The approval is based on positive results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study, showing a 59% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to standard therapies. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The FDA's approval of CARVYKTI® for use after just one prior line of therapy marks a significant advancement in the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma. This is particularly noteworthy given the disease's historically limited options post-relapse. The 59 percent reduction in disease progression or death, as demonstrated in the CARTITUDE-4 study, is a substantial improvement over standard therapies. It is important to recognize the potential for a treatment-free period this offers to patients, which could enhance their quality of life significantly.However, the safety profile of CARVYKTI® warrants attention, especially the boxed warning for severe conditions such as Cytokine Release Syndrome and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome. While these risks are a known factor in many advanced therapies, it is important for healthcare providers to weigh these risks against the potential benefits when considering this treatment for their patients. Healthcare Economist The approval of CARVYKTI® has implications for the healthcare system's resource allocation. Considering that only an estimated 15 percent of multiple myeloma patients progress to a 5th line of therapy, the earlier intervention with CARVYKTI® could potentially reduce the long-term treatment costs by decreasing the frequency of relapses and extending the treatment-free intervals for patients.On the other hand, CARVYKTI® is a sophisticated cell therapy, which suggests a high initial treatment cost. This raises questions about the economic burden on the healthcare system and insurance providers. The balance between the upfront costs and potential savings from reduced disease progression needs to be carefully assessed. Market Research Analyst Johnson & Johnson's announcement can be expected to have a positive influence on their market positioning, particularly within the oncology sector. The doubling of manufacturing capacity for CARVYKTI® in 2023, with plans to double again in 2024, indicates a strong supply chain strategy that aligns with the anticipated demand following this approval. Such scalability is essential in the biotech industry, especially for treatments that require specialized manufacturing processes.Investors should note that the company's commitment to improving outcomes in multiple myeloma treatment could foster investor confidence. However, it is essential to monitor the post-market performance of CARVYKTI® regarding both efficacy in a broader patient population and the management of its associated severe adverse effects. 04/05/2024 - 11:21 PM Expanded indication for this one-time infusion will provide more patients with a potential period away from their multiple myeloma treatment as early as first relapse Approval is based on results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study, in which treatment with CARVYKTI® in 1-3 prior lines of therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 59 percent compared to standard therapies HORSHAM, Pa., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved CARVYKTI® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel; cilta-cel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and are refractory to lenalidomide.1 With this approval, CARVYKTI® becomes the first and only B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted therapy approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma as early as first relapse. FDA approval is based on positive results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study, which demonstrated that the earlier use of CARVYKTI® reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 59 percent compared to standard therapies—pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd)—in adults with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy.1 The study, which was presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine, also included and reported key secondary results such as overall response (OR) and overall survival (OS).1 ""CARVYKTI demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a personalized, one-time infusion in the earlier treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as shown through the CARTITUDE-4 study results,"" said Binod Dhakal, M.D., Associate Professor, Medical College of Wisconsin, Division of Hematology and Oncology.* ""With this approval, I'm excited for patients who may have the opportunity for a treatment-free period for their multiple myeloma as early as first relapse, with the hope of eliminating the burden of having to be on continuous treatment while living with this challenging disease."" More than 35,000 estimated new cases of multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer, will be diagnosed in 2024 in the United States.2 Real-world studies show that only an estimated 15 percent of patients initially diagnosed with multiple myeloma are able to start a 5th line of therapy.3 With this new indication, more patients will be able to access this innovative treatment. ""This milestone underscores our commitment to improve outcomes for patients and transform the treatment of multiple myeloma with CARVYKTI,"" said Jordan Schecter, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Multiple Myeloma, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""We are proud to bring an important, highly effective immunotherapy that has demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile to physicians and patients for the earlier treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and we look forward to building on this latest milestone as we continue to focus on our ultimate goal of delivering a cure for multiple myeloma."" CARVYKTI® is a cell therapy that works by harnessing a patient's immune system, or T cells, to fight the disease. Treatment requires extensive training, preparation, and certification to ensure a positive experience for patients. Since initial approval in February 2022, Johnson & Johnson has made significant advances in manufacturing to rapidly scale CARVYKTI® production. ""We understand the urgency for patients in need of CARVYKTI, and we have been making considerable progress in increasing supply and availability in anticipation of this milestone approval,"" said Tyrone Brewer, President, U.S. Hematology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""We more than doubled manufacturing of CARVYKTI in 2023, we are striving to double again in 2024, and we will continue to invest in our capacity so we can provide this critical therapy to as many patients as possible."" The safety profile for CARVYKTI® includes a boxed warning for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barre syndrome and their associated complications, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS), Prolonged and Recurrent Cytopenias and Secondary Malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell malignancies.1 Warnings and Precautions include Increased Early Mortality, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, Hypersensitivity Reactions and Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines.1 The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20 percent) are pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infections-pathogen unspecified, cough, chills, diarrhea, nausea, encephalopathy, decreased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea, edema, viral infections, coagulopathy, constipation, and vomiting.1The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 50 percent) include lymphopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreased, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.1 About CARTITUDE-4 CARTITUDE-4 (NCT04181827) is the first international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy.4 Results were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. About CARVYKTI® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel; cilta-cel)CARVYKTI® (cilta-cel) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in February 2022 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.1 CARVYKTI® is now approved in the U.S. for the second-line treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide. In addition to a unanimous (11 to 0) FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommendation in support of this new indication, in March 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the approval of a Type II variation for CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor, have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, and are refractory to lenalidomide. In September 2022, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in patients that have no history of CAR-positive T cell infusion therapy targeting BCMA and who have received three or more lines of therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and in whom multiple myeloma has not responded to or has relapsed following the most recent therapy. CARVYKTI® is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, which involves reprogramming a patient's own T-cells with a transgene encoding chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that directs the CAR positive T cells to eliminate cells that express BCMA. BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. The CARVYKTI® CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domains designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells. In December 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech USA, Inc. to develop and commercialize CARVYKTI®.

T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologicmalignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cellimmunotherapies, including CARVYKTI®. CARVYKTI® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluationand Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTI® REMS Program. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased early mortality - In CARTITUDE-4, a (1:1) randomized controlled trial, there was a numerically higher percentage of early deaths in patients randomized to the CARVYKTI® treatment arm compared to the control arm. Among patients with deaths occurring within the first 10 months from randomization, a greater proportion (29/208; 14%) occurred in the CARVYKTI® arm compared to (25/211; 12%) in the control arm. Of the 29 deaths that occurred in the CARVYKTI® arm within the first 10 months of randomization, 10 deaths occurred prior to CARVYKTI® infusion, and 19 deaths occurred after CARVYKTI® infusion. Of the 10 deaths that occurred prior to CARVYKTI® infusion, all occurred due to disease progression, and none occurred due to adverse events. Of the 19 deaths that occurred after CARVYKTI® infusion, 3 occurred due to disease progression, and 16 occurred due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were due to infection (n=12). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® for RRMM in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies (N=285), CRS occurred in 84% (238/285), including ≥Grade 3 CRS (ASCT 2019) in 4% (11/285) of patients. Median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 7 days (range: 1 to 23 days). CRS resolved in 82% with a median duration of 4 days (range: 1 to 97 days). The most common manifestations of CRS in all patients combined (≥10%) included fever (84%), hypotension (29%) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (11%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include pyrexia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak syndrome, and supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. CRS occurred in 78% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (3% Grade 3 to 4) and in 95% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4). Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of CARVYKTI®. Of the 285 patients who received CARVYKTI® in clinical trials, 53% (150/285) patients received tocilizumab; 35% (100/285) received a single dose, while 18% (50/285) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 14% (39/285) of patients received at least one dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI® infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, immediately institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Neurologic toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Neurologic toxicities included ICANS, neurologic toxicity with signs and symptoms of parkinsonism, GBS, immune mediated myelitis, peripheral neuropathies, and cranial nerve palsies. Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of these neurologic toxicities, and on the delayed nature of onset of some of these toxicities. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention for further assessment and management if signs or symptoms of any of these neurologic toxicities occur at any time. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies for RRMM, one or more neurologic toxicities occurred in 24% (69/285), including ≥Grade 3 cases in 7% (19/285) of patients. Median time to onset was 10 days (range: 1 to 101) with 63/69 (91%) of cases developing by 30 days. Neurologic toxicities resolved in 72% (50/69) of patients with a median duration to resolution of 23 days (range: 1 to 544). Of patients developing neurotoxicity, 96% (66/69) also developed CRS. Subtypes of neurologic toxicities included ICANS in 13%, peripheral neuropathy in 7%, cranial nerve palsy in 7%, parkinsonism in 3%, and immune mediated myelitis in 0.4% of the patients. Immune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS): Patients receiving CARVYKTI® may experience fatal or life-threatening ICANS following treatment with CARVYKTI®, including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, ICANS occurred in 13% (36/285), including Grade ≥3 in 2% (6/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of ICANS was 8 days (range: 1 to 28 days). ICANS resolved in 30 of 36 (83%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 3 days (range: 1 to 143 days). Median duration of ICANS was 6 days (range: 1 to 1229 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. Of patients with ICANS 97% (35/36) had CRS. The onset of ICANS occurred during CRS in 69% of patients, before and after the onset of CRS in 14% of patients respectively. Immune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3) and in 23% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (3% Grade 3). The most frequent ≥2% manifestations of ICANS included encephalopathy (12%), aphasia (4%), headache (3%), motor dysfunction (3%), ataxia (2%) and sleep disorder (2%). Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI® infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of ICANS. Rule out other causes of ICANS symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ICANS for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Parkinsonism: Neurologic toxicity with parkinsonism has been reported in clinical trials of CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, parkinsonism occurred in 3% (8/285), including Grade ≥ 3 in 2% (5/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of parkinsonism was 56 days (range: 14 to 914 days). Parkinsonism resolved in 1 of 8 (13%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 523 days. Median duration of parkinsonism was 243.5 days (range: 62 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. The onset of parkinsonism occurred after CRS for all patients and after ICANS for 6 patients. Parkinsonism occurred in 1% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (no Grade 3 to 4) and in 6% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4). Manifestations of parkinsonism included movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and personality changes. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of parkinsonism that may be delayed in onset and managed with supportive care measures. There is limited efficacy information with medications used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease for the improvement or resolution of parkinsonism symptoms following CARVYKTI® treatment. Guillain-Barré syndrome: A fatal outcome following GBS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI® despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. Symptoms reported include those consistent with Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, encephalopathy, motor weakness, speech disturbances, and polyradiculoneuritis. Monitor for GBS. Evaluate patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy for GBS. Consider treatment of GBS with supportive care measures and in conjunction with immunoglobulins and plasma exchange, depending on severity of GBS. Immune mediated myelitis: Grade 3 myelitis occurred 25 days following treatment with CARVYKTI® in CARTITUDE-4 in a patient who received CARVYKTI® as subsequent therapy. Symptoms reported included hypoesthesia of the lower extremities and the lower abdomen with impaired sphincter control. Symptoms improved with the use of corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. Myelitis was ongoing at the time of death from other cause. Peripheral neuropathy occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7% (21/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (3/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 57 days (range: 1 to 914 days). Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 11 of 21 (52%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 58 days (range: 1 to 215 days). Median duration of peripheral neuropathy was 149.5 days (range: 1 to 692 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. Peripheral neuropathies occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3 to 4) and in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (2% Grade 3 to 4). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. Patients who experience peripheral neuropathy may also experience cranial nerve palsies or GBS. Cranial nerve palsies occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, cranial nerve palsies occurred in 7% (19/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (1/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of cranial nerve palsies was 21 days (range: 17 to 101 days). Cranial nerve palsies resolved in 17 of 19 (89%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 66 days (range: 1 to 209 days). Median duration of cranial nerve palsies was 70 days (range: 1 to 262 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. Cranial nerve palsies occurred in 9% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (1% Grade 3 to 4) and in 3% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (1% Grade 3 to 4). The most frequent cranial nerve affected was the 7th cranial nerve. Additionally, cranial nerves III, V, and VI have been reported to be affected. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cranial nerve palsies. Consider management with systemic corticosteroids, depending on the severity and progression of signs and symptoms. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 1% (3/285) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 99 days of receiving CARVYKTI®, with a median onset of 10 days (range: 8 to 99 days) and all occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. The manifestations of HLH/MAS included hyperferritinemia, hypotension, hypoxia with diffuse alveolar damage, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, cytopenia and multi-organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction and respiratory failure. Patients who develop HLH/MAS have an increased risk of severe bleeding. Monitor hematologic parameters in patients with HLH/MAS and transfuse per institutional guidelines. Fatal cases of HLH/MAS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. HLH is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards. CARVYKTI® REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, CARVYKTI® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTI® REMS. Further information is available at https://www.carvyktirems.com/ or 1-844-672-0067. Prolonged and Recurrent Cytopenias: Patients may exhibit prolonged and recurrent cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CARVYKTI® infusion. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by day 30 following CARVYKTI® infusion occurred in 62% (176/285) of the patients and included thrombocytopenia 33% (94/285), neutropenia 27% (76/285), lymphopenia 24% (67/285) and anemia 2% (6/285). After Day 60 following CARVYKTI® infusion 22%, 20%, 5%, and 6% of patients had a recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia respectively, after initial recovery of their Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Seventy-seven percent (219/285) of patients had one, two or three or more recurrences of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias after initial recovery of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Sixteen and 25 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, at the time of death. Monitor blood counts prior to and after CARVYKTI® infusion. Manage cytopenias with growth factors and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines. Infections: CARVYKTI® should not be administered to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections, occurred in patients after CARVYKTI® infusion. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, infections occurred in 57% (163/285), including ≥Grade 3 in 24% (69/285) of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 6%, bacterial infections in 5%, and fungal infections in 1% of patients. Overall, 5% (13/285) of patients had Grade 5 infections, 2.5% of which were due to COVID-19. Patients treated with CARVYKTI® had an increased rate of fatal COVID-19 infections compared to the standard therapy arm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after CARVYKTI® infusion and treat patients appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to the standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 5% of patients after CARVYKTI® infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, as medically indicated. Counsel patients on the importance of prevention measures. Follow institutional guidelines for the vaccination and management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. Viral Reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Perform screening for Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any other infectious agents if clinically indicated in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice. Hypogammaglobulinemia: can occur in patients receiving treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia adverse event was reported in 36% (102/285) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500mg/dl after infusion in 93% (265/285) of patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500mg/dl, after infusion occurred in 94% (267/285) of patients treated. Fifty six percent (161/285) of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post CARVYKTI® for either an adverse reaction or prophylaxis. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with CARVYKTI® and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dL. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. Use of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following CARVYKTI® treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during CARVYKTI® treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Hypersensitivity Reactions occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 5% (13/285), all of which were ≤Grade 2. Manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions included flushing, chest discomfort, tachycardia, wheezing, tremor, burning sensation, non-cardiac chest pain, and pyrexia. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in CARVYKTI®. Patients should be carefully monitored for 2 hours after infusion for signs and symptoms of severe reaction. Treat promptly and manage patients appropriately according to the severity of the hypersensitivity reaction. Secondary Malignancies: Patients treated with CARVYKTI® may develop secondary malignancies. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, myeloid neoplasms occurred in 5% (13/285) of patients (9 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 case of myelodysplastic syndrome followed by acute myeloid leukemia). The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasms was 447 days (range: 56 to 870 days) after treatment with CARVYKTI®. Ten of these 13 patients died following the development of myeloid neoplasms; 2 of the 13 cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia have also been reported in the post marketing setting. T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies, including CARVYKTI®.

The therapy targets B-cell Maturation Antigen, providing hope for patients and physicians. Positive None. Negative Increased early mortality observed in patients receiving CARVYKTI® compared to control arm in clinical trials. Potential severe adverse reactions including Cytokine Release Syndrome, Neurologic Toxicities, and Secondary Hematological Malignancies. Warnings and Precautions for Infections, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Hypersensitivity Reactions, and Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines associated with CARVYKTI® treatment. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval of CARVYKTI® for use in earlier lines of treatment for multiple myeloma marks a significant advancement in the therapeutic landscape of hematologic malignancies. This approval is predicated on the CARTITUDE-4 study, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival for patients who are relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory. The approval for second-line treatment use is notable because it allows for earlier intervention with a personalized immunotherapy approach, potentially altering the standard of care and improving patient outcomes.From a research perspective, the implications of this approval are multifaceted. It not only broadens the treatment arsenal against multiple myeloma but also underscores the importance of targeted therapies in oncology. The specificity of B-cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) targeting by CAR-T therapies, such as CARVYKTI®, is reflective of the ongoing shift towards precision medicine. However, the safety profile warrants careful consideration, as the treatment comes with a boxed warning for severe side effects, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), among others. Healthcare Economist The expanded FDA approval of CARVYKTI® has potential economic implications for the healthcare system, particularly in the management of multiple myeloma. The earlier use of CAR-T therapy could result in a shift in treatment costs. While the upfront expenses for CAR-T therapies are considerable, the potential for a treatment-free respite may reduce the long-term costs associated with chronic treatments and hospitalizations due to disease progression or relapse. However, the economic benefit hinges on the long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of CARVYKTI® in real-world settings.The manufacturing and supply chain aspects are also critical, as the company has indicated efforts to expand production capacity to meet the anticipated increase in demand. This expansion must be efficient to avoid supply shortages that could delay treatment for patients. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of CARVYKTI® in comparison to existing therapies will be a determinant in its adoption and coverage by insurance providers, impacting market dynamics and potentially influencing stock market performance for Legend Biotech. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The approval of CARVYKTI® for second-line treatment presents a strategic business development for Legend Biotech. The company is poised to capture a larger market share in the multiple myeloma treatment space, especially since it is the first BCMA-targeted therapy approved for use after only one prior line of therapy. This early intervention could lead to improved patient adherence and outcomes, fostering brand loyalty and establishing Legend Biotech as a pioneer in cell therapy for blood cancers.Investors should monitor the post-approval performance of CARVYKTI® closely, as its market penetration will be influenced by physician prescribing habits, patient access programs and the competitive landscape. The therapy's safety profile and the management of its severe side effects will be a important factor in its adoption. Additionally, the company's ability to scale up manufacturing to meet demand without compromising quality will be essential for sustaining growth and investor confidence. 04/05/2024 - 11:30 PM New indication for this one-time infusion may provide patients with a treatment-free respite as early as first relapse SOMERSET, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ: LEGN) (Legend Biotech), a global leader in cell therapy, announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved CARVYKTI® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel; cilta-cel) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and are refractory to lenalidomide.1 CARVYKTI® is the first and only B-cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) targeted therapy, including CAR-T therapies, bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), approved starting in the second-line of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. “The expanded label of CARVYKTI has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma by providing patients and physicians with a personalized immunotherapy that can be used earlier in the treatment regimen. Multiple myeloma is an incurable and progressive hematologic cancer that causes patients to relapse and become refractory to treatment, so new, innovative options are desperately needed,” said Ying Huang, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Legend Biotech. “We are committed to improving the lives of patients battling blood cancer and will continue to work towards developing cellular therapies that bring us closer to a cure.” The FDA approval is based on positive results from the CARTITUDE-4 study, which demonstrated that CARVYKTI® resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of progression-free survival compared to two standard of care treatment regimens, pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd), in adults with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy.1 This approval follows a unanimous (11 to 0) recommendation from the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) in support of CARVYKTI® in earlier lines of treatment. “The results of the CARTITUDE-4 study demonstrated the substantial clinical benefit of cilta-cel infusion over standard of care continuous therapy in patients who experience a relapse after one to three prior treatments,” said Surbhi Sidana, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy at Stanford University School of Medicine.† “This expanded FDA approval for cilta-cel will allow a wider patient population to access this novel therapy earlier in the course of their treatment.” “This expanded FDA approval validates the growing need for CARVYKTI and means more patients will have access to our life-altering, individualized therapy,” said Birk Vanderweeën, Senior Vice President, Global Manufacturing and Supply. “To ensure we can meet increased demand for our customized therapy, our global manufacturing teams and partners have expanded production capacity and are laser-focused on further scaling out operations to ensure patients who need CARVYKTI have access to it.” The safety profile for CARVYKTI® includes a boxed warning for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barre syndrome, and their associated complications, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS), Prolonged and Recurrent Cytopenias and Secondary Malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and T-cell malignancies.1 Warnings and Precautions include Increased Early Mortality, Infections, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Hypersensitivity Reactions, and Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines.1 The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20%) are pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infections-pathogen unspecified, cough, chills, diarrhea, nausea, encephalopathy, decreased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea, edema, viral infections, coagulopathy, constipation, and vomiting.1 The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) include lymphopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreased, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.1 CARVYKTI® IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, PROLONGED and RECURRENT CYTOPENIA, and SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Do not administer CARVYKTI® to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), which may be fatal or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®, including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with CARVYKTI®. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and their associated complications resulting in fatal or life-threatening reactions have occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS), including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with CARVYKTI®. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities Prolonged and/or recurrent cytopenias with bleeding and infection and requirement for stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Secondary hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, have occurred in patients following treatment with CARVYKTI®. T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies, including CARVYKTI®. CARVYKTI® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTI® REMS Program. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS INCREASED EARLY MORTALITY - In CARTITUDE-4, a (1:1) randomized controlled trial, there was a numerically higher percentage of early deaths in patients randomized to the CARVYKTI® treatment arm compared to the control arm. Among patients with deaths occurring within the first 10 months from randomization, a greater proportion (29/208; 14%) occurred in the CARVYKTI® arm compared to (25/211; 12%) in the control arm. Of the 29 deaths that occurred in the CARVYKTI® arm within the first 10 months of randomization, 10 deaths occurred prior to CARVYKTI® infusion, and 19 deaths occurred after CARVYKTI® infusion. Of the 10 deaths that occurred prior to CARVYKTI® infusion, all occurred due to disease progression, and none occurred due to adverse events. Of the 19 deaths that occurred after CARVYKTI® infusion, 3 occurred due to disease progression, and 16 occurred due to adverse events. The most common adverse events were due to infection (n=12). CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® for RRMM in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies (N=285), CRS occurred in 84% (238/285), including ≥ Grade 3 CRS (ASCT 2019) in 4% (11/285) of patients. Median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 7 days (range: 1 to 23 days). CRS resolved in 82% with a median duration of 4 days (range: 1 to 97 days). The most common manifestations of CRS in all patients combined (≥ 10%) included fever (84%), hypotension (29%) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (11%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include pyrexia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak syndrome, and supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. CRS occurred in 78% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (3% Grade 3 to 4) and in 95% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4). Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Please see Section 5.4; Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of CARVYKTI®. Of the 285 patients who received CARVYKTI® in clinical trials, 53% (150/285) patients received tocilizumab; 35% (100/285) received a single dose, while 18% (50/285) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 14% (39/285) of patients received at least one dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI® infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, immediately institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Neurologic toxicities included ICANS, neurologic toxicity with signs and symptoms of parkinsonism, GBS, immune mediated myelitis, peripheral neuropathies, and cranial nerve palsies. Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of these neurologic toxicities, and on the delayed nature of onset of some of these toxicities. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention for further assessment and management if signs or symptoms of any of these neurologic toxicities occur at any time. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies for RRMM, one or more neurologic toxicities occurred in 24% (69/285), including ≥ Grade 3 cases in 7% (19/285) of patients. Median time to onset was 10 days (range: 1 to 101) with 63/69 (91%) of cases developing by 30 days. Neurologic toxicities resolved in 72% (50/69) of patients with a median duration to resolution of 23 days (range: 1 to 544). Of patients developing neurotoxicity, 96% (66/69) also developed CRS. Subtypes of neurologic toxicities included ICANS in 13%, peripheral neuropathy in 7%, cranial nerve palsy in 7%, parkinsonism in 3%, and immune mediated myelitis in 0.4% of the patients. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS): Patients receiving CARVYKTI® may experience fatal or life-threatening ICANS following treatment with CARVYKTI®, including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, ICANS occurred in 13% (36/285), including Grade ≥3 in 2% (6/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of ICANS was 8 days (range: 1 to 28 days). ICANS resolved in 30 of 36 (83%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 3 days (range: 1 to 143 days). Median duration of ICANS was 6 days (range: 1 to 1229 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. Of patients with ICANS, 97% (35/36) had CRS. The onset of ICANS occurred during CRS in 69% of patients, before and after the onset of CRS in 14% of patients respectively. Immune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3) and in 23% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (3% Grade 3). The most frequent ≥2% manifestations of ICANS included encephalopathy (12%), aphasia (4%), headache (3%), motor dysfunction (3%), ataxia (2%), and sleep disorder (2%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTI® infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of ICANS. Rule out other causes of ICANS symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ICANS for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Parkinsonism: Neurologic toxicity with parkinsonism has been reported in clinical trials of CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, parkinsonism occurred in 3% (8/285), including Grade ≥ 3 in 2% (5/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of parkinsonism was 56 days (range: 14 to 914 days). Parkinsonism resolved in 1 of 8 (13%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 523 days. Median duration of parkinsonism was 243.5 days (range: 62 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. The onset of parkinsonism occurred after CRS for all patients and after ICANS for 6 patients. Parkinsonism occurred in 1% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (no Grade 3 to 4) and in 6% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (4% Grade 3 to 4). Manifestations of parkinsonism included movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and personality changes. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of parkinsonism that may be delayed in onset and managed with supportive care measures. There is limited efficacy information with medications used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease for the improvement or resolution of parkinsonism symptoms following CARVYKTI® treatment. Guillain-Barré Syndrome: A fatal outcome following GBS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI® despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. Symptoms reported include those consistent with Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, encephalopathy, motor weakness, speech disturbances, and polyradiculoneuritis. Monitor for GBS. Evaluate patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy for GBS. Consider treatment of GBS with supportive care measures and in conjunction with immunoglobulins and plasma exchange, depending on severity of GBS. Immune Mediated Myelitis: Grade 3 myelitis occurred 25 days following treatment with CARVYKTI® in CARTITUDE-4 in a patient who received CARVYKTI® as subsequent therapy. Symptoms reported included hypoesthesia of the lower extremities and the lower abdomen with impaired sphincter control. Symptoms improved with the use of corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. Myelitis was ongoing at the time of death from other cause. Peripheral Neuropathy occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7% (21/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (3/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 57 days (range: 1 to 914 days). Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 11 of 21 (52%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 58 days (range: 1 to 215 days). Median duration of peripheral neuropathy was 149.5 days (range: 1 to 692 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. Peripheral neuropathies occurred in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (0.5% Grade 3 to 4) and in 7% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (2% Grade 3 to 4). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. Patients who experience peripheral neuropathy may also experience cranial nerve palsies or GBS. Cranial Nerve Palsies occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, cranial nerve palsies occurred in 7% (19/285), including Grade ≥3 in 1% (1/285) of the patients. Median time to onset of cranial nerve palsies was 21 days (range: 17 to 101 days). Cranial nerve palsies resolved in 17 of 19 (89%) of patients with a median time to resolution of 66 days (range: 1 to 209 days). Median duration of cranial nerve palsies was 70 days (range: 1 to 262 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut-off. Cranial nerve palsies occurred in 9% of patients in CARTITUDE-4 (1% Grade 3 to 4) and in 3% of patients in CARTITUDE-1 (1% Grade 3 to 4). The most frequent cranial nerve affected was the 7th cranial nerve. Additionally, cranial nerves III, V, and VI have been reported to be affected. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cranial nerve palsies. Consider management with systemic corticosteroids, depending on the severity and progression of signs and symptoms. HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH)/MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION SYNDROME (MAS): Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 1% (3/285) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 99 days of receiving CARVYKTI®, with a median onset of 10 days (range: 8 to 99 days) and all occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. The manifestations of HLH/MAS included hyperferritinemia, hypotension, hypoxia with diffuse alveolar damage, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, cytopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction and respiratory failure. Patients who develop HLH/MAS have an increased risk of severe bleeding. Monitor hematologic parameters in patients with HLH/MAS and transfuse per institutional guidelines. Fatal cases of HLH/MAS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. HLH is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards. CARVYKTI® REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, CARVYKTI® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTI® REMS. Further information is available at https://www.carvyktirems.com or 1-844-672-0067. PROLONGED AND RECURRENT CYTOPENIAS: Patients may exhibit prolonged and recurrent cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CARVYKTI® infusion. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias not resolved by day 30 following CARVYKTI® infusion occurred in 62% (176/285) of the patients and included thrombocytopenia 33% (94/285), neutropenia 27% (76/285), lymphopenia 24% (67/285) and anemia 2% (6/285). After Day 60 following CARVYKTI® infusion 22%, 20%, 5%, and 6% of patients had a recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia respectively, after initial recovery of their Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Seventy-seven percent (219/285) of patients had one, two, or three or more recurrences of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias after initial recovery of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Sixteen and 25 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, at the time of death. Monitor blood counts prior to and after CARVYKTI® infusion. Manage cytopenias with growth factors and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines. INFECTIONS: CARVYKTI® should not be administered to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections, occurred in patients after CARVYKTI® infusion. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, infections occurred in 57% (163/285), including ≥Grade 3 in 24% (69/285) of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 6%, bacterial infections in 5%, and fungal infections in 1% of patients. Overall, 5% (13/285) of patients had Grade 5 infections, 2.5% of which were due to COVID-19. Patients treated with CARVYKTI® had an increased rate of fatal COVID-19 infections compared to the standard therapy arm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after CARVYKTI® infusion and treat patients appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to the standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 5% of patients after CARVYKTI® infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care, as medically indicated. Counsel patients on the importance of prevention measures. Follow institutional guidelines for the vaccination and management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. Viral Reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Perform screening for Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or any other infectious agents if clinically indicated in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice. HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA: can occur in patients receiving treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia adverse event was reported in 36% (102/285) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500mg/dl after infusion in 93% (265/285) of patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500mg/dl, after infusion occurred in 94% (267/285) of patients treated. Fifty-six percent (161/285) of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post CARVYKTI® for either an adverse reaction or prophylaxis. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with CARVYKTI® and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dL. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. Use of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following CARVYKTI® treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during CARVYKTI® treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with CARVYKTI®. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS occurred following treatment with CARVYKTI®. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 5% (13/285), all of which were ≤ Grade 2. Manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions included flushing, chest discomfort, tachycardia, wheezing, tremor, burning sensation, non-cardiac chest pain, and pyrexia. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in CARVYKTI®. Patients should be carefully monitored for 2 hours after infusion for signs and symptoms of severe reaction. Treat promptly and manage patients appropriately according to the severity of the hypersensitivity reaction. SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES: Patients treated with CARVYKTI® may develop secondary malignancies. Among patients receiving CARVYKTI® in the CARTITUDE-1 & 4 studies, myeloid neoplasms occurred in 5% (13/285) of patients (9 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 case of myelodysplastic syndrome followed by acute myeloid leukemia). The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasms was 447 days (range: 56 to 870 days) after treatment with CARVYKTI®. Ten of these 13 patients died following the development of myeloid neoplasms; 2 of the 13 cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia have also been reported in the post-marketing setting. T-cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies, including CARVYKTI®. Mature T-cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusions and may include fatal outcomes. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-526-7736 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples. EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status, seizures, neurocognitive decline, or neuropathy, patients receiving CARVYKTI® are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following CARVYKTI® infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period, and in the event of new onset of any neurologic toxicities. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20%) are pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infections-pathogen unspecified, cough, chills, diarrhea, nausea, encephalopathy, decreased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea, edema, viral infections, coagulopathy, constipation, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) include lymphopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell decreased, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

ABOUT CARVYKTI® (CILTACABTAGENE AUTOLEUCEL; CILTA-CEL) Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, which involves reprogramming a patient’s own T-cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that identifies and eliminates cells that express BCMA. The cilta-cel CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells.1 In December 2017, Legend Biotech entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop and commercialize cilta-cel. In February 2022, cilta-cel was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the brand name CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In May 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted conditional marketing authorization of CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In September 2022, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved CARVYKTI®. Cilta-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. in December 2019 and in China in August 2020. In addition, cilta-cel received a PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Commission in April 2019. Cilta-cel also received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA in February 2019, from the European Commission in February 2020, and from the Pharmaceuticals and Medicinal Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan in June 2020. In March 2022, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recommended by consensus that the orphan designation for cilta-cel be maintained on the basis of clinical data demonstrating improved and sustained complete response rates following treatment. ABOUT CARTITUDE-4 CARTITUDE-4 (NCT04181827) is an ongoing, international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd) in adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival.2 ABOUT MULTIPLE MYELOMA Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.3 In 2024, it is estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and more than 12,000 people will die from the disease in the U.S.4 While some patients with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.5 ABOUT LEGEND BIOTECH Legend Biotech is a global biotechnology company dedicated to treating, and one day curing, life-threatening diseases.

The approval is based on positive response rates and duration of response in Phase II trials, leading to inclusion in NCCN Guidelines®. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The recent FDA approval of AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo's ENHERTU for a broad range of HER2-positive metastatic cancers represents a significant advancement in precision medicine. The approval, based on Phase II trials, showcases the drug's ability to deliver targeted therapy across various tumor types, a promising development for patients with limited treatment options.From an oncology research perspective, the tumor-agnostic nature of ENHERTU is notable. By focusing on the HER2 biomarker rather than the tumor's location, this therapy exemplifies a shift towards more personalized treatment approaches in oncology. This could lead to increased demand for biomarker testing, potentially expanding the market for diagnostic companies specializing in cancer genomics.The long-term impact on AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo could be substantial if ENHERTU's efficacy is confirmed in further trials, potentially leading to full approval and wider usage. However, it's essential to monitor post-approval studies to ensure the drug's benefits outweigh risks, such as the reported cases of interstitial lung disease. Healthcare Market Analyst ENHERTU's approval under the FDA's accelerated program indicates a high unmet need for treatments in this patient population. It's important to consider the drug's market potential, which hinges on its continued performance in confirmatory trials. The competitive landscape for HER2-targeting therapies is also a factor, with established treatments like trastuzumab and pertuzumab already in use.From a market perspective, the approval could lead to increased revenue streams for AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, especially considering the drug's inclusion in the NCCN Guidelines. The impact on the stock market for these companies might be positive in the short term, reflecting investor optimism about the drug's potential. Long-term effects will depend on sustained clinical success and market penetration.Moreover, the regulatory review of ENHERTU in other countries as part of Project Orbis could facilitate global market expansion, further bolstering the business outlook for the companies involved. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Specialist The FDA's use of the Real-Time Oncology Review program and Project Orbis for ENHERTU's approval process exemplifies the agency's commitment to expediting access to potentially life-saving treatments. This regulatory pathway can significantly reduce the time it takes for a drug to reach the market, benefiting patients and pharmaceutical companies alike.However, the accelerated approval is contingent upon the verification of clinical benefits in confirmatory trials. This requirement introduces an element of risk for the investing community, as any negative outcomes from these trials could impact the drug's marketability and, consequently, the companies' financial performance.It is also worth noting that the safety profile of ENHERTU will be closely monitored, particularly regarding interstitial lung disease. Any emerging safety concerns could lead to regulatory actions, such as additional warnings or usage restrictions, potentially affecting the drug's commercial success. 04/05/2024 - 09:43 PM Based on three Phase II trials of AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s ENHERTU which showed clinically meaningful responses across a broad range of tumors ENHERTU now has five approved indications with the latest in HER2-expressing (IHC 3+) metastatic cancers WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo's ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) has been approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo. The first tumor-agnostic approval of a HER2-directed therapy and ADC by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on results from the subgroup of patients with HER2-positive IHC 3+ tumors in each of the DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-CRC02 Phase II trials. Funda Meric-Bernstam, MD, Chair of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, US, said: “Until the approval of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, patients with metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors have had limited treatment options. Based on the clinically meaningful response rates seen across clinical trials, this tumor-agnostic approval means that patients may now be treated with a HER2-directed medicine.” Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: “As the first antibody drug conjugate to be granted a tumor-agnostic indication, ENHERTU is truly delivering on its potential across metastatic HER2-targetable tumors. The approval also elevates the importance of testing for biomarkers, including HER2, across a broad range of tumors to ensure these patients with advanced cancer who have few options know whether a targeted medicine might be right for them.” Ken Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., said: “This fifth indication in the US is a significant milestone as eligible patients with previously treated metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors may now be treated with ENHERTU. The accelerated approval by the FDA for this tumor-agnostic indication is based on the clinically meaningful efficacy seen with ENHERTU across numerous types of metastatic cancers.” In the DESTINY-PanTumor02 Phase II trial, patients with centrally or locally assessed HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors including either biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic or other tumors treated with ENHERTU showed a confirmed ORR of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.7-61.0) and a median DoR range of 19.4 months (range: 1.3-27.9+ [+ denotes ongoing responses at data cutoff]). In DESTINY-Lung01, patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive (IHC 3+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ENHERTU showed a confirmed ORR of 52.9% (95% CI: 27.8-77.0) and median DoR range of 6.9 months (range: 4.0-11.7+). A confirmed ORR of 46.9% (95% CI: 34.3-59.8) and median DoR range of 5.5 months (range: 1.3+-9.7+) was seen in patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive (IHC 3+) colorectal cancer in the DESTINY-CRC02 trial. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 347 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors in the DESTINY-Breast01, DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-CRC02 trials. The safety profile observed across the trials was consistent with previous clinical trials of ENHERTU with no new safety concerns identified. Based on these results, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (ENHERTU) has been included in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as a treatment option for multiple metastatic tumors. See NCCN Guidelines® for detailed recommendations.1 This approval was granted under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review program after securing Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ENHERTU in the US in this setting. The US regulatory submission was reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. As part of Project Orbis, ENHERTU is also under regulatory review for the same indication by regulatory authorities in Australia, Brazil and Singapore. Important Safety Information Indications ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: Unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen either: – In the metastatic setting, or – In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy Unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy Unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen Unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception. Contraindications None. Warnings and Precautions Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21). Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Additional Dose Modifications Thrombocytopenia For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.

Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) as compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2-mutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years.

HER2 expression in solid tumors HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells throughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.2,3 In some cancers, HER2 expression is amplified or the cells have activating mutations.2,4 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.5 HER2-directed therapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers for a number of years.3,6,7 Although HER2 is expressed in solid tumor types including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a result, available literature is limited.4 In these solid tumors, HER2-positive expression, classified as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, has been observed at rates from 1% to 28%.8,9 Approximately 1% to 5% of patients with NSCLC have tumors with HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+), however, the levels of protein expression reported vary in the literature.8,10 Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have tumors which are HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+).8,11,12 DESTINY-PanTumor02 DESTINY-PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2-expressing tumors, including biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer or other tumors. The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-PanTumor02 is confirmed ORR as assessed by investigator. Secondary endpoints include DoR, disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. DESTINY-PanTumor02 has enrolled 267 patients, including 111 HER2-positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America, and is to be expanded to recruit more patients with metastatic HER2-postive IHC 1+, IHC 2+ and IHC 3+ tumors. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. DESTINY-Lung01 DESTINY-Lung01 is a global Phase II, open-label, two-cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4mg/kg or 6.4mg/kg) in patients with HER2-mutant (cohort 2, n=91) or HER2-overexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) [cohort 1 and 1a, n=90]) unresectable or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who had progressed after one or more systemic therapies. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY-Lung01 enrolled 181 patients, including 17 HER2-postive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple sites, including Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. DESTINY-CRC02 DESTINY-CRC02 is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses (5.4mg/kg or 6.4mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive colorectal cancer of BRAF wild-type, RAS wild-type or RAS mutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4mg/kg or 6.4mg/kg of ENHERTU. In the second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4mg/kg arm. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, investigator-assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY-CRC02 enrolled 122 patients, including 64 HER2-positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. DESTINY-Breast01 DESTINY-Breast01 is a global, single-arm, open-label, two-part multicenter Phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in patients with HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include DoR, DCR, clinical benefit rate, PFS and OS. DESTINY-Breast01 enrolled 253 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed ADC.

(AC) reports a preliminary first-quarter book value range of $42.67 to $42.87 per share, showing growth from previous quarters. Further financial details will be released in May. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The preliminary book value range for Associated Capital Group indicates a sequential increase from the previous quarter and year-over-year. This increase suggests a strengthening of the company's underlying assets or a possible appreciation in investment portfolio values. Investors often look at book value as a metric to assess whether a stock is under or overvalued relative to its net asset value. A rising book value can be a positive signal, implying that the company is growing its intrinsic value.However, it's essential to consider the drivers behind the book value increment. For instance, if the increase is due to a one-off event such as the sale of an asset, it may not be indicative of ongoing operational strength. Investors should await the detailed financial results to understand the full picture, including revenue streams and profitability metrics, which are important in evaluating the company's performance and future outlook. Market Research Analyst The information provided by Associated Capital Group offers a glimpse into the company's financial health ahead of the full earnings report. The stock market typically reacts to such preliminary figures, as they help shape expectations. A positive trend in book value can often lead to bullish sentiment among investors, potentially driving up the stock price in anticipation of strong full-quarter financials.It's important to note that while preliminary book value figures are insightful, they don't provide a complete view of the company's market position or competitive dynamics. Industry comparisons and broader market trends will also play a significant role in influencing investor perceptions and the stock's performance. The upcoming detailed financial results will be more telling, especially if they reveal trends in operational efficiency, cost management and revenue growth. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM GREENWICH, Conn., April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Associated Capital Group, Inc.

Herbalife Announces Pricing of Upsized $800 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of Senior Secured Notes Offering,2024-04-06T01:36:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Herbalife  (HLF) announces the upsizing and pricing of $800 million senior secured notes due 2029, with a fixed annual interest rate of 12.25%. The company plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.","Herbalife Announces Pricing of Upsized $800 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of Senior Secured Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Herbalife (HLF) announces the upsizing and pricing of $800 million senior secured notes due 2029, with a fixed annual interest rate of 12.25%. The company plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Herbalife's decision to upsize its senior secured notes offering from $700 million to $800 million at a fixed interest rate of 12.25% is a strategic move to restructure its debt profile. The high interest rate indicates a premium the company is paying, likely reflecting a risk premium demanded by investors. This could suggest that the market perceives higher risk associated with Herbalife's creditworthiness. However, by repaying existing debts, including those with a higher interest rate, Herbalife could improve its interest expense outlook and potentially its credit rating over time.The use of proceeds to pay down existing senior secured credit facility borrowings and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025 before maturity could reduce near-term liquidity risks. This proactive approach to managing debt maturities may reassure investors about the company's financial prudence. However, investors should be aware of the potential dilution of earnings due to increased interest expenses in the short term, before the long-term benefits of the refinancing are realized. Debt Market Analyst The pricing of the notes at 97.298% of par reflects a discount, which is not uncommon in the debt market, especially for offerings of this size and nature. The discount compensates investors for the immediate mark-to-market risk. The closing date set for April 12, 2024, provides a clear timeline for market participants to assess Herbalife's liquidity and capital structure strategy.The guarantee by the company and its subsidiaries ensures that the obligations are backed by a broader asset base, which could be seen as a confidence measure for debt holders. However, the emphasis on the securities not being registered under the Securities Act and only being offered under specific exemptions like Rule 144A and Regulation S means that the offering is targeted at qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons, limiting the investor base. Market Research Analyst Herbalife's approach to debt refinancing amidst the current economic climate reflects a strategic maneuver to align its capital structure with its operational needs. The high interest rate may be interpreted as a response to the prevailing interest rate environment and the company's specific risk profile. The timing of the offering and the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes alongside debt repayment could indicate that Herbalife is also aiming to maintain a cushion for strategic initiatives or unforeseen expenses.Investors should monitor the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-transaction to assess the impact of this capital restructuring on its financial health. While the upsizing provides Herbalife with additional capital, it also increases the company's debt burden, which could affect future financial flexibility. 04/05/2024 - 09:36 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) (the “Company”), a global health and wellness company, today announced the upsizing and pricing of the previously announced offering by HLF Financing SaRL, LLC and Herbalife International, Inc., each a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, of $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Notes”) at a price to the public of 97.298% of par. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be issued in the offering was increased to $800 million from the previously announced amount of $700 million. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 12.25%, which will be paid semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2024. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company and the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the obligations of any domestic borrower under the Company’s senior secured credit facility. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay indebtedness, including borrowings outstanding under the Company’s senior secured credit facility and a portion of the Company’s 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025, to pay related fees and expenses and the remainder for general corporate purposes.

Negative The company's non-compliance with NYSE listing standards raises concerns about its financial health and ability to maintain its listing on the exchange. Financial Analyst The notification received by Local Bounti Corporation from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard is a signal of financial distress which could influence investor sentiment and the company's ability to raise capital. Market capitalization is a critical metric, as it reflects the market's valuation of a company's equity and is often used by investors to gauge a company's size, and, indirectly, its stability and growth prospects.Local Bounti's situation, with both market capitalization and stockholders' equity falling below $50 million, may raise concerns about its financial health and operational efficiency. In the short term, while the stock continues to trade, there could be increased volatility as investors react to the uncertainty of the company's future on the exchange. Over the long term, if Local Bounti fails to regain compliance, it could face delisting, which typically leads to lower liquidity and could hamper the company's ability to attract institutional investors.It's also important to consider that the agricultural technology sector is capital intensive and companies often rely on their market capitalization not just for valuation purposes, but also as a basis for securing loans and investments. This notice could therefore have a cascading effect on Local Bounti's operations and strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst Local Bounti operates in the indoor agriculture industry, a sector that is gaining attention due to the increasing demand for sustainable farming practices and locally sourced produce. The industry is competitive and requires significant investment in technology and infrastructure to stay relevant. The notice from NYSE may suggest that Local Bounti is facing challenges in maintaining its competitive edge or managing its growth effectively.Investors and market participants often look at a company's ability to maintain compliance with exchange standards as a barometer for operational competence and governance. The company's consideration of 'all available options' to regain compliance indicates a proactive approach, but the lack of assurance in maintaining its listing may introduce market skepticism.Furthermore, the company's performance should be assessed relative to its peers within the sector. If competitors are not facing similar issues, it could indicate that Local Bounti's challenges are company-specific rather than industry-wide, which might affect investor perception of the company's management and strategic direction. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the compliance with NYSE's listing standards is not only a financial requirement but also a matter of corporate governance. The notice serves as a formal warning that Local Bounti needs to address its financial standing promptly. The 18-month Market Capitalization Cure Period provides a time frame for the company to improve its financial metrics or face potential delisting.During this period, the company must navigate the legal implications of its strategic decisions carefully. Any plan proposed to the NYSE to regain compliance will be scrutinized for its feasibility and adherence to both the exchange's requirements and broader securities regulations. The legal team at Local Bounti will need to ensure that all actions taken to address the notice are transparent and communicated effectively to shareholders to avoid any potential legal disputes or further loss of investor confidence. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM HAMILTON, Mont., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Local Bounti Corporation (NYSE: LOCL) (""Local Bounti"" or the ""Company""), a breakthrough U.S. indoor agriculture company, today announced that on April 3, 2024, it received a notice (the ""Notice"") from the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE"") that it is not in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the ""Minimum Market Capitalization Standard"") due to the fact that the Company's average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50 million and, at the same time, its stockholders' equity was less than $50 million. In accordance with NYSE procedures, the Company intends to notify the NYSE that it plans to submit a plan within 45 days of receipt of the Notice advising the NYSE of definitive action it has taken, or is taking, to bring it into compliance with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard within 18 months of receipt of the Notice (the ""Market Capitalization Cure Period""). Any plan submitted by the Company to regain compliance would be subject to NYSE approval. The Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company's common stock, which will continue to trade on the NYSE during the Market Capitalization Cure Period. The Company is considering all available options to regain compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. The Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to satisfy any of the steps outlined above and maintain the listing of its shares on the NYSE.

The company aims to repay existing loans and notes, focusing on growth and shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Herbalife's move to refinance a significant portion of its debt portfolio is a strategic decision that could have notable implications for the company's financial health and flexibility. By securing a $400 million Term Loan B and a $400 million revolving credit facility, the company is not only addressing its immediate debt obligations but also potentially reducing its interest expenses and extending maturities. This could improve cash flow management and provide more room for investment in growth initiatives.However, investors should carefully monitor the terms of the new debt, including interest rates and covenants, which will determine the actual cost of capital and any new financial restrictions the company may face. The fact that the company is replacing its current facilities before their maturity could signal a proactive approach to capital management, but it also raises questions about the company's access to capital and future debt market conditions.Given that Herbalife operates in a competitive health and wellness market, maintaining financial agility is key to capitalizing on market opportunities and managing risks. The refinancing could be a positive sign of the company's commitment to financial prudence and shareholder value, assuming it leads to a more favorable debt structure. Market Research Analyst Herbalife's refinancing announcement may suggest a broader strategy to optimize its operational efficiency and strengthen its market position. In the health and wellness sector, companies often need to invest heavily in marketing, research and development and global expansion. By refinancing existing debt, Herbalife might be aiming to free up resources for these critical areas.The impact on the stock market will largely depend on investor perception of the company's ability to manage its debt and generate growth. If the market views this refinancing as a sign of financial stability and foresight, it could lead to positive sentiment and a potential uptick in Herbalife's stock price. Conversely, if the terms of the refinancing are less favorable than the market expects, or if there is skepticism about the company's growth prospects, there could be a negative reaction.It's also important to consider the timing of the refinancing, set for April 2024. The advance notice gives investors time to assess Herbalife's performance leading up to the refinancing and to gauge the health of the credit markets at that time. Market conditions, interest rates and investor confidence in the sector will all play roles in how this refinancing is ultimately perceived and its subsequent impact on the company's stock. 04/05/2024 - 09:38 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) (the “Company”), a premier health and wellness company, community and platform, today announced it is in the process of completing its previously announced $1.2 billion secured refinancing, which is expected to include a $400 million, 5-year senior secured Term Loan B facility.

ENHERTU® Approved in the U.S. as First Tumor Agnostic HER2 Directed Therapy for Previously Treated Patients with Metastatic HER2 Positive Solid Tumors,2024-04-06T03:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca's ENHERTU receives U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 positive solid tumors after showing clinically meaningful responses. The drug is now approved for five indications, with the latest in metastatic cancers.","ENHERTU® Approved in the U.S. as First Tumor Agnostic HER2 Directed Therapy for Previously Treated Patients with Metastatic HER2 Positive Solid Tumors Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca's ENHERTU receives U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 positive solid tumors after showing clinically meaningful responses. The drug is now approved for five indications, with the latest in metastatic cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Clinical Researcher The recent FDA approval of ENHERTU for a broad range of HER2 positive metastatic cancers represents a significant advancement in oncology therapeutics. The accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response underlines the drug's potential to provide clinical benefits in a setting with limited treatment options. This development is particularly noteworthy as it marks the first tumor-agnostic approval of a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate, highlighting the shift towards precision medicine in oncology.From a clinical research perspective, the efficacy data from the DESTINY clinical development program is promising. The confirmed ORR and median DOR across various solid tumors indicate that ENHERTU could offer a new therapeutic strategy for patients who have exhausted other systemic treatments. However, the continued approval contingent upon verification in a confirmatory trial suggests that investors should be aware of the potential for future adjustments based on long-term efficacy and safety data. Healthcare Economist The approval of ENHERTU has implications for healthcare economics, particularly in the precision oncology market. The drug's tumor-agnostic indication can lead to an increase in biomarker testing across multiple tumor types, potentially expanding the patient population eligible for treatment. This expansion could drive up demand for ENHERTU, affecting both the drug's pricing strategy and the overall cost of cancer care.Moreover, the comprehensive support program for patients and providers suggests a strategic move by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca to ensure market penetration and patient adherence. The financial support mechanisms could alleviate some economic barriers to access, which is a critical factor in the adoption of high-cost oncology treatments. Investors should consider the potential for increased healthcare spending in this domain and the subsequent market growth for targeted therapies like ENHERTU. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The recent FDA approval of ENHERTU is a strategic milestone for Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca, likely to have a positive impact on their market positioning. The drug's approval under the RTOR program and Priority Review signifies its importance and the unmet need in the treatment landscape. As a first-in-class HER2 directed ADC with a tumor-agnostic indication, ENHERTU is set to compete in a niche but growing segment of the oncology market.Investors should note that the drug's safety profile, including the Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease and Embryo-Fetal toxicity, will require careful monitoring and could influence prescribing patterns. Nevertheless, the inclusion of ENHERTU in the NCCN Guidelines as a treatment option for multiple metastatic tumors is an endorsement that may bolster its adoption in clinical practice. The potential for international regulatory reviews could further enhance the drug's global market reach and commercial success. 04/05/2024 - 11:10 PM Based on three phase 2 trials of Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU that showed clinically meaningful responses across a broad range of tumors ENHERTU now has five approved indications with the latest in HER2 expressing (IHC 3+) metastatic cancers TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. The first tumor agnostic approval of a HER2 directed therapy and ADC was based on efficacy data in 192 adult patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who were enrolled in one of three multicenter phase 2 trials from the DESTINY clinical development program, including DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 or DESTINY-CRC02. The major efficacy outcome measure in all three of the studies was confirmed ORR and an additional efficacy outcome measure was DOR. In DESTINY-PanTumor02, efficacy was assessed in a subgroup of previously treated patients (n=111) with centrally or locally assessed HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors including either biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic or other tumors. Confirmed ORR was 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.7-61.0) and median DOR range was 19.4 months (range: 1.3, 27.9+ [‘+’ denotes ongoing responses at data cutoff]). In DESTINY-Lung01, efficacy was assessed in a subgroup of patients (n=17) with centrally confirmed HER2 positive (IHC 3+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A confirmed ORR of 52.9% (95% CI: 27.8-77.0) and median DOR range of 6.9 months (range: 4.0, 11.7+) was seen. In DESTINY-CRC02, efficacy was assessed in the subgroup of patients (n=64) with centrally confirmed HER2 positive (IHC 3+) colorectal cancer. Confirmed ORR was 46.9% (95% CI: 34.3-59.8) and median DOR range was 5.5 months (range: 1.3+, 9.7+). The approval was received following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) review of the application using the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program and under Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The submission was reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. As part of Project Orbis, ENHERTU also is under regulatory review for the same indication by regulatory authorities in Australia, Brazil and Singapore. “Until the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan, patients with metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors have had limited treatment options,” said Funda Meric-Bernstam, MD, Chair of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Based on the clinically meaningful response rates seen across clinical trials, this tumor-agnostic approval means that patients may now be treated with a HER2 directed medicine.” ENHERTU is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and Embryo-Fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 347 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who received ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in DESTINY-Breast01, DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-CRC02. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased white blood cell count, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, fatigue, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, vomiting, decreased appetite, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased blood potassium, constipation, decreased sodium, stomatitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were sepsis, pneumonia, vomiting, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, hemorrhage, COVID-19, fatigue, acute kidney injury, anemia, cellulitis, and dyspnea. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.3% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (2.3%), cardiac arrest (0.6%), COVID-19 (0.6%), and sepsis (0.6%). The following events occurred in one patient each (0.3%): acute kidney injury, cerebrovascular accident, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. “This fifth indication in the U.S. is a significant milestone as eligible patients with previously treated metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors may now be treated with ENHERTU,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “The accelerated approval by the FDA for this tumor agnostic indication is based on the clinically meaningful efficacy seen with ENHERTU across numerous types of metastatic cancers.” “As the first antibody drug conjugate to be granted a tumor agnostic indication, ENHERTU is truly delivering on its potential across metastatic HER2 targetable tumors,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “This approval also elevates the importance of testing for biomarkers, including HER2, across a broad range of tumors to ensure these patients with advanced cancer who have few options know whether a targeted medicine might be right for them.” Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed ENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, reimbursement and distribution for ENHERTU in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting www.ENHERTU4U.com or calling 1-833-ENHERTU (1-833-364-3788). Please visit www.ENHERTU.com for full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide. Based on these results, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (ENHERTU) has been included in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as a treatment option for multiple metastatic tumors.

Primary results from the DESTINY-CRC02 phase 2 trial were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. About DESTINY-Breast01 DESTINY-Breast01 is a global single-arm, open-label, two-part multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include DOR, DCR, clinical benefit rate, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY-Breast01 enrolled 253 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov. Updated data from DESTINY-Breast01 were presented at the ESMO 2021 Virtual Congress. The initial analysis was presented at SABCS 2019 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December 2019. About HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells throughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.2,3 In some cancers, HER2 expression is amplified or the cells have activating mutations.2,4 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.5 HER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers for a number of years. Although HER2 is expressed in solid tumor types including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers,4 testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a result, available literature is limited. In these solid tumors, HER2 positive expression, classified as IHC 3+, has been observed at rates from 1% to 28%.6,7 Approximately 1% to 5% of patients with NSCLC have tumors with HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+), however, the levels of protein expression reported vary in the literature.6,8 Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have tumors that are HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+).6,9,10 About ENHERTU ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC.

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception. Contraindications None. Warnings and Precautions Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21). Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment. HER2-Positive or HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2-Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3. HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Additional Dose Modifications Thrombocytopenia For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.

Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) as compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2-mutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.

No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Renal Impairment: A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min). Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).

AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Subsidiaries of Old Republic International Corporation; Revises Outlook to Positive for Old Republic Life Insurance Company,2024-04-05T20:08:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"AM Best affirms Old Republic Insurance Companies' strong financial ratings and positive outlooks, with stable and excellent credit ratings across its subsidiaries. The group's expertise in commercial lines insurance, solid profitability, and strong risk management contribute to its success.","AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of Subsidiaries of Old Republic International Corporation; Revises Outlook to Positive for Old Republic Life Insurance Company Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AM Best affirms Old Republic Insurance Companies' strong financial ratings and positive outlooks, with stable and excellent credit ratings across its subsidiaries. The group's expertise in commercial lines insurance, solid profitability, and strong risk management contribute to its success. Positive None. Negative None. Insurance Industry Analyst The affirmation of the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) for the members of Old Republic Insurance Companies, including Old Republic Title Insurance Group and Old Republic Insurance Company of Canada, indicates a stable and robust financial position. This stability is particularly significant given the volatility in the insurance industry, which can be affected by a myriad of factors including economic downturns, natural disasters and regulatory changes. The strong ratings suggest that Old Republic has a solid balance sheet and is well-positioned to meet its ongoing insurance obligations.For stakeholders, the stable outlook provides confidence in the company's ability to manage risk effectively and maintain profitability. This is further reinforced by Old Republic's focus on commercial lines insurance carriers and its expansion beyond traditional business lines. The positive outlook revision for Old Republic Life Insurance Company (ORL) suggests an expected continuation of favorable performance, which could be an indicator of strategic growth and operational efficiency within the company. Financial Market Analyst The ratings and outlooks provided by AM Best are critical indicators of a company's creditworthiness and are closely watched by investors. For Old Republic International Corporation (NYSE: ORI), the parent company of the subsidiaries mentioned, these affirmed and stable ratings could influence investor perception and stock performance. In the short term, this news may reassure investors of the company's financial health and lead to increased investor confidence.In the long term, the ratings affirmations and positive outlook for ORL may attract more conservative investors looking for stable returns and low volatility. However, it's important to note that while ratings provide a snapshot of financial stability, they are not the sole factor in investment decision-making. Investors should also consider broader market conditions, the company's strategic initiatives and sector-specific challenges when evaluating the potential impact on stock performance. Risk Management Consultant The emphasis on Old Republic's balance sheet strength, strong operating performance and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM) practices suggests that the company has effective risk management strategies in place. These strategies are important for mitigating potential losses and ensuring the company's resilience against financial and operational risks. The ratings also reflect the company's expertise in the alternative risk transfer market and specialty commercial segments, which can be complex areas requiring specialized risk assessment and management.For businesses considering insurance services from Old Republic, the ratings are indicative of a reliable partner capable of delivering on claims and maintaining a stable financial outlook. The company's modest exposure to asbestos liabilities, which have historically been a significant concern in the insurance industry, further underscores its prudent risk management approach and could be a deciding factor for businesses with similar liability concerns. 04/05/2024 - 04:08 PM OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICRs) of “aa-” (Superior) of the members of Old Republic Insurance Companies (Old Republic). Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of “aa-” (Superior) of Old Republic National Title Insurance Company (Tampa, FL) and American Guaranty Title Insurance Company (Oklahoma City, OK) (collectively referred to as Old Republic Title Insurance Group [ORTIG]). At the same time, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a+” (Excellent) of Old Republic Insurance Company of Canada (Old Republic Canada) (Hamilton, Ontario). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. In addition, AM Best has revised the outlooks to positive from stable and affirmed the FSR of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR of “bbb+” (Good) of Old Republic Life Insurance Company (ORL) (Chicago, IL). All companies are subsidiaries of Old Republic International Corporation (ORI) [NYSE: ORI]. (See below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings for the members of Old Republic.) The ratings of Old Republic, which is considered the lead rating unit in the ORI enterprise, reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). Old Republic is the flagship group for the Old Republic Insurance enterprise and one of the top 50 property/casualty insurers in the United States. The group is made up of commercial lines insurance carriers that focus on specific sectors of the North American economy. Its largest lines of business include commercial auto and workers’ compensation; however, the group continues to expand its product capabilities beyond the traditional focus within these lines. Old Republic benefits from its expertise within the alternative risk transfer market and specialty commercial segments, as well as historically solid profitability, expertise in its respective individual business specialties and well-recognized franchises. The organization continues to have very modest exposure to asbestos liabilities. The ratings of ORTIG reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strongest, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM. The ratings of ORTIG also reflect the implicit support the group receives from its position in the Old Republic enterprise and its strategic role within the organization. The ratings of ORTIG recognize its strong reserving practices and continued profitability. With a majority of ORTIG’s premiums and fees generated through independent agents, a significant portion of its expenses are variable. This enables ORTIG to manage down cycles better, as fixed costs generally are lower for that distribution channel. AM Best expects that ORTIG will continue to generate underwriting and operating results that are in line with its title competitors, despite the impact of higher mortgage interest rates, which has led to a steep drop in mortgage originations and refinance activity. AM Best expects that ORTIG will remain a significant contributor to the overall profitability of the ORI enterprise, while maintaining the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization in the intermediate term, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). ORTIG continues to be integral to the overall organization, with common branding and talent synergies, as well as complementary ERM programs. The ratings of Old Republic Canada reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM. The ratings of Old Republic Canada also reflect its strategic importance within the Old Republic enterprise. The ratings of Old Republic Canada recognize the synergies it gains as an affiliate of Great West Casualty Company, as well as its accident and sickness businesses. Partially offsetting these positive rating factors are the company’s limited product offering and the challenging market environment in Canada. The ratings of ORL reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its marginal operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. The positive outlooks for ORL reflect the expectation that the company will continue to exhibit favorable operating performance over the intermediate term, while maintaining its overall balance sheet strength assessment. The ratings of ORL recognize its risk-adjusted capitalization, which is assessed at the strongest level, as measured by BCAR. Invested asset holdings are of good credit quality, as the portfolio is designed to minimize credit default risk rather than maximizing yield. Earnings have been positive in recent years. Premiums have declined over the last several years, as closed term premiums run off and as occupational accident premiums have trended lower. The company’s business profile consists of a closed block of term life insurance and the actively marketed occupational accident line. Despite its modest size, ORL is important strategically to the Old Republic organization. The FSR of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of “aa-” (Superior) have been affirmed, with stable outlooks, for the following members of the Old Republic Insurance Companies: BITCO General Insurance Corporation BITCO National Insurance Company Great West Casualty Company Manufacturers Alliance Insurance Company Old Republic General Insurance Corporation Old Republic Insurance Company Old Republic Surety Company Old Republic Union Insurance Company Pennsylvania Manufacturers Indemnity Company Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance Company This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary AMCON Distributing Company announces the acquisition of Burklund Distributors, Inc., expanding its reach in consumer products distribution. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Burklund Distributors by AMCON Distributing Company marks a strategic expansion that could potentially strengthen AMCON's distribution network and enhance its market presence in the Midwest. By integrating Burklund Distributors, which is based in East Peoria, Illinois, AMCON is not only expanding geographically but also may be diversifying its product portfolio and customer base.From a market research perspective, the consolidation within the distribution sector often aims to achieve economies of scale, which can lead to cost savings in logistics and supply chain management. For AMCON, this could mean improved margins over time. Additionally, the broader distribution network may provide AMCON with increased bargaining power with suppliers and an ability to offer a more comprehensive range of products to its customers.However, the success of such acquisitions depends on the integration process, including the alignment of corporate cultures and systems. The impact on AMCON's financials will need to be monitored in subsequent quarters to assess the effectiveness of the acquisition and its contribution to revenue growth and profitability. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the closure of this acquisition could signal positive future performance for AMCON's stock (NYSE American: DIT). Investors will be looking at key metrics in upcoming earnings reports to gauge the immediate financial impact, such as changes in revenue, cost of sales and EBITDA margins.It's important to note that acquisitions can lead to one-time costs associated with the transaction and integration, which could affect short-term financial results. However, if managed effectively, the long-term benefits of expanded operations could outweigh these initial costs. The acquisition may also lead to an improved competitive position for AMCON in the convenience and foodservice distribution industry, which could have positive implications for shareholder value.Investors should consider the acquisition in the context of AMCON's overall growth strategy and how it fits within the competitive landscape of the distribution industry. Monitoring subsequent financial disclosures will be essential to evaluate the return on investment and the strategic value derived from the acquisition of Burklund Distributors. 04/05/2024 - 04:05 PM OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMCON Distributing Company (“AMCON”) (NYSE American: DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska-based consumer products company is pleased to announce the closing of its previously announced acquisition of Burklund Distributors, Inc., of East Peoria, Illinois.

Receives Notification of Deficiency from Nasdaq Related to Delayed Filing of Annual Report on Form 10-K Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Sonder Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SOND) received a deficiency notification from Nasdaq due to the delayed filing of its 2023 Form 10-K. The company has 60 days to submit a compliance plan and could be granted an extension of up to 180 days to regain compliance. Sonder intends to work diligently to file the 2023 Form 10-K as soon as possible. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company delays its annual report, it often signals underlying issues that could range from simple clerical errors to significant financial discrepancies. Stakeholders should monitor the situation closely, as the delay can impact investor confidence and trigger volatility in the company's stock price. The extended timeline provided by Nasdaq for compliance suggests a window for Sonder to rectify the issues without immediate drastic consequences. However, the market often reacts negatively to uncertainty and the lack of transparency until the report is filed could lead to a decline in share value.Investors should consider the historical performance of companies in similar situations, as delays in filing can sometimes precede restatements or the identification of material weaknesses in internal controls. It would be prudent to review Sonder's past financial health and any previously disclosed risks that might be related to the current delay. An analysis of the company's liquidity, debt levels and cash flows will be essential once the report is filed to assess any impact on the company's financial stability. Legal Expert Non-compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) is a serious matter, as it requires timely filing of all periodic reports. The SEC's oversight ensures that investors have access to essential financial information to make informed decisions. The notice from Nasdaq is a procedural step, but it can lead to increased scrutiny from regulators and investors alike. Sonder's commitment to submit a compliance plan is a positive step, but it is the effectiveness of the plan and the timely resolution of the issues that will ultimately determine their ability to maintain listing status.Should Sonder fail to regain compliance within the given timeframe, the company risks delisting, which could significantly limit its access to capital markets and further erode shareholder value. It is also important to note that the SEC may investigate the reasons behind the filing delay, which could lead to additional disclosures or enforcement actions if any violations of securities laws are discovered. Market Research Analyst The reaction of the market to news of delayed filings can often be indicative of the company's perceived stability and the strength of its management team. Sonder's ability to communicate effectively with shareholders and the market during this period will be critical in maintaining trust. Investors should look for patterns in market behavior in response to similar events with other companies and sectors to gauge potential outcomes.Furthermore, the nature of the issues that caused the delay, once disclosed, will be significant. If the delay is due to operational inefficiencies, it could signal deeper systemic problems within the company. However, if the delay is due to strategic reasons such as acquisitions or restructuring, the market might respond more favorably once the rationale is fully understood. In any case, the company's subsequent actions and the eventual content of the 2023 Form 10-K will be telling in terms of Sonder's operational health and strategic direction. 04/05/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN FRANCISCO, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sonder Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SOND, “Sonder” or the “Company”) today announced that it received an expected deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on April 2, 2024 (the ""Notice""). The Notice indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) as a result of its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), as described more fully in the Company's Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing (the “Form 12b-25”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 15, 2024. The Listing Rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC. In accordance with Nasdaq’s listing rules, the Company has 60 calendar days after the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. Following receipt of such plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the 2023 Form 10-K’s due date, or until September 30, 2024, for the Company to regain compliance. The Company intends to submit a compliance plan to Nasdaq and take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules as soon as practicable. As previously disclosed, the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K was delayed due to the matters described in the Form 12b-25 and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024.

The company's antibodies show potential in restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing immune response in cancer patients. Positive 23andMe leverages genetic and health data to discover ULBP6 variants linked to immune diseases and cancer risks. Antibody '1473' targets ULBP6, a stress-induced ligand on cancer cells, showing high binding affinity to NKG2D. '1473' activates NK and T cells, potentially reversing immune suppression and enhancing tumor cell killing. CD200R1 antibody '00610' demonstrates potential to combine with anti-PD-1 therapies, enhancing immune response in cancer patients. CD200R1 is broadly expressed on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, offering a new target for immunotherapy. 23andMe's antibodies are in clinical trials for advanced solid tumors, showing promise in enhancing immune response and inhibiting tumor growth.

(Nasdaq: ME) (“23andMe”), a leading human genetics and biopharmaceutical company, will present data on its two clinical stage programs, 23ME-01473 targeting ULBP6, and 23ME-00610 targeting CD200R1, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, taking place in San Diego, CA, April 5-10, 2024. 23ME-001473 (‘1473) - Clinical-Stage Dual Mechanism Monoclonal Antibody Targeting ULBP6 Key takeaways: 23andMe used its proprietary database of human genetic and health information to discover germline variants of ULBP6 associated with higher risks of immune disease and lower risks of cancer, suggesting the potential of ULBP6 as a novel immuno-oncology (I/O) drug target.Data also show soluble ULBP6 is a dominant immunosuppressor compared to other soluble NKG2D ligands due to its highest binding affinity to NKG2D among all NKG2D ligands.‘1473 is a high affinity, Fc effector-enhanced, anti-ULBP6 antibody that restores the activation and tumor cell killing capacity of natural killer (NK) and T cells through the dual mechanisms of NKG2D and FcγRIIIa activation. Key details: ULBP6 is a stress-induced ligand that is upregulated on the surface of cancer cells and binds to the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D found on NK and T cells.ULBP6 can be shed from the cell surface of tumor cells into a soluble form that acts as an immunosuppressive decoy to evade immune surveillance. Soluble ULBP6 is elevated in cancer patient plasma.Of all human NKG2D ligands, ULBP6 exhibits the highest binding affinity to NKG2D, which correlates with the high potency of soluble ULBP6 in suppressing PBMC-mediated interferon-gamma secretion and promoting tumor cell growth in vitro.Expression profiling of ULBP6 in various tumors using The Cancer Genome Atlas and immunohistochemistry reveals its elevated expression in squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of adenocarcinomas.‘1473’s dual synergistic activation of NKG2D and FcγRIIIa leads to optimal activation of NK cells, which may reverse immune suppression and circumvent resistance to immune-checkpoint inhibitors due to the loss of neoantigen presentation in tumors.‘1473 is currently being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT06290388). 23ME-00610 - Clinical-Stage Monoclonal Antibody Targeting CD200R1 Key Takeaways: CD200R1 is a dominant immune checkpoint and differentiated from PD-1, based on both the pattern of expression on tumor infiltrating immune cells from patient tumors and the pattern of activation on patient peripheral mononuclear blood cells.23andMe preclinical results support the potential for 23ME-00610 to combine with anti-PD-1 and antiangiogenics. Key Details: Prevalence of CD200R1 and its ligand CD200 was characterized on tumor samples from patients with clear cell renal cell and serous ovarian carcinomas.CD200R1 is broadly expressed on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells and NK cells, whereas expression of PD-1 is predominantly restricted to T cells.23ME-00610 differentially enhanced interferon-gamma secretion from cancer patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells relative to anti-PD-1, and 23ME-00610 enhanced both T and NK cell anti-tumor activity.CD200/R1 is an independent immunosuppressive pathway from PD/L-1, with potential for synergism in patients with cancer based on preclinical combination data with primary human T cells.CD200, the ligand of CD200R1, is expressed on both tumor cells and endothelial cells, and combination anti-CD200 with anti-VEGF led to tumor growth inhibition relative to single agents in a preclinical mouse model.23ME-00610 is currently in the Phase 2a portion of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial (NCT05199272). The presentations will be available on the 23andMe Investor Relations and Therapeutics websites on April 8, 2024.

Strong backlog of $513.4 million at the end of 2023 for continued growth in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported earnings by CPI Aerostructures show a mixed financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. While there was a slight decline in revenue year-over-year, the company managed to increase its gross profit and gross margin. The substantial boost in net income is primarily due to a significant deferred tax asset valuation allowance reduction. This one-time tax benefit has inflated earnings per share (EPS), which, when adjusted, shows a more modest increase. The reduction in debt and a healthy cash flow from operations signify a stable financial position.Investors should be cautious in interpreting the EPS jump as a sign of operational growth, as the underlying earnings growth is less dramatic when tax benefits are excluded. The increase in gross margin, albeit slight, suggests some improvement in cost management or pricing power. The reduction in debt is a positive sign, indicating the company's commitment to improving its balance sheet. However, the slight dip in revenue could be a point of concern, warranting a closer look at market demand and competitive dynamics. Market Research Analyst CPI Aero's backlog of $513.4 million is a robust indicator of future revenue, reflecting confidence in the company's growth trajectory. This backlog, coupled with the introduction of new programs, suggests potential for continued expansion in 2024. A strong backlog often correlates with future financial stability and can be a reassuring sign for investors looking for long-term holdings.However, it is essential to analyze the nature of these new programs and the company's ability to convert its backlog into revenue efficiently. The aerospace and defense industry, where CPI Aero operates, is subject to long sales cycles and fluctuating government budgets, which can impact the timing and certainty of these revenues. Stakeholders should monitor the company's execution on these new programs and the impact of external factors such as defense spending trends and global economic conditions. Economist The financial results of CPI Aero need to be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The company's performance, especially the operational cash flow improvement, is indicative of adept management in a potentially challenging economic climate. The ability to generate cash and pay down debt is particularly valuable if the economy faces headwinds, as it provides a buffer against downturns.Furthermore, the increase in net income and EPS, even when adjusted for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance reduction, is a positive signal. However, the true test of the company's economic resilience will be its capacity to sustain growth without such one-time benefits. Long-term investors should consider the company's strategic positioning, cost structure and the economic outlook of the defense sector, which can be influenced by geopolitical tensions and government policies. 04/05/2024 - 08:40 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 vs. Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenue of $23.5 million compared to $24.1 million;Gross profit of $4.1 million compared to $3.9 million;Gross margin of 17.4% compared to 16.1%;Net income of $14.8 million compared to net income of $6.8 million;Earnings per share of $1.20 ($0.09 excluding the fourth quarter 2023 deferred tax asset valuation allowance reduction of $1.11) compared to earnings per share of $0.55 ($0.03 excluding the fourth quarter 2022 deferred tax asset valuation allowance reduction of $0.52);Cash flow from operations of $3.1 million compared to $0.1 million.

(“CPI Aero” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: CVU) today announced financial results for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2023. “We reported solid full-year results, delivering 3.8% increased revenue and a 4.7% increase in gross profit in 2023.

ABOUT SANSURE BIOTECH INC.Sansure (www.sansureglobal.com) is an in-vitro diagnostic solution provider founded in Changsha, Hunan province, China, in 2008 with over 2,000 employees and a broad product portfolio. It is engaged in research and development, production and sales of diagnostic reagents and instruments. The company has more than ten years of experience in specialized diagnostic reagents, nucleic acid diagnostic instruments, complete lab solutions and lab chain services and offers solutions for molecular diagnosis that are compatible with most polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection instruments and lab environments. Sansure listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's STAR Market on 28 August 2020, raising RMB2.0 billion (c.US$300 million), and as of 27 July 2022, had a market capitalization of approximately RMB17.5 billion (c.US$2.6 billion). It was also one of the first molecular diagnostics companies to have its SARS-CoV-2 test kits approved in China, which are now sold to over 160 countries. Headquartered in Changsha, the company has built a new industrial park in Shanghai to facilitate its growth. The company has branches and affiliates in nearly 20 cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Xi'an. ABOUT ASEP MEDICAL HOLDINGS INC.Asep Medical Holdings Inc. (www.asepmedical.com) is dedicated to addressing the global issue of antibiotic failure by developing novel solutions for significant unmet medical needs in human medicine. The Company is a consolidation of three existing private companies, all with technology in advanced development — Sepset Biosciences Inc. (proprietary diagnostic tools to enable the early and timely identification of sepsis), ABT Innovations Inc. (broad-spectrum therapeutic agents to address multi-drug resistant biofilm infections), and SafeCoat Medical Inc. (an antibacterial peptide medical device coating technology). Sepset Biosciences Inc. (www.sepset.ca) is in the final stages of preparation for clinical studies and commercialization of an in vitro diagnostic test that involves a patient gene expression signature that helps assess the development of severe sepsis, one of the significant diseases leading to antibiotic failure since antibiotics are the primary initial treatment for sepsis. Sepsis was responsible for nearly 20% of all deaths on the planet in 2017 and essentially all deaths due to COVID-19 and other pandemics. The SepsetER test is a blood-based gene expression assay that is straightforward to implement, and results are obtained about an hour after taking a blood sample in the emergency room or intensive care unit. This proprietary diagnostic technology differs from current diagnostic tests, enabling the risk assessment for progression to severe sepsis within ~60 minutes of initiating the test. Bacterial culture, the gold standard, provides results after ~15 hours but can be as long as three. Asep believes its test will enable critical early decisions to be made by physicians regarding appropriate therapies and thus reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to sepsis. ABT Innovations Inc.'s (www.abtinnovations.ca) peptide technology covers a broad range of therapeutic applications, including bacterial biofilm infections (dental, wound, sinusitis, skin, medical device infections, chronic infections, lung, bladder, ear-nose and throat, orthopaedic, etc.), anti-inflammatories, anti-infective immune-modulators and vaccine adjuvants. The company is in the pre-clinical development phase with promising data for the first three indications. SafeCoat Medical Inc.'s (www.safecoatmedical.com) technology encompasses anti-fouling self-assembling polymers combined with conjugated antimicrobial peptides, which can be applied to various surfaces as antimicrobial and anti-fouling coatings. In particular, the invention relates to coatings that may be applied to multiple medical devices and implants, and feasibility has been demonstrated in animal models. The company's expertise also encompasses the methods for manufacturing and applying these anti-bacterial coatings.

The repurchase plan follows the mutual holding company reorganization in January 2022 and will commence after releasing March 31, 2024, results. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by CFSB Bancorp, Inc. regarding its stock repurchase program reflects a strategic corporate finance decision. Repurchasing shares can be an indicator of management's belief that the stock is undervalued and it often leads to an increase in the earnings per share (EPS) figure, as there are fewer shares outstanding. This can be positive for investors, as it may lead to a higher stock price due to the reduced supply and improved financial ratios.However, the impact on the stock market will largely depend on the execution of this program. Factors such as market conditions, the company's financial performance and the availability of stock will play important roles. Investors should monitor the company's capital allocation efficiency, as alternative uses of capital could potentially offer higher returns. The repurchase plan also signals confidence in the company's liquidity and financial stability post-reorganization. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CFSB Bancorp's stock repurchase plan may be interpreted as a positive signal, potentially attracting investor interest. It's important to consider the context; the company completed a mutual holding company reorganization over a year ago. This repurchase initiative could be part of a broader strategy to optimize capital structure and shareholder value post-reorganization.Investors should evaluate the timing of the repurchases, as it coincides with the release of the company's financial results. If the results are favorable, the repurchase activity could compound the positive market reaction. Conversely, if results are below expectations, the repurchase program may provide some support to the stock price. Nonetheless, the long-term value of the repurchase program will be contingent upon the company's ongoing financial health and market performance. Legal Expert In terms of legal compliance, the repurchase program's adherence to Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission is significant. Rule 10b5-1 allows insiders of publicly traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. This rule is important because it provides a defense against charges of insider trading, should the individuals make trades during a time when they have access to non-public information. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for companies to repurchase their shares without being deemed to manipulate the market.For stakeholders, the legal framework ensures that the repurchase process is conducted transparently and fairly, minimizing legal risks. It is important for investors to be aware that while the company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, the announcement itself can influence investor sentiment and the company's stock price. 04/05/2024 - 04:15 PM QUINCY, Mass., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CFSB Bancorp, Inc.

Tricon Residential Inc. Receives Final Court Approval for Take Private by Blackstone Real Estate,2024-04-05T21:01:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Tricon Residential Inc. (NYSE: TCN, TSX: TCN) announced a final order approving its acquisition by Blackstone Real Estate Partners X for US$11.25 per Common Share in cash.

Receives Final Court Approval for Take Private by Blackstone Real Estate Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Tricon Residential Inc. (NYSE: TCN, TSX: TCN) announced a final order approving its acquisition by Blackstone Real Estate Partners X for US$11.25 per Common Share in cash. The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval under the Investment Canada Act, expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Tricon Residential Inc. by Blackstone entities represents a significant consolidation in the real estate investment sector. The agreed price of US$11.25 per Common Share needs to be assessed against Tricon's historical stock performance, book value and future cash flow projections. Investors should consider the premium paid over the current trading price and how it compares with similar transactions in the industry. The long-term implications for shareholders include the loss of potential future dividends and the ability to participate in the growth of the company, counterbalanced by the immediate liquidity event at the transaction price.From a market perspective, the delisting from the NYSE and TSX will reduce the investable universe for real estate securities, potentially increasing focus on remaining public entities. This could have an indirect effect on the valuation multiples of peer companies. Additionally, the deregistration from the U.S. Exchange Act signals a complete exit from public markets, which may have implications for the transparency and governance standards to which Tricon was previously held. Legal Expert The Ontario Superior Court of Justice's final order signifies compliance with legal procedures, adding certainty to the transaction. However, the remaining regulatory approval under the Investment Canada Act is a key hurdle that should not be overlooked. This act involves assessing whether the acquisition is of 'net benefit' to Canada, which includes considerations like employment and the participation of Canadians in the business. The outcome of this process is a significant factor that could influence the transaction's timeline or its terms.For shareholders, the details enclosed in the management information circular and the letter of transmittal are important documents. They provide guidance on how to navigate the transaction process and ensure receipt of the cash consideration. The role of the transfer agent and depositary, TSX Trust, is central in facilitating this process for registered shareholders, while beneficial shareholders must rely on their intermediaries, highlighting the importance of clear communication channels in such corporate actions. Market Research Analyst The transaction between Tricon and Blackstone is reflective of an ongoing trend in the real estate market where large institutional investors are acquiring real estate assets and platforms to leverage economies of scale and portfolio diversification. The impact on the business landscape includes potential shifts in strategy and management approaches as private equity firms like Blackstone have different operational goals compared to publicly traded companies.For the broader market, this acquisition may prompt a re-evaluation of real estate investment strategies among investors and competitors. As large players continue to consolidate, the competitive dynamics within the industry could shift, potentially leading to more mergers and acquisitions. This could also influence rental market trends, property management practices and innovation within the sector as Blackstone integrates Tricon's operations into its expansive real estate portfolio. 04/05/2024 - 05:01 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tricon Residential Inc. (NYSE: TCN, TSX: TCN) (“Tricon” or the “Company”) today announced that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) has granted a final order approving its previously announced statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”) pursuant to which Blackstone Real Estate Partners X, together with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Tricon (“Common Shares”) for US$11.25 per Common Share in cash (the “Transaction”).

Surf Air Mobility Receives Continued Listing Standard Notice from NYSE,2024-04-05T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Surf Air Mobility Inc. (NYSE: SRFM) received notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the minimum stock price requirement. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance by increasing its share price to at least $1.00.,"Surf Air Mobility Receives Continued Listing Standard Notice from NYSE Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Surf Air Mobility Inc. (NYSE: SRFM) received notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the minimum stock price requirement. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance by increasing its share price to at least $1.00. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Surf Air Mobility's recent non-compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price requirement signals potential concerns for the company's market valuation and investor confidence. Typically, a share price below $1 is often seen as a warning sign that a company may be facing financial difficulties or that its growth prospects are not as strong as initially anticipated. The market perceives such news with caution and it could lead to increased volatility in Surf Air's stock price.From a market research perspective, the proposed solutions like a reverse stock split, while a common strategy to boost share prices, may not address underlying issues within the company's operations or market position. Investors often view reverse splits ambivalently, as it does not change the company's market capitalization but can sometimes be perceived as a cosmetic fix. The real focus should be on Surf Air's ability to improve its fundamental business performance and address the factors that led to the decline in share price. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of Surf Air Mobility's stock price deficiency, the company has a six-month period to regain compliance, which provides a temporal cushion to strategize and implement corrective measures. However, this development can affect shareholder value and potentially trigger margin calls for investors using leverage. The company's consideration of a reverse stock split, pending stockholder approval, is a definitive step towards remedying the share price issue.It's essential to scrutinize the company's upcoming financial statements for signs of operational improvement or further distress. Investors should monitor the company's revenue growth, expense management and cash flow generation. These factors will be critical in determining whether Surf Air can organically increase its share price above the NYSE threshold or if the reverse stock split will be the chosen path to compliance. Legal Expert The notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance does not immediately affect Surf Air's listing, but it does introduce a period of scrutiny where the company must demonstrate its ability to meet exchange requirements. Legally, the company is obligated to follow through with its stated intention to regain compliance, or it risks further sanctions, including potential delisting. The legal team at Surf Air must ensure that any measures taken, such as a reverse stock split, comply with both NYSE regulations and securities laws.The implications of non-compliance and the steps to regain it must be clearly communicated to shareholders, as transparency is important in maintaining trust during such periods. If a reverse stock split is pursued, the company must adhere to proper procedures for stockholder approval, which involves clear disclosure and voting protocols. Legal guidance will be paramount in navigating these regulatory waters and minimizing any negative impact on the company's reputation and operational capabilities. 04/05/2024 - 05:00 PM Surf Air Mobility continues to trade on the NYSE under ticker symbol SRFM. LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Surf Air Mobility Inc. (NYSE: SRFM) (“Surf Air Mobility”,“Surf Air”), a leading regional air mobility platform, today announced that on April 2, 2024 it received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of Surf Air’s Common Stock was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The NYSE notice has no immediate impact on the listing of Surf Air’s Common Stock, and the Common Stock will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE, subject to Surf Air’s compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards. Surf Air plans to notify the NYSE within 10 business days that it intends to regain compliance with Rule 802.01C and cure the stock price deficiency. Surf Air can regain compliance at any time within the six-month period following receipt of the NYSE notice if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period Surf Air has a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. Surf Air intends to consider available alternatives, including, but not limited to, a reverse stock split, subject to stockholder approval no later than at Surf Air’s next annual meeting of stockholders, if necessary to cure the stock price non-compliance. Under the NYSE’s rules, if Surf Air determines that it will cure the stock price deficiency by taking an action that will require stockholder approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders, the price condition will be deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share, and the price remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. The notice is not anticipated to impact the ongoing business operations of Surf Air and its subsidiaries or its reporting requirements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Financial Analyst The early tender results for AMC Networks Inc.'s cash tender offer for its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2025 indicate a strong bondholder response, with a significant portion of the outstanding notes being tendered. This reflects bondholder sentiment and can impact the company's debt profile and interest expenses. The offer's structure, offering a premium for early tenders, is a common strategy to incentivize quick participation and may indicate the company's urgency to restructure its debt ahead of the 2025 maturity. The redemption notice for remaining notes suggests a proactive approach to debt management, potentially reducing future refinancing risk.Financially, the tender offer and subsequent redemption could affect AMC's liquidity and leverage ratios, important metrics for investors. The funding of this purchase through the issuance of new senior secured notes due 2029 may alter the company's capital structure, possibly increasing the proportion of secured debt. This could affect the risk profile of AMC's debt and potentially influence the terms of future borrowing. Investors should monitor the final results and the impact on the company's financial statements, particularly the balance sheet and cash flows. Market Research Analyst AMC Networks Inc.'s decision to repurchase its senior notes can be seen as a strategic move to capitalize on current market conditions. By addressing its upcoming obligations early, the company may be aiming to take advantage of lower interest rates before potential hikes. This could be a response to market forecasts or a reflection of the company's internal financial projections and strategy. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as dealer managers signifies the offer's importance and the need for expert handling, which could reassure investors about the process's credibility.The market's reaction to such financial maneuvers can vary. A successful tender offer often reassures investors of management's confidence in the company's financial health and strategic direction. However, it's essential to observe the stock market's response once the offer is completed, as the reallocation of capital towards debt management might raise questions about the company's long-term growth plans and investment in operations. Debt Market Analyst The early tender results show a considerable uptake by note holders, which can be an indicator of the current debt market sentiment towards AMC Networks Inc. The offered consideration and early tender premium are competitive, reflecting the company's commitment to reducing its debt burden. The move to issue new senior secured notes due 2029 to fund the tender offer suggests a refinancing strategy aimed at extending the debt maturity profile, which could be seen as a positive step towards long-term financial stability.However, the shift from unsecured to secured debt could imply a change in the pecking order of claims on the company's assets in the event of financial distress, potentially affecting unsecured debt holders' recovery rates. The market will closely watch the final acceptance numbers and the pricing and terms of the new notes, as these will provide insights into the company's credit standing and the appetite of debt investors for AMC's credit risk. 04/05/2024 - 08:05 PM NEW YORK, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMC Networks Inc.

(NYSE: NTZ) reported a decrease in invoiced sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 compared to the previous year due to challenging market conditions. The company focused on strengthening its branded business and restructuring operations to enhance competitiveness. Despite a decrease in sales, the transition to a lifestyle brand showed progress with a shift towards retail sales. Operating losses were reported, along with one-off restructuring costs. Net finance costs decreased in the fourth quarter, but rose for the full year due to rising interest rates. The company invested in retail expansion and production facilities, while reducing workforce to achieve cost savings. Positive Invoiced sales for the fourth quarter 2023 amounted to €84.1 million, a 27.8% decrease compared to the previous year. Branded sales represented 92.2% of total sales, indicating a successful transition to a lifestyle brand. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2023 was 36.2%, with an operating loss of (€1.4) million. Net finance costs for the fourth quarter were (€2.8) million. Invoiced sales for full year 2023 totaled €328.6 million, reflecting a 29.9% decrease compared to 2022. The company invested €11.8 million in retail expansion and production facilities in 2023. Natuzzi held €33.6 million in cash as of December 31, 2023. Negative Decrease in sales for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Operating losses reported for both periods. Net finance costs increased for the full year due to rising interest rates. One-off restructuring costs incurred in both periods. Reduction in workforce by 514 people in 2023. Market Analyst The reported decline in invoiced sales for Natuzzi S.p.A. in the fourth quarter of 2023 is a reflection of the broader challenges faced in the furniture industry. The significant drop of 27.8% year-over-year, even when adjusted for backlog, indicates a contraction in demand. This contraction may be attributed to cyclical economic factors or a shift in consumer spending patterns post-COVID. Investors should note the strategic shift towards a lifestyle brand and the implications of such a transition, which may affect short-term profitability but could potentially position the company for a stronger brand presence and customer loyalty in the long term.Furthermore, the restructuring efforts, including the reduction of the workforce and the investment in retail and production facilities, suggest a focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. However, the immediate impact of these changes has resulted in one-off restructuring costs and an operating loss. The increase in net finance costs year-over-year, likely due to rising interest rates, is an additional pressure point on the company's financial health. The reported cash holdings provide some liquidity buffer, but the decline from the previous quarter warrants attention to the company's cash flow management. Financial Analyst Analyzing the gross margin trends, the slight improvement in 2023 compared to the previous year suggests that despite the decrease in sales, Natuzzi may be starting to realize some benefits from its restructuring efforts. The reported annual savings of €22.6 million in labor costs could be significant for the company's bottom line. However, the operating loss, even when excluding restructuring costs, raises questions about the core profitability of the company's operations.From an investment perspective, the company's strategy to invest in brand and retail expansion during a period of reduced sales is a bold move that could either pave the way for future growth or strain financial resources if the anticipated sales recovery does not materialize. Investors should closely monitor the company's next earnings reports for signs of a successful turnaround or further challenges. Retail Industry Expert The transition of Natuzzi towards a lifestyle brand, with an increased focus on branded sales, is a significant development. The retail sector, particularly in luxury goods, has seen a shift towards direct-to-consumer models, which can offer higher margins and greater control over brand image. Natuzzi's increase in branded sales from 85.3% to 92.2% and retail sales from 52.2% to 61.7% since the beginning of 2021 indicates a successful pivot in this direction.The investment in IT and organizational interventions to modernize management of retail and commercial operations is a forward-thinking approach to align with industry best practices. However, the effectiveness of these investments in driving sales growth and customer engagement in a competitive market will be important for the company's success. The retail expansion, particularly in the context of a global slowdown, carries risks but also the potential for capturing market share if consumer confidence rebounds. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM FOURTH QUARTER 2023 HIGHLIGHTS 4Q 2023 INVOICED SALES AMOUNTED TO €84.1 MILLION, REFLECTING A DECREASE OF 27.8% COMPARED TO A STRONG 4Q 2022, WHICH BENEFITTED FROM A €16.9 MILLION REDUCTION IN BACKLOG.

(NYSE: NTZ) (“we”, “Natuzzi” or the “Company” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), one of the most renowned brands in the production and distribution of design and luxury furniture, today reported its unaudited financial information for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Pasquale Natuzzi, Chairman of the Group, commented: “Market conditions for the furniture industry have remained challenging during 2023. It's evident that the furniture industry faced extraordinary conditions in 2023, with major markets experiencing a significant slowdown in demand, following two consecutive strong years post-COVID. In this context, we continued investing to complete the transition to a lifestyle brand, with direct access to consumers through retail. This is a process I initiated about 20 years ago, which represented a profound transformation of the Group I founded 65 years ago as a manufacturing company, focused on the value segment of the market. Being globally recognized as a Brand in the high-end segment of the market and delivering a superior in-store customer experience has been a long journey that forced us to review our processes, competences, and industrial capabilities. I am now witnessing the progress of this hard work, which, in the current market conditions, is even more important to competing and reaffirming our leadership. Our team has been working with determination also to evolve our production and increase our operational agility, dealing with the industrial legacy of our origins. Drawing from my 65 years of experience, in times such as these, it's imperative to persevere in investment to strengthen our commercial core assets while pursuing restructuring initiatives; this is the agenda our management has been focusing on in 2023.” Antonio Achille, CEO of the Group, commented: “2023 has clearly been a challenging year for the overall industry. In the main markets of our operations, North America, China and Europe, the real estate, which is a primary source of new demand, has been stagnant, because of the negative economic situation and high interest rates. Consumers remained very prudent when it comes to invest in durable products. This has been reflected on our business, with a decrease in sales. In this context, we continue working and investing in the two fundamentals pillars for our transformation: completing the transition to a brand-life style and restructure our operations. On the commercial front, Natuzzi today has completed the transition to a brand / retail group. 92.2% of our sales comes from Branded and 61.7% comes from retail. These percentage were respectively 85.3% and 52.2% at the beginning of 2021. In 2023, with an acceleration in the last quarter, we have invested significantly to increase the control of our global retail and commercial operations. This has led to two initiatives, respectively aimed at improving the retail and the other at managing our galleries and wholesales business. To improve retail performance, we have established the Global Retail Division under the leadership of Diego Babbo, a manager with more than 20 years’ experience in Retail. This division is dedicated to modernizing and professionalizing our retail approach by developing tools to support our Regions and Dealers in enhancing the retail performances and elevate the in-store customer experience. We have standardized all retail related KPIs to accelerate the diagnosis of areas requiring immediate intervention to foster organic growth. Leveraging the experience we have matured in our direct stores, we now offer our franchising partners turn-key retail programs, which include IT systems, training, and guidelines on store layout, merchandising, and visuals. To improve the productivity of our DOS and Franchise partners we closed the tail of not performing stores. On the wholesale front, we introduced the Natuzzi Commercial Excellence Program. This program allows us to assign specific targets to each business account and drive commercial priorities for each of our 304 employees in the global commercial team. This constitutes a significant change in our way of working, which enables us to centrally manage and control the activities of our field force and independent dealers globally. In our search to become a consumer centric company, we introduced a Consumer CRM to maintain a constant dialogue between our stores and clients, serving also to increase loyalty and incentivize product repurchase. As a results of these investments and actions taken over the last 12 months, the control on our retail and wholesale business is now significantly stronger and we are confident that this will allow us to accelerate organic growth. In 2023, despite the negative market conditions, based on the confidence of our brand and retail project, we opened 9 DOS, of which 6 in North America, namely in San Diego, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Frisco. One notable new opening is the flagship in Manhasset situated in one of the most performing streets in Long Island. In addition, we opened 3 DOS managed by our JV in China. Today Natuzzi has 678 stores (DOS and FOS) around the world and 665 branded galleries. This constitutes a significant platform for organic growth and a distinctive competitive advantage. Among the 100 markets where we distribute our products, we have identified 3 strategic regions where to prioritize our future investment, namely the US, China, and Europe, with a focus on the UK and Italy. Let me provide an update on each of these three markets. In US, we opened 6 DOS, 1 FOS and 7 Natuzzi galleries. We reviewed the leadership organization to ensure focus on the two main components of our business: Lou Mossotti has been recently appointed to lead the retail, with Scott Kruger focusing on the development of our gallery and our wholesale business. We also strengthen our commercial team in the US, with the introduction of 14 new agents, reaching the total of 24 agents. Out of the 678 stores, 346 stores are located in China, of which 97 Natuzzi Italia and 249 Natuzzi Editions. We do not consolidate our China stores as they are part of our 49% stake in the joint venture (JV) we established in 2018. In 2023, we made significant investments to align the JV team with our modern retail approach and to ensure visibility into the JV's performance at a granular level within our IT system. This allows us to support the local JV team in enhancing performance through strategic choices in stores layout, merchandising, branding, and customer experience. Europe has been mostly exposed to the negative consumer dynamics in 2023. In UK, which is our largest market in Europe, we are working to reduce our presence in multi-brand distributors to focus and favor the performance of the 30 mono-brand stores, of which 13 Natuzzi Italia and 17 Natuzzi Editions. In Italy, we operate 78 stores, 12 of which are Directly Operated Stores (DOS), distributing our Natuzzi Editions collection under the historical local banner Divani & Divani by Natuzzi. We are working to elevate the positioning of our brand by leveraging the distinctive assets of our Group and collections, in contrast to local competitors who rely heavily on aggressive promotion and communication. On the restructuring front, we continued addressing the industrial legacy of the group, particularly in Italy, as we transition into a lifestyle brand with our brands positioned in the high/medium price segments of the market. This legacy includes large manufacturing facilities established during a time when Natuzzi had a significant output, producing across various price ranges and acting as a third-party producer. In 2023, we accelerated our restructuring, with €7.4 million one-off costs to reduce the workforce by 514 people. This resulted in a total reduction of 759 workers from 2021 to 2023, of which 266 workers from Italian factories and HQ. This, in total, represents a reduction of 17.5%, leading to €22.6 million in annual savings compared to 2021. We executed the staff restructuring, in compliance with our ethics standards and with the labor regulations of the different markets which are particularly restrictive in some geographic areas we operate, chiefly in Italy. In doing so, we always ensure that this operations have a break-even of 12-16 months and we measure their NPV on the mid-term. Following is a recap of the number of people involved in restructuring at Group level in the three-year period 2021-2023, the related costs and expected savings. 2021 2022 2023 Total People involved in restructuring (units) 91 154 514 759 Restructuring cost (€/mln) 1.0 2.6 7.4 11.0 Yearly saving -labor costs only- (€/mln) 3.6 5.7 13.3 22.6 €/mln At the same time, we have invested to introduce the competences which are needed to ensure the success of our brand retail business which include marketing, retail, merchandising, finance and IT, to better support growth activities and the digital transformation of the Company. *** 4Q 2023 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE 4Q 2023 consolidated revenue amounted to €84.1 million, from €116.5 million in 4Q 2022. 4Q 2023 were affected by the persisting macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges, resulting in a reduced consumers’ spending capacity and postponement of durable purchases. Furthermore, 4Q 2023 compares with a strong 4Q 2022 that benefitted from a €16.9 million reduction in post-COVID backlog. Excluding “other sales” of €2.4 million, 4Q 2023 invoiced sales from upholstered and other home furnishings products amounted to €81.7 million, compared to €113.4 million in 4Q 2022. Revenues from upholstered and other home furnishings products are hereafter described according to the main dimensions of the Group’s business: A: Branded/Unbranded Business B: Key Markets C: Distribution A. Branded/Unbranded business The Group operates in the branded business (with Natuzzi Italia, Natuzzi Editions and Divani&Divani by Natuzzi) and the unbranded business, the latter with collections dedicated to large-scale distribution. A1. Branded business. Within the branded business, Natuzzi is pursuing a dual-brand strategy: i) Natuzzi Italia, our luxury furniture brand, offers products entirely designed and manufactured in Italy and targets an affluent and more sophisticated global consumer with a highly inspirational collection that is largely the same across all our global stores to best represent our Brand. Natuzzi Italia products are almost exclusively sold in mono-brand stores (directly operated or franchises). ii) Natuzzi Editions, our contemporary collection, offers products entirely designed in Italy and produced in different plants strategically located to best serve individual markets (mainly China, Romania and Brazil). Natuzzi Editions products are distributed in Italy under the brand Divani&Divani by Natuzzi, which is manufactured in Italy to shorten the lead time to serve the Italian market where the brand is distributed. The store merchandising of Natuzzi Editions, starting from a common collection, is tailored to best fit the opportunities of each market. The Natuzzi Editions products are sold primarily through galleries and selected mono-brand franchise stores. In 4Q 2023, Natuzzi’s branded invoiced sales amounted to €75.3 million, compared to €103.9 million in 4Q 2022. In the context of declining consumer spending and postponement of durable purchase, Natuzzi Italia has been affected strongly given its premium positioning versus Natuzzi Editions. The following is the contribution of each Brand to 4Q 2023 invoiced sales: Natuzzi Italia invoiced sales amounted to €26.6 million, from €51.8 million in 4Q 2022. As anticipated, in the current generalized context of declining consumer spending and postponement of durable purchase, Natuzzi Italia has been strongly affected given its premium positioning. In addition, 4Q 2023 compares to a strong 4Q 2022, which benefitted from about €8 million of backlog reduction. In China, sales continued to be affected by the overstock and negative economic and industry-specific momentum reported by our JV in China, whereas Europe still struggles with a difficult macroeconomic context and geopolitical instability. Natuzzi Editions invoiced sales (including invoiced sales from Divani&Divani by Natuzzi) amounted to €48.7 million, from €52.1 million in 4Q 2022. Specifically, while the Divani&Divani by Natuzzi sales were affected by a more aggressive competitive arena in Italy, Natuzzi Editions sales were flat compared to 4Q 2022, thanks to the 6 Natuzzi Editions stores opened in the US between the second part of 2022 and 2023, whose overall productivity increased in 4Q 2023, offsetting the weak performance in other regions. A2. Unbranded business. Invoiced sales from our unbranded business amounted to €6.4 million in 4Q 2023, from €9.5 million in 4Q 2022. The Company’s strategy is to focus on selected large accounts and serve them with a more efficient go-to-market model. B. Key Markets Below is a breakdown of 4Q 2023 upholstery and home-furnishings invoiced sales compared to 4Q 2022, according to the following geographic areas. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Delta € Delta % North America 25.9 30.6 (4.7) (15.4%) Greater China 7.1 10.5 (3.4) (32.1%) West & South Europe 24.5 41.1 (16.6) (40.4%) Emerging Markets 11.8 16.6 (4.9) (29.2%) Rest of the World* 12.4 14.6 (2.1) (14.6%) Total 81.7 113.4 (31.7) (27.9%) Figures in €/million, except percentage. *Include South and Central America, Rest of APAC. The performance of invoiced sales in North America was curbed mainly by the weak performance of the wholesale channel, as distributors continue to be focused on reducing their stock rather than placing new orders. In Greater China, the furniture industry continues to face persistent challenges, driven by a more prudent consumers’ willingness to invest in durables and the difficulties of the real estate market. Additionally, the joint venture is actively working to reduce the inventory of Natuzzi Italia products accumulated during 2022, thus leading to a reduced level in new orders. In China, we are stabilizing the organizational structure with the aim to improve the performances as well as focusing on the upgrade of the store concepts to provide a more comprehensive store experience. Lastly, we are harmonizing the merchandising offer to better represent the Natuzzi DNA while addressing the customers’ local taste. C. Distribution During 2023, the Group distributed its branded collections in 110 countries, according to the following table. Direct Retail FOS Total retail stores as of Dec. 31, 2023 North America 21 (1) 8 29 West & South Europe 33 101 134 Greater China 21 (2) 325 346 Emerging Markets ─ 75 75 Rest of the World 4 90 94 Total 79 599 678 In an effort to continuously improve the productivity of our DOS and Franchise partners we closed the tail of not performing stores. The Group also sells its branded products by means of 665 points of sales located in five continents, encompassing mostly shop-in-shop galleries (including 12 Natuzzi Concessions, i.e., store-in-store points of sale directly managed by the Mexican subsidiary of the Group). (1) Included 3 DOS in the U.S. managed in joint venture with a local partner. As the Natuzzi Group does not exert full control in each of these DOS, we consolidate only the sell-in from such DOS. (2) All directly operated by our joint venture in China. As the Natuzzi Group owns a 49% stake in the joint venture and does not control it, we consolidate only the sell-in from such DOS. FOS = Franchise stores managed by independent partners. During 4Q 2023, Group’s invoiced sales from direct retail, DOS and Concessions directly operated by the Group, amounted to €19.2 million, compared to €22.2 million in 4Q 2022. In 4Q 2023, invoiced sales from franchise stores amounted to €31.3 million, compared to €46.6 million in 4Q 2022. We continue executing our strategy to evolve into a Brand/Retailer and improve the quality of our distribution network. The weight of the invoiced sales generated by the retail network (Direct retail and Franchise Operated Stores, or FOS) on total upholstered and home furnishings business in 4Q 2023 was 61.7% compared to 60.7% in 4Q 2022 and 51.5% in 4Q 2019. The Group also sells its products through the wholesale channel, consisting primarily of Natuzzi-branded galleries in multi-brand stores, as well as mass distributors selling unbranded products. During 4Q 2023, invoiced sales from the wholesale channel amounted to €31.3 million, compared to €44.6 million in 4Q 2022 and €46.4 million in 4Q 2019. 4Q 2023 GROSS MARGIN During 4Q 2023, net of restructuring costs, we had a gross margin of 36.2%. The decrease in sales between 4Q 2023 and 4Q 2022 resulted in a higher incidence of fixed costs on sales, which has been partially offset by increased efficiency in the average consumption of raw materials, improved brand and channel mix, as well as pricing discipline. Indeed, 4Q 2023 cost of labor included €5.1 of one-off extraordinary costs connected to the reduction plan of workers, especially within the Italian factories. The application of the related accounting principle imposed us to accrue the overall restructuring cost as soon as the corresponding liability arises, the majority of which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023, while all the benefits will be reflected starting from 2024. We will continue to go in this direction, as the increase in the Group’s flexibility to enhance gross margin is among our top priorities of our plans. 4Q 2023 OPERATING EXPENSES During 4Q 2023 we have reduced the operating expenses (which include selling expenses, administrative expenses, other operating income/expenses, and the impairment of trade receivables) by €8.7 million, passing from (€41.3) million in 4Q 2022 to (€32.6) million in 4Q 2023. While the Company is focused on decreasing those discretionary costs that are not directly connected to sales, the limited turnover reported in the quarter have hindered its ability to effectively absorb fixed costs. Consequently, this has led to an increase in the percentage weight of the overall operating expenses in relation to revenue. Specifically, the overall €8.7 million reduction is mainly due to the following: ─ a €8.4 million reduction in transportation costs, as result of renegotiation of transportation rates and lower volume delivered; ─ a €1.2 million reduction in custom duties due to fewer products manufactured in Asia. Such reduction in costs was partially offset by: ─ a €0.7 million increase due to one-off costs in connection to the staff reduction plan at the HQ in Italy, and ─ a €0.2 million increase in amortization following the DOS openings in 2023. The Company will continue to focus on reducing selling and administrative expenses also in 2024, by renegotiating contracts with suppliers, reviewing its staff allocation at retail level, and by reviewing its overall processes, looking for further efficiency. 4Q 2023 NET FINANCE INCOME/(COSTS) During 4Q 2023, the Company accounted for (€2.8) million of Net Finance costs compared to Net Finance costs of (€4.8) million in 4Q 2022. Rising interest rates continue to adversely impact our results principally in terms of increased interest expense of rental contracts as well as third-party financing, notwithstanding the outstanding bank debt in the quarter on average decreased compared to 4Q 2022. KEY RESULTS: FULL YEAR 2023 During 2023, the Company reported the following results: ─ Total revenue of €328.6 million, compared to €468.5 million in 2022. ─ We had a gross margin of 34.3%, from 35.1% and 29.7% reported in 2022 and 2019, respectively. 2023 gross margin also includes (€6.3) million of restructuring costs connected to the overall reduction plan of workers at Group level. ─ Depreciation and amortization for the period, which also include the depreciation charge of right-of-use assets related to the operating leases and accounted for in the cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses, amounted to €22.4 million in 2023, compared to €21.7 million and €25.1 million in 2022 and 2019, respectively. ─ We had an operating loss of (€9.5) million, compared to an operating profit of €8.5 million in 2022 and an operating loss of (€22.5) million in 2019. 2023 operating loss of (€9.5) million includes (€7.4) million of extraordinary costs to reduce the number of workforce, and specifically: within the cost of sales, the above-mentioned (€6.3) million of labor-related restructuring costs; within selling and administrative expenses, a (€1.1) million of labor-related restructuring costs in connection to the reduction plan of employees in Italy. ─ Net Finance costs were (€8.5) million, mainly as a result of rising interest rates, compared to Net Finance costs of (€5.2) million in 2022 and net finance costs of (€9.9) million in 2019. ─ We had a loss after tax for the period of (€16.2) million, which compares to a profit after tax of €1.3 million in 2022 and to a loss after tax of (€33.7) million in 2019. BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW During 2023, €3.2 million of net cash were provided by operating activities as a result of: ─ a loss for the period of (€16.2) million; ─ adjustments for non-monetary items of €26.9 million, of which depreciation and amortization of €22.4 million; ─ a €0.7 positive contribution from working capital change, mainly as a result of a €8.0 million decrease in the inventory level, a €9.8 million decrease in trade receivables and other assets, partially offset by a (€11.2) million decrease in trade payables and other liabilities, and (€4.4) million for payments connected to the reduction of workforce; ─ interest and taxes paid for (€8.3) million. During 2023, (€7.9) million of cash were used in investing activities, as a result of (€11.8) million of net capital expenditure partially offset by €3.0 million collected from our JV in China at the beginning of the year following the share capital reduction, and a €0.9 million of public grant received by the Italian Government in connection with the modernization plan of the Italian factories. In the same period, (€15.7) million of cash were used in financing activities, mainly due to the repayment of long-term borrowing for (€8.7) million, (€6.7) million for short-term borrowing repayment and (€11.1) million for lease-related payments, partially offset by the €10.9 million of new financing, namely €6.4 million as subsidized loans in connection with a program of public incentives aimed at upgrading the Italian plants and €4.5 in favor of our Romanian subsidiary. As a result, as of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents was €33.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had a net financial position before lease liabilities (cash and cash equivalents minus long-term borrowings minus bank overdraft and short-term borrowings minus current portion of long-term borrowings) of (€6.6) million, compared to €7.9 million as of December 31, 2022. ******* CONFERENCE CALL The Company will host a conference call on Monday April 8, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time (4.00 p.m. Italy time, or 3.00 p.m. UK time) to discuss financial information.

The company's commitment to quick and safe power restoration is highlighted, with 1,000 crews working through the weekend. Avangrid's extensive interstate network allows for efficient deployment of resources during weather emergencies, showcasing their dedication to customer service and community support. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The deployment of extensive resources by Avangrid to restore power in the aftermath of the Nor'easter storm is indicative of the company's operational resilience and its commitment to service restoration. From an investor's perspective, the quick mobilization of 103 lineworkers and 81 tree crews, among other support staff, demonstrates Avangrid's robust emergency response capabilities. This is essential for maintaining customer trust and minimizing financial repercussions associated with prolonged outages.However, investors should also consider the financial implications of such emergency operations. While the immediate customer service benefits are clear, the costs associated with deploying additional resources can impact the company's short-term financials. The extent of these costs and their effect on the company's quarterly earnings should be monitored. Furthermore, the frequency of these weather events could prompt a reassessment of the company's long-term infrastructure investment strategy, potentially leading to increased capital expenditures aimed at bolstering grid resilience. Risk Management Expert Avangrid's response to the power outages caused by the Nor'easter highlights the importance of risk management and disaster preparedness in the utility sector. The collaborative effort across state lines within Avangrid's network showcases an effective risk mitigation strategy that leverages the company's multi-state presence. For stakeholders, this approach not only ensures operational continuity during crises but also serves as a case study for evaluating the company's governance practices in managing unforeseen events.From a risk assessment perspective, the proactive deployment of resources to address the power outages may also serve to mitigate potential regulatory scrutiny and customer dissatisfaction. However, the recurring nature of severe weather events raises questions about the long-term sustainability of such reactive measures. Investors may look for more proactive investments in infrastructure hardening and smart grid technologies that could reduce the frequency and severity of future disruptions. Environmental Sustainability Analyst Avangrid's involvement in restoring power in Maine following the Nor'easter is not only operationally significant but also aligns with its identity as a sustainable energy company. The swift action reinforces its commitment to environmental responsibility and community support, which are increasingly important to socially conscious investors. The deployment of resources reflects the company's preparedness for climate-related disruptions, a factor that is critical for long-term sustainability in the energy sector.While the immediate environmental impact of the storm is a concern, the broader implications for Avangrid's sustainability goals should be considered. The resilience of the power grid to extreme weather conditions is a key component of sustainable infrastructure. Investments in renewable energy sources and grid modernization could be accelerated as a result of these incidents, potentially enhancing the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable energy and providing long-term value to shareholders. 04/05/2024 - 05:16 PM More than 100 lineworkers, 81 tree crews from Avangrid’s Connecticut subsidiary United Illuminating working with hundreds of Central Maine Power crews to restore power to 230,000 impacted customers B-roll linked HERE; soundbites linked HERE ORANGE, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avangrid, Inc. (NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and member of the Iberdrola Group, has deployed 103 lineworkers, 81 tree crews, 41 bucket and digger derrick trucks, and 45 support staff, including damage assessors and crew guides, from its Connecticut subsidiary United Illuminating to Maine. UI crews are working hand-in-hand with more than hundreds of other line and tree crews in restoration efforts after a powerful Nor’easter knocked out power to nearly 350,000 customers earlier this week. 1,000 crews will be working through the weekend to restore power. “During powerful storms like this Nor’easter, all Avangrid companies, including Central Maine Power and United Illuminating, are committed to doing whatever it takes to restore power to our customers as quickly and as safely as possible,” said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. “By tapping into our extensive interstate network of dedicated field professionals, Avangrid is uniquely positioned to deploy our resources across the Northeast to meet weather emergencies wherever and whenever they arise. I thank the men and women of UI for working tirelessly with the dedicated CMP team to restore power to our Maine communities in need.” The crews deployed from UI include internal line and service crews, external line crews, external tree crews and internal supervisors, damage assessment crews, crew guides, and storekeepers. While UI faced minor impacts from the same storm system, line crews restored power to all UI customers before deploying to Maine. They have joined hundreds of other line and tree crews working along CMP who have been working around the clock in severe conditions caused by the heavy snow and high winds, including battling damaged and fallen trees, broken poles, and downed power lines. Together, internal and external crews have already restored power to nearly 140,000 customers since the storm began on Wednesday, and they anticipate they will work throughout the weekend to restore remaining customers affected by the storm. The collaborative storm response effort is part of Avangrid’s multi-state network of resources to assist its hardest hit service areas to bolster response times. The company deployed similar assistance of personnel and equipment during the historic flooding event in December 2023 and during Hurricane Lee in September 2023. About Avangrid: Avangrid, Inc.

MV Oil Trust Announces Trust First Quarter Distribution,2024-04-05T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"MV Oil Trust (NYSE: MVO) declared a quarterly distribution of $3,795,000 or $0.330 per unit for the period ending March 31, 2024, with positive financial data.","MV Oil Trust Announces Trust First Quarter Distribution Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary MV Oil Trust (NYSE: MVO) declared a quarterly distribution of $3,795,000 or $0.330 per unit for the period ending March 31, 2024, with positive financial data. Positive MV Oil Trust (NYSE: MVO) announced a distribution of $3,795,000 or $0.330 per unit for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. Volumes for the period were 146,612 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) with an average price of $69.82 per BOE. Net profits for the period amounted to $5,024,202, with $4,019,362 applicable to the Trust's 80% interest. Total cash proceeds available for the Trust after expenses were $3,795,000. The distribution will be payable on April 25, 2024, to unitholders of record on April 15, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent distribution announcement by MV Oil Trust indicates a significant payment to unitholders, which is reflective of the Trust's performance over the past quarter. The distribution of $0.330 per unit is a concrete figure that investors can use to gauge the Trust's profitability and efficiency in capital management. Analyzing the given data, the cost management appears to be effective, with net profits of $5,024,202 from gross proceeds of $10,236,574 after costs of $5,212,372.Moreover, the average price per BOE (Barrel of Oil Equivalent) of $69.82 suggests a favorable market condition for oil and gas during the quarter. This price point, coupled with the volume of 146,612 BOE, has led to substantial gross proceeds. Investors should note that the oil and gas sector is highly cyclical and sensitive to global economic factors, which can significantly affect prices and, consequently, the profitability of trusts like MVO. Energy Market Analyst From an energy market perspective, the average price of $69.82 per BOE reported by MV Oil Trust is indicative of the current state of the oil market. This price is influenced by a myriad of factors including geopolitical events, supply and demand dynamics and OPEC policies. The volume of 146,612 BOE suggests stable production levels. However, investors should be aware of the potential volatility in the energy sector, as changes in the market can rapidly affect prices and production economics.Additionally, the absence of a reserve for capital expenditures in this report could be a point of interest. It could imply that the Trust is currently not setting aside funds for future development or maintenance, which may affect long-term sustainability and production capabilities. Stakeholders should consider the implications of such a strategy on future distributions and the overall health of the Trust. 04/05/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MV Oil Trust (NYSE: MVO) announced the Trust distribution of net profits for the quarterly payment period ended March 31, 2024.

Tax Law Expert The adoption of a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan by CarParts.com is a strategic move to safeguard the company's valuable tax attributes. Tax attributes, which include net operating losses and tax credits, can provide significant financial advantages, such as reducing taxable income in future periods. The Plan aims to prevent an unintended 'change of ownership' as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could restrict the company's ability to utilize these attributes.The issuance of purchase rights, which become exercisable under certain conditions, serves as a defensive mechanism against hostile takeovers. This dilutive effect protects the tax attributes by discouraging any single entity from acquiring a substantial ownership stake. For existing and potential investors, the Plan could maintain shareholder value by preserving the company's tax benefits. However, it's also essential to consider that such plans can sometimes be viewed as anti-takeover measures that may deter beneficial acquisitions. Corporate Governance Analyst The Board's decision to adopt a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and issue rights to shareholders is a governance action with implications for shareholder rights and corporate control. From a governance standpoint, the Plan reflects the Board's proactive stance in managing the company's assets, in this case, its tax attributes. The rights serve as a 'poison pill', a common tactic used by companies to prevent or discourage takeover attempts that the Board deems not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders.While the Plan is set to be voted on by shareholders, its interim implementation without immediate shareholder approval raises questions about the Board's autonomy and the balance of power between the Board and shareholders. Investors should be aware of the potential for the rights to alter the power dynamics within the company, as they could significantly impact the outcome of any potential takeover attempts. The governance aspect of such a Plan is a double-edged sword, offering protection while potentially limiting shareholder influence over certain corporate decisions. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan for CarParts.com are multifaceted. On one hand, preserving the tax attributes can enhance the company's financial position by allowing it to offset future taxable income, thereby potentially improving net income and cash flows in the long term. This can be favorable for the stock price as it reflects an improved financial outlook.On the other hand, the market's reaction to the announcement of such a Plan can be mixed. While it signals the Board's intent to protect assets, it can also be perceived as a lack of openness to mergers or acquisitions, possibly limiting the company's strategic options. The Plan's impact on the stock market will depend on investors' assessment of these opposing factors. From a valuation perspective, analysts must consider the potential value of the tax attributes against the opportunity cost of forgoing possible acquisition premiums. 04/05/2024 - 05:26 PM TORRANCE, Calif., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CarParts.com, Inc. (the ""Company"") announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the ""Plan"") intended to preserve the value of certain of the Company's tax attributes (the ""Tax Attributes""). As of December 30, 2023, federal and state Tax Attributes were $105,224 and $84,780, respectively. However, these Tax Attributes may be materially reduced or eliminated by a ""change of ownership"" of the Company under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (a ""change of ownership""). In general, a change of ownership would occur if stockholders that own (or are deemed to own) at least 5 percent or more of the Company's outstanding common stock increased their cumulative ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. As part of the Plan, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchase right (the ""rights"") on each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 16, 2024 to holders of record as of the close of business on April 16, 2024. Shares of the Company's common stock issued after the record date will be issued together with the rights. The rights are not currently exercisable and initially will trade only with the Company's common stock. However, if any person or group acquires 4.99% or more of the Company's common stock, or if a person or group that already owns 4.99% or more of the Company's common stock acquires additional shares, then, subject to certain exceptions, the rights would separate from the common stock and become exercisable for shares of the Company's common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price, resulting in significant dilution to the ownership interests of the acquiring person or group. The Plan includes a procedure pursuant to which the Company's Board of Directors may consider requests to exempt acquisitions of the Company's common stock from the Plan if it determines that doing so would not limit or impair the availability of the Tax Attributes. The rights will expire on April 5, 2027. The rights may also expire on an earlier date upon the occurrence of other events, including a determination by the Company's Board of Directors that the Tax Attributes have been utilized or are no longer available, or that the Plan is no longer necessary to protect the Tax Attributes. The Plan also may be terminated at any time by the Company's Board of Directors before the rights become exercisable. The Company intends to submit the Plan for stockholder approval at its 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. If stockholder approval of the Plan is not obtained prior to the first anniversary of the date of the adoption of the Plan, the Plan will expire on the close of business on such date. The Plan is similar to Tax Benefits Preservation Plans adopted by many other public companies with significant Tax Attributes. The issuance of the rights will not affect the Company's reported earnings or loss per share and is not taxable to the Company or its stockholders. Additional information regarding the Plan will be set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A that the Company is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ELI-007 and ELI-008 AMP vaccination results in significantly increased immune response compared to conventional vaccines. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The development of ELI-002 and its ability to induce cytotoxic mKRAS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is a significant advancement in oncological immunotherapy, particularly for pancreatic and colorectal cancers. The induction of a durable T cell response with increased memory phenotype suggests a potential for long-term immunity against tumor recurrence. Moreover, the observed antigen spreading could enhance the body's ability to fight cancer by recognizing and attacking a broader range of tumor-specific antigens, beyond the initial target of mKRAS mutations.From a clinical perspective, the lack of induced regulatory T cell responses is promising, as these cells can suppress immune responses and facilitate tumor growth. The lymph node-targeted design of ELI-002 might be more effective in activating the immune system than traditional vaccines, as it directly engages the lymph nodes, which are critical in initiating and regulating immune responses. The upcoming presentation of Phase 1 clinical data will be closely watched for evidence of clinical efficacy and safety profiles, which are vital in determining the vaccine's potential impact on patient care. Medical Research Analyst The preclinical studies of ELI-007 and ELI-008, which show a marked increase in immune response compared to conventional vaccines, signal a breakthrough in the field of cancer vaccine research. These vaccine candidates target mutations in the BRAF and p53 genes, which are common in various solid tumors, suggesting a broad therapeutic potential. The AMP technology's ability to enhance the immune response could transform the current landscape of cancer immunotherapy.As an analyst, the translational aspect of this technology from preclinical to clinical stages will be key in assessing its viability as a therapeutic option. The scalability, production costs and integration into existing treatment protocols will also play a critical role in its adoption. The potential benefits of these vaccines include not only improved patient outcomes but also the possibility of reducing the overall cost of cancer care by preventing relapse and reducing the need for more aggressive treatments. Market Research Analyst The positive outcomes from Elicio Therapeutics' immunotherapy research could have significant implications for the company's market position. The focus on hard-to-treat cancers with high relapse rates, such as pancreatic and colorectal cancers, addresses a substantial unmet medical need, which could lead to rapid adoption and significant market share if clinical trials demonstrate clear benefits. Additionally, the broad applicability of the AMP technology to target shared mutations in solid tumors might open up new market segments for the company.Investors will likely monitor the interim data release of the 7-peptide ELI-002 formulation in the second quarter of 2024. Positive data could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the company's stock value. Conversely, any setbacks could have a negative impact. It is essential to consider that the biotechnology sector is highly volatile and investment decisions should be based on comprehensive analysis of clinical data and market potential. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM 68% of patients treated with ELI-002 developed cytotoxic mKRAS-specific CD4+ T cells84% of patients treated with ELI-002 developed cytotoxic mKRAS-specific CD8+ T cellsThe majority of ELI-002-treated patients tested had antigen spreading where induced T cells targeted additional patient-specific tumor mutations beyond mKRASThe majority of patients who received a ELI-002 booster dose were observed to have durable mKRAS-specific T cell response with increased memory T cell phenotype Preclinical studies of ELI-007 and ELI-008 demonstrated that AMP vaccination resulted in a 42-fold to a several-hundred-fold increased immune response when compared to conventional vaccines Initial ELI-002 7P clinical data expected to be presented in the second quarter of 2024 BOSTON, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elicio Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ELTX, “Elicio Therapeutics” or “Elicio”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced that it will be sharing pipeline updates for all investigational candidates at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting, taking place in San Diego, California from April 5-10, 2024. Among the data presented will be updated immunogenicity data from the ongoing Phase 1 (AMPLIFY-201) study of ELI-002, an off-the-shelf investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine for patients with mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma (“mKRAS”)-driven pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Preclinical data on vaccine candidates, ELI-007 and ELI-008, investigational peptide vaccines targeting BRAF and p53-driven cancers, respectively, will also be shared. In the first-in-human, Phase 1 (AMPLIFY-201) study, ELI-002 was given as adjuvant treatment for patients with high relapse-risk mKRAS-driven colorectal cancer (“CRC”) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”). A majority of patients who received the booster immunizations maintained or increased mKRAS-specific T cell responses relative to baseline. ELI-002 demonstrated several key advantages, including lymph node-targeted vaccine design, potent immunogenicity with balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, HLA-agnostic activity, and targeting of mKRAS antigens critical for tumor survival. The mKRAS-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells generated by ELI-002 exhibited increased cytotoxic function and development of favorable memory phenotype. Regulatory T cell responses were not detected. Antigen spreading was observed following ELI-002 vaccination, with patient-specific tumor neoantigen-directed T cell responses detected in the majority of evaluated patients using direct ex vivo immunogenicity assays. ""Earlier data published in Nature Medicine demonstrate that our off-the-shelf lymph node-targeted cancer vaccine candidate, ELI-002, induces memory T cell responses. With longer follow-up, we observed response durability and added antigen-spreading to the mechanism of ELI-002, where we saw additional personal neoantigen responses join together with mutated KRAS responses creating a precision response that may lead to enhanced clinical activity,” said Christopher Haqq, M.D., Ph.D., Elicio’s Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development, and Chief Medical Officer. “Following positive early findings from the 2-peptide formulation of ELI-002, we initiated a randomized Phase 2 study of our 7-peptide formulation, ELI-002 7P, in adjuvant pancreatic cancer (NCT05726864). We expect to share interim 7-peptide ELI-002 data from the Phase 1A arm in the second quarter of 2024.” Peter DeMuth, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Elicio Therapeutics, added, “These preclinical data demonstrate that ELI-007 and ELI-008 induce strong tumor antigen-specific T cell responses targeting BRAF and p53 mutations, respectively. ELI-007 and ELI-008 induced highly potent and functional T cell responses, often ten to a hundred-fold higher than comparator. These data build on previous data showing that the AMP strategy can improve the potency of vaccine immunotherapy by delivering vaccine components directly to the lymph nodes, the ‘command center’ of the immune system. These data support the broad applicability of the technology and represent promising therapeutic product opportunities targeting mutations shared in a large fraction of human solid cancers.” Poster Presentation Summary Presentation Title: Durable immunogenicity of ELI-002 2P in AMPLIFY-201: Lymph node targeted mKRAS-specific amphiphile vaccine in pancreatic and colorectal cancerSession Title: First-in-Human Phase I Clinical Trials 1Session Date and Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, 1:30 PM – 5:00 PM PT ELI-002 2P consists of 2 Amph-modified mKRAS peptide antigens, Amph-G12D and Amph-G12R (Amph-Peptides 2P), and an Amph-modified immune-stimulatory oligonucleotide adjuvant (Amph-CpG-7909).ELI-002 2P was administered as an adjuvant treatment for patients with high relapse-risk mutant KRAS PDAC and CRC.25 patients received ELI-002 2P at 1.4 mg of Amph-Peptides 2P and Amph-CpG-7909 at 5 escalating dose levels: 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg.Peripheral blood and circulating tumor DNA (“ctDNA”) or serum tumor antigen were collected longitudinally to assess T cell immunogenicity and reductions in clinical tumor biomarkers.A majority of patients who received ELI-002 booster immunizations maintained or increased mKRAS-specific T cell responses relative to baseline. Durable responses were associated with increased memory T cell phenotype compared to baseline.ELI-002 induced increased mKRAS-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells with cytotoxic function, associated with increased memory phenotype in a majority of patients.CD4+ T regulatory cells were not induced after ELI-002 2P immunization.Antigen spreading was observed with T cell responses to patient-specific tumor mutations (not mKRAS) after ELI-002 2P vaccination in a majority of patients tested.Data demonstrated several advantages of ELI-002 including lymph node-targeted vaccine design, potent immunogenicity with durable and balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, increased T cell cytotoxic function, and antigen spreading to induce T cells targeting additional tumor mutations beyond mKRAS. Presentation Title: AMP-peptide vaccination against mutant BRAF epitopes promotes lymph node delivery to generate potent, functional T cell immunitySession Title: Vaccines, Antigens, and Antigen Presentation 1Session Date and Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, 9:00 AM – 12:30 PM PT Our preclinical program, ELI-007, is an investigational multivalent lymph node–targeted AMP peptide vaccine comprised of the V600E and V600K mutant antigens, developed to target BRAF gene mutations.AMP-immunization generated robust in vivo immune responses yielding strong T cell activation against mBRAF epitopes.Lymph node-targeted AMP-vaccination resulted in a 19-fold increase in immune response after only 3 doses and a 42-fold increase after 5 doses when compared to conventional comparator vaccines.Induced T cells were polyfunctional exhibiting the production of multiple effector cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL2, GM-CSF) as well as cytotoxic molecules (Granzyme B) important in the lysis of tumor cells.Substantial populations of mBRAF-specific T cells were found patrolling peripheral organs like the lung, which is one of the predominant sites for metastatic spread in melanoma and colorectal carcinoma. Presentation Title: AMP-peptide vaccination against multiple p53 mutant epitopes promotes lymph node delivery to generate potent, functional T cell immunitySession Title: Vaccines, Antigens, and Antigen Presentation 1Session Date and Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, 9:00 AM – 12:30 PM PT Our preclinical program, ELI-008, is an investigational multivalent lymph node–targeted AMP peptide vaccine developed to target p53 hotspot mutations.AMP-immunization generated robust immune responses yielding strong T cell activation against common p53 hot spot mutations (R248W, R248Q, R175H, R273H, R273C, R282W, G245S, Y220C, C135Y, R158H, H214R).Potent T cell responses were observed after only two doses with AMP-p53 R248W, which were further improved after a third bi-weekly dose. For multiple p53 mutations, ELI-008 demonstrated a several-hundred-fold increase over conventional comparator vaccines.Induced T cells were polyfunctional exhibiting production of multiple effector cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL2, GM-CSF) and showed high cytotoxic potential by secreting large quantities of Granzyme B and effectively killing target cells in vivo.Substantial populations of p53-specific T cells were found patrolling peripheral organs like the lung, which is one of the predominant sites for the metastatic spread of many cancers. About ELI-002 Our lead product candidate, ELI-002, is a structurally novel investigational AMP cancer vaccine that targets cancers that are driven by mutations in the mKRAS-gene—a prevalent driver of many human cancers. ELI-002 is comprised of two powerful components that are built with our AMP platform consisting of AMP-modified mutant KRAS peptide antigens and an AMP-modified CpG adjuvant that is available as an off-the-shelf subcutaneous administration. ELI-002 2P (2 peptide formulation) is currently being studied in an ongoing Phase 1 (AMPLIFY-201) trial in patients with high relapse risk mKRAS-driven solid tumors, following surgery and chemotherapy (NCT04853017). ELI-002 7P (7 peptide formulation) is currently being studied in a Phase 2 (AMPLIFY-7P) trial in patients with mKRAS-driven pancreatic cancer (NCT05726864). The ELI-002 7P formulation is designed to provide immune response coverage against seven of the most common KRAS mutations present in 25% of all solid tumors, thereby increasing the potential patient population for ELI-002 and potentially reducing the chance of bypass resistance mechanisms. About ELI-007 and ELI-008 Our preclinical programs, ELI-007 and ELI-008, are being evaluated in studies funded by the Gastro-Intestinal (“GI”) Research Foundation with the aim of developing multivalent cancer vaccines targeting several mutations. ELI-007 is an investigational multivalent lymph node–targeted AMP peptide vaccine comprised of the V600E and V600K mutant antigens, which make up >95% of all BRAF-driven cancers in humans, representing up to 1.5 million cancer incidences worldwide each year. The BRAF gene is part of an intracellular signaling pathway that drives cell growth and division. BRAF mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and ultimately cancer. ELI-008 is an investigational multivalent lymph node–targeted AMP peptide vaccine developed to target p53 hotspot mutations. p53 is a tumor-suppressing protein that controls the cell cycle, DNA replication and cell division. Mutations in the p53 protein lead to uncontrolled tumor progression and growth. Similar to KRAS, p53 mutations are present in a broad spectrum of cancer types, accounting for >30% of solid tumors. In preclinical models, ELI-007 and ELI-008 have shown strong T cell activation and demonstrated strong induction of tumor-antigen-specific T cell responses.

BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Announces No Unit Payment for the First Quarter of 2024,2024-04-05T20:10:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) announced no dividend payment for Q1 2024 due to negative payment calculation. The Trust's revenue is based on daily Royalty Production and WTI Price.,"BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Announces No Unit Payment for the First Quarter of 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) announced no dividend payment for Q1 2024 due to negative payment calculation. The Trust's revenue is based on daily Royalty Production and WTI Price. Positive None. Negative No dividend payment for Q1 2024 due to negative payment calculation based on WTI Price and production costs. Financial Analyst The announcement by BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust of a zero dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, signifies a notable event for unitholders and potential investors. The lack of dividend distribution is directly tied to the underlying financial mechanics of the Trust, which are influenced by the volatile nature of commodity prices, in this case, crude oil. The Trust's revenue is contingent upon the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price surpassing the combined costs of chargeable costs and production taxes, a threshold which was not met this quarter. The negative average per barrel royalty of $(15.28) indicates that the production costs and taxes exceeded the revenue from oil sales by a substantial margin. This situation reflects broader market conditions that could be symptomatic of sector-wide issues such as increased operational costs or depressed oil prices. Investors might consider the implications of such a dividend cut as a signal to reevaluate the stability and future profitability of the Trust, particularly in light of the fluctuating nature of oil markets. Energy Market Analyst The data provided on the average WTI price, alongside the average adjusted chargeable costs and production taxes, paints a clear picture of the challenges faced by the oil industry, particularly in the context of the North Slope operations managed by Hilcorp. The average WTI price of $77.01, when set against the backdrop of average adjusted chargeable costs of $89.61, demonstrates the sensitivity of royalty trusts to price swings in the commodity markets. The negative royalty per barrel suggests that there are underlying inefficiencies or market pressures that are contributing to the Trust's inability to generate a positive cash flow. This could be of interest to stakeholders who track the operational performance and cost management of oil production entities. The average net production of 66.8 mb/d also provides an insight into the production scale and its potential impact on the Trust's ability to leverage economies of scale in future market conditions. 04/05/2024 - 04:10 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (NYSE: BPT) announced that unitholders will not receive a dividend payment for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The dividend information is as follows: Ex-Dividend Date: April 12, 2024 Record Date: April 15, 2024 Payable Date: None Dividend Rate: $0.00 per Unit As provided in the Trust Agreement, the quarterly royalty payment by Hilcorp North Slope, LLC to the Trust is the sum of the individual revenues attributed to the Trust as calculated each day during the quarter. The amount of revenue is determined by multiplying Royalty Production for each day in the calendar quarter by the Per Barrel Royalty for that day. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Per Barrel Royalty for any day is the WTI Price for the day less the sum of (i) Chargeable Costs multiplied by the Cost Adjustment Factor and (ii) Production Taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Per Barrel Royalty was calculated based on the following information: Average WTI Price $77.01 Average Adjusted Chargeable Costs $89.61 Average Production Taxes $ 2.69 Average Per Barrel Royalty $(15.28) Average Net Production (mb/d) 66.8 The average daily closing WTI price was below the “break-even” price for the quarter, resulting in a negative value for the payment calculation for the quarter. However, as provided in the Trust Agreement, the payment with respect to the Royalty Interest for any calendar quarter may not be less than zero.

WTX-518 shows tumor regression by resisting IL-18BP suppression, while WTX-712 activates tumor-specific T lymphocytes. Both candidates demonstrate potent immunotherapeutic effects in preclinical models. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The preclinical success of Werewolf Therapeutics' WTX-518 and WTX-712, as presented at the AACR meeting, is a promising development in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The ability of WTX-518 to selectively deliver active IL-18 within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and resist suppression by IL-18BP could represent a significant advancement in overcoming resistance mechanisms that have historically limited cytokine therapies. The induction of complete tumor regression in a mouse model suggests a strong potential for efficacy, though it's important to note that preclinical models do not always translate to human trials.WTX-712's unique mechanism of action, which involves the selective release of IL-21 to activate tumor-specific T lymphocytes, is particularly noteworthy. The comparison of IL-21 half-life extended (HLE) to IL-2 HLE therapy indicates a superior anti-tumor efficacy, especially in the context of resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. The ability to induce a strong anti-tumor phenotype and sustain the expansion of cytotoxic T cells could potentially offer a new therapeutic option for patients with refractory or immunologically unresponsive tumors.From a business perspective, these findings may attract investors' attention as they could lead to the development of novel and differentiated therapies in a competitive market. However, the transition from preclinical to clinical development is fraught with challenges and many candidates fail to demonstrate the same level of efficacy or safety in humans. Investors should consider the risks associated with the early stage of development and the significant investment required to bring such therapies to market. Biotech Market Analyst Werewolf Therapeutics' announcement has the potential to impact its business trajectory and stock performance. The oncology market is highly receptive to innovative treatments, particularly those that can address tumors unresponsive to current therapies. The company's focus on conditionally-activated cytokines could fill a niche within the broader immunotherapy space, which has been expanding rapidly.The emphasis on WTX-518 and WTX-712's ability to induce complete tumor regressions and their differentiated mechanisms of action could be a strategic move to differentiate Werewolf from its competitors. A successful transition to clinical trials and eventual FDA approval could position the company as a leader in next-generation immunotherapies. However, the market is also cognizant of the high attrition rates in drug development. The true test will come with clinical trial results, which will be critical in determining the future value of these assets.For stakeholders, the key factors to monitor include the progression to clinical trials, the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles in humans and the company's ability to secure the necessary funding and partnerships to advance these candidates. While the preclinical data is encouraging, the long-term impact on the company's financial health will depend on multiple variables, including the competitive landscape, regulatory hurdles and market adoption post-approval. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM WTX-518, a conditionally activated IL-18 INDUKINETM molecule that resists suppression by IL-18BP, led to complete tumor regressions in preclinical models WTX-712, a conditionally activated IL-21 INDUKINETM molecule has potent antitumor activity in preclinical models with a differentiated immune activation mechanism WATERTOWN, Mass., April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Werewolf Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company” or “Werewolf”) (Nasdaq: HOWL), an innovative biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of conditionally-activated therapeutics engineered to stimulate the body’s immune system for the treatment of cancer, is presenting preclinical data on development candidates WTX-518 and WTX-712 in posters at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, taking place April 5-10 in San Diego, California. “We are excited to share that both WTX-518 and WTX-712 demonstrate powerful immunotherapeutic effects in preclinical models,” said Daniel J. Hicklin, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Werewolf. “WTX-518 exhibits remarkable tumor-selective activation, resistance to IL-18BP and robust immune activation, overcoming key hurdles in the use of this promising cytokine in cancer therapy. WTX-712 acts through a unique mechanism that robustly activates tumor-specific T lymphocytes with an expanded therapeutic window through its selective release of wild-type IL-21 in the TME. These data collectively highlight the innovative strategies we are pursuing to further expand the repertoire of unique immune stimulating cytokine mechanisms in the fight against cancer.” Results highlighting WTX-518 findings are summarized in a poster titled, “Discovery of WTX-518, an IL-18 pro-drug that is conditionally activated within the tumor microenvironment and induces regressions in mouse tumor models” (Abstract #4074). Key takeaways reveal that WTX-518: is inducible, and its in vitro activity is not impeded by IL-18BP;selectively delivers active binding protein resistant (BPR) IL-18 to the tumor microenvironment (TME); andpromotes increased influx and activation of NK cells and polyfunctional CD8 T cells in the TME, and demonstrates complete tumor regression in the MC38 mouse tumor model. The WTX-712 data are summarized in a poster titled, “WTX-712, a conditionally active IL-21 INDUKINE™ molecule, induces a strong anti-tumor phenotype through a differentiated mechanism” (Abstract #4078). Key takeaways reveal that: WTX-712 demonstrates inducibility and antitumor activity with regressions in the MC38 mouse tumor model;IL-21 HLE (half-life extended) has superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to IL-2 HLE therapy in mouse tumor models that are highly resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, in part due to the activation of type-I IFN pathways; andIL-21 HLE promotes sustained expansion and activation of tumor infiltrating CD8 T cells with increased polyfunctionality and induces expression of cytotoxic effector molecules (Granzyme A, Granzyme B, and perforin). Both posters can be viewed in person from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, April 9, during the session category “Immunology” at Poster Section 4, and will be available on our website at https://investors.werewolftx.com/news-and-events/scientific-resources.

Bausch Health Announces Patent Lawsuit Against Amneal Pharmaceuticals,2024-04-05T22:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Bausch Health Companies Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Amneal Pharmaceuticals for seeking approval to market a generic version of XIFAXAN®. The litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act has been initiated, triggering a 30-month stay of potential FDA approval for Amneal's ANDA. Bausch Health remains confident in its XIFAXAN® intellectual property and continues to defend it.","Bausch Health Announces Patent Lawsuit Against Amneal Pharmaceuticals Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bausch Health Companies Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Amneal Pharmaceuticals for seeking approval to market a generic version of XIFAXAN®. The litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act has been initiated, triggering a 30-month stay of potential FDA approval for Amneal's ANDA. Bausch Health remains confident in its XIFAXAN® intellectual property and continues to defend it. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Legal Expert The initiation of a lawsuit by Bausch Health against Amneal Pharmaceuticals over the ANDA filing for a generic version of XIFAXAN® brings the complexities of pharmaceutical patent litigation to the forefront. This type of legal action is a common defensive strategy employed by brand-name drug manufacturers to extend market exclusivity and delay the entry of generic competitors. The invocation of the Hatch-Waxman Act, specifically the Paragraph IV Certification, is a critical event as it not only commences the litigation but also imposes a 30-month stay on the FDA's approval of the generic drug, which can significantly impact the market dynamics.The outcome of such lawsuits can have substantial financial implications for both parties involved. For Bausch Health, a favorable ruling would maintain its monopoly on the sales of XIFAXAN®, preserving significant revenue streams. Conversely, a ruling in favor of Amneal could accelerate market competition, potentially leading to reduced prices and profit margins for Bausch Health. Stakeholders should monitor this legal battle closely, as the final judgment could influence the company's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the lawsuit between Bausch Health and Amneal Pharmaceuticals is indicative of the broader trend in the pharmaceutical industry where brand-name companies fiercely protect their high-margin products. XIFAXAN® is a key product in Bausch Health's portfolio and the potential introduction of a generic version by Amneal could disrupt market shares. The 30-month stay provides a temporary shield for Bausch Health, but investors should consider the possibility of an earlier settlement, as seen in Bausch's past settlements with Teva, Sandoz and Sun.It's important to note that while the litigation is a defensive move for Bausch Health, the company's history of settlements suggests a strategic approach to managing generic competition. Settlements often result in a controlled entry of generics at a future date, which allows the original manufacturer to prepare for the revenue impact. The ongoing litigation with Norwich also adds a layer of uncertainty that investors should account for when evaluating Bausch Health's future revenue projections and market strategy. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Bausch Health's patent litigation against Amneal Pharmaceuticals hinge on the potential delay in generic competition for XIFAXAN®. Investors should be aware that Bausch Health's stock might experience volatility as the market reacts to each development in the lawsuit. The company's previous settlements with other generics manufacturers have likely been factored into the stock price to some extent, but the outcome of this new lawsuit could still sway investor sentiment.Assessing the potential impact on Bausch Health's revenue and earnings, the protection of XIFAXAN®'s patent could mean sustained high-margin sales for the duration of the stay and beyond, if Bausch prevails. However, should Amneal succeed in proving the patents invalid or unenforceable, the introduction of a generic could erode Bausch's market share and profitability. Long-term investors should consider the company's pipeline and ability to innovate beyond XIFAXAN® as a measure of resilience against such patent cliffs. 04/05/2024 - 06:15 PM LAVAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / April 5, 2024 / Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE:BHC)(TSX:BHC) along with its gastroenterology business, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., announced that it filed a lawsuit today in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC, Amneal EU, Limited, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Amneal Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This lawsuit follows receipt of a Notice of Paragraph IV Certification stating that Amneal submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval to market a generic version of XIFAXAN® (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets. Amneal asserts that certain patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for XIFAXAN® are unenforceable, invalid, and/or not infringed by Amneal's ANDA product. This action formally initiates the litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act and triggers a 30-month stay of any potential FDA approval for Amneal's ANDA.""Bausch Health remains confident in its XIFAXAN® intellectual property and we will continue to defend our XIFAXAN® franchise for the benefit of patients,"" Thomas J. Appio, CEO, Bausch Health said.

Negative Potential non-compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements due to delayed Annual Report filing may impact investor confidence and stock performance. Financial Analyst Receiving a non-compliance notice from Nasdaq is a significant red flag for investors, indicating potential internal issues within NeuBase Therapeutics, such as operational inefficiencies or financial discrepancies. It's essential to monitor how the market reacts to such news. A delay in filing an Annual Report can lead to increased volatility in the company's stock price as investors reassess risk profiles. The company's ability to submit a convincing compliance plan within the stipulated 60-day period will be critical. If they fail to do so, the risk of delisting could further impact investor confidence and liquidity of the stock. Legal Expert The notice from Nasdaq serves as a procedural reminder of the stringent regulatory environment public companies operate within. Non-compliance can lead to severe consequences, including delisting. However, it is important to note that the notice itself does not immediately affect the company's stock listing, which gives NeuBase a window to rectify the situation. The legal team at NeuBase must navigate the compliance landscape effectively to avoid further legal complications. Investors should be aware of the repercussions of non-compliance, such as potential investigations or fines, which could affect the company's financial health and operational capabilities.

It's important to analyze peer companies within the biotech sector to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader trend. The impact on NeuBase's reputation and its ability to attract future capital could be substantial. Investors might look at market sentiment and analyst ratings to gauge the long-term implications.

The split will not affect ownership percentage and is set to take effect on April 12, 2024, with trading on a split-adjusted basis starting April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is a strategic move that can have significant implications for a company's stock price and market perception. In the case of Marin Software Incorporated, the 1-for-6 reverse split is aimed at reducing the number of outstanding shares, which could potentially increase the stock price by a factor of six. However, this does not inherently add value to the company and should not be mistaken for an improvement in the underlying business fundamentals.From a financial analysis standpoint, the reduction in the number of authorized shares appears to be a measure to prevent dilution post-split. This could be viewed positively by investors who are concerned about share value erosion. However, the immediate impact on liquidity must be considered, as the reduced number of shares may result in lower trading volumes and potentially higher volatility. Investors should monitor how the market reacts to these changes post-split, as the initial reaction can sometimes differ from the long-term trend. Market Research Analyst Marin Software's decision to implement a reverse stock split often reflects a desire to appeal to institutional investors and to comply with stock exchange listing requirements. Companies with higher stock prices are typically seen as more stable and less speculative, which might attract a different investor base. This could also be a preemptive step to stay listed on the Nasdaq, as exchanges often have minimum bid price requirements.It's important to note that while the ownership percentage for existing shareholders remains unchanged, the psychological impact on retail investors can be significant. Some may perceive the reverse split as a red flag, signaling that the company is struggling to meet listing requirements or trying to artificially inflate its stock price. The market's reception of this reverse split will be a key indicator of investor confidence in Marin's future prospects. Securities Lawyer The legal implications of a reverse stock split include the need for clear communication and adherence to regulatory requirements. Marin Software has followed due process by gaining stockholder approval and providing detailed information in its definitive proxy statement. The company must ensure that the execution of the reverse stock split complies with SEC regulations, state corporate laws and Nasdaq listing standards.For shareholders, the rounding down of fractional shares to cash may have minor tax implications, as these transactions could be considered a realization event. Moreover, the change in CUSIP number is a routine administrative update that signifies the change in the structure of the stock but has no direct legal impact on shareholders or the company's obligations. 04/05/2024 - 04:00 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marin Software Incorporated (NASDAQ: MRIN), a leading provider of digital marketing software for performance-driven advertisers and agencies, announced that at its annual meeting of stockholders held today, stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split of Marin’s outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-4 and not more than 1-for-6, with the exact ratio to be set within that range at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and a proposal to reduce the number of authorized shares of Marin’s common stock from 142,857,143 to that number of shares equal to 142,857,143 multiplied by two times the stock split ratio. Marin’s Board of Directors has determined that the reverse stock split ratio will be 1-for-6 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split is expected to take effect at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 12, 2024 and Marin expects that its common stock will trade on a split-adjusted basis on at the opening of trading on April 15, 2024. Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every 6 shares of Marin’s issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock with any fractional amounts rounded down and paid in cash in lieu of the fractional amount. The Reverse Stock Split will reduce the number of shares of outstanding common stock from approximately 18.4 million to approximately 3.1 million. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of Marin’s common stock. At the opening of trading on April 15, 2024, Marin’s common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MRIN,” but will be assigned a new CUSIP number (56804T 304) and will trade on a split-adjusted basis. Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., Marin’s transfer agent, will provide instructions to registered stockholders regarding the process for exchanging their stock certificates.

The purchases were made at daily average prices ranging from SEK 215.303 to SEK 218.490, totaling SEK 5,074,759. The company now holds 733,850 treasury shares out of 172,096,305 outstanding shares. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent share repurchase activity by Millicom (Tigo) indicates a strategic move to manage capital allocation and potentially signal confidence in the company's future prospects to the market. Share repurchases can be a double-edged sword; on one hand, they can improve financial ratios such as earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which might lead to a higher stock price. On the other hand, they utilize cash reserves that could have been invested in growth opportunities or used to pay down debt.Considering the repurchase was made under the Safe Harbour Regulation, it suggests compliance with strict regulatory requirements, aimed at preventing market manipulation. The repurchase activity was executed at a time when the company holds a substantial number of treasury shares, which could be used for employee compensation plans or future acquisitions. Investors should monitor whether these repurchases will continue and how they align with the company's long-term strategy and capital deployment plans. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the repurchase of Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) by Millicom may reflect the management's belief that the stock is undervalued. The average price paid per SDR over the course of the repurchase period shows a slight variation, indicating a stable market perception during those days. It's important to analyze the repurchase in the context of the company's overall financial health, including its cash flow statements and balance sheets.Investors should consider the impact of the repurchase on the company's liquidity and leverage ratios. The financial opportunity cost of this buyback program must be weighed against potential alternative uses of capital, such as investment in new technology or market expansion, especially in the highly competitive telecommunications industry. Long-term effects on shareholder value will depend on how these repurchased shares are utilized moving forward. Corporate Governance Analyst The execution of a share repurchase program is often scrutinized for its implications on corporate governance. In Millicom's case, repurchasing shares could be perceived as a move to consolidate voting power or as a tactic to support the share price. The transparency provided in the press release, including a detailed breakdown of transactions, adheres to good governance practices and regulatory compliance, fostering trust among stakeholders.Shareholders should evaluate the alignment of this repurchase with the company's stated objectives and the interests of all shareholders. The repurchase activity should be seen in the broader context of the company's capital distribution policy, which includes dividends and other forms of shareholder returns. Understanding the board's rationale behind the timing and scale of the buyback could provide insights into the company's operational performance and strategic priorities. 04/05/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, April 5, 2024 – Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 27,945 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between April 2, 2024 and April 5, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

The rating reflects WATC's ownership by WAL and its favorable operating plan despite its short history and modest capitalization. Positive None. Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 04:01 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KBRA publishes its Issuer rating of BBB+ for Western Alliance Trust Company, N.A. (“WATC” or “the company”), an OCC-chartered, non-depository national trust bank that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: WAL; “parent company”), for which KBRA maintains a senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+. On November 17, 2023, KBRA assigned an Issuer rating of BBB+ to WATC on an unpublished basis. The Outlook for the rating is Stable. The Issuer rating of WATC is based principally on the company’s ownership, as well as the unconditional guarantee of its obligations, by ultimate parent, WAL. Accordingly, any changes to WAL’s ratings or the existing Stable Outlook for the parent company’s long-term ratings, would be accompanied by the same action for WATC’s rating. With this key credit consideration noted, despite WATC’s short operating history (which began during 2023), and modest capitalization ($52 million of equity at YE23) in comparison to WAL’s, we consider the subsidiary’s operating plan to be a favorable one. If operations are well executed as we currently expect, WATC’s financial contribution and strategic importance should increase over time. To access rating and relevant documents, click here.

Common stock of Powerfleet (PWFL) to remain listed and traded on Nasdaq Global Market during the 60-day grace period for compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Negative None. Financial Analyst The restatement of financial statements by Powerfleet, Inc. due to an accounting adjustment is a significant event that may raise concerns among investors about the company's financial controls and governance. The adjustment involves a non-cash charge that affects the net loss attributable to common stockholders and the equity section of the balance sheet. While the company asserts that there will be no adverse impact on key financial metrics such as revenue, net loss, cash flows, or adjusted EBITDA, the restatement may still lead to a reevaluation of the company's financial health by investors and analysts.From a valuation perspective, the restatement does not seem to directly affect the operational performance of the company, as the core financial results remain unchanged. However, investors typically expect transparency and accuracy in financial reporting and any restatement could potentially shake investor confidence, at least in the short term. The impact on the stock price will depend on how the market interprets the seriousness of the accounting issue and the company's ability to restore credibility.Furthermore, the late filing of the 2023 Form 10-K has triggered a notice from Nasdaq, which introduces a compliance risk. Although there is a 60-day grace period, failure to regain compliance could lead to further consequences, including delisting. This adds a layer of uncertainty for investors and could influence stock performance during this period. Accounting Expert Powerfleet's decision to restate its financial statements highlights the complexity of accounting for financial instruments such as convertible preferred stock. The redemption premium associated with this type of equity is a critical factor in determining the financial statement presentation. The adjustment indicates that the initial accounting treatment may have been inconsistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which govern financial reporting and are designed to ensure consistency and comparability across different companies.The restatement process itself is an arduous task that requires a thorough examination of past financial statements. It will involve the correction of the equity section, specifically the 'Convertible redeemable preferred stock' and 'Additional paid-in capital' accounts, which are key components of a company's capital structure. The non-cash nature of the charge suggests that there will be no cash outflow as a result of the restatement. However, it may affect certain ratios and metrics that investors use to evaluate the company's financial leverage and equity valuation.Lastly, the voluntary revision of financial statements to make other unrelated and immaterial revisions indicates a proactive approach by management to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial information. While these revisions are described as immaterial, they contribute to the overall integrity of the financial reporting process. 04/05/2024 - 06:36 PM WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Powerfleet, Inc. (Nasdaq: PWFL) today announced its intention to adjust its historical accounting treatment for the redemption premium associated with its Series A convertible preferred stock, which was fully redeemed in connection with the closing of the Company's business combination with MiX Telematics Limited on April 2, 2024, due to a technical accounting issue. This will result in the restatement of its financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, and for each of the interim periods during the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years. The technical accounting issue was identified during the final stages of the preparation for filing of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and has been determined by the Company to require adjustment to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In connection with the restatement, the Company expects to voluntarily revise the financial statements for the same periods to make other unrelated and immaterial revisions. This action follows a comprehensive review by the Company's management and audit committee. The company is working diligently to finalize the restatement process. The company is committed to completing this process as swiftly as reasonably possible and is well positioned to file the 2023 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2024. Key points of the restatement: Adjustment details: The change in the accounting treatment of the preferred stock results in a non-cash charge in arriving at ""Net loss attributable to common stockholders,"" an increase in ""Convertible redeemable preferred stock"" and a reduction in ""Additional paid-in capital.""No anticipated adverse impact on previous statements of operations, cash flows and adjusted EBITDA: The change in the accounting treatment of the preferred stock is not expected to adversely impact previously reported revenues, net loss, cash flows or adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and for each of the interim periods during the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.As a result of the Restatement, the Company was late in the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""2023 Form 10-K"") and received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying it that it did not timely file the 2023 Form 10-K, as required pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Under Nasdaq rules, Powerfleet has 60 calendar days from the date of the written notice to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Powerfleet's common stock will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Global Market during the 60-day grace period, subject to its compliance with the other continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market.

The venue includes regionally inspired bars and restaurants. The grand opening marks CDI's expansion into its 14th state, creating jobs and economic opportunities for the community. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The opening of the Terre Haute Casino Resort by Churchill Downs Incorporated represents a significant expansion within the gaming and hospitality industry, particularly for the regional economy of Indiana. The strategic placement of the casino is poised to attract a broad audience from the Midwest, potentially increasing tourism and local spending. The investment of $290 million signifies a considerable capital expenditure which could lead to an uptick in the company's operational costs in the short term but may result in increased revenue streams over time.With the addition of 1,000 slot machines and 36 table games, along with a sportsbook, the resort is diversifying its entertainment offerings. This diversification is key in creating multiple revenue channels, which could lead to a more resilient business model against economic fluctuations. The creation of nearly 550 permanent jobs also reflects positively on CDI's contribution to the local job market, possibly enhancing the company's reputation and social license to operate. Hospitality Industry Consultant The integration of a 122-room luxury hotel and various food and beverage amenities into the Terre Haute Casino Resort aligns with current trends in the hospitality sector, where experiential and destination-based offerings are becoming increasingly important. The resort's approach to integrating regionally inspired bars and restaurants caters to a growing consumer demand for authentic experiences. This could potentially result in a higher average spend per visitor and longer stays, which are critical metrics in the hospitality industry.Additionally, the timing of the full amenity opening, scheduled after the casino floor launch, allows for a phased approach to market entry. This can be beneficial for managing operational risks and optimizing the guest experience. The phased opening could also serve as an extended marketing strategy, keeping the venue in the public eye and potentially driving continued interest and visitation. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the Terre Haute Casino Resort, it is essential to consider the capital structure of Churchill Downs Incorporated. The $290 million investment will likely have been financed through a mix of debt and equity. The impact on the company's balance sheet should be carefully monitored, particularly the debt levels and interest coverage ratios. Investors should watch for the resort's performance metrics in upcoming quarters, as these will be indicative of the return on investment and the project's ability to service any incurred debt.The gaming sector is subject to regulatory risks and any changes in gaming laws could impact the resort's operations. However, entering the Indiana market represents geographic diversification for CDI, which could mitigate risks associated with market concentration. The long-term potential of the resort also hinges on the competitive landscape, as new entrants or expansions by existing competitors could influence market share. 04/05/2024 - 04:00 PM Casino Floor and Food & Beverage Amenities Open to the Public 122-Room Luxury Hotel to Open May 15 LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Churchill Downs Incorporated (“CDI” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: CHDN) announced today the opening of Terre Haute Casino Resort in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Agenus Announces Reverse Stock Split of Common Stock,2024-04-05T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Agenus Inc. announces a one-for-twenty reverse stock split to enhance financing flexibility and meet listing requirements. The split will be effective on April 12, 2024, maintaining the common stock's par value at $0.01 per share.","Agenus Announces Reverse Stock Split of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Agenus Inc. announces a one-for-twenty reverse stock split to enhance financing flexibility and meet listing requirements. The split will be effective on April 12, 2024, maintaining the common stock's par value at $0.01 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Agenus Inc. to implement a one-for-twenty reverse stock split is a strategic move that typically indicates an effort to shore up the stock price to meet exchange listing requirements. In this case, the objective is to maintain the company's listing on the Nasdaq Capital Markets and to align with the Russell Indices criteria. This is a common practice among companies whose share price has declined significantly.From a financial standpoint, reverse stock splits do not fundamentally alter a company's value, as the market capitalization remains consistent. However, it can have psychological effects on investors, who may perceive the higher stock price as a sign of improved health or prospects. The immediate impact often includes increased volatility as the market adjusts to the new price level. In the long term, the success of this maneuver will largely depend on the company's operational performance and its ability to capitalize on the perceived benefits of a higher stock price.For current shareholders, the reverse split is neutral in terms of their percentage ownership, barring the cash compensation for fractional shares. The cash payment for fractional shares is a minor detail but can be seen as a slight inconvenience for those affected. For potential investors, the new price point could either be a barrier to entry or an attractive entry point, depending on their perception of the company's future performance. Market Research Analyst A reverse stock split can be indicative of a company's current market position and its strategic approach to investor relations. Agenus Inc.'s decision to undergo a reverse split may be analyzed from a market trends perspective. Historically, reverse splits are often viewed with skepticism as they may signal underlying issues with the company's stock performance or a need to appease listing requirements. Nevertheless, they can also be perceived as a reset button, offering the company a chance to rebrand its financial image.The reaction of the market to such corporate actions can vary. Some investors might see the higher price as a new baseline and a sign of stability, potentially attracting institutional investors that have policies against investing in stocks below a certain price. For Agenus, aligning with the Russell Indices could increase its visibility and liquidity by being part of index funds' portfolios. It is important to monitor the stock's trading volume and price movement post-split to gauge the market's reception of this strategic move.In addition, the reverse stock split may affect the company's ability to raise capital. While a higher stock price can make the stock more appealing to certain investors, it could also reduce the stock's liquidity, making it more challenging to raise funds through future equity offerings. The long-term success of this strategy will be contingent upon Agenus' ability to leverage the reverse split to attract new investment and drive growth in its core business areas. 04/05/2024 - 04:30 PM LEXINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Agenus Inc. (Nasdaq: AGEN), a leader in discovering and developing novel immunological agents to treat various cancers, today announced its stockholders have approved a one-for-twenty reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, which will go into effect at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time on April 12, 2024.

Agenus expects that upon the opening of trading on April 12, 2024, its common stock will trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis under the current trading symbol “AGEN” and the new CUSIP number 00847G 804.

(CDTX) announced promising preclinical data on its drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) immunotherapies at the AACR Annual Meeting. The multispecific CD73/PD-1 DFC showed improved tumor reduction over PD-1 monotherapy, CCR5-targeting DFC demonstrated efficacy in colorectal cancer, and CBO421 outperformed oleclumab in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The recent advancements in immunotherapies using drug-Fc conjugates (DFCs) represent a significant stride in oncology. The development of a multispecific CD73/PD-1 targeting DFC is particularly noteworthy due to its multivalent approach, combining a small molecule CD73 inhibitor with a PD-1 inhibitor peptide. This strategy could potentially overcome the limitations of monotherapies by simultaneously blocking multiple pathways that tumors exploit to evade the immune system.Furthermore, the novel CBO421 DFC's ability to inhibit CD73 enzymatic activity and promote receptor internalization could offer a two-pronged mechanism to thwart tumor immune evasion. The comparison to oleclumab, an existing anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody, suggests that CBO421 may offer superior efficacy, which if translated clinically, could disrupt the current treatment landscape for triple-negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy Market Analyst The preclinical success of Cidara Therapeutics' DFCs could have substantial market implications. The potential improvement in treatment efficacy compared to current monotherapies addresses an unmet need in cancer treatment, particularly for patients with limited response to existing immune checkpoint inhibitors. The targeting of CCR5 in colorectal cancer, for instance, opens avenues for new therapeutic strategies in solid tumors.Investors should monitor the progress of these candidates towards clinical trials, as positive outcomes could lead to significant shifts in market share within the oncology sector. The company's proprietary Cloudbreak platform appears to be an asset not only for the rapid development of these DFC candidates but also as a potential source of licensing revenue or strategic partnerships. Biotech Patent Attorney The intellectual property landscape around DFCs is critical for securing a competitive edge in the biotech industry. The proprietary nature of Cidara's Cloudbreak platform and the novelty of their DFC candidates could provide strong patent protection. This protection is paramount in safeguarding research investments and ensuring exclusivity in the market upon potential FDA approval.However, the company must navigate the complex patent environment, which includes ensuring that their DFCs do not infringe on existing patents and that their own patents can withstand challenges. The robustness of their IP strategy could influence investor confidence and the company's valuation in the long term. 04/05/2024 - 03:00 PM - Multispecific CD73/PD-1 DFC demonstrates improved tumor reduction compared to PD-1 monotherapy in nonclinical study - CCR5-targeting DFC demonstrates potent efficacy in colorectal cancer mouse model - Late-breaking CBO421 data demonstrates improved efficacy compared to oleclumab in human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines SAN DIEGO, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDTX), a biotechnology company using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases, announced the company will deliver four poster presentations, including one late-breaking poster presentation, at this year’s American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting being held April 5-10, 2024 at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California. The presentations highlight data on the company’s multispecific CD73/PD-1 drug Fc-conjugate (DFC), its CCR5-targeting DFC, and CBO421, its lead oncology DFC candidate targeting CD73. “The preclinical data highlighted in our presentations at this year’s AACR meeting show the promise of our first-in-class or best-in-class DFCs to potentially improve treatment for a variety of cancers,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Cidara. “Our Cloudbreak platform has quickly produced DFC candidates effective in preclinical studies across various cancers with specific disease targets. This week, we are sharing data on our CCR5 DFC program for the first time, which has demonstrated robust efficacy as a monotherapy in mouse models of colorectal cancer. Targeting CCR5 has the potential to improve response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, which could have a greater impact for patients unresponsive to these current treatment options. Additionally, our multispecific CD73/PD-1-targeting DFC and CBO421, our lead CD73-targeting DFC, continue to demonstrate antitumor efficacy, and we look forward to further advancing these candidates toward the clinic.” Presentation details are summarized below: Abstract Title: Discovery of a multispecific CD73/PD-1 targeting Drug Fc-Conjugate (DFC), which improves tumor reduction compared to PD-1 monotherapy in a humanized mouse modelPresenter: James Levin, Ph.D.Date and Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, 1:30-5:00 PM PT Key Highlights: First-in-class CD73/PD-1 targeting DFC is comprised of a multivalent conjugate of a small molecule CD73 inhibitor stably linked to a proprietary human IgG1 Fc-fusion with a PD-1 inhibitor peptideMultispecific DFC demonstrated potent inhibition of tumor growth in a humanized mouse model and was more potent than PD-1 monotherapy Abstract Title: CBO421, a novel drug Fc-conjugate, inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD73 and triggers CD73 internalizationPresenters: Elizabeth Abelovski and Nicholas Dedeic Date and Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, 9:00 AM-12:30 PM PTKey Highlights: CD73 is a cell surface enzyme responsible for the production of adenosine, which is immunosuppressive and leads to immune evasion in solid tumorsAdenosine production can be inhibited therapeutically by enzyme inhibition and receptor internalization and subsequent degradationIn human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, CBO421 demonstrated potent and complete CD73 enzyme inhibition and robust CD73 receptor internalization in CD73 cancer cells, superior to oleclumab, an anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody Abstract Title: CBO421: A novel drug Fc-conjugate to prevent tumor immune evasion via the CD73/adenosine pathwayPresenters: Amanda Almaguer and Doug Zuill Date and Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, 1:30-5:00 PM PTKey Highlights: CBO421 demonstrated strong binding affinity and potent inhibition of both soluble and membrane bound CD73, differentiating it from monoclonal antibody CD73 inhibitorsThe candidate also exhibited high potency in functional cell-based assays and robust antitumor efficacy in a syngeneic mouse model Abstract Title: CCR5-001, a novel Drug Fc-Conjugate (DFC) targeting CCR5, demonstrates potent efficacy in a colorectal cancer mouse modelPresenter: Simon Döhrmann, Ph.D. Date and Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, 1:30-5:00 PM PTKey Highlights: CCR5 is expressed on multiple immune cells and can contribute to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, limiting response to immune checkpoint inhibitorsFirst-in-class CCR5-targeting DFC, CCR5-001, demonstrated potent CCR5 binding and functional inhibition of CCR5 signaling in cell-based assaysThe candidate also demonstrated robust efficacy as a monotherapy in a syngeneic colorectal cancer mouse model, representing a potential to target CCR5 with DFCs in solid cancers where pathology is driven by the CCR5/CCL5 axis About Cidara TherapeuticsCidara Therapeutics is using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop novel drug-Fc conjugates (DFCs).

Gray Announces Paydown of Debt,2024-04-05T16:18:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE: GTN) announced debt principal payments totaling $53.75 million, including required payments and voluntary prepayments. The company's financial results for the first quarter of 2024 are pending, with an expected report in early May.","Gray Announces Paydown of Debt Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE: GTN) announced debt principal payments totaling $53.75 million, including required payments and voluntary prepayments. The company's financial results for the first quarter of 2024 are pending, with an expected report in early May. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Gray Television's recent debt principal payments demonstrate a proactive approach to debt management. Paying down debt ahead of schedule can potentially save the company in interest expenses and improve its debt-to-equity ratio, a key indicator of financial health watched by investors. The $38.75 million voluntary payment on Term Loan E, which is due in 2026, suggests that Gray is generating sufficient cash flow to address its liabilities earlier than required. However, it's important to note that such strategic financial decisions may also indicate that the company currently lacks more lucrative investment opportunities to deploy its capital for higher returns. Investors should keep an eye on the upcoming first-quarter financial results for a clearer picture of Gray's operational performance and whether these debt payments align with a broader strategy of conservative financial management or a response to a lack of growth prospects. Market Research Analyst The media industry, where Gray Television operates, is highly competitive and capital-intensive. By making significant debt payments, Gray is likely positioning itself as a more stable and less leveraged entity in a market where agility is crucial. This could enhance its competitive stance, especially when negotiating with creditors or seeking new financing in the future. On the other hand, the market may interpret such early repayments as a signal that Gray is not pursuing aggressive expansion or acquisitions, which are common growth strategies in the media sector. Investors might benefit from understanding the company's long-term strategy, including how it plans to balance debt reduction with necessary investments to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving media landscape. Economist Gray Television's decision to prepay its debt obligations could be seen as a response to the broader economic context. If interest rates are expected to rise, early repayment locks in lower interest costs and shields the company from future rate hikes, which could be a savvy move in a tightening monetary environment. This action might also reflect management's confidence in their liquidity and operational efficiency, even if it does not immediately translate into stock market gains. In the long run, a stronger balance sheet could provide Gray with greater resilience against economic downturns and enable it to capitalize on opportunities that may arise during periods of market volatility. 04/05/2024 - 12:18 PM Atlanta, Georgia, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gray Television, Inc.

The change is effective from April 4, 2024, as per previous press releases. J. Duane Poliquin, Chair, announced the transition. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The delisting of Almaden Minerals Ltd. from the NYSE American and its transition to the OTCQB Marketplace signifies a strategic shift in the company's stock market presence. This move often corresponds with a company's need to meet different regulatory and financial reporting requirements that are less stringent on the OTCQB compared to the NYSE American. For investors, this could mean changes in the liquidity and visibility of Almaden's stock, which might impact trading volumes and the ease with which shares can be bought or sold.Furthermore, companies listed on major exchanges are typically subject to more rigorous scrutiny and perceived as more established; thus, a delisting might affect investor perception. It is important to monitor how this transition influences the company's stock performance in the following quarters, as it could affect investor confidence and the company's ability to raise capital in the future. Financial Analyst The shift of Almaden Minerals Ltd. to the OTCQB Marketplace may have financial implications for the company. Delisting from a major exchange like the NYSE American can be a cost-saving measure, as it reduces the regulatory and listing fees associated with maintaining a presence on such an exchange. However, it may also limit the company's exposure to institutional investors and restrict access to certain capital pools.Investors should consider the potential impact on the company's cost structure and its ability to attract investment. The company's future financial reports should be scrutinized for changes in capital expenditure, research and development investment and any shifts in strategic financial planning that may arise from the new listing environment. Securities Compliance Analyst Almaden's transition to the OTCQB Marketplace brings into focus the regulatory landscape of securities.

Why More Clinical Labs Are Turning to Whole-Genome Sequencing for Cancer,2024-04-05T16:45:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is gaining momentum in precision oncology, particularly in hematologic and pediatric cancers.

Illumina's Global Medical Director of Oncology highlights the significance of WGS in accurate diagnosis, classification, and therapy guidance for complex cancers. Recent studies showcase WGS's superiority over standard testing methods, emphasizing its potential in revolutionizing cancer care globally. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) into precision oncology represents a significant advancement in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. WGS's ability to analyze the complete genome allows for a more detailed understanding of cancer at a genomic level. This is particularly beneficial for classifying complex cancers such as acute myeloid leukemias, where the diversity of cancer cell genomics can be vast. The detailed genomic information provided by WGS can guide treatment decisions, potentially leading to more effective and individualized therapies for patients.Moreover, the global adoption of WGS, as seen with the UK's National Health Service, indicates a trend towards more widespread use in clinical settings. This could lead to a standardization of cancer care practices, with WGS becoming a more routine part of oncology diagnostics. However, the cost and complexity of WGS may limit its use to certain types of cancers and institutions, potentially creating disparities in cancer care. Medical Research Analyst The inclusion of WGS in clinical oncology is a testament to the technological advancements in the field of genomics. The additional diagnostic information provided by WGS, as cited in the March 2021 landmark paper, underscores its potential to enhance standard diagnostic methods like PCR, karyotyping and FISH. The 25% increase in diagnostic yield is significant and could lead to more accurate and timely diagnoses, which are critical for effective cancer treatment.From a research perspective, the data from WGS can contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology, potentially leading to the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The scalability and automation-friendly nature of WGS also suggest that it could become more cost-effective over time, making it more accessible to a broader range of healthcare providers and patients. Healthcare Economist The adoption of WGS in precision oncology has implications for healthcare economics. While the technology may offer superior diagnostic capabilities, it also comes with higher costs compared to traditional genomic testing methods. The decision by the UK's National Health Service to approve WGS at a national level is a bold investment in precision medicine, which may yield long-term cost savings through more targeted and effective treatments, reducing the need for more expensive or extensive care down the line.However, the initial investment in WGS technology and the training required for its use may pose financial challenges, especially for healthcare systems with limited resources. It is essential to consider the cost-benefit ratio and the potential impact on healthcare budgets, as well as the accessibility of such advanced diagnostics to all patient populations. 04/05/2024 - 12:45 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 5, 2024 / IlluminaThe adoption of WGS in precision oncology is on the rise. Plus: the promise of MRDOriginally published on Illumina News CenterWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) use is more established for rare and pediatric disease, but next-generation sequencing in clinical use for cancer consists of various approaches. In the last two decades since a targeted therapy was first approved for the EGFR mutation, comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, has become a gold standard for genomic assessment of cancer. CGP is a single next-generation sequencing assay that assesses hundreds of genes, including relevant cancer biomarkers, for therapy guidance. WGS is a comprehensive method for analyzing entire genomes-human, animal, plant, or disease-related microbes-and its use is restricted to certain cancer types as well as select top-tier academic settings worldwide.""Prior to therapy selection usage in the 2010s, genomics was, and still is, quite a potent diagnostic, classification, and prognostication tool in cancer,"" says Illumina Global Medical Director of Oncology Sugganth Daniel Pillei, MD.Whole-genome sequencing is applicable in specific types of cancer, such as blood cancers, pediatric malignancies, CNS malignancy, and sarcomas. Daniel explains: ""In hematologic malignancies, for example, that proportion of diagnostic and prognostic usage remains very high, because the amount of detail that is needed to accurately diagnose, classify, and risk-stratify leukemias is highly dependent on genomics and has become more so with time.""Classifying leukemias, such as acute myeloid leukemias, is more complex in part because blood cancer cells have highly diversified genomic lineages-but accurate classification and risk stratification determine the treatment regimen. ""In this context, WGS makes sense,"" Daniel says, ""because you need that broad suite of mutations and variants and genome-wide patterns to make up the picture of what the cancer is, in addition to pinpointing the therapy targets.""After blood cancers, which show the greatest clinical utility so far, pediatric cancers also benefit from the more comprehensive method. The combination of diagnosis, classification, and prognosis required in pediatric cancers dictates the need for whole-genome sequencing.CGP is a targeted panel that focuses on certain areas of the genome, whereas WGS looks across the board. ""Whatever we see in CGP, you're going to see on WGS, and much, much more,"" Daniel says. In fact, WGS pairs well with information that other testing provides, such as cytogenetics from karyotyping; and gene copy number changes, deletions, and amplifications through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing.Global adoption and programs In March 2021, a landmark paper from Eric Duncavage, David Spencer, and 25 others at Washington University School of Medicine showed that WGS yielded 25% additional diagnostic information over standard-of-care testing (PCR, karyotyping, FISH-each of which were done in different labs, making the logistics for WGS easier as well; WGS is also more amenable to automation and scalability).A recent paper in Nature demonstrated the utility of WGS in more than 13,000 tumors from Genomics England's 100,000 Genomes Project. The United Kingdom's National Health Service was the first to approve WGS at a national level, and the country has about seven regional labs that can run WGS. This adoption inspired similar national WGS initiatives in Germany, Sweden, and elsewhere-and the leading institutions in these countries (such as Karolinska Institute, part of Genomic Medicine Sweden, and Munich Leukemia Laboratory) are focusing on rare cancers, leukemias and lymphomas, and pediatric cancers.In 2023, the United States' National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended WGS for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a major step for precision oncology. That same year, Medicare Administrative Contractor MolDX approved reimbursement of WGS for AML.WGS and the MRD advantage Daniel came to Illumina to join the Oncology Medical Affairs group, where he focuses on work in molecular residual disease (MRD) testing, ctDNA-based assays, WGS, and other emerging applications in cancer. He coordinates with cross-functional teams to engage and host collaborations in cancer-related diagnostics in the US, Europe, and other regions. He is a board-certified molecular pathologist with extensive experience in establishing and directing molecular oncology and molecular genetics labs in academic institutions and in large reference labs.MRD testing assesses the potential risk for cancer recurrence and offers a method of detecting cancer relapse before standard modalities such as CT or MRI. It can also be used to assess the effectiveness of a cancer treatment for an individual by defining the state of the molecular disease at any point in time. To tell whether a treatment is working or not requires administering the test on two occasions-for example at the beginning of therapy or mid-regimen and at the completion of the regimen. If a patient's results move from positive to negative after therapy, it not only informs doctors that the treatment was effective, it provides that information much sooner (rather than having to wait two years after therapy has ended for a scan to reveal that the cancer has come back). MRD can also be used for surveillance or longitudinal monitoring in a setting where cancer patients have reached a state of remission and are in long-term follow-up.The bulk of available MRD data is on risk stratification, which is also its major use case. The technology is in its early stages, and standardization across providers in reporting and quantification is the subject of partnerships in various international consortia.This year, Illumina announced collaborations with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine and Bristol Myers Squibb to innovate on our MRD research assay, currently under development on a whole-genome backbone. The WGS MRD research assay will detect ctDNA for MRD assessment, allowing researchers to study cancer samples across multiple solid tumor indications. In contrast with existing MRD solutions with complex workflows, Illumina plans to develop a distributable clinical solution that will provide a cost-effective, highly sensitive, and automated workflow, with the potential to achieve a turnaround time of five to seven days.Collaborations with Roche, Pillar Biosciences, and many other oncology partnerships are helping build Illumina's portfolio of in vitro and companion diagnostics. With so many tests in development, it's paramount that the assays and instruments remain accessible and all-purpose. Illumina technology supports many stages across the cancer continuum and enables its users to provide solutions that aid in the management of cancer patients from research and early discovery to clinical care and beyond. This has been advantageous for large institutions using multiple instruments and platforms across many types of labs. If the technology can transfer between different labs in an organization, the work itself-sometimes under a single investigator-enjoys a smoother pathway. As Daniel puts it, ""The availability and use of the same platform and the same technology at different points facilitates better and faster results overall.""Come to our talk at AACR! At the annual American Association for Cancer Research meeting in San Diego, Illumina is sponsoring a spotlight talk on Sunday, April 7 from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. The session features speakers working across the continuum from discovery through clinical research: Working on discovery, Dr. Hussein Abbas from MD Anderson Cancer Center will discuss how the Illumina NovaSeq X Series is unlocking massive microenvironment and cell heterogeneity discovery power via single-cell sequencing.

GE Aerospace Board of Directors Authorizes Regular Quarterly Dividend,2024-04-05T16:02:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) announces a $0.28 per share dividend for shareholders, payable on April 25, 2024.","GE Aerospace Board of Directors Authorizes Regular Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags management dividends Rhea-AI Summary GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) announces a $0.28 per share dividend for shareholders, payable on April 25, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of GE Aerospace's dividend declaration is a key indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. A dividend payment, especially in the aerospace sector, which can be capital intensive, suggests a level of confidence in the company's cash flow and profit generation capabilities. The size of the dividend, $0.28 per share, should be compared with historical payments to assess if this reflects an increase, stability, or decrease in shareholder returns over time.Investors typically view regular and consistent dividend payments as a positive signal, often interpreting them as a company's strong performance and stable earnings. However, it is also important to consider the payout ratio, which indicates what proportion of earnings is being paid out as dividends. An excessively high payout ratio could be unsustainable in the long term, whereas a low ratio might suggest room for future increases in dividend payments or reinvestment in the business for growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend by GE Aerospace could influence investor sentiment and stock market performance. Dividends are often factored into the valuation models of stocks, with many investors seeking out dividend-paying stocks for the income they provide, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment.Moreover, the timing of the dividend declaration and the ex-dividend date are important for investors. The ex-dividend date is particularly important because it determines the cutoff for eligibility to receive the dividend. Investors must own the stock before the ex-dividend date to be entitled to the dividend payment. This can lead to increased trading volume before the ex-dividend date as investors position themselves to capture the dividend. 04/05/2024 - 12:02 PM EVENDALE, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) today declared a $0.28 per share dividend on the outstanding common stock of the Company. The dividend is payable April 25, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2024. The ex-dividend date is April 12, 2024.

Franklin Universal Trust (“FT” or the “Fund”) Announces Distribution,2024-04-05T15:43:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Franklin Universal Trust (FT) declares a monthly distribution of $0.0425 per share from net investment income, payable on April 30, 2024.

The Fund aims to offer high current income while preserving capital, with a secondary goal of income growth through dividends and capital appreciation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Franklin Universal Trust regarding its monthly distribution from net investment income is of particular interest to income-focused investors and analysts monitoring the fixed income market. The distribution amount of $0.0425 per share is a tangible figure that can be used to calculate the fund's yield, which is important for comparing the investment against other income-generating assets. It's important to observe how this yield stacks up against the current interest rate environment and inflation rates to assess the real return to investors.One must also consider the sustainability of these distributions. The Fund's ability to maintain or increase its distributions is contingent upon the performance of its underlying investments, which are not specified in the announcement. A diverse and high-quality portfolio is essential to support consistent payouts, especially during market volatility. Any significant changes in the payout ratio could signal shifts in the Fund's investment strategy or its earnings performance, which are key factors for long-term value. Market Research Analyst The secondary objective of the Franklin Universal Trust to achieve growth of income through dividend increases and capital appreciation suggests a strategy that aligns with investors seeking not just current income but also long-term growth potential. This dual focus can be appealing in a diversified portfolio, balancing immediate returns with the prospect of capital gains.However, potential investors should be aware of the economic context in which these distributions are being made. In a rising interest rate environment, for instance, the value of the Fund’s existing fixed-income securities might decline, which could impact capital appreciation. Conversely, if rates stabilize or decrease, the Fund's strategy could become more attractive. Understanding the Fund's asset allocation and how it might be affected by macroeconomic factors is essential for a comprehensive investment analysis. Economist From an economic perspective, the distribution announcement by Franklin Universal Trust offers an insight into the broader economic picture. Fixed-income investments like those managed by the Fund are influenced by overall economic health, interest rates and inflation. The Fund's emphasis on preservation of capital indicates a conservative approach, which might be more attractive to risk-averse investors, particularly in uncertain economic times.It's also noteworthy that past distributions are not indicative of future trends, a disclaimer that reflects the unpredictable nature of investment income. Economic cycles, regulatory changes and market disruptions can all impact the Fund's performance. Investors should consider these factors, alongside the Fund's distribution history, when evaluating the potential for future income and capital appreciation. 04/05/2024 - 11:43 AM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Universal Trust [NYSE: FT] today announced a monthly distribution from net investment income of $0.0425 per share, payable on April 30, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 17, 2024 (Ex-Dividend Date: April 16, 2024). The Fund’s primary investment objective is to provide high, current income consistent with preservation of capital. Its secondary objective is growth of income through dividend increases and capital appreciation. Distributions may vary based on the Fund’s net investment income. Past distributions are not indicative of future trends. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s distribution policy.

The sale surpasses the $150 million asset sale guidance, showcasing NGL's commitment to portfolio optimization and focus on reliable produced water management.","NGL Energy Partners LP Announces Sale of the New Mexico Ranches Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL) completes the sale of its North and South Ranches in New Mexico, generating approximately $70.0 million in proceeds. The sale surpasses the $150 million asset sale guidance, showcasing NGL's commitment to portfolio optimization and focus on reliable produced water management. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of the North and South Ranches by NGL Energy Partners LP represents a strategic move to streamline the company's operations and focus on its core business of produced water management. The proceeds of approximately $70 million, when viewed in conjunction with the cumulative asset sales exceeding $150 million, indicate a significant liquidity infusion. This could potentially be used to reduce debt, reinvest in core operations, or return value to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases.From a financial perspective, such asset sales may result in a more focused business model, potentially leading to operational efficiencies and cost savings. However, it is important to assess the impact on revenue streams and whether the divestment aligns with the company's long-term growth strategy. Shareholders and potential investors should monitor how the proceeds are allocated, as this will influence the company's financial health and future performance. Environmental Sustainability Analyst NGL Energy Partners LP's emphasis on environmental sustainability and the management of produced water in its operations is reflective of the broader industry trend towards responsible resource management. The sale of the ranches and the mention of sustainability suggest that NGL is attempting to balance its economic objectives with environmental considerations.Investors with an interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors should take note of NGL's commitment to sustainability. This could enhance the company's reputation and potentially attract a growing segment of socially responsible investors. However, it is important to scrutinize the actual environmental impact of NGL's operations beyond public statements to ensure that their practices align with their sustainability claims. Energy Sector Market Analyst NGL Energy Partners LP operates within the competitive and volatile energy sector, particularly in the production and management of water solutions. The sale of the New Mexico ranches located in the Delaware Basin—a key area for oil and gas exploration—could signal a strategic pivot or consolidation within this sector. The Delaware Basin is known for its significant oil and natural gas reserves and NGL's focus on its water solutions business may be a response to the growing demand for water management services in hydraulic fracturing operations.Understanding the market dynamics of the Delaware Basin and the broader energy sector is essential for evaluating the potential impact of the sale. If NGL can capitalize on the increasing need for produced water management, it may secure a competitive advantage. However, the energy sector's susceptibility to regulatory changes and fluctuating commodity prices should be considered when assessing the long-term implications of this transaction. 04/05/2024 - 12:46 PM TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL) (“NGL,” or the “Partnership”) announced today that it has completed the sale of its North and South Ranches.

Financial Analyst The filing of the Universal Registration Document by PHAXIAM Therapeutics with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers represents a significant disclosure of the company's financial health and governance practices. Investors and analysts closely examine such documents to gauge a company's performance and strategic direction. The inclusion of the annual financial report within this filing provides an opportunity to assess the company's profitability, revenue streams and expense management over the past fiscal year.Moreover, the report on corporate governance offers insights into the company's leadership and decision-making structures, which are essential for evaluating management effectiveness and potential risks. This information can influence investor confidence and, consequently, the company's stock price. It is a common practice for publicly traded companies to make these documents readily accessible and PHAXIAM's compliance with this transparency is a positive indicator for corporate governance.

The company has bought a total of 19,772,737 shares for €501,756,956.50, holding 4.01% of the total issued share capital. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Stellantis N.V.'s recent announcement regarding the progress of its share buyback program is an indicator of the company's financial strategy and confidence in its intrinsic value. Share buybacks can often signal to the market that a company believes its stock is undervalued. The repurchase of shares can also be a method to return value to shareholders, as it typically increases earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding.However, the impact of such programs on the stock price is not always immediate or predictable. While buybacks can provide support for the stock price in the short term, they can also reduce the cash available for other uses, such as investment in growth opportunities or debt reduction. In the context of Stellantis, the scale of the buyback (€1 billion) suggests a significant commitment to this strategy.Investors often view share buybacks as a positive move, but it's essential to consider the opportunity cost and the company's long-term strategy. For instance, if Stellantis is foregoing investment in new technologies or expansion into new markets, the long-term growth potential of the company may be affected. Thus, while the buyback may be seen as a positive in the short term, its long-term implications should be carefully considered. Financial Analyst Examining the details of Stellantis' share buyback program, one can discern the financial implications for the company's capital structure and shareholder value. The repurchase of 19,772,737 common shares for a total consideration of €501,756,956.50 represents a substantial financial undertaking. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company is effectively increasing the ownership stake of remaining shareholders and could potentially improve return on equity (ROE).Additionally, the average market purchase price provides insight into the company's valuation metrics during the buyback period. The average price paid per share can be compared to the company's historical stock performance and industry benchmarks to assess whether the buyback was conducted at a favorable price point.It's notable that the company holds 4.01% of the total issued share capital in treasury, which could be used for future strategic purposes such as employee compensation plans or future buybacks. The decision to hold a significant portion of shares in treasury reflects a flexible approach to capital management, which can be advantageous in responding to changing market conditions. 04/05/2024 - 12:05 PM Weekly Report (March 29- April 4, 2024) on the First Tranche of Stellantis 2024 Share Buyback Program AMSTERDAM, April 5, 2024 - Stellantis N.V.

Earning a spot means that IHG Hotels & Resorts has surpassed rigorous benchmarks, establishing itself as one of the country's best places to work. To determine the 100 Best Companies to Work For, Great Place To Work® analyzed the anonymous survey responses of more than half a million employees from Great Place To Work Certified™ companies with at least 1,000 workers. Companies also submitted essays describing their efforts to offer generous and innovative support for workers, which were validated against employee survey responses. Rani Hammond, Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Americas, IHG Hotels & Resorts, said: ""This ranking serves as an important benchmark as we continue to create a performance-led culture at IHG, leveraging the power of our exceptional talent to deliver on our goals and priorities as a business. I'd like to thank all our colleagues for their commitment and care and for sharing their perspectives on what makes IHG a great place to work.

In a challenging economy, many companies reduce investments in their people and scale back goals for diversity, equity, and inclusion. But these companies, the 100 Best, relentlessly pursue a better work experience for every employee, and if anything, double down on the employee experience regardless of title, tenure, gender, or ethnicity. These companies know this is how you increase performance, productivity, and your innovation velocity when your firm needs it the most.""

Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 11:38 AM Upcoming ISG Provider Lens™ reports will guide enterprises evaluating providers of application development services and platforms that help improve business performance STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, has launched a research study examining providers of next-generation application development and maintenance (ADM) services and low-code/no-code development platforms aimed at boosting business agility and improving customer experience. The study results on ADM services will be published in a series of comprehensive ISG Provider Lens™ reports, called Next-Gen ADM Services, scheduled to be released in October. The geographically focused reports will cover providers offering services including agile application development, application managed services, application quality assurance, continuous testing and AI-enabled application development and maintenance. At the same time, ISG will publish a second report, Next-Gen ADM Solutions, covering providers of low-code and no-code (LCNC) development tools. Enterprise buyers will be able to use information from the reports to evaluate their current vendor relationships, potential new engagements and available offerings, while ISG advisors use the information to recommend providers to the firm’s buy-side clients. ADM services leverage software capabilities to integrate across all business layers, generating new data sources and achieving enterprise agility. Meanwhile, user-friendly low-code and no-code (LCNC) development platforms allow even users without software development backgrounds to configure and develop applications. “Harnessing the potential of ADM services and LCNC solutions, enterprises can now fast-track application development with unprecedented efficiency,” said Iain Fisher, director, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Our studies showcase vendors and service providers empowering businesses with the agility to adapt and thrive in a digital-first environment.” For the Next-Gen ADM Services study, ISG distributed surveys to nearly 100 ADM service providers. Working in collaboration with ISG’s global advisors, the research team will produce six quadrants representing the ADM services the typical enterprise is buying, based on ISG’s experience working with its clients. The quadrants are: Agile Application Development Outsourcing, evaluating providers that offer ADM expertise spanning the complete application development and management landscape, covering large and highly complex application environments that can span multiple geographic locations, technology layers and development stages. Agile Application Development Projects, assessing providers of agile application development services with clearly defined scope. These providers usually offer specific knowledge and skills for projects that vary from small mobile applications to large solution implementations, with typical engagements lasting less than 18 months. Application Managed Services, evaluating service providers that manage clients’ defined application portfolio in production. Services include application support, enhancements, platform upgrades, security, bug fixes, and troubleshooting. The quadrant also assesses providers’ capability to integrate AI and GenAI into the managed services lifecycle. Application Quality Assurance covers providers of comprehensive quality assurance programs that can encompass a client’s entire application portfolio. These programs may include assessments, design, implementation, and managed services, and they should offer training for developers, testers and operators. Continuous Testing Specialists, assessing providers of automated testing services for continuous application testing, delivering quality with the speed of agile development. Providers should offer large-scale testing and continuous integration for complex systems, such as ERP and e-commerce, with test cases to demonstrate their abilities. AI-enabled Application Development and Maintenance (AI-ADM), evaluating providers using technologies such as ML, natural language processing (NLP) and AI- and GenAI-based tools to enhance application development by minimizing repetitive and manual tasks. Reports will cover the global next-gen ADM services market and examine services available in Brazil, Asia Pacific, Europe and the U.S. ISG analysts Akhila Harinarayan (Asia Pacific and the U.S.), Pedro L. Bicudo Maschio (Brazil), and Oliver Nickels (Europe) will serve as authors of the reports. For the Next-Gen ADM Solutions study, ISG has distributed surveys to more than 80 providers of these platforms. Providers will be evaluated against two quadrants: Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP), evaluating global vendors of application development platforms targeting professional developers that use drag-and-drop interfaces with minimal coding requirements and promising faster application development, deployment and provisioning. Vendors also offer guidance and training. No-Code Development Platforms (NCDP), assessing global software vendors offering application development platforms targeting citizen developers, featuring drag-and-drop interfaces emphasizing ease of use. These platforms enable users to provision applications without coding knowledge, leveraging their understanding of business requirements. ISG analyst Akhila Harinarayan will serve as author of this global report. A list of identified providers and vendors and further details on each study are available in these brochures: ADM Services and ADM Solutions. Companies not listed as providers can contact ISG and ask to be included in either study.

Enterprise customers wishing to share their experience about a specific provider or vendor are encouraged to register here to receive a personalized survey URL. Participants will receive a copy of this report in return for their feedback.

Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 10:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 5, 2024 / RayonierOriginally published on Rayonier.comRayonier purchased its first forest property in Nassau County, Florida, in the late 1930s. Since then, it has had a strong presence in the county. Company leaders reflect on our past and future in Nassau County.Ever since Rayonier bought its first forest property in Nassau County, Florida, in the 1930s, our stories have been intertwined. Together, we have strived to be the best stewards of our community and the land within it.As Nassau County celebrates its bicentennial this year and Rayonier prepares to celebrate its centennial in 2026, Rayonier leaders reflect on the 87-year history of Rayonier in Nassau and our vision for the company's future here.It's a topic that excites everyone on our team-our voices are warm with pride when we talk about how we helped the community recover from the Great Depression and how we've adapted and evolved over the decades.In 2017, we built our company headquarters at Wildlight, even further solidifying our relationship with the community.Over the years, a unifying ethic has emerged and only grown stronger: this company, through its leaders and team members, considers itself a corporate citizen of Nassau, with a responsibility and a commitment to contribute to the community's well-being.Healthy Economic Growth Since 1937Mike Bell, Rayonier's Vice President of Public Affairs, describes our company's relationship with Nassau County as one built around economic growth and constant reinvention. Mike looks to the past to illustrate how this legacy was built.When Rayonier first came to Nassau in 1937, the local economy had been devastated by the Great Depression. At that time, the community relied on a small number of agricultural products to survive. When Rayonier built a manufacturing plant on Amelia Island, it diversified Nassau's economy and created high-paying jobs that strengthened the community.At first, the War Production Board took over the manufacturing plant to help make nitrocellulose, which was used in explosives, bullets, and rocket propellants during World War II. And as in many communities, that assistance in wartime production helped to stabilize the County's economy.Later, when Rayonier was able to use the facility as a pulp and paper mill as it had originally intended, the local economy began to flourish. For one thing, those manufacturing jobs were some of the highest-paying jobs in the County. But there was also an indirect economic impact throughout the supply chain.""Rayonier helped sustain the region because we drew timber supply from a large radius,"" says Mike. ""That supported a lot of folks-tree growers, loggers, trucking companies-even if they weren't working at the plant.""In the 1930s, Rayonier also entered the timber business in the region when we began to buy land throughout Northeast Florida to ensure a steady supply of wood for our mills. We started a cycle that continues today: planting, harvesting and replanting our pine forests to provide a sustainable resource.""Through our dedicated reforestation efforts, we are now growing our fourth generation of trees on much of our property in Nassau County,"" Mike says.Together, the mills and the well-managed forests helped Nassau County increase its tax base and create a foundation for healthy economic growth.Rayonier has changed over time and now we no longer own manufacturing plants. We spun the pulp mills out into a separate public company now known as RYAM, but those mills are still operating and sustaining the County through taxes and high-paying jobs. They also support the timber industry in the region.Now, we continue to grow timber, own and operate a real estate subsidiary and are involved in a number of non-timber related businesses on our land base.""Rayonier is still here because we keep reinventing ourselves,"" says Mike.Reinvention may be in our nature at Rayonier, but certain principles have remained consistent throughout our history. One of these, Mike says, is Rayonier's legacy of promoting sustainable economic growth in the communities where it operates-and that's especially true in Nassau County.Sustainable Forests Support NassauDirector of Operations Jeremy Flood leads our Coastal Resource Unit, which manages timberland in and around Nassau County. He says it can be difficult for people to realize the economic impact forestry continues to have in the region.""You might not see it when you drive around on the paved roads,"" Jeremy says. ""But if you take a bird's eye view of the County, you see mostly forests and Rayonier owns a significant portion of those undeveloped areas.""Today, we own 121,000 acres in Nassau County, which has roughly 415,000 acres of land altogether. Much of our land is timberland that we manage for a sustainable supply of wood over the long term.""We're just now cutting the trees we planted when I started my career,"" Jeremy says. ""Forestry is unique because it takes that kind of forward thinking to provide for the future.""Jeremy credits Rayonier with giving him early insight into the industry. His family moved to Nassau County when he was young, and he got to know several Rayonier employees as he joined the community.""I found forestry in part because I had this influence of Rayonier folks-they were people I respected and looked up to,"" he says. ""It's been a rewarding career. In forestry, you're managing what's naturally on the landscape, using wisdom and science to organize it and make it efficient.""Jeremy is proud to be a forester because of the many benefits to natural ecosystems. With modern science-based management practices, our forests provide clean water, clean air and critical wildlife habitat, all while supplying society with important products like lumber, plywood and paper.""I hope people see a lot of the good that's already been done here by Rayonier,"" Jeremy says of Nassau County. ""And I hope in the future they'll see the six or eight generations of forestry still happening behind the scenes.""Some Nassau County residents are already able to see behind the scenes as customers with Rayonier's Hunting & Recreation Program.In this program, Rayonier land is open to residents and visitors to Nassau for hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and foraging. Currently, we have more than 900 customers in Nassau who are accessing our land to enjoy the outdoors with family and friends.Wildlight: Sustainable Community DevelopmentIn 2007, Rayonier's relationship with Nassau entered a new chapter when the County's leadership approached our company to establish a public-private partnership, the result of which is the Wildlight development. At that time, population growth was on the horizon and the County wanted to be prepared.Local leaders didn't want to sit back and watch as developers capitalized on Nassau's growth rate, buying up smaller parcels of land and developing them in a haphazard way with no thought to the bigger picture.Instead, they asked Rayonier, one of the County's largest landowners, to work with them on a whole-landscape plan to prepare for inevitable population growth. This way, the County could follow a methodical, strategic approach-planning for residential neighborhoods, schools, police stations, parks and more in a logical way.Rayonier's leaders were excited to work with the County.""I've been in this business for 30 years and you rarely see this happen in development,"" says Chris Corr, Rayonier's Senior Vice President of Real Estate Development. ""It's uncommon to have the opportunity to think on this larger scale, but because of Rayonier's land ownership that's what we've been able to do.""Chris, a Florida native, says the vision for Wildlight is to transition forest land into a healthy, sustainable community. It's different, he says, from the pattern you see all too often in Florida, where the natural environment is often spoiled in favor of high-density development.People and communities thrive when they have access to nature and plenty of opportunities for outdoor recreation and exercise. And many people are drawn to Nassau County for its beaches, rivers and forests-so it's important to preserve the best parts of the community even as it grows.Chris and his team surveyed the 24,000 acres that would become Wildlight and identified 12,000 acres, including critical wildlife habitat and wetlands, to set aside in conservation easements. These lands will be undeveloped and protected forever, and the easements will be managed by the Conservation Habitat Network and the East Nassau Stewardship District.Nassau residents and visitors will have access to much of this protected land, including a future park called the Green Ribbon, a 13-mile linear park alongside the St. Marys River.Rayonier is also building a trail network through the conserved areas and a new public boat ramp. There will be lots of opportunities for kayaking, hiking and biking in areas that were previously inaccessible to the public.As Rayonier continues to reinvent itself, this time as a partner to the County in sustainable community development, its core values remain the same.""Rayonier has been a steward of land for nearly 100 years with experience across states and countries managing land resources in a sustainable way,"" Chris says. ""So that ethic is in the heart-the blood stream-of Rayonier. We get to bring that to community development and it's a real thing."" To see future plans for Wildlight's growth in the county, view its Next Chapter website here.Rural Nassau and StewardshipIn planning for the future, Nassau County's leaders and residents have said it's also important to preserve the community's rural roots. Western Nassau has always been more rural than the rest of the County, with ranchettes, farms and forest land. This culture, they say, is important to Nassau and they don't want development pressure to override this rich heritage.Rayonier's rural land sales subsidiary, Raydient Rural, is committed to helping with this vision. We are turning forest land into small homesteads where land buyers can live rural lifestyles.Jason Shearer, Raydient's Senior Manager of Development and Sales, says that growing up rural helped him find his way to a career in forestry, where he was able to serve as a steward of the land.""The people we're providing homesteads for are growing up much like I did-on four or five acres, knowing where their food comes from and participating in 4-H and FFA,"" Jason says. ""We're creating places where future stewards can be cultivated.""Community Service in NassauMike Bell, our Vice President of Public Affairs, says that Rayonier's philanthropic work in Nassau is a natural outgrowth of our company's core values.""Our stewardship ethic goes beyond environmental stewardship. It's a common thread that permeates everything we've done,"" Mike says. ""We've always thought about what's best for our community and what makes it stronger.""As a practical matter, Mike says this is important for business reasons. The health of our company is tied to the well-being of the community. But it's also something that Rayonier team members are passionate about. Many give their time freely to local organizations, volunteering as well as sitting on boards and committees and sharing their professional expertise. Mike focuses his own efforts on education: he sits on the District Board of Trustees for the Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ), a community college with five campuses in the area.Despite Nassau County's A-rated K-12 school district, he says that about 35 percent of local students pursue no post-secondary education. Mike believes every student needs a plan for the future and FSCJ provides an attainable option.""FSCJ is incredibly affordable and it's good for students who don't know what they want to do,"" he says. ""It's important for the future prosperity of the County. It doesn't bode well for the County if we can't get those kids into a career with a living wage.""In addition to serving on boards and committees, Rayonier gives back to Nassau through our Community Fund, which donates annually to local organizations. In the past five years, Rayonier has given, on average, $129,000 per year, concentrating the majority of funding in the following areas:Natural Resources & Environmental EducationEducation and Youth DevelopmentHealth/Hospital, Civic and Community GrowthKim Sartor, our Community Affairs Manager, lights up when she talks about her work with local organizations. One project she loves to talk about is the work Rayonier has done with Family Support Services of Northeast Florida.Family Support Services is a community based care agency focused on improving circumstances and outcomes for families. FSS provides safe homes for abused and neglected children and teens through foster care and finds forever families for children through adoption.Rayonier has teamed up with Family Support Services volunteers to renovate their ""Bright Spaces"" facility, which provides a safe, therapeutic, welcoming environment for supervised visitation with children in care in Nassau County.Our employees also help with the annual Angel Tree Toy Drive for Family Support Services of Nassau, buying and wrapping gifts for the children to open during holiday visits with their families.""If we want to be successful as a company, we have to take care of our community,"" Kim says. ""We're funding programs that will grow our children and their children. In 10-15 years, I want to be retired and be assured our community is still thriving and growing.""Legacy and VisionSince 1937, our company has grown alongside Nassau County and we couldn't be more proud to call this community our home.Of our 181 local employees, 95 live here in the County, and 86 commute from surrounding communities.Our perspective is perfectly summed up in these thoughts from Wes Hinton, Vice President of Wildlight at Rayonier:""Everyone on our team cares deeply about what happens here,"" he says. ""Our work is a point of pride and there is excitement around it. I grew up here and my daughter is now the sixth generation in my family to be raised in Nassau County. I took this job because I want to have a say in how this community develops over time. It's our forever home.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rayonier on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: RayonierWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonierEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: RayonierView the original press release on accesswire.com When did Rayonier purchase its first forest property in Nassau County, Florida?

The company's proactive approach includes maintaining forest soil health, protecting water quality, and promoting biodiversity. Positive PotlatchDeltic focuses on sustainable timberland production and environmental protection. The company's Best Management Practices (BMPs) are developed internally and continuously improved over time. Federal laws like the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, as well as state regulations, influence PotlatchDeltic's BMPs. PotlatchDeltic conducts annual internal and external audits to monitor BMP implementation. Negative None. Environmental Compliance Analyst When assessing the environmental compliance of a company like PotlatchDeltic, it's essential to look at how their internal Best Management Practices (BMPs) align with legislative requirements. The mention of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) indicates a commitment to federal environmental standards. This is particularly pertinent given the increasing regulatory scrutiny on environmental protection. By adhering to these BMPs, the company is likely aiming to mitigate risks associated with non-compliance, such as legal penalties and reputational damage.Moreover, the integration of BMPs into the company's environmental management system and the requirement for contractors to comply suggests a robust approach to sustainability. The ongoing revision and adaptation of BMPs demonstrate a proactive stance on environmental stewardship, which could enhance the company's appeal to environmentally conscious investors and consumers. However, the effectiveness of these BMPs in actual environmental outcomes would be a key factor in evaluating the company's long-term sustainability performance. Sustainable Investment Analyst From an investment perspective, PotlatchDeltic's emphasis on sustainable timberland management practices can be seen as a strategic move to position itself favorably in the market. With a growing trend towards sustainable and responsible investing, the company's actions could potentially attract a segment of investors who prioritize environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment decisions.Furthermore, the company's adherence to third-party forest certification programs like the Sustainable Forestry Initiative and Forest Stewardship Council could provide a competitive advantage. These certifications are often used as benchmarks by investors to assess a company's commitment to sustainable practices. It's important for investors to monitor the outcomes of the annual audits and the company's compliance with these standards, as they could impact the company's market reputation and, consequently, its stock performance. Forestry Industry Analyst Within the forestry sector, the adoption of BMPs and certification frameworks is a significant indicator of a company's operational efficiency and long-term viability. PotlatchDeltic's strategy to incorporate these practices into their management system suggests an alignment with industry best practices, which could translate into operational cost savings, improved yield and market differentiation. The reference to voluntary and mandatory BMPs across different states highlights the company's agility in navigating a complex regulatory landscape.Investors should consider the potential impact of these practices on the company's operational costs and revenue. Effective BMPs can lead to more sustainable forest management, which can ensure a steady supply of timber and potentially higher long-term returns. However, investors should also be aware of the costs associated with implementing and maintaining these practices, as well as the potential for increased scrutiny from both regulators and the public. 04/05/2024 - 10:00 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 5, 2024 / PotlatchDelticOur timberland management practices are driven by our objectives for sustainable timberland production and for environmental protection. Utilizing our decades of timberland management expertise, we have developed internal Best Management Practices (BMPs) that include regulatory and certification frameworks and provide a consistent, tested means of implementing environmental protection. Our timberland management requirements are used as a proactive approach to maintain the health of forest soil, protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and promote biodiversity. Our foresters implement BMPs as part of our environmental management system during all phases of forest management and across all our timberlands. We require that all contractors implement applicable BMPs during forest management activities on our lands and in our mill supply chains. The BMPs are evaluated in formal studies, field tested, revised, and adapted over time to continuously improve their effectiveness.Our BMPs are influenced by a wide range of federal, state, and local legislation and regulations. At the federal level, the 1972 Clean Water Act (CWA) and Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) are the primary laws surrounding environmental protection for private working forests. Federal measures are combined with state water quality BMPs that establish standards for logging, road building, reforestation, streamside protection, and other activities. Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina are among the states that have voluntary BMPs. In Idaho, BMPs are required under the Idaho Forest Practices Act (FPA). Standards and criteria under third-party forest certification programs such as the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® or Forest Stewardship Council® BMPs and measures beyond the federal and state requirements ensure the conservation and proper management of timberlands. BMP implementation monitoring is a requirement of our environmental management system, and we conduct annual internal and external third- party audits of compliance.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The Fund's managed distribution plan focuses on consistent monthly distributions, including return of capital if necessary.","Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust (“FTF” or the “Fund”) Announces Distribution Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FRANKLIN DURATION INCOME TRUST (FTF) announces a monthly distribution of $0.0615 per share from net investment income, aiming to narrow the discount between market price and NAV. The Fund's managed distribution plan focuses on consistent monthly distributions, including return of capital if necessary. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust of a monthly distribution aligns with a strategic approach to enhance shareholder value through consistent payouts. This strategy is often employed by funds to attract income-focused investors. The fixed rate distribution is a notable element, as it provides predictability in income streams, which can be particularly appealing in volatile market conditions.However, the reliance on net ordinary income and short-term capital gains to generate distributions could be a concern if the fund's investments do not perform as expected or if market conditions deteriorate. The mention of potential return of capital indicates that distributions might not always be derived from income, which could mislead investors looking for yield. The capability of the fund to maintain its managed distribution rate without eroding capital is a critical factor for long-term sustainability.The Plan's impact on narrowing the discount between the market price and the NAV is uncertain. While consistent distributions can make the fund's shares more attractive, thus potentially reducing the discount, there's no guarantee this strategy will succeed. The Board's discretion to amend or terminate the Plan adds a layer of uncertainty that could influence investor sentiment and the fund's market price. Market Research Analyst Managed distribution plans like the one Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust has implemented are part of a broader industry trend where funds aim to provide shareholders with regular income. This trend reflects a growing investor appetite for dividend-paying assets amid low interest rate environments. However, the effectiveness of such plans in actually reducing the market price discount to NAV is mixed, with some funds experiencing success while others continue to struggle.It's important to note that a fund's decision to distribute capital can be a double-edged sword. While it may provide short-term market price support, it could also signal that the fund is struggling to generate enough income from its investments. This could potentially lead to a reassessment of the fund's value proposition and risk profile by the market.Investors tend to scrutinize such plans for indications of a fund's underlying financial health. The periodic review by the Board, including the yearly review of the fixed rate, will be closely watched as it may affect the perceived stability and reliability of the fund's distributions. Adjustments to the fixed rate could alter investor expectations and impact the fund's attractiveness. Economist The economic implications of Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust's distribution plan can be multifaceted. On one hand, by providing a steady distribution, the fund could stimulate spending and investment by income-dependent shareholders, which can have a positive ripple effect on the economy. On the other hand, if the distributions are frequently sourced from capital, it could indicate an underlying weakness in income-generating assets, potentially reflecting broader economic issues such as low yields across fixed-income markets.Moreover, the Plan's goal to narrow the discount between market price and NAV suggests a focus on market perception. The success of such a strategy is contingent on broader market trends and investor confidence. If investor sentiment shifts due to macroeconomic factors like interest rate changes or market volatility, the Plan may not achieve its intended effect, highlighting the interconnectedness of fund strategies and economic conditions. 04/05/2024 - 11:41 AM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FRANKLIN LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST [NYSE American: FTF] today announced a monthly distribution from net investment income of $0.0615 per share, payable on April 30, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 17, 2024 (Ex-Dividend Date: April 16, 2024). The Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) has authorized a managed distribution plan (the “Plan”) pursuant to which the Fund makes monthly distributions to shareholders at the fixed rate of $0.0615 per share. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with consistent distributions each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund’s common shares, but there can be no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. The Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, that is consistent with the Fund’s investment strategy and risk profile. To the extent that sufficient distributable income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that was invested in the Fund is paid back to shareholders. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund’s capital loss carryovers from prior years. The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund’s shareholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of the Plan. The amounts and sources of distributions reported herein are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.

One of the notable highlights of this partnership was the meeting held with Virginia Jameson, the Undersecretary of Food and Agriculture in California. SGTM and VRM representatives provided an update on the progress of their programs in the state, specifically focusing on the management of biosolids and challenging wet manures. The team received valuable insights and encouragement from Ms. Jameson to promptly address these materials and implement sustainable measures. Following their visit to California, the SGTM and VRM team traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with influential figures from the U.S. Department of State's Office of Global Food Security Division and the head of agriculture programs for the US Peace Corps. These meetings centered around aligning SGTM's and VRM's initiatives with existing programs and exploring collaborative strategies to tackle climate adaptation in local food systems across challenging locations globally. Moreover, the journey took the SGTM and VRM team to Austin, Texas, where they successfully implemented the state's first ""Groundswell"" pile. This landmark achievement signifies a significant step towards restoring agricultural land and promoting sustainable practices in the region. They ventured to Jordan to continue the team's quest for sustainable solutions. There, they engaged in a series of meetings with representatives from the Jordanian Ministries of Water and Environment, USAID, and consulting experts appointed by USAID. These discussions aimed to find effective and sustainable solutions for managing accumulated biosolids.

Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund (“TEI” or the “Fund”) Announces Distribution,2024-04-05T15:42:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund (TEI) announces a monthly distribution of $0.0475 per share from net investment income, payable on April 30, 2024.

The Fund's Board of Trustees has authorized a managed distribution plan to provide consistent monthly distributions to shareholders and narrow the discount between market price and net asset value. The Plan may distribute long-term capital gains and return of capital if sufficient income is not available monthly. Shareholders should be aware of potential adverse effects on market price due to plan amendments or terminations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a monthly distribution from Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund [NYSE: TEI] represents a tactical move to enhance shareholder value. The fixed rate distribution of $0.0475 per share is a strategy to narrow the gap between the market price and the net asset value (NAV) of the Fund's common shares. This approach can be attractive to income-focused investors seeking predictable cash flows, possibly leading to an increased demand for the shares.However, the sustainability of such distributions is contingent on the Fund's ability to generate sufficient net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, aligning with its investment strategy and risk profile. The potential use of long-term capital gains and/or return of capital to maintain the distribution rate could indicate that the Fund's earnings are not fully covering the distributions. This can be a red flag, as a return of capital effectively reduces an investor's principal and may not be a positive indicator of the Fund's investment performance.Investors should be aware of the implications of capital loss carryovers, which could offset current year capital gains. The Board's ability to amend or terminate the Plan without prior notice adds a layer of uncertainty that could influence investor sentiment and impact the market price of the shares. Continuous monitoring and yearly review of the fixed rate distribution are prudent governance practices, but they also underscore the dynamic nature of such distribution plans. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the managed distribution plan by Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund could be perceived as a tool to make the Fund more competitive within the income fund landscape. By providing consistent monthly distributions, the Fund may be appealing to a segment of the market that prioritizes steady income, such as retirees or conservative investors.The strategy to narrow the discount between market price and NAV can also be seen as an attempt to attract new investors and possibly stabilize or enhance the share price. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy can be influenced by broader market conditions, investor risk appetite and the performance of emerging markets, which are inherently more volatile.The announcement also serves as a reminder to the market about the importance of understanding the components of distributions. The distinction between net income yield and return of capital is critical, as the latter may not be a sustainable long-term strategy for wealth generation. Market response to such announcements can vary and the long-term impact on the Fund's performance and market price will depend on the actual results of this managed distribution plan. Tax Advisor For shareholders, the tax implications of the Fund's distributions are an important consideration. The composition of the distribution—whether it's sourced from net ordinary income, short-term capital gains, or a return of capital—has distinct tax consequences. Regular income and short-term capital gains are typically taxed at higher ordinary income tax rates, while qualified dividends and long-term capital gains may benefit from lower tax rates.A return of capital is not taxed immediately as it is considered a return of the shareholder's investment; however, it reduces the cost basis of the investment, which can increase capital gains tax liability upon the sale of the shares. It's important for shareholders to understand these nuances to manage their tax liabilities effectively.While the Fund's strategy seeks to maximize distributions from income and short-term gains, the possibility of distributing long-term capital gains or returning capital can complicate tax planning for investors. Shareholders should consult with tax professionals to understand the potential tax impact of their investment in the Fund, particularly if the Plan is amended or terminated in the future. 04/05/2024 - 11:42 AM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund [NYSE: TEI] today announced a monthly distribution from net investment income of $0.0475 per share, payable on April 30, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 17, 2024 (Ex-Dividend Date: April 16, 2024). The Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) has authorized a managed distribution plan (the “Plan”) pursuant to which the Fund makes monthly distributions to shareholders at the fixed rate of $0.0475 per share. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with consistent distributions each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund’s common shares, but there can be no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. The Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, that is consistent with the Fund’s investment strategy and risk profile. To the extent that sufficient distributable income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that was invested in the Fund is paid back to shareholders. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund’s capital loss carryovers from prior years. The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund’s shareholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of the Plan. The amounts and sources of distributions reported herein are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The acquisition aims to provide deep insights, improve performance, and optimize costs for developers building on Cloudflare's platform. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Baselime by Cloudflare represents a strategic move into the observability market, which is a growing segment within the cloud computing industry. Observability tools are essential for developers to monitor and troubleshoot cloud applications effectively. The integration of Baselime's technology with Cloudflare's existing developer platform could provide a competitive edge by offering a more comprehensive suite of tools for serverless application development and maintenance.From a market perspective, this acquisition could enhance Cloudflare's value proposition to developers, potentially increasing the platform's user base and stickiness. By addressing the known challenge of observability in serverless architectures, Cloudflare may attract new customers seeking a more robust solution for their development needs. This move could also signal to investors that Cloudflare is actively expanding its product offerings to capture more market share in the fast-evolving cloud services sector. Financial Analyst Cloudflare's entrance into the observability market via acquisition could have several financial implications. Firstly, it may lead to an increase in R&D expenses due to the integration and further development of Baselime's technology. However, if the integration is successful, it could lead to higher revenue streams from existing and new customers who require advanced observability tools for their serverless applications.Investors should monitor Cloudflare's quarterly financials for increases in operating expenses and gauge whether these are offset by revenue growth attributed to the new observability tools. Moreover, the market's reaction to this acquisition could influence Cloudflare's stock price in the short term, as investors assess the potential for market expansion and revenue diversification. Cloud Computing Expert Observability is a critical aspect of cloud computing, particularly for serverless architectures where traditional monitoring tools may fall short. Cloudflare's acquisition of Baselime indicates a commitment to addressing the unique challenges of serverless observability. By integrating Baselime's tools, Cloudflare aims to provide developers with the ability to analyze application behavior, optimize performance and troubleshoot issues more effectively.Understanding the technical advantages of this acquisition is important. Baselime's use of OpenTelemetry standards could simplify the integration process with various application frameworks and cloud providers, which would be a significant benefit for developers. This standardization could also reduce the learning curve and barriers to entry for developers new to Cloudflare's platform, fostering a more inclusive and accessible development environment. 04/05/2024 - 11:33 AM Cloudflare enters new market; acquisition will enhance observability tools within Cloudflare's developer platform to keep pace with the evolving needs of modern web applications SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced an entrance into the observability market with the acquisition of Baselime, the cloud-native observability platform. By integrating Baselime’s technology with Cloudflare’s developer platform, Cloudflare will be uniquely positioned to bring deep knowledge of serverless platforms and developer experience together to solve the challenges of observability for serverless apps. Today, entire applications are built on serverless architectures, from compute to databases, storage, queues, and more. Still, observability is often regarded as one of the weaknesses of serverless architectures — trading off visibility into the application’s behavior for scalable infrastructure that doesn’t need to be managed. Building and debugging production applications requires the ability to understand trends and patterns, identify performance bottlenecks, and isolate errors to ensure ongoing reliability, scalability, and security. Having access to this level of visibility, preferably all within one platform, is a critical factor developers consider when choosing a platform on which to build. “Two million developers building on Cloudflare trust us to help scale their apps globally, but can still struggle to understand the behavior of their cloud applications,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO, Cloudflare. “We believe that to be the leading developer platform, having the best observability tools built in is going to be table-stakes. Baselime has raised the standard for serverless observability and we can further unlock those insights for every developer building on our platform.” With this acquisition, Cloudflare enters into the observability market to further enable developers to deploy services in production — allowing teams to identify when a release has gone wrong and needs to be rolled back, investigate bugs and regressions, optimize performance, and more. Developers will also benefit from the ability to optimize the cost of their serverless applications, by understanding the rate of requests made and analyzing sources of latency. With this acquisition, Baselime will be integrated into Cloudflare’s developer platform, helping developers push the boundaries of modern observability to: Analyze their observability data across thousands of possible fields and values, to surface all errors, requests, or performance issues for specific users or across their entire applications. Enable and adopt OpenTelemetry-based tools and standards to facilitate integration with a diverse set of application frameworks and cloud providers. These tools and standards enable developers to easily and consistently instrument their applications for rich observability data, making it easier to quickly troubleshoot issues, whether they impact a single user, a subset of users or the entire application. Extract insights from their observability data thanks to a suite of developer experience improvements, including real-time error tracking based on logs and traces, actionable alerts, trace diagrams and timelines, an approachable query engine, and an AI debugging assistant. “Cloudflare is building the next frontier of cloud computing with their connectivity cloud. Our core mission has always been to simplify and innovate observability for the future of the cloud, and Cloudflare's ecosystem offers the ideal ground to further this cause,” said Boris Tane, founder and CEO, Baselime. “With Cloudflare, we're positioned to deeply integrate into a platform that two million developers trust, enabling them to build, ship, and troubleshoot applications fast. I am incredibly excited about the potential of what we can build together and the impact it will have on developers around the world.” To learn more, please check out the resources below: Blog: Cloudflare acquires Baselime to expand serverless application observability capabilities Two million developers are now building on Cloudflare’s developer platform cloudflare.com/developer-platform/ About Cloudflare Cloudflare, Inc.

About Bruno Mars Fourteen-time GRAMMY Award winner and thirty-time GRAMMY Award nominee Bruno Mars is a celebrated singer, songwriter, producer, and musician who has sold over 200 million singles worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. Recently Mars accepted Album Of The Year on behalf of the duo An Evening with Silk Sonic during the 2022 BET Awards. Previously sweeping the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards, the super duo took home four awards including Record Of The Year ""Leave The Door Open,"" Song Of The Year ""Leave The Door Open,"" Best R&B Performance ""Leave The Door Open,"" and Best R&B Song ""Leave The Door Open."" This comes after “Leave The Door Open” becomes Bruno’s 17th song to reach Multi-Platinum status. Mars’ 64th Annual GRAMMY win for Record of the Year makes him only the second artist in Grammy history to win the category three times, following Simon and Garfunkel. Bruno’s critically acclaimed “Leave The Door Open” climbed its way from No. 3 to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it his eighth No. 1. He became one of the 18 artists in Hot 100 history to ever do so. 24K Magic marked his highest first week sales debut, remaining in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 for an impressive 44 consecutive weeks. The lead hit single “24K Magic” is certified four times Platinum by the RIAA and the follow-up smash, “That’s What I Like” is certified six-times platinum. “That’s What I Like” also climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Mars’ seventh Hot 100 chart-topper and his first No. 1 on the Hot R&B Songs chart, where it remained at the top-spot for 19 consecutive weeks. His smash collab with Cardi B, “Finesse,” skyrocketed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track surged up the chart from its #35 debut and followed Michael Jackson’s “Black or White” as the second #35 to #3 jump in the Hot 100’s history. The remix also marked Mars’ fifteenth Hot 100 top 10 and fourteenth Hot 100 top 5. Additionally, Mars became the first male and third act overall to have at least three top 5 Hot 100 hits from each of his first three albums, following only Mariah Carey and Beyoncé. Bruno is also the first artist to have two songs spend 24 or more weeks in the Hot 100's Top 5 “That's What I Like” and “Uptown Funk” making him the only artist to have both a four-time and six-time platinum single from the same album. Honorably, Mars is one of the few artists to have written and produced all of his No. 1 hits and has had a No. 1 song on the Hot 100 from each of his first three studio albums. With seven Hot 100 No. 1’s, Mars was ranked No. 1 among male artists with the most Hot 100 No. 1s for this decade, extending his lead over Justin Bieber, Drake, Eminem, and The Weeknd. Mars traveled the globe from 2017-2018 on a massive 24K Magic World Tour, which sold more than 1 million tickets in a single day. In 2015, Bruno dominated music charts with the hit single “Uptown Funk,” which took home three GRAMMY Awards, including Record of the Year.

Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The FDA's approval of Abecma for earlier use in multiple myeloma patients is a significant advancement in the field of oncology. As an oncologist, the improved progression-free survival (PFS) rates reported in the KarMMa-3 trial are particularly noteworthy. PFS is a critical endpoint in cancer trials as it directly correlates with the period during which a patient's disease is managed without growth or spread. The reported 51% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for these patients represents a potential shift in the standard of care for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.Abecma's one-time infusion modality also introduces a new dynamic in treatment protocols. This approach could lead to a reduction in the cumulative side effects associated with traditional, ongoing treatments and provide meaningful treatment-free intervals. The well-established safety profile, with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, is crucial, especially in a patient population that often faces significant treatment-related adverse events. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the approval of Abecma based on the KarMMa-3 trial results is a testament to the potential of CAR T cell therapies in treating hematologic malignancies. The trial's design, focusing on triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients, addresses a patient group with high unmet needs and traditionally poor outcomes. The 94% manufacturing success rate mentioned for Abecma is impressive and speaks to the scalability and reliability of this treatment, which are critical factors for widespread adoption and commercial success.Furthermore, the global approvals in the U.S., Japan, Switzerland and the EU indicate a strong regulatory confidence in the therapy. This broad approval could be a harbinger for increased market penetration and a positive impact on the financial performance of Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio, given the high value of innovative cancer treatments. Healthcare Economist Examining the economic implications, the expanded approval of Abecma could lead to a paradigm shift in the cost structure of multiple myeloma treatment. CAR T cell therapies are typically associated with high upfront costs, but they may offer cost savings over time due to their one-time treatment nature. This is particularly relevant in the context of multiple myeloma, where patients may relapse and require multiple lines of therapy over time.The potential for longer treatment-free intervals could translate into reduced healthcare utilization and associated costs. However, the broader adoption of Abecma will require careful consideration of pricing strategies and reimbursement policies to ensure accessibility while balancing the innovation premium that such therapies command. 04/05/2024 - 09:05 AM Abecma tripled progression-free survival compared to standard regimens in the Phase 3 KarMMa-3 trial, with a 51% reduction in risk of disease progression or death and a well-established safety profile Expanded approval brings this personalized CAR T cell therapy to more patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma earlier in their treatment journey as a one-time infusion offering meaningful treatment-free intervals when responding to therapy Abecma is now approved in the U.S., Japan, Switzerland and the EU for earlier use for triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, underscoring BMS’ commitment to delivering Abecma globally, with consistently high manufacturing success rates and continuous increases in capacity PRINCETON, N.J., & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and 2seventy bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSVT) have announced that on April 4, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, based on results from the KarMMa-3 trial. This approval expands Abecma’s indication, making it available in earlier lines to patients who have relapsed or become refractory after exposure to these three main classes of treatment (triple-class exposed), after two prior lines of therapy. Abecma is administered as a one-time infusion, with a new recommended dose range of 300 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells. Please see the Important Safety Information section below, including Boxed WARNINGS for Abecma regarding Cytokine Release Syndrome, Neurologic Toxicities, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome, Prolonged Cytopenia, and Secondary Hematological Malignancies. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240403030392/en/Product image for download (Photo: Bristol Myers Squibb) “Abecma has demonstrated a progression-free survival benefit three times that of standard regimens in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and we are now bringing the promise of cell therapy to patients earlier in their treatment journey,” said Bryan Campbell, senior vice president, Head of Commercial, Cell Therapy, Bristol Myers Squibb. “This approval underpins our commitment to addressing the unmet needs of more patients living with multiple myeloma by improving upon the current treatment paradigm, and we remain steadfast in our pursuit of innovation and advancing cell therapy research to deliver potentially transformative therapies.” “We are extremely pleased that Abecma will be available to many more patients in the U.S.,” said Chip Baird, chief executive officer, 2seventy bio. “This approval represents another important milestone for patients, for Abecma, and for 2seventy bio as we remain committed to increasing treatment options and working to improve outcomes for patients living with multiple myeloma.” Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease characterized by periods of remission and relapse. In early lines of treatment, regimens consisting of combinations of IMiDs, PIs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies are often used to help manage the disease. Unfortunately, as many patients go on to relapse and/or become refractory to these classes of therapy, more patients are becoming triple-class exposed earlier in their treatment journey. There are limited options for these patients, and triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma is associated with poor outcomes and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of three to five months. In this patient population with high unmet need, Abecma has demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in PFS (95% CI: 13.3 months vs. 4.4 months [HR: 0.49; p<0.0001]). In addition, Abecma exhibited a well-established safety profile with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. No cases of Parkinsonism were reported in the study. “The results of the KarMMa-3 study are remarkable, especially given the historic outcomes with standard regimens for these patients with relapsed or refractory disease,” said Al-Ola A. Abdallah, M.D., University of Kansas, Clinical Associate Professor, Clinical Director, Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics and chair of U.S. Myeloma Innovations Research Collaborative. “With this approval, these patients now have an opportunity to be treated at an earlier line of therapy with a potentially transformative therapy that offers significantly improved progression-free survival for this difficult-to-treat disease that has had no established treatment approach.” To support this approval and future expansions, Bristol Myers Squibb has made continuous investments to increase manufacturing capacity and has shown a consistently high manufacturing success rate of 94% for Abecma in the commercial setting. Abecma was recently approved in Japan, Switzerland and the European Union for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma after two prior lines of therapy, making it the only CAR T cell therapy available globally for earlier lines of therapy for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Abecma is also currently approved in Great Britain and Israel for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after three or more prior lines of therapy. KarMMa-3 Pivotal Trial Results The KarMMa-3 trial is a pivotal, Phase 3, open-label, global, randomized, controlled trial evaluating Abecma compared to standard regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received two to four prior lines of treatment, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and were refractory to the last treatment regimen, with 94% of patients with disease refractory to prior treatment with daratumumab. KarMMa-3 is the only Phase 3 trial to evaluate a CAR T cell therapy in a patient population consisting entirely of triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. The trial’s patient-centric design allowed for crossover from standard regimens to Abecma upon confirmed disease progression. At the time of the final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, more than half (56%) of patients in the standard regimens arm crossed over to receive Abecma as a subsequent therapy. In the study, 254 patients were randomized to receive Abecma and 132 were randomized to receive standard regimens that consisted of combinations that included daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd), daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd), ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd), carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) or elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (EPd) chosen based on their most recent treatment regimen and investigator discretion. In the Abecma arm, pretreatment consisted of leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy. The choice to use bridging therapy was at the discretion of the investigator. At an estimated median duration of follow-up of 15.9 months at the primary PFS analysis, Abecma more than tripled the primary endpoint of PFS compared with standard regimens, with a median PFS of 13.3 months (95% CI: 11.8-16.1) vs. 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.4-5.9), respectively (HR:0.49; 95% CI: 0.38-0.64; p<0.0001), representing a 51% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death with Abecma. Abecma also showed a significant improvement in overall response rates (p<0.0001) with the majority (71%) of patients treated with Abecma achieving a response, and 39% achieving a complete or stringent complete response. In comparison, less than half of patients (42%) who received standard regimens achieved a response, with 5% experiencing a complete response or stringent complete response. Responses were durable with Abecma, with a median duration of response of 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.0-18.6). In those patients who derived a complete response or better, median duration of response was 20 months (95% CI: 15.8-24.3). Abecma has exhibited a well-established and consistent safety profile with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Among patients who received Abecma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (n=349), any grade CRS occurred in 89% of patients, including Grade >3 CRS in 7% of patients, and three cases (0.9%) of Grade 5 CRS reported. The median time to onset of CRS was 1 day (range: 1-27 days), and the median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1-63 days). Any grade neurotoxicity occurred in 40% of patients treated with Abecma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, including Grade 3 neurotoxicity in 4% of patients, and two cases (0.6%) of Grade 4 neurotoxicity reported. At the safety update for KarMMa-3, one case of Grade 5 neurotoxicity was reported. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1-148 days), and the median duration of neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1-720 days). About Abecma Abecma is a CAR T cell therapy that recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. Abecma is being jointly developed and commercialized in the U.S. as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion, and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio. This approval further underscores Bristol Myers Squibb’s deep knowledge and experience in cell therapy science and continued clinical advancements for multiple myeloma patients. The companies’ broad clinical development program for Abecma includes ongoing and planned clinical studies (KarMMa-2, KarMMa-3, KarMMa-9) for patients with multiple myeloma.

U.S. Important Safety Information BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, PROLONGED CYTOPENIA and SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. Do not administer ABECMA to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Neurologic Toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with ABECMA. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS) including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities. Prolonged Cytopenia with bleeding and infection, including fatal outcomes following stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. T cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including ABECMA ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Warnings and Precautions: Early Death: In KarMMa-3, a randomized (2:1), controlled trial, a higher proportion of patients experienced death within 9 months after randomization in the ABECMA arm (45/254; 18%) compared to the standard regimens arm (15/132; 11%). Early deaths occurred in 8% (20/254) and 0% prior to ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively, and 10% (25/254) and 11% (15/132) after ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively. Out of the 20 deaths that occurred prior to ABECMA infusion, 15 occurred from disease progression, 3 occurred from adverse events and 2 occurred from unknown causes. Out of the 25 deaths that occurred after ABECMA infusion, 10 occurred from disease progression, 11 occurred from adverse events, and 4 occurred from unknown causes. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. Among patients receiving ABECMA for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (N=349), CRS occurred in 89% (310/349), including ≥ Grade 3 CRS (Lee grading system) in 7% (23/349) of patients and Grade 5 CRS in 0.9% (3/349) of patients. The median time-to-onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 27 days), and the median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 63 days). In the pooled studies, the rate of ≥Grade 3 CRS was 10% (7/71) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 5.4% (13/241) for patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells. The most common manifestations of CRS (greater than or equal to 10%) included pyrexia (87%), hypotension (30%), tachycardia (26%), chills (19%), hypoxia (16%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, ARDS, atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, renal failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HLH/MAS. Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Of the 349 patients who received ABECMA in clinical trials, 226 (65%) patients received tocilizumab; 39% (135/349) received a single dose, while 26% (91/349) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 24% (82/349) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Almost all patients who received corticosteroids for CRS also received tocilizumab. For patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 76% (54/71) of patients received tocilizumab and 35% (25/71) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. For patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 63% (152/241) of patients received tocilizumab and 20% (49/241) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CRS. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of CRS and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Neurologic Toxicities: Neurologic toxicities, including immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS), which may be severe or life- threatening, occurred concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS following treatment with ABECMA. In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity occurred in 40% (139/349), including Grade 3 in 4% (14/349) and Grade 4 in 0.6% (2/349) of patients. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 to 148 days). The median duration of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 123 of 139 (88%) patients and median time to resolution was 5 days (range: 1 to 245 days). One-hundred and thirty four out of 349 (38%) patients with neurotoxicity had CRS. The onset of neurotoxicity during CRS was observed in 93 patients, before the onset of CRS in 12 patients, and after the CRS event in 29 patients. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 5.6% (4/71) and 3.7% (9/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively. The most frequent (greater than or equal to 5%) manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy (21%), headache (15%), dizziness (8%), delirium (6%), and tremor (6%). At the safety update for KarMMa-3 study, one patient developed fatal neurotoxicity 43 days after ABECMA. In KarMMa, one patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff. Cerebral edema has been associated with ABECMA in a patient in another study in multiple myeloma. Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 3 parkinsonism have occurred after treatment with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion and treat promptly. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 2.9% (10/349) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA, with a median onset of 6.5 days (range: 4 to 10 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Five patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction and cytopenia. In KarMMa-3, one patient had Grade 5, two patients had Grade 4 and two patients had Grade 3 HLH/MAS. The patient with Grade 5 HLH/MAS also had Grade 5 candida sepsis and Grade 5 CRS. In another patient who died due to stroke, the Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved prior to death. Two cases of Grade 3 and one case of Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved. In KarMMa, one patient treated in the 300 x 106 CAR-positive T cells dose cohort developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS. In another patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, HLH/MAS was contributory to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines. ABECMA REMS: Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at www.AbecmaREMS.com or contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA. Infections: ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion. In all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, infections (all grades) occurred in 61% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 21% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 7%, bacterial infections in 4.3%, and fungal infections in 1.4% of patients. Overall, 15 patients had Grade 5 infections (4.3%); 8 patients (2.3%) with infections of pathogen unspecified, 3 patients (0.9%) with fungal infections, 3 patients (0.9%) with viral infections, and 1 patient (0.3%) with bacterial infection. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 38% (133/349) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Viral Reactivation: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice. Prolonged Cytopenias: In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, 40% of patients (139/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 42% (145/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. In 89% (123/139) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 76% (110/145) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 1.9 months. Five patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 62% (44/71) and 56% (135/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively. Monitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines. Hypogammaglobulinemia: In all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 13% (46/349) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dL after infusion in 37% (130/349) of patients treated with ABECMA. Hypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion occurred in 45% (158/349) of patients treated with ABECMA. Forty-one percent of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post-ABECMA for serum IgG <400 mg/dL. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dl. Manage appropriately per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. Use of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or after ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA. Secondary Malignancies: Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. In KarMMa-3, myeloid neoplasms (four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and one case of acute myeloid leukemia) occurred in 2.2% (5/222) of patients following treatment with ABECMA compared to none in the standard regimens arm at the time of the safety update. The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasm from ide-cel infusion was 338 days (Range: 277 to 794 days). Three of these five patients have died following the development of myeloid neoplasm. One out of the five cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy. T cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including ABECMA. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1‑888‑805‑4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing of secondary malignancy. Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period. Adverse Reactions: The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) include pyrexia, CRS, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections – pathogen unspecified, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, nausea, headache, chills, upper respiratory tract infection, encephalopathy, edema, dyspnea and viral infections.

The ship will feature Carnival Fun Italian Style and will be homeported in Long Beach, California. Bennett, a longtime Carnival enthusiast, will christen the ship on April 24 and embark on its maiden voyage on April 25. Positive None. Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM Carnival Set to Welcome Second Carnival Fun Italian Ship to Long Beach on April 24 MIAMI, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Having conquered the big screen (""Mean Girls""), the small screen (""Hallmark Channel"") and Broadway (""Spamalot""), actor Jonathan Bennett is ready to take on his next big role: the godfather of Carnival Cruise Line's new 135,000 gross ton ship featuring Carnival Fun Italian Style. Carnival Cruise Line today named Bennett as the godfather for its next ship, Carnival Firenze, which is inspired by the city of Florence, Italy and is the second Carnival ship to sail with the Carnival Fun Italian Style theme. Carnival President Christine Duffy surprised Bennett with the news captured in this video. To make it an even easier for Bennett to sail, the ship will be homeported in his backyard in Long Beach, Calif., where it will be christened on April 24 and embark on its first sailing on April 25. ""Jonathan is a true brand ambassador for Carnival. He cruises with us, honeymooned with us and tells his friends and family to vacation with Carnival. He is friendly and welcoming to everyone and embodies the Carnival style of fun. After he sailed on the first voyage of Carnival Firenze's sister ship Carnival Venezia last May, he told me it would be his dream to be the godfather of one of our ships, so how could I turn down such a request for such a terrific friend to Carnival,"" said Duffy. ""While he's not Italian, he is proof positive that anyone can have Italian Style fun when you sail on our Italian-themed ships, and we are thrilled to have him help us welcome our newest addition to the Carnival fleet."" Following his first professional acting role on the soap opera ""All My Children,"" Bennett appeared in a number of television series before his breakout role as Aaron Samuels in the hit movie ""Mean Girls."" He has gone on to star in multiple feature films, Hallmark Channel movies and hosted programs for the Food Network. He's also the host for the New York Times Square New Year's Eve celebration where Carnival has sponsored the ball drop for the past three years. He is currently completing his first Broadway appearance in the hit revival of the musical, ""Spamalot."" ""This is an amazing honor and I'm so proud to know that I'll always be a part of the Carnival Firenze family,"" said Bennett. ""When I told Christine that I'd love to be a Carnival cruise ship godfather, I never thought she'd take my request seriously. I have so much respect for the Carnival team and how they're dedicated to taking care of their guests, the ocean and each other. When I say Carnival is a great company and a great way to vacation, I mean it! I'm so excited to not only be the ship's godfather, but to also get to cruise on Carnival Firenze as a guest now that Carnival fun Italian style is coming to the west coast.""

Labaton Keller Sucharow LLP Announces Proposed Settlement on Behalf of Purchasers of Lordstown Motors Corp. Securities - RIDE RIDEW,2024-04-05T13:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,Labaton Keller Sucharow LLP announces approval of proposed settlement benefiting Lordstown Motors Corp. purchasers involving securities violations.,"Labaton Keller Sucharow LLP Announces Proposed Settlement on Behalf of Purchasers of Lordstown Motors Corp. Securities - RIDE RIDEW Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Labaton Keller Sucharow LLP announces approval of proposed settlement benefiting Lordstown Motors Corp. purchasers involving securities violations. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The approval of a settlement class and proposed settlement in a securities litigation case such as the one involving Lordstown Motors Corp. typically signifies the nearing end of a complex legal battle. The allegations of violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 suggest claims of securities fraud, misleading disclosures and issues with control person liability. The settlement's approval process involves assessing whether it is fair, reasonable and adequate for the affected class members.From a legal standpoint, the creation of a Settlement Fund with a minimum of $3 million and additional funding up to $7 million is a significant financial commitment. The fund's size reflects the severity of the alleged misconduct and the potential damages incurred by the claimants. The distribution plan for the Net Settlement Fund will be scrutinized to ensure equitable compensation for the damages suffered by the class members.For investors and stakeholders, the resolution of such litigation removes a degree of uncertainty and potential financial liability from Lordstown Motors Corp. However, it's worth noting that the litigation will continue against other defendants, which implies ongoing legal costs and potential further settlements or judgments. Financial Analyst The establishment of a settlement in a high-profile bankruptcy case has direct financial implications for investors of Lordstown Motors Corp. The earmarked settlement fund represents a non-operating expense that will impact the company's financial statements and could influence investor perception. The funding of the settlement may affect the company's cash reserves or require financing, which could alter its capital structure or financial strategy.Moreover, the resolution of the litigation may lead to a re-evaluation of the company's stock by the market. While the settlement may be seen as a step toward stability, the ongoing litigation against other defendants suggests that the company is not entirely out of the woods, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Future financial performance and the ability to attract additional capital may hinge on the final outcomes of the remaining legal challenges.It is also important to consider the long-term reputational impact on Lordstown Motors Corp. Settlements of this nature can be double-edged swords; they can remove legal overhangs but also potentially affirm allegations of past wrongdoing, which might influence future partnerships, customer trust and overall brand image. Market Research Analyst The settlement announcement in the context of Lordstown Motors Corp. provides a lens into the broader electric vehicle (EV) industry, where investor scrutiny and market confidence are paramount. As EV companies often rely on forward-looking statements to attract investment, allegations of misleading information can have ripple effects across the sector.Understanding investor sentiment and market trends is important in this situation. The market's reaction to the settlement could serve as an indicator of the EV industry's risk tolerance and the importance placed on corporate governance. A swift recovery in Lordstown's stock price post-settlement could signal market confidence in the sector's growth prospects despite individual company setbacks.Additionally, the outcome of this case may influence the regulatory landscape, potentially leading to stricter disclosure requirements for publicly traded EV companies. This could affect how these companies communicate with investors and the market, ultimately shaping investment strategies and market dynamics in the EV sector. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM WILMINGTON, Del., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Labaton Keller Sucharow LLP announce that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has approved the following announcement of a proposed settlement that would benefit purchasers of Lordstown Motors Corp.

The distribution, payable on April 29, 2024, increased due to higher production but offset by lower prices. Sabine's updated website offers financial reports, tax information, and SEC filings. Positive Argent Trust Company declared a cash distribution of $0.535500 per unit for Sabine Royalty Trust. The distribution reflects oil production for January 2024 and gas production for December 2023. Preliminary production volumes include 64,623 barrels of oil and 1,542,894 Mcf of gas. The distribution increased due to higher production but offset by decreased oil and gas prices. Sabine's website has been updated with financial reports, tax information, and SEC filings. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The recent announcement by Sabine Royalty Trust regarding their increased cash distribution per unit is a reflection of the underlying commodity production and price dynamics. The uptick in distribution is primarily due to enhanced oil and gas production volumes, which have risen significantly compared to the previous month. This increase in production volume is critical for income-focused investors as it suggests a potential for increased revenue streams, assuming prices remain stable or improve.However, it's important to note that the decrease in oil and gas prices could offset some of the gains from higher production. This price volatility is a common characteristic of the energy sector and can impact the predictability of future distributions. Investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with commodity price fluctuations and their impact on royalty income.It's also worth mentioning that the timing of cash receipts can cause fluctuations in monthly distributions. This lag can affect investor expectations and should be taken into account when assessing the trust's performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in distributions by Sabine Royalty Trust can be seen as a positive signal to the market, potentially leading to a favorable investor sentiment towards SBR's stock. The trust's ability to increase its cash distribution despite a decrease in commodity prices speaks to its operational efficiency and the quality of its assets.Investors should, however, examine the trust's historical payout ratios and compare them with current levels to assess the sustainability of these distributions. A distribution that is increasing while commodity prices are decreasing may raise questions about the long-term viability of such payouts, especially if the trend in commodity prices continues downward.Moreover, the updated website and availability of printed reports indicate the company's commitment to transparency and shareholder communication, which are important factors for investor trust and confidence. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market, the performance of energy trusts like Sabine Royalty Trust can serve as an indicator of the health of the energy sector. The preliminary production volumes and prices provide insight into industry trends, such as the supply-demand balance, technological advancements in extraction and geopolitical factors influencing commodity prices.Investors might also consider the impact of alternative energy sources and environmental policies on the long-term demand for oil and gas. While the current increase in production is beneficial, shifts towards renewable energy could alter the landscape in which trusts like Sabine operate. Understanding these market forces is essential for making informed investment decisions in the energy sector. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM DALLAS, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Argent Trust Company, as Trustee of the Sabine Royalty Trust (NYSE: SBR), today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.535500 per unit, payable on April 29, 2024, to unit holders of record on April 15, 2024. Sabine's cash distribution history, current and prior year financial reports and tax information booklets, a link to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission and more can be found on its website, which has recently been updated with a new look, at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/. Additionally, printed reports can be requested and are mailed free of charge. This distribution reflects primarily the oil production for January 2024 and the gas production for December 2023, which is considered current production. Preliminary production volumes are approximately 64,623 barrels of oil and 1,542,894 Mcf of gas. Preliminary prices are approximately $81.94 per barrel of oil and $2.39 per Mcf of gas. This month's distribution is greater than the previous month's primarily due to an increase in oil and gas production. This was offset somewhat by decreased oil and gas prices. The table below compares this month's production and prices to the previous month's: Net to Trust Sales Volumes (a) Average Price (a) Oil (bbls) Gas (Mcf) Oil (per bbl) Gas (per Mcf) Current Month 64,623 1,542,894 $81.94 $2.39 Prior Month 48,104 1,046,545 $89.38 $2.45 (a) Sales volumes are recorded in the month the Trust receives and identifies the related royalty income. Because of this, sales volumes and pricing may fluctuate from month to month based on the timing of cash receipts. Revenues are only distributed after they are received, verified, and posted. Most energy companies normally issue payment of royalties on or about the 25th of every month, and depending on mail delivery, a varying amount of royalties are not received until after the revenue posting on the last business day of the month. The revenues received after that date will be posted within 30 days of receipt. Due to the timing of the end of the month of March, approximately $297,000 of revenue received will be posted in the following month of April, in addition to normal cash receipts received during April. Since the close of business in March and prior to this press release, approximately $983,000 in revenue has been received. Approximately $13,000 for 2024 Ad Valorem taxes was deducted from this month's distribution. These payments are normal expenditures at this time of year.

Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM The Company demonstrates significant progress since presenting at last year’s Summit. SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Know Labs, Inc. (NYSE American: KNW), an emerging developer of non-invasive medical diagnostic technology, today announced it has been selected for an abstract poster presentation at the American Physiological Society (APS) Summit in Long Beach, California on April 4-7, 2024. The Company will present results titled, “Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Using a Radiofrequency Sensor and a Machine Learning Model.” These results demonstrated that novel data preprocessing techniques, continued algorithm refinement and more high-resolution data improved the accuracy for Know Labs’ proprietary radiofrequency (RF) dielectric sensor in measuring blood glucose using a popular CGM as a comparative reference. These results were first published last year. At the previous APS Summit, Know Labs presented results from its peer-reviewed, proof-of-principle study conducted in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, which assessed the accuracy of its RF dielectric sensor in identifying different analytes in vitro, proving a 100% accuracy rate in these tests. Since then, Know Labs has published several clinical studies demonstrating the stability, repeatability, and accuracy of its non-invasive continuous blood glucose monitor. Most recently, Know Labs announced interim results from its first clinical research protocol involving people with diabetes, using venous blood as a comparative reference and a machine learning model trained on data collected in a lab setting, which resulted in an overall MARD of 11.1%. Compared to previous studies, in which most of the data collected was within the normoglycemic range and glucose values from a popular CGM were used as comparative reference, this study significantly increased the number of data points within the hyperglycemic range and therefore further validated the medical application of the Company’s proprietary sensor. During 2024, as the Company continues on the path toward FDA clearance, Know Labs will deploy the KnowU™, its wearable, non-invasive continuous glucose monitor (CGM), in large-scale, external clinical trials to determine real-world applicability, specifically the technology’s performance throughout continuous wear, on different locations on the body, and within more expansive glycemic ranges and diverse populations.

AGCS will focus on its Large Corporate and Specialty business in the U.S., leveraging its global capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. Insurance Industry Analyst The divestiture of Allianz's U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance segments to Arch Insurance is a strategic realignment focusing on core strengths and market presence. By offloading these subsidiaries, Allianz is poised to concentrate on its Large Corporate and Specialty business, which aligns with its Allianz Commercial strategy. The sale includes a significant transfer of loss reserves, which suggests a move to streamline operations and reduce exposure to long-tail risks that are typical in the MidCorp and Entertainment sectors.The transaction's value at $1.4 billion indicates Allianz's commitment to optimizing its capital allocation, which could lead to improved return on equity for shareholders in the long term. The movement of approximately 500 employees to Arch will also be a critical factor in maintaining service continuity, which is essential for retaining the existing customer base during the transition period. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the $450 million cash payment and the associated $1.0 billion of Allianz capital represent a substantial liquidity event. This transaction could potentially free up capital for Allianz, allowing for reinvestment in areas with higher growth prospects or returning value to shareholders. The assumption of $2 billion of loss reserves by Arch is a significant liability transfer, potentially improving Allianz's solvency ratios and financial stability.It's important for investors to monitor the deployment of the freed-up capital and how effectively Allianz leverages its competitive advantages post-transaction. The focus on Large Corporate and Specialty business may drive profitability, considering the higher margins typically associated with specialty insurance products. M&A Legal Expert The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, which is standard for deals of this magnitude in the insurance industry. Delays or challenges in obtaining these approvals could impact the expected close date in the second half of 2024. It is also worth noting the legal complexities involved in transferring insurance policies and loss reserves, which must be managed meticulously to avoid potential disputes or regulatory issues.Furthermore, the integration of the transferred employees into Arch's operations will require careful legal navigation to ensure compliance with employment laws and contractual obligations. This human capital aspect is often underappreciated in M&A transactions but is important for maintaining operational excellence and client relationships. 04/05/2024 - 09:26 AM Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE (‘AGCS’) to sell its Fireman’s Fund insurance businesses in the United States to Arch Insurance North America for total transaction value of $1.4 billion AGCS will continue to leverage its competitive advantages in the strategically important U.S. insurance market through its Large Corporate and Specialty business as part of its Allianz Commercial strategy MUNICH & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE (‘AGCS’), Allianz Group’s carrier for large corporate and specialty insurance, today announced an agreement to sell its U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance businesses, underwritten via its Fireman’s Fund subsidiaries, to Arch Insurance North America, part of Arch Capital Group Ltd.

FlexShares Announces Liquidation of an Exchange Traded Fund,2024-04-05T13:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Northern Trust's FlexShares ETFs terminate the FlexShares ESG & Climate Emerging Markets Core Index Fund (FEEM).,"FlexShares Announces Liquidation of an Exchange Traded Fund Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Northern Trust's FlexShares ETFs terminate the FlexShares ESG & Climate Emerging Markets Core Index Fund (FEEM). Positive None. Negative The termination of the FlexShares ESG & Climate Emerging Markets Core Index Fund may disappoint investors who were interested in ESG-focused investments. Financial Analyst The liquidation of the FlexShares ESG & Climate Emerging Markets Core Index Fund (FEEM) is a noteworthy event for investors and market participants. The decision to close a fund often reflects underlying challenges such as insufficient assets under management, lackluster performance, or a strategic shift by the fund's managers. In this case, it may indicate a reassessment of the viability of niche ESG funds within emerging markets, which can be more volatile and less liquid than developed markets.From a financial perspective, the liquidation process involves selling off the fund's assets and distributing the proceeds to shareholders. This can have tax implications for investors, as capital gains distributions may occur. Additionally, the timing of the liquidation, close to the trading day, is essential to minimize market impact and ensure the best possible outcomes for investors.For the broader ESG investment landscape, this liquidation might signal a consolidation trend where only funds with significant scale and differentiation survive. This could lead to a more competitive environment with potentially better outcomes for investors in terms of fees and fund performance. Market Research Analyst Emerging markets are often seen as fertile ground for ESG investments due to their potential for rapid development and improvement in governance and sustainability practices. However, the closure of the FEEM fund suggests that the appetite for such investments may be more limited than previously thought, or that the fund was not able to effectively capitalize on these opportunities.It's important to assess the competitive landscape of ESG funds targeting emerging markets. The failure of one fund could be due to its own shortcomings or a more systemic issue within the sector. The liquidation might also reflect investors' preference for ESG funds with a broader mandate or those that are part of a larger, more established family of funds.Understanding the market dynamics and investor sentiment towards ESG in emerging markets is important for other fund managers and financial institutions. They might need to adjust their strategies, improve transparency, or enhance their value proposition to attract and retain investors. ESG Investment Strategist Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria are increasingly important for investors and the liquidation of the FEEM fund could be indicative of the challenges specific to implementing ESG principles in emerging markets. These markets often face governance issues, less stringent environmental regulations and social challenges that can complicate ESG investing.An ESG Investment Strategist would examine the methodologies and criteria used by the FEEM fund to assess how it integrated ESG factors into its investment process. The fund's inability to attract enough capital might suggest that its ESG strategy did not align with investor expectations or that it failed to communicate its ESG value effectively.Moreover, this event could prompt a reevaluation of ESG scoring systems and their applicability to emerging markets. It may highlight the need for more localized and nuanced approaches to ESG analysis that account for the unique challenges and opportunities in these regions. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Northern Trust’s FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds announced the liquidation and termination of the FlexShares ESG & Climate Emerging Markets Core Index Fund (Ticker: FEEM) (the “Fund”). Prior to and through the close of regular trading (the “Close of Trading”) on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) on or about April 23, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), the Fund will undertake the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio. Upon the close of business on or about April 19, 2024, the Fund will discontinue accepting orders for the purchase of creation units. Trading of the Fund’s shares will be suspended prior to the open of regular trading (i.e., 9:30 a.m., Eastern time) on the NYSE Arca on April 24, 2024. Accordingly, the final date of trading of the Fund’s shares on the NYSE Arca will be April 23, 2024. Shareholders may sell their shares on or before the Close of Trading on April 23, 2024, and may incur customary brokerage charges associated with such sales. Shareholders who do not sell their shares on or before the Close of Trading on April 23, 2024, will receive cash equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares calculated as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently expected to be sent to shareholders on or about April 30, 2024. Those shareholders remaining in the Fund on the Closing Date will not be charged any transaction fees by the Fund, but the net asset value of the Fund on the Closing Date will reflect trading costs associated with the sale of portfolio securities of the Fund. If Fund shareholders sell their shares or receive a liquidating distribution, it is generally considered a taxable event and they should consult their tax advisor about the potential tax consequences.

(Nasdaq: SHOT) raised $5 million through a private placement with Core 4 Capital Corp, issuing 2,369,668 shares at $2.11 per share without attaching warrants. The Company incurred minimal expenses and paid no commissions, ensuring almost all proceeds go to the Company. CEO Jarret Boon expressed excitement over the confidence shown by sophisticated investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement of $5 million by Safety Shot, Inc. is indicative of a strategic capital infusion that can potentially bolster the company's balance sheet. The lack of warrants in the transaction suggests the investor, Core 4 Capital Corp., has confidence in the company's intrinsic value and future performance. The favorable terms, including the absence of commissions and minimal expenses, mean that nearly all of the raised capital can be directed towards Safety Shot's operational needs or growth initiatives. This is a positive signal to the market, as it often sees offerings diluted by additional costs.From an investment perspective, the transaction's pricing at $2.11 per share, seemingly at market price, avoids immediate dilution concerns that typically accompany below-market private placements. This could maintain shareholder value in the short term, while the influx of capital could drive long-term growth if managed effectively. Investors should monitor how Safety Shot plans to allocate this capital, as it could have significant implications for the company's strategic direction and operational scale. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context of Safety Shot's market positioning and competitive landscape is essential when evaluating the impact of this capital raise. The fact that a single institutional investor is willing to invest directly into Safety Shot at market price, without the leverage of warrants, indicates a perceived robust market opportunity or competitive advantage held by Safety Shot. This could reflect the investor's belief in the company's technology, management team, or market trends favoring Safety Shot's offerings.It is important to consider the investor's perspective: Core 4 Capital Corp.'s involvement could also bring additional credibility and possibly open doors to new partnerships or customer relationships. For stakeholders, the key question is how Safety Shot will leverage this investment to capture market share and whether this will translate into sustainable revenue growth. The company's ability to execute on its strategic plan following this infusion of capital will be a critical factor in realizing potential market opportunities. Legal Expert The structuring of the private placement by Safety Shot, Inc. raises some legal and regulatory considerations. The transaction's straightforward nature, without warrants and with no commissions paid, simplifies the legal landscape and minimizes regulatory scrutiny. However, investors should be aware that private placements, while quicker and less regulated than public offerings, still need to comply with securities laws and regulations such as the Securities Act of 1933.Another point of interest is the disclosure of the terms of the deal. Transparency in such dealings is important for maintaining investor trust and for the proper functioning of the markets. The company's clear communication regarding the financial terms and the use of proceeds will be important in maintaining regulatory compliance and investor relations. 04/05/2024 - 09:30 AM JUPITER, FL, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safety Shot, Inc.

This is compared to most offerings that result in less than 90% of the proceeds actually going to the Company. Safety Shot CEO Jarret Boon commented, “We are thrilled to announce this straight equity investment into the Company from a single institutional investor priced at market price. This no warrants private placement conveys that sophisticated investors are feeling confident about the Company and its new executive team.”Proceeds from the private placement will be used for general corporate purposes and to primarily fund the continued advancement of the Company’s Safety Shot beverage, which is positioned to create its own product category—rapid alcohol detoxification—in the growing $1.56 billion alcohol detoxication market.

Shareholders vote in favor of Merger Agreement and Convertible Note Share Issuance Proposal. Merger terms include cancellation of Eagle's Common Stock for 2.6211 shares of Star Bulk's common stock. The merger is expected to be completed soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The merger between Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. and Star Bulk Carriers Corp. represents a significant consolidation in the dry bulk shipping industry, which is known for its cyclicality and volatility. The combined entity is expected to benefit from economies of scale, operational synergies and an enhanced competitive position in the global shipping market. From a financial perspective, shareholders of Eagle are poised to receive a premium in the form of Star Bulk common stock, which could potentially lead to increased shareholder value if the merged company performs well. The issuance of shares for the convertible notes also suggests a strategic move to manage debt obligations while potentially diluting existing shares. Investors should monitor the post-merger performance closely, as integration risks and market conditions could impact the forecasted benefits of the merger. Market Research Analyst The approval of the merger by Eagle Bulk Shipping's shareholders indicates a positive outlook on the strategic fit between the two companies. The dry bulk shipping sector is influenced by global trade volumes, commodity prices and international maritime regulations. By consolidating operations, the new entity may achieve better fleet utilization and cost efficiencies. However, the success of this merger will depend on the effective integration of assets and the ability to navigate the regulatory landscape. Stakeholders should consider the impact of this merger on market competition, as a reduction in the number of players could alter the dynamics of charter rates and customer bargaining power. Legal Expert The legal implications of the merger between Eagle Bulk Shipping and Star Bulk Carriers are multifaceted. The favorable vote on the Merger Agreement indicates a clear path forward for the transaction, pending regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. The exchange ratio of shares provides a quantifiable benefit to Eagle's shareholders, but also raises questions about the valuation methods used. Additionally, the issuance of shares beyond the conversion cap for convertible notes could lead to potential legal scrutiny if not handled according to the terms of the indenture and securities laws. It's important for the companies to ensure full compliance with all legal requirements to avoid any post-merger litigation or regulatory issues. 04/05/2024 - 09:12 AM STAMFORD, Conn., April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc.

Negative None. Market Research Analyst The potential acquisition of MariaDB by Progress Software Corp. represents a strategic move that could significantly alter the competitive landscape of the database software industry. From a market research perspective, this acquisition is poised to bolster Progress's portfolio with MariaDB's open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), which is highly scalable and reliable. The synergy between Progress's existing infrastructure software products and MariaDB's RDBMS could provide a more comprehensive solution to customers, potentially increasing market share and customer retention.However, the impact on the stock market is contingent upon the final terms of the deal and the subsequent integration of MariaDB's offerings into Progress's suite of products. Investors should monitor the progress of negotiations and consider the potential for cost savings, cross-selling opportunities and the enhancement of Progress's competitive position. Additionally, the acquisition could provide Progress with an edge in the growing field of AI, as mentioned in the context of leveraging LLMs with RAG, which could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its market position. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition of MariaDB by Progress Software Corp. could have significant implications for Progress's financials. The acquisition could lead to a diversification of revenue sources and an increase in total addressable market. The long-term support (LTS) of OpenEdge until 2030 indicates a stable revenue stream and the potential integration with MariaDB's technology may drive further growth.Investors should evaluate the acquisition cost, potential revenue synergies and the impact on Progress's earnings per share (EPS). The deal could be accretive if MariaDB's RDBMS complements Progress's existing product lineup and enhances its overall offerings. The focus should be on the potential for increased market penetration and the realization of economies of scale that could improve margins over time.It is also critical to assess Progress's track record in successfully integrating acquisitions, as this will be a key determinant of the acquisition's success. The company's financial stability and customer retention rates suggest a strong foundation, but the execution of the acquisition strategy will be pivotal in realizing the anticipated financial benefits. Legal Expert The announcement falls under the Irish Takeover Panel Act and the Takeover Rules, signifying a highly regulated process that must be navigated with precision. The legal intricacies of such a cross-border acquisition involve thorough due diligence to ensure compliance with various jurisdictions' regulations. The statement that 'there can be no certainty that any offer will be made' underscores the tentative nature of the deal at this stage.Legal considerations will also include the examination of antitrust laws to preempt any regulatory hurdles that could arise from the consolidation of two significant players in the database software market. The legal outcome will influence the timeline and feasibility of the acquisition, which in turn affects investor sentiment and the stock market reaction. Stakeholders should pay close attention to regulatory announcements and legal proceedings that could provide insights into the likelihood and timing of the deal's completion. 04/05/2024 - 09:15 AM NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

(“Progress”) has expressed interest in acquiring MariaDB plc (“MariaDB”), via an announcement under Rule 2.4 of the Takeover Rules. Why do we believe this acquisition makes sense for Progress, for MariaDB customers and developers and for existing Progress customers and shareholders? Why MariaDB and Progress Belong TogetherWe think that the best acquisitions are mutually beneficial for both organizations. In a new blog published today, John Ainsworth, our Executive Vice President and General Manager, Application and Data Platform, discusses the history of Progress in the database space and why we believe MariaDB makes for an ideal business candidate to be a part of Progress. The Benefits of MariaDB Joining Progress As a trusted provider of infrastructure software, our team believes the relational database management (RDBMS) product from MariaDB offers an attractive value proposition for our customers looking for a scalable, reliable open-source RDBMS and that we have a proven track record of both delivering mission-critical database management products and collaborating with and nurturing a vibrant open-source community. A Strong Database HeritageProgress was founded over 40 years ago with the goal of helping customers build mission-critical business applications with a platform that reduces complexity and provides the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) in the industry. That platform, OpenEdge, remains a core pillar of our company. OpenEdge customers include many companies that you would recognize. But you might not know that a significant portion of our customers are other software companies that have built their applications (and businesses) on our platform. Our commitment to OpenEdge remains strong, with our latest long-term support (LTS) release, 12.8 being supported until 2030. We are also actively working on the innovation releases that will follow and enable our customers to meet pressing business challenges well into the future. We are no strangers to the SQL world either. OpenEdge supports SQL in addition to ABL, and our DataDirect connectivity products set the standard for ODBC and JDBC connectivity, already embedded in many popular applications. Deepening Our Data Capabilities in the Age Of AILast year, we added the MarkLogic Multi-Model Database to our portfolio, along with Semaphore, which extends our capabilities to include the management of documents, graphs, geospatial, time series and more. We believe that this combination of data platforms provides the means for our customers to embrace AI, leveraging private information with LLMs using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). We are convinced that MariaDB would be an excellent addition to the Progress portfolio, providing leading relational database capabilities to customers with applications built with a wide variety of languages and approaches.

Financially, the company saw an increase in research and development expenses but a decrease in general and administrative expenses, with cash of $2.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Positive Positive topline clinical results from the Phase 2b PARADIGM ALS trial 37.4% difference in disease progression in ALSFRS-R patients treated with PrimeC Positive trends in quality of life and complication-free survival Upcoming presentation of data at a medical conference and submission for publication Increase in research and development expenses by 18% mainly due to salaries and clinical program expenses Decrease in general and administrative expenses by 20% attributed to less share-based compensation and insurance costs Cash balance of approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2023 Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial outcomes presented by NeuroSense Therapeutics indicate a strategic focus on advancing their clinical programs, as evidenced by the 18% increase in research and development expenses. This uptick is mainly due to a rise in staffing and subcontractor costs, which aligns with the company's efforts to accelerate its PrimeC treatment through clinical trials. However, the 44% decrease in share-based compensation suggests a shift in employee incentive structures, possibly to conserve cash or reflect a change in the company's valuation.From an investor's perspective, the reduction in general and administrative expenses, particularly the 56% decrease in insurance costs, may point to improved risk management or a favorable renegotiation of terms. While the overall operating expenses saw a marginal decrease, the financial health of NeuroSense must be scrutinized in the context of its cash reserves. With $2.6 million in cash as of December 31, 2023, the burn rate and additional funding sources become critical factors for sustaining operations and continuing the development of their ALS treatment. Biotech Market Analyst The reported 37.4% difference in slowing disease progression in the ALSFRS-R scale for patients treated with PrimeC is a significant milestone for NeuroSense and the ALS treatment landscape. This positive data could potentially lead to heightened investor interest and stock valuation, as the market responds to successful clinical trial results. Moreover, the improvements in quality of life and complication-free survival, along with the positive trends in neurofilament light chain levels, could position PrimeC as a promising candidate in a market with limited treatment options.However, the long-term commercial success of PrimeC will depend on various factors, including the drug's efficacy in larger, more diverse patient populations, its safety profile, pricing strategy and the competitive landscape. Investors should also consider the regulatory pathway ahead and the potential for partnership or acquisition by larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their neurodegenerative disease portfolio. Medical Research Analyst The ALSFRS-R (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) is a validated tool used to monitor the progression of ALS symptoms. The 37.4% difference observed in the Phase 2b PARADIGM trial suggests that PrimeC may offer a clinically meaningful benefit to patients. The neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a biomarker for neuronal damage and positive trends in its levels could indicate a neuroprotective effect of the drug. These results could be pivotal in defining the therapeutic's potential and may influence future research and development strategies.It's important to note that while these results are promising, the next steps will likely involve larger Phase 3 trials to confirm efficacy and safety. The data's reception at upcoming medical conferences and its subsequent publication in a peer-reviewed journal will be critical to gaining the scientific community's endorsement, which is essential for regulatory approval and market adoption. 04/05/2024 - 09:29 AM CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd.

NGM Bio Announces Closing of Tender Offer,2024-04-05T13:19:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. has been acquired by Atlas Neon Parent, Inc., an affiliate of The Column Group, LP, through a successful cash tender offer at $1.55 per share. The acquisition resulted in NGM Bio becoming a privately held subsidiary of Parent.","NGM Bio Announces Closing of Tender Offer Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. has been acquired by Atlas Neon Parent, Inc., an affiliate of The Column Group, LP, through a successful cash tender offer at $1.55 per share. The acquisition resulted in NGM Bio becoming a privately held subsidiary of Parent. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of NGM Biopharmaceuticals' tender offer by Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. represents a significant event in the biotechnology industry, particularly for the involved parties. The acquisition price of $1.55 per share needs to be evaluated against the historical stock performance and industry benchmarks. The fact that 27% of NGM Bio's outstanding shares were tendered suggests a level of investor confidence in the offer's fairness. However, one must consider the broader impact, such as the potential for reduced liquidity for remaining shareholders and implications for the company's strategic direction post-acquisition.With the company going private, investors should analyze the potential benefits, like increased operational flexibility and freedom from public reporting requirements, against the loss of public market valuation mechanisms. This shift also typically leads to changes in the governance structure that may affect the company's long-term strategy and innovation pipeline. The delisting from Nasdaq is a definitive endpoint for public investors and the timing of these actions relative to market conditions could be insightful for understanding the acquisition strategy. Market Research Analyst NGM Bio's acquisition is indicative of ongoing consolidation trends within the biotech sector. Given the high costs and risks associated with drug development, mergers and acquisitions can provide a means for larger entities to bolster their pipelines and for smaller firms to secure the necessary capital to continue their research. It's important to assess the therapeutic areas NGM Bio specializes in and the stage of their product pipeline to understand the strategic value of the acquisition.Market reaction to such acquisitions can vary, but typically, an acquisition announcement can lead to increased volatility in the stock prices of both the acquiring and target companies. In this case, the cessation of trading on Nasdaq following the merger will bring an end to such volatility for NGM Bio. The broader impact on the biotech sector could involve a reassessment of valuations for similar companies, potentially affecting investor strategies and the market dynamics of biotech stocks. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the transaction's completion following the tender offer is subject to regulatory compliance and fulfillment of contractual conditions. The adherence to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the delisting and deregistration process must be meticulously managed. Investors and stakeholders should be aware of the legal rights associated with the tender offer, such as the appraisal rights for dissenting shareholders.The involvement of reputable legal advisors, such as Hogan Lovells US LLP for NGM Bio and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP for Parent, indicates a thorough legal due diligence process. It's important for investors to understand the legal implications of the merger, including any potential changes in shareholder rights and the legal responsibilities of the newly private entity. The legal framework within which this acquisition has occurred can set precedents and influence future transactions within the biotech industry. 04/05/2024 - 09:19 AM SAN FRANCISCO, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NGM Bio”) (Nasdaq: NGM), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today announced that Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. (“Parent”), an affiliate of The Column Group, LP (“TCG”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Atlas Neon Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), has successfully completed the previously announced cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of NGM Bio not held by affiliates of TCG and certain other stockholders at a price per share of $1.55 in cash (the “Offer Price”). The tender offer and related withdrawal rights expired at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 4, 2024 (the “Expiration Date”). As of the Expiration Date, a total of 22,323,295 shares of NGM Bio common stock were validly tendered, and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 27% of the outstanding shares of NGM Bio common stock as of the Expiration Date.

An additional 39,516,567 shares, owned by affiliates of TCG and certain other stockholders, were contributed to Parent pursuant to rollover agreements in exchange for shares of Parent. Following the closing of the tender offer, Merger Sub merged with and into NGM Bio and all shares of NGM Bio common stock that had not been validly tendered (other than shares held by stockholders who properly demanded appraisal of such shares or shares held by affiliates of TCG and certain other stockholders who agreed to exchange their shares for shares of Parent) were converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, NGM Bio became a privately held and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Prior to the opening of trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on April 5, 2024, all shares of NGM Bio common stock ceased trading on Nasdaq, and NGM Bio intends promptly to cause such shares to be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Viking Files Registration Statement with SEC for Proposed Initial Public Offering,2024-04-05T12:50:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Viking Holdings  announces a proposed initial public offering of its ordinary shares, with BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan as lead underwriters. The offering is subject to market conditions, and the company intends to list on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'VIK'.","Viking Files Registration Statement with SEC for Proposed Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary Viking Holdings announces a proposed initial public offering of its ordinary shares, with BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan as lead underwriters. The offering is subject to market conditions, and the company intends to list on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'VIK'. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The filing of a registration statement on Form F-1 with the SEC by Viking Holdings Ltd for an initial public offering (IPO) is a significant development for the company. The decision to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'VIK' indicates the company's ambition to expand its investor base and increase its visibility in the global market.However, the lack of details on the number of shares to be offered and the price range suggests that the company is still in the early stages of determining its market valuation. This is not uncommon in the IPO process, as companies and underwriters gauge investor interest and market conditions to finalize such details.The involvement of high-profile underwriters and bookrunners like BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan, UBS Investment Bank and others reflects positively on the potential of Viking's offering. Their roles are pivotal in advising on pricing, managing the issuance and ensuring regulatory compliance.Investors should monitor the effectiveness of the registration statement and subsequent prospectus for a better understanding of the company's financials, business model and growth strategy. The success of the IPO will depend on market reception, which in turn relies on broader economic conditions and investor sentiment at the time of the offering. Financial Analyst An IPO is a critical event for any company as it provides access to public capital markets, which can be a substantial source of funding for future growth. Viking's IPO will likely have a significant impact on its financial structure, providing funds that could be used for expansion, debt reduction, or other strategic initiatives.Investors should pay close attention to the performance of Viking's IPO as it can set a precedent for market confidence in similar companies. The pricing of the IPO will be particularly telling, as it will reflect the market's valuation of the company based on its perceived potential and risks.The role of the underwriters is also important in ensuring a successful IPO. Their confidence in managing the offering and their reputation in the market can influence institutional and retail investor participation.Long-term implications for stakeholders include the company's ability to meet public market expectations in terms of transparency, governance and financial performance. Post-IPO, Viking will be subject to increased scrutiny from analysts, investors and the media, which can affect stock volatility and investor relations. Legal Expert The legal process of an IPO involves rigorous scrutiny by the SEC and Viking's registration statement filing is just the beginning. The statement's effectiveness is contingent upon SEC review, during which disclosures about Viking's operations, financial condition and risk factors will be evaluated for adequacy.It's important for potential investors to understand that the IPO process is subject to legal and regulatory compliance, which can affect the timing and success of the offering. The 'quiet period' that follows a registration statement filing limits what the company can publicly say about its business prospects, which is intended to prevent market manipulation.Furthermore, the legal stipulation that no securities may be sold until the registration statement is effective is a safeguard for investors, ensuring they have access to full and fair disclosure before making investment decisions.The role of co-managers, such as Rothschild & Co and Stifel, although less prominent than that of the lead underwriters, involves assisting in the distribution of shares and providing additional market reach, which can be pivotal for the overall success of the IPO. 04/05/2024 - 08:50 AM LOS ANGELES, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Holdings Ltd (""Viking"") today announced that it has publicly filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") relating to a proposed initial public offering of its ordinary shares. The number of ordinary shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. The proposed offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering.

In doing so, Cortexa achieves another significant milestone, domestic Australian manufacturing, further strengthening its position as a leader in the Australian psychedelic landscape by executing on its plan to develop a reliable local supply.

Optima was established in 1995 and has extensive experience in the manufacture of GMP, clinical-grade pharmaceutical products, with the capacity to scale operations in line with demand.

In addition, Cortexa will shortly commence a medical education program designed to increase awareness of Psychedelic Assisted Therapy amongst the broader adult psychiatry community and continue its engagement with peak bodies and key customers to further expand the market in Australia.

Earnings for Q1 2024 will be announced on April 30, 2024, with a conference call scheduled for analysts and investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Enterprise Products Partners L.P.'s increased quarterly cash distribution to $0.515 per unit, representing a 5.1 percent increase from the previous year, signals a positive cash flow situation and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This increase is notable as it exceeds the typical inflation rate, suggesting that the company is not only maintaining but also potentially growing its real distribution value over time. The $40 million repurchase of common units also indicates a strategy to enhance shareholder value, as buybacks can lead to earnings per share accretion. The utilization of 48 percent of the authorized $2.0 billion buyback program shows a significant commitment to this strategy.Investors may interpret these actions as a sign of management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. However, it is essential to consider the potential impact on the company's liquidity and whether the buyback and increased distributions are sustainable in the long run, especially in an industry that requires substantial capital for maintaining and expanding infrastructure. The balance between rewarding unitholders and retaining enough capital to fund operations and growth initiatives is a critical aspect to evaluate. Energy Sector Analyst Enterprise Products Partners L.P. operates in the midstream segment of the energy sector, which is typically characterized by stable cash flows derived from fee-based contracts. The partnership's extensive asset base, including pipelines and storage facilities, positions it to benefit from the ongoing demand for energy infrastructure and services. The increase in distribution and the buyback program may reflect underlying strength in the midstream market, possibly driven by stable commodity prices and production levels.However, the energy sector is subject to regulatory, environmental and market risks that could affect future performance. For example, shifts in regulatory policies or a significant change in energy supply and demand dynamics could impact the company's operations. Investors should consider the long-term sustainability of the partnership's business model in the context of the global energy transition and potential shifts towards renewable energy sources. Tax Specialist The qualified notice for non-U.S. unitholder income tax withholding is a compliance measure that affects foreign investors in Enterprise Products Partners L.P. The company's adherence to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d) ensures that distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. This has implications for the net income that foreign investors will receive from their investments.Brokers and nominees must be vigilant in applying these withholding taxes to prevent any potential tax liabilities for non-U.S. investors. For investors, understanding the tax implications of their investments is crucial, as it can affect the overall return on investment. This is especially relevant for a company like Enterprise, which has a significant distribution increase that could attract more foreign investment, potentially increasing the administrative complexity of tax withholding requirements. 04/05/2024 - 09:41 AM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(CORZ) reported impressive results for March 2024, earning 906 self-mined bitcoin and an estimated 309 customer-earned bitcoin. They deployed 2,500 S21 miners, expanded infrastructure to 745 megawatts, and operated 224,000 owned and hosted bitcoin miners. The total energized hash rate reached 25.6 exahash, with 16 megawatts delivered ahead of schedule for a high-performance computing client. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent update from Core Scientific provides several key financial metrics that are pertinent to investors and stakeholders in the cryptocurrency mining industry. The reported increase in self-mined bitcoin to 2,825 for the first quarter, coupled with the 970 bitcoins earned by customers, reflects a substantial operational output. This performance is particularly notable given the anticipated bitcoin 'halving' event, which traditionally impacts mining profitability due to the reward for mining new blocks being cut in half.Furthermore, the sale of 2,888 bitcoins resulting in approximately $160.8 million in sales proceeds indicates a robust revenue stream. However, one must consider the volatility of bitcoin prices and the potential impact on future revenue. The deployment of 2,500 S21 miners and the expansion of operational infrastructure to 745 megawatts signify an aggressive capital expenditure strategy aimed at increasing the company's mining capabilities. This expansion is a strategic move to bolster hash rate capacity ahead of the halving event.Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage operational costs associated with such expansions, particularly electricity consumption, which is a significant expense in bitcoin mining. The reported average self-mining fleet efficiency of 26.85 J/TH is an important metric, as it indicates the energy efficiency of the mining equipment. More efficient mining can lead to lower operational costs and potentially higher profit margins. Energy Market Analyst Core Scientific's operational update has implications beyond the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the energy sector. The company's ability to reduce power consumption and deliver 6,063 megawatt hours back to local grids is a critical aspect of its operations. This grid support highlights the symbiotic relationship between large-scale mining operations and local energy providers, especially during periods of peak demand.By engaging in such demand response programs, Core Scientific not only contributes to grid stability but may also benefit from financial incentives offered by utility companies for reducing power usage during peak times. This can be a secondary revenue stream or a cost-saving measure, depending on the structure of the agreements with the utility companies.The expansion to 745 megawatts of owned operational infrastructure suggests that Core Scientific is becoming a significant power consumer in its operational regions. This level of consumption gives the company a substantial role in the local energy markets, potentially influencing energy prices and availability. It is essential for investors to consider the long-term sustainability of such energy demands, especially in light of increasing scrutiny on the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining operations. Cryptocurrency Market Analyst From a cryptocurrency market perspective, Core Scientific's operational achievements indicate a bullish stance on the future of bitcoin mining, despite the forthcoming halving event. Achieving an energized self-mining hash rate of 19.3 exahash and aiming for 21.8 exahash by the end of 2024 demonstrates confidence in the scalability and profitability of their mining operations.The deployment of new S21 miners is also a strategic move to maintain competitiveness in the network's increasing difficulty. As the hash rate increases, so does the difficulty of mining new bitcoins, which can impact the number of bitcoins mined if the company's hash rate does not keep pace. By upgrading to more efficient mining hardware, Core Scientific is positioning itself to maintain or improve its mining output post-halving.However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market, such as regulatory changes, market volatility and technological advancements that could render current mining equipment obsolete. These factors can significantly affect the company's future performance and should be taken into account when evaluating its business prospects. 04/05/2024 - 09:10 AM Earned 906 self-mined bitcoin and our customers earned an estimated 309 bitcoin at our data centers in March for a first quarter total of 2,825 self-mined bitcoin and an estimated 970 customer-earned bitcoin Deployed first shipment of approximately 2,500 S21 miners from previously announced order Expanded owned operational infrastructure to 745 megawatts Operated approximately 224,000 owned and hosted bitcoin miners for a total energized hash rate of 25.6 exahash as of March 31, 2024 Delivered 16 megawatts of infrastructure for high-performance computing client more than 30 days ahead of schedule AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Core Scientific, Inc.

Self-Mining Core Scientific earned 906 bitcoin in March from its owned fleet of miners. As of month end, the Company operated approximately 173,000 owned bitcoin miners, representing approximately 77% of the bitcoin miners operating in its data centers and a total energized hash rate of 19.3 EH/s. Hosting Services In addition to its self-mining fleet, Core Scientific provided data center hosting services, technology and operating support for approximately 51,000 hosted, customer-owned bitcoin miners, representing approximately 23% of the bitcoin miners operating in the Company’s data centers as of March 31, 2024. Customer-owned bitcoin miners earned an estimated 309 bitcoin in March, including bitcoin rewards paid to the Company pursuant to proceeds sharing agreements. Grid Support The Company reduced the consumption of power at its data centers on several occasions in March, delivering 6,063 megawatt hours to local grid partners. By supporting the grid in such a fashion, Core Scientific helps grid operators keep power flowing to their customers when temperatures rise and air conditioning use increases, and when temperatures drop and heating use increases. Core Scientific works with utility companies and the communities in which it operates to enhance electrical grid stability. New Miner Deployments The Company received and deployed approximately 2,500 new Bitmain S21 miners at the end of March, the first delivery of the 2.5 EH/s order announced previously. The Company expects to receive and deploy the remaining S21s from this order by the end of April 2024. The prior generation miners replaced by the new S21s were relocated to Core Scientific’s Calvert City, KY data center and its Pecos, TX data center, where 21MW of new infrastructure has been energized, increasing the Company’s total owned operational infrastructure to 745 MW.

The deal is estimated to require $1.4 billion in capital. The acquired businesses wrote $1.7 billion in gross premium in 2023, with 500 employees expected to join Arch. This move aims to expand Arch's presence in the middle market and enhance its product suite. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of AGCS's U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance businesses by Arch Insurance represents a strategic move to solidify its position in the middle-market segment. The $1.7 billion gross premium written indicates a significant revenue stream and the integration of 500 professionals could potentially enhance operational efficiencies. This move aligns with Arch's history of sustained topline growth, indicating a calculated approach to expansion.From a market perspective, the deal may alter competitive dynamics, potentially increasing Arch's market share and bargaining power. The addition of specialty programs may offer Arch a diversified portfolio, which is often attractive to investors seeking companies with a robust risk management strategy. However, the capital requirement of $1.4 billion to support the acquisition raises questions about the impact on Arch's financial leverage and return on investment, which stakeholders should monitor closely. Financial Analyst Arch Insurance's decision to invest $450 million in cash for the acquisition requires scrutiny of its capital allocation strategy. The investment represents a substantial cash outflow and the estimated $1.4 billion capital requirement suggests a significant commitment of resources. Investors should evaluate the expected return on this investment, considering the five-year streak of double-digit growth could be an indicator of a potentially accretive acquisition.Furthermore, the deal's closing timeline, set for the second half of 2024, introduces a period of uncertainty during which market conditions could evolve. Regulatory approval processes also add a layer of risk. The involvement of reputable financial advisors such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan is reassuring, yet stakeholders should remain vigilant about the execution risks and the integration process of the acquired entities into Arch's operations. Insurance Industry Analyst The insurance sector is characterized by its reliance on underwriting expertise and distribution relationships. Arch's acquisition of a market-leading Entertainment business and expansion into middle-market lines should be evaluated for synergies in underwriting and claims handling. The move to enhance distribution relationships and product offerings is indicative of a strategy to capture a broader customer base and deepen market penetration.However, the success of such integrations often hinges on the cultural fit and the smooth transition of employees. The commitment to 'Pursuing Better Together' suggests a focus on maintaining an inclusive culture, which is critical for retaining talent and ensuring business continuity. The long-term benefits of this acquisition will largely depend on Arch's ability to leverage the expertise of the new team and effectively integrate the specialty programs into its existing suite of products. 04/05/2024 - 09:00 AM The transaction will enable further expansion into the middle-market property and casualty segment.

This transaction builds upon Arch Insurance’s North America business that has delivered double-digit topline growth for five consecutive years. “Combining this platform, broad set of client relationships and talented employee-base with Arch’s capabilities creates an attractive middle-market business that should further establish Arch Insurance as a market leader in the specialty insurance space,” said Nicolas Papadopoulo, CEO for Arch Worldwide Insurance Group. “We take pride in our client-focused, inclusive culture and look forward to incorporating the experience and expertise of our new colleagues as we continue to raise the bar and fulfill our brand promise of Pursuing Better Together.” This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024 and is subject to regulatory approvals.

The recall affects products in flexible film bags. Positive None. Negative None. Consumer Safety Specialist The voluntary recall of Tide Pods, Gain Flings, Ace Pods and Ariel Pods by Procter & Gamble (P&G) underscores the company's commitment to consumer safety. The recall, limited to products distributed in the United States, may have been triggered by packaging issues that could pose risks such as child access or tampering. As a Consumer Safety Specialist, it's important to recognize that recalls can protect public health but also have financial implications for the company. Recalls often involve costs related to logistics, refunds and repackaging and can impact consumer trust.From a safety standpoint, the recall demonstrates adherence to consumer protection standards, potentially preventing accidents and reinforcing brand reliability. However, the immediate financial impact could be negative, as the company may face lost sales and additional expenses. In the long term, if managed effectively, the recall could enhance brand reputation for safety and responsiveness, which can be beneficial in maintaining customer loyalty. Market Analyst When a leading company like P&G announces a recall, it's a matter of interest for Market Analysts due to potential stock volatility. The recall of popular products such as Tide Pods and Gain Flings may cause short-term stock fluctuations as investors react to the news. The scale of the recall will determine the extent of financial impact, including costs associated with the recall and potential litigation or fines if the packaging defect is linked to any harm.Investors will be watching P&G's next quarterly earnings report closely for any financial setbacks attributed to this recall. Additionally, the company's market share in the laundry detergent segment could be temporarily affected as competitors might capitalize on this opportunity. However, P&G's long-standing market presence and diversified product portfolio may help mitigate the impact. Brand Strategist For a Brand Strategist, the recall of these products presents both a challenge and an opportunity for P&G. The negative publicity from a recall could affect brand perception, particularly if the recall is not handled with transparency and efficiency. Effective communication strategies are essential to maintain consumer confidence during such incidents.On the opportunity side, P&G's proactive approach to the recall can be leveraged to demonstrate the company's dedication to quality and customer service. By swiftly addressing the issue and ensuring that all affected products are safely removed from the market, P&G can reinforce a positive image of corporate responsibility. In the long run, this can translate into stronger brand loyalty and potentially increased market share as consumers value brands that prioritize their safety. 04/05/2024 - 09:29 AM CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) today announced a voluntary packaging recall of Tide Pods, Gain Flings, Ace Pods and Ariel Pods liquid laundry detergent packets packaged in flexible film bags.

The innovative token combines payment and utility features, enabling seamless data and currency exchanges among internet-connected devices. Key highlights include M2M Proof of Concept release, platform launch in Q4 2024, token issuance, and proposed digital exchange listing. Positive None. Negative None. Cryptocurrency Analyst The introduction of SEALCOIN by SEALSQ Corp represents a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency applications, particularly in the context of decentralized networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). The dual nature of SEALCOIN as both a payment and utility token could potentially streamline transactions within its ecosystem, offering a more cohesive and integrated experience for users engaging in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.From a technical standpoint, the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Proof of Concept (PoC) signifies a leap towards autonomous financial interactions between devices, which could lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs by eliminating intermediary service providers. This development is noteworthy as it could pave the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology in various industries where IoT is prevalent.However, the success of SEALCOIN and its impact on SEALSQ's business will largely depend on user adoption rates, the robustness of its underlying technology and its ability to withstand cybersecurity threats, especially given the post-quantum nature of the technology. The proposed listing on a digital exchange will be a critical moment for SEALCOIN, as it will provide insights into market reception and investor confidence. Financial Analyst SEALSQ's announcement of SEALCOIN's upcoming launch and its strategic partnerships, such as with the Counting Hashgraph Association, indicates a strong business move that could potentially diversify the company's revenue streams and enhance its market position. The anticipation of a new token can often lead to speculative trading, impacting the company's stock price in the short term.Investors should monitor the progress of the M2M PoC and the subsequent platform launch, as these milestones will likely affect the company's valuation. A successful PoC could demonstrate SEALSQ's capability to deliver on its promises and potentially attract new partnerships, driving up investor interest. On the flip side, any setbacks or delays could negatively impact investor sentiment.In the long term, the integration of SEALCOIN into SEALSQ's existing product offerings could lead to new business models and revenue opportunities, such as transaction fees or services tied to the token's use. The extent to which SEALCOIN is adopted by the web3 community and the broader market will be important in assessing its long-term financial impact on the company. Blockchain Technology Expert The initiative to launch SEALCOIN within a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) showcases an innovative application of blockchain technology beyond simple currency transactions. The utilization of Hedera's network for the digital infrastructure suggests a focus on scalability and security, which are critical for the success of blockchain initiatives, particularly in the IoT space where vast numbers of transactions can occur.One of the key technical challenges for SEALCOIN will be ensuring interoperability among different devices and platforms, as well as maintaining a high level of security, especially in the face of quantum computing advancements. The development and implementation of post-quantum cryptographic methods will be essential to safeguard the network against future threats.SEALSQ's approach in combining payment and utility aspects in a single token is relatively novel in the blockchain space and could set a precedent for future projects. This strategy may offer users enhanced utility but also adds complexity to the token's economic model, which will need careful management to maintain stability and user trust. 04/05/2024 - 08:42 AM Geneva, Switzerland, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SEALCOIN is Poised to Transform the Cryptocurrency Landscape Within the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) SEALSQ Corp (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company"") (NASDAQ: LAES), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, announces the launch date of SEALCOIN as a Hybrid Payment & Utility Token for its Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). SEALCOIN is designed to enable billions of internet-connected devices to autonomously engage in seamless data and currency exchanges. The SEALCOIN platform is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2024, followed by Token issuance and a proposed listing of SEALCOIN on a digital exchange. With this exciting development for the cryptocurrency industry, SEALSQ is setting a new benchmark in the space. SEALCOIN’s innovative approach combines the best features of both payment and utility tokens, offering unparalleled flexibility and utility to its users, for both physical and digital P2P transactions' network. Key Highlights: Hybrid Payment & Utility Token: SEALCOIN is designed to serve as both a medium of exchange and a utility token within its ecosystem, providing users with a versatile tool for transactions and access to exclusive services.Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Proof of Concept (PoC): A significant milestone is being reached with the release of a M2M PoC enabling the disintermediation of service providers for interconnected devices. The release is scheduled for mid-July 2024, with a comprehensive demo planned shortly thereafter, showcasing the innovative capabilities of SEALCOIN in enabling Service vs Payment transactions between machines.SEALCOIN Platform Launch in Q4 2024: The launch of the SEALCOIN platform is expected to take place in October 2024. This launch will introduce the Purchasing and Tokenization of Certificates (MVP), marking a major step forward in bridging a strong physical network to the secure Digital infrastructure of Hedera’s network. Token Issuance & Proposed Digital Exchange Listing: Following the launch of the SEALCOIN platform, SEALSQ will proceed with Token Issuance and subsequently list SEALCOIN on a digital exchange . Counting Hashgraph Association as one of its key partners in the SEALCOIN project underpins SEALSQ’s ambitions with this landmark project. The Company plans to secure further partnerships amongst its Networks in a move designed to build momentum among the web3 community and SEALCOIN’s presence in the market. ""Our vision with SEALCOIN is to redefine the boundaries of secured P2P transactions, in the physical and the digital world,"" said Carlos Moreira, CEO of SEALSQ. ""By launching SEALCOIN, we are not just introducing another cryptocurrency; we are setting the stage for a future where transactions and services in the digital space are seamless, secure, and efficient. Our work to validate a M2M PoC, upcoming platform launch, to be followed by a strategic listing on a digital exchange, are all steps toward realizing this vision.

Through innovative solutions like recycled poly mailers and advanced recycling trials, SEE is making strides in sustainability. Positive None. Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 08:45 AM Originally published in the SEE Impact Report 2022NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 5, 2024 / Alan Adams is SEE's Sustainability Director for the Asia Pacific region. With decades of experience in the packaging industry, he leads customer engagements, advocacy, and sustainability strategy development and delivery and is a longtime contributor to packaging sustainability education. Alongside the Australian Institute of Packaging (AIP), Alan has played an integral role in shaping Sustainable Packaging Guidelines to reduce food waste in the region. In 2021, he was recognized by the AIP as Industry Packaging Professional of the Year for his outstanding achievements and significant contributions.How is SEE driving circularity in the Asia Pacific region?Circularity is critical. Our goal is to make effective packaging solutions that enable efficient supply chains. We're seeking to eliminate waste of all types and make our solutions circular so the materials can be used again and again. It starts with great design: designing out waste, designing for recycling, and designing partnerships along the value chain to support the development of advanced recycling technologies that drive circularity.Some of the circular solutions SEE is offering in the Asia Pacific region include SEALED AIR® brand Jiffy Shurtuff poly mailers made with more than 80% recycled content, which Australia Post started using in 2020; SEALED AIR® brand TempGuard insulated box liners, a curbside recyclable alternative to expanded polystyrene (EPS) bins; and CRYOVAC® brand HydroLoQ padless modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) trays, designed to eliminate the absorbent pads traditionally used in meat packaging and keep millions of pads from going to landfill every year.A critical challenge facing the food industry is driving circularity for plastics using packaging materials that have strict hygiene and performance requirements for food protection and distribution. In the Asia Pacific region, we have built out transition plans for our solutions and are pioneering new outcomes.Our team recently collaborated on a first-of-its-kind advanced recycling trial in Australia for SEE's CRYOVAC® brand R90 barrier vacuum shrink bag. With more than 90% polyethylene content, the food packaging solution is designed for recycling and meets the Australian Packaging Covenant Organization's 2023 design guidelines. This trial brought together new recycling technology and new materials development to highlight the path to circularity in advanced meat packaging.In your role, how do you engage with customers to help them reach their sustainability goals?SEE takes a holistic approach that enables customers to reduce their environmental impact and achieve their sustainability goals. Sustainability means different things to different customers. Their goals vary, so there is no one sustainable solution nor silver bullet to solve their challenges. I guide our regional team through the process of learning what our customers' sustainability goals are and what they want their products and packaging to say about them. From there, the team shares the pros and cons of various packaging solutions to enable our customers to make the best choices for meeting their goals. In many ways, this means we are material agnostic. It's more about solving customer challenges than promoting specific packaging solutions.Discuss the changing landscape in the Asia Pacific region and what sustainability innovations are being developed there.The Asia Pacific region is diverse with developed economies working on advanced recycling, improving sorting, and increasing recovery rates. Great attention has been placed on creating packaging design criteria to increase the circularity of materials and developing mandatory rules to ensure the industry keeps up with those of us leading the way.The region also has large developing economies struggling with difficult waste management challenges. Oftentimes, challenges lead to innovative solutions. Ocean-bound plastics is a good example. Collecting plastics at risk of ending up in our oceans supports an urgent intervention we need now. Green claims are on the rise, and increasingly, we see that trust and transparency are critical. Independent verification of claims on our recycled content is now a must.SEE's Asia Pacific team has a strong record of developing innovative solutions.

During the meeting, which was also attended by the Minister for Digital Transformation and the Civil Service, José Luis Escrivá; the director of the Office of Economic Affairs of the Presidency of the Government, Manuel de la Rocha, and the president of IBM Spain, Portugal, Greece and Israel, Horacio Morell, they shared challenges and initiatives that are opening up in the field of artificial intelligence and supercomputing. Afterwards, the Government of Spain, through its Ministry for Digital Transformation, the Civil Service, and IBM today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote their collaboration in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI supercomputing, advance the development and practical deployment of open, ethical and responsible generative AI in Spain, and sharing the vision to create a leading suite of foundation models including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. During the meeting at La Moncloa, the President stressed that agreements such as this one demonstrate Spain's commitment to accelerate the ethical and responsible use of AI, particularly in the public sector, with great impact on productivity for many sectors of the economy and on Europe's strategic autonomy. The document was signed today in Madrid by Darío Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research, and José Luis Escrivá, Minister for Digital Transformation and Civil Service of the Government of Spain. Tapping into IBM's open-source AI framework, communities will be able to shape and contribute to the Spanish LLM, that will also include co-official languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician and Valencian) increasing innovation, transparency and safety while ensuring a more cost-efficient yet technologically competitive position in the market. The collaboration also reflects the intention to develop AI-enhanced techniques to accelerate the discovery, development, and validation of new materials to increase the sustainability of the semiconductors value chain. ""AI positions us at the threshold of a new industrial revolution, with a very significant potential impact in terms of productivity gains for a large number of economic sectors and in providing better public services to our citizens,"" said the minister José Luis Escrivá. ""The Government of Spain is promoting a useful and ethical development of the opportunities offered by this technology. IBM, with its experience, knowledge, and resources, is an excellent partner to accompany us in our vision."" ""IBM shares this bold vision to accelerate the Government of Spain's AI strategy and to be the national AI partner for Spain,"" said Darío Gil, IBM SVP and Director of IBM Research. ""We will leverage IBM's deep investments across the entire AI stack, from compute to models, we will enable an open community to drive the full potential of AI technologies. Together, we will work to foster the responsible use of AI to drive sustainable growth in Spain, and all Spanish speaking countries worldwide."" Spanish is the second leading spoken language in the world (6.2% of the world's population1). One of the priority areas under this MoU is to collaborate in a leading suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. Creating models that are entirely designed in Spanish will enhance AI sustainability by reducing biases and providing competitive alternatives for the Spanish industry. These models will be refined using advanced tuning and alignment techniques, encompassing innovative methods that facilitate direct community enhancements and foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration. Recent advances in generative AI and AI supercomputing hold tremendous promise for governments and economies who can realize the productivity gains enabled by these technologies. With this collaboration, the Government of Spain is taking decisive action to seize this opportunity with timely and transformative commitments to invest in the AI revolution. The coordination within the government institutions in this field will facilitate both widespread use of AI across national, regional, and local economies, as well as the timely and sufficient resources needed to build competitive advantages within a rapidly evolving AI-driven commercial landscape. This includes investment in human capital (upskilling and tooling) and community-driven adoption of AI to ensure that the productivity benefits and economic gains can positively impact across the economy of Spain, from small-medium sized businesses (SMBs) to large enterprises and the public sector. Taking this into account, the Memorandum of Understanding is based on five principles; Promote the development of a suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages.Collaborate on the research and development of a full stack generative AI platform, including software built on open-source frameworks and tools as well as infrastructure enabling hardware diversity.Promote national and regional AI strategies through a cooperative approach that promotes a responsible use of the foundation models and the associated generative AI platform. This collaborative effort aims to benefit the public sector and SMEs throughout Spain.Foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration, to establish Spain as a global leader in AI. Develop AI-enhanced techniques to accelerate the discovery, development, and validation of new materials to advance the sustainability of the semiconductor industry value chain. An additional priority described under this memorandum is to collaborate on the research and development of AI technology for supercomputing applications.

The financial results indicate positive growth and financial stability for the company.","Greenbrier Reports Second Quarter Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Greenbrier Companies, Inc. reports a strong second fiscal quarter with $1.03 EPS, new railcar orders of 5,900 units valued at $690 million, and mid-teen gross margin at 14%. The company achieved a consolidated gross margin in the mid-teens for the second consecutive quarter, with steady lease fleet utilization of nearly 99%. Greenbrier also retired $48 million of 2024 convertible notes, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, and updated guidance for fiscal 2024. The financial results indicate positive growth and financial stability for the company. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Greenbrier Companies' reported GAAP EPS of $1.03 and significant new railcar orders suggest a strong operational quarter, which is likely to influence investor sentiment positively. The mid-teen gross margin at 14% indicates a stable profitability level, although a slight decrease from the previous quarter's 15%. This stability in margins, despite fluctuations in product mix and seasonal impacts, demonstrates Greenbrier's ability to manage costs effectively. The retirement of the remaining $48 million of 2024 convertible notes using cash reflects a solid balance sheet, potentially reducing future interest expenses and dilution of shareholder equity.Moreover, the declared quarterly dividend marks the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and could be seen as a sign of confidence in ongoing financial health. The forward-looking guidance provided by Greenbrier, with expected revenue of $3.5 – $3.7 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $155 million across various segments, offers a transparent outlook for investors and could be factored into stock valuations. The anticipated gross leasing investment suggests a strategic focus on growing the leasing segment, which typically provides stable, long-term revenue streams. Market Research Analyst Greenbrier's update on new railcar orders valued at nearly $690 million, coupled with a lease fleet growth to 14,600 units, indicates a robust demand in the freight transportation market. This is a positive sign for the industry's growth trajectory and Greenbrier's market position. The company's backlog of 29,200 units, valued at $3.6 billion, provides substantial revenue visibility and could be a strong indicator of sustained performance, especially important for investors looking for stability in future earnings.The segment breakdown shows that the Manufacturing and Leasing & Management Services are the primary drivers of revenue and profitability, with the latter showing a remarkable gross margin of over 70%. This diversification of revenue streams, with a strong emphasis on high-margin leasing services, could be a key factor in hedging against market volatility and ensuring consistent cash flows. Economist Greenbrier's financial performance, including the growth in its lease fleet and high utilization rates, reflects broader economic trends in the transportation sector. The nearly 99% lease fleet utilization rate signals strong demand for freight transportation services, which often correlates with broader economic activity. As an economist, it's noteworthy that Greenbrier's strategic investments and operational efficiency have allowed it to maintain performance despite the mild winter weather's impact on its Maintenance Services segment.The company's ability to navigate the cyclical nature of the freight industry and maintain a high backlog indicates resilience and adaptability. The strategic focus on leasing investments aligns with a long-term view of generating stable revenue streams, which can be particularly advantageous during economic downturns or periods of market uncertainty. 04/05/2024 - 08:30 AM GAAP EPS of $1.03 New railcar orders of 5,900 units valued at nearly $690 million Mid-teen gross margin at 14% LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.

Tekorius, CEO and President. ""Greenbrier's broad product lineup, extensive market relationships, supportive customer experience, and deep commercial origination capabilities combine to create our unique leadership position and enable ongoing success.

Supplemental Leasing Information(In millions, except owned fleet, unaudited) Greenbrier's leasing strategy provides an additional ""go to market"" element to Greenbrier's Commercial strategy of direct sales, partnerships with operating leasing companies, and origination of leases for syndication partners as well as providing a platform for further growth at scale. Investing in leasing assets also provides a recurring stream of revenue and tax-advantaged cash flows, however in the short-term it reduces Greenbrier's Manufacturing revenue and margin as a result of deferring revenue recognition. During the April 2023 Investor Day, Greenbrier provided a long-term target to more than double recurring revenue from leasing and management fees by investing up to $300 million net annually for the next five years. Recurring revenue is defined as Leasing & Management Services revenue excluding the impact of syndication transactions.

Greenbrier uses words, and variations of words, such as ""approximately,"" ""are"" ""backlog,"" ""believe,"" ""continue,"" ""demand,"" ""drive,"" ""enhance,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""grow,"" ""momentum,"" ""ongoing,"" ""optimistic,"" ""progress,"" ""provide,"" ""position,"" ""recurring,"" ""strategy,"" ""strong"" ""target,"" ""will,"" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about backlog and other orders, leasing performance, financing, future liquidity, cash flow, tax treatment, and other information regarding future performance and strategies and appear throughout this press release. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the following: an economic downturn and economic uncertainty; inflation (including rising energy prices, interest rates, wages and other escalators) and policy reactions thereto (including actions by central banks); disruptions in the supply of materials and components used in the production of our products; the war in Ukraine and related events; and the COVID-19 pandemic, variants thereof, governmental reaction thereto, and related economic disruptions (including, among other factors, operations and supply disruptions and labor shortages). Our backlog of railcar units and other orders not included in backlog are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Certain orders in backlog are subject to customary documentation which may not occur. More information on potential factors that could cause our results to differ from our forward-looking statements is included in the Company's filings with the SEC, including in the ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" sections of the Company's most recently filed periodic report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Except as otherwise required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of the date hereof. Financial Metric Definitions EBITDA is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This metric is a performance measurement tool used by rail supply companies and Greenbrier. You should not consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for other financial statement data determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because this metric is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, the measure presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We define EBITDA as Net earnings before Interest and foreign exchange, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. We believe the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information as it excludes the impact of financing, foreign exchange, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall operating performance of a company's core business. We believe this assists in comparing our performance across reporting periods.

Negative None. 04/05/2024 - 08:00 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 5, 2024) - European Energy Metals (TSXV: FIN) (FSE: W28) (""European Energy Metals"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an amended agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with Capella Minerals Ltd. (TSXV: CMIL) (""Capella"") to now acquire a 100% interest in the lithium Finnish Pegmatite Project (the ""Project""). Whereas the Project was currently subject to a two stage 51/80% earn-in agreement (the ""Earn-In Agreement"") between the Company and Capella, the Purchase Agreement replaces the Earn-In Agreement in its entirety, and, upon completion of the transaction, the Company will hold a 100% interest in the project with no further commitments due to Capella.Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, upon closing, the Company has agreed to pay Capella $250,000 in cash and issue 1,100,000 common shares of the Company (the ""Consideration Shares""). Capella will also receive a 2% net smelter royalty on the Project, half of which may be repurchased by the Company at any time in exchange for the payment of 1,000,000 Euro. The Consideration Shares will be subject to a statutory four month hold period as well as contractual restrictions on resale. Completion of the transaction remains subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.Jeremy Poirier, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We are very pleased to obtain 100% ownership and control of the project. We believe this will provide a faster and clearer pathway to advance our exploration efforts on the ground and unlock the project's potential. It provides the company with further financial flexibility and eliminates the remaining work commitment and allows the company to save on both cash and share payments from the existing earn in."" The Project covers approximately 2,500 km2 within geological terrane that hosts numerous spodumene pegmatite prospects and deposits and is at the center of the development of a 700 million Euro hard rock lithium supply chain complex by Keliber Oy and its parent Sibanye-Stillwater Inc. The company's recently granted Nabba Exploration Licences occur less than 10 km from Keliber's Spodumene Concentrator Plant. The 2023 inaugural exploration season saw the discovery of multiple occurrences of lithium bearing spodumene pegmatite mineralization. The highlight was the discovery of the Kyrola Prospect, a 350m long by 110m wide spodumene-bearing boulder field, where 49 rock chip grab samples assayed from 3.84% Li2O to 0.003% Li2O, with 15 of the 49 samples returning grades in excess of 0.50% Li2O (Li2O = lithium oxide). The extent of the boulder field is constrained only by low-lying overburden covered areas and farm fields. The mean assay of these samples was 0.53% Li2O. Fifteen samples assayed greater than 0.50% Li2O, eleven assayed greater than 1.00% Li2O, 4 assayed greater than 2.00% Li2O and 1 assayed greater than 3.00% Li2O. It is interpreted that based on glacial history of the area the boulders have only been transported 300-500 m from source.Figure 1To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/9006/204317_fab8139c64dc9b76_001full.jpgThe Company also announces that Joel Leonard has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary of the Company.

Outlook “The year ahead is rife with new, innovative product releases arriving in Q2 and continuing throughout 2024,” Salz added. “In addition to the strength of our core roadmap, we are in the process of unlocking what we believe to be two of the most material developments to our business model since launching Rivalry in 2018. The first is a B2B vertical to license our in-house developed games, and the second is exploration and development within the crypto ecosystem – each representing an impactful growth catalyst on our path to profitability this year.” ""I have never had more confidence in our product roadmap and what Rivalry is building this year. Apart from new products, original games, and proprietary features, we have been working to dial-up the overall feel and entertainment value of our core product to provide a tech-savvy, next generation customer with a tailored experience that is well-differentiated within the larger sports betting marketplace.""

Paramount will debut the technology during the CMT Music Awards, tapping into the growing retail media market. Shopsense offers a frictionless second-screen shopping experience for viewers, connecting them to curated products inspired by the content they are watching. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Shopsense AI's retail media platform, in collaboration with Paramount Global, represents a significant step in the evolution of advertising and e-commerce. By bridging the gap between content consumption and consumer purchasing behavior, this technology taps into the burgeoning trend of 'second screen' usage, particularly among Gen Z viewers. The retail media market is indeed the fastest-growing advertising segment and integrating shoppable content directly into a broadcast is a strategic move to capture this growth.From a market research perspective, the potential for increased viewer engagement and incremental revenue streams is substantial. The ability to shop in real-time while consuming content could significantly boost impulse purchases, thereby increasing the average revenue per user (ARPU) for content providers. Moreover, the integration of loyalty programs could enhance customer retention and provide valuable data for targeted marketing strategies.However, the success of this platform will depend on the seamless integration of the shopping experience without disrupting the viewing experience, as well as the quality and relevance of the curated products. The initial launch during a high-profile event like the CMT Music Awards is a strategic move, likely to generate buzz and test the platform's effectiveness in a live setting. Retail Technology Expert Shopsense AI's patent-pending technology offers a glimpse into the future of retail technology, where artificial intelligence plays a central role in personalizing shopping experiences. The 'no-SDK' solution for broadcasters is particularly noteworthy as it simplifies the adoption process and minimizes technical barriers for content publishers. This ease of integration could accelerate the adoption of second-screen shopping experiences across the industry.The Shopsense Lens feature, which allows consumers to 'snap and shop,' is a significant advancement in image recognition and AI technology. This feature reduces the friction typically associated with finding and purchasing products seen on screen, which could lead to a higher conversion rate. However, the accuracy of the AI in identifying and matching products will be critical to the user experience and the platform's credibility.Furthermore, the implications for data collection and privacy should be considered. As viewers interact with shoppable content, they generate valuable data that can be used for personalization and advertising. While this presents opportunities for hyper-targeted advertising, it also raises questions about user privacy and data security, which are increasingly important to consumers and regulators. Digital Media Strategist The strategic partnership between Shopsense AI and Paramount Global underscores the shifting landscape of digital media consumption and monetization. By leveraging the second-screen phenomenon, Paramount is positioning itself to capitalize on direct-to-consumer sales channels while still maintaining its core business of content delivery. This dual approach could serve as a model for other content providers looking to diversify revenue streams beyond traditional advertising and subscription models.The long-term impact on the stock market and Paramount's financial performance will hinge on the user adoption rate and the efficacy of the platform in driving sales. If successful, this could lead to a reevaluation of the company's revenue potential and open up new avenues for partnerships with retailers and brands. It also sets a precedent for how media companies can innovate in the face of changing consumer behaviors and the ongoing challenge of digital disruption.While the initial focus appears to be on entertainment and sports programming, the scalability of this technology to other content genres and platforms could further enhance its market impact. The potential for international expansion, particularly in markets with high mobile usage and second-screen engagement, could also be a significant growth driver for Shopsense AI and its partners. 04/05/2024 - 08:00 AM Launch Partner Paramount Global Will Debut “Second Screen” Mobile Shopping Experience During the CMT Music Awards Red Carpet Pre-Show on Sunday, April 7 REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shopsense AI today announced the launch of its AI-powered retail media platform, with Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA; PARAA) as its inaugural partner. Shopsense’s patent-pending technology unlocks new advertising and incremental revenue opportunities for broadcast and streaming networks by making content seamlessly shoppable within their own apps and e-commerce sites. Paramount Global will debut the new mobile shopping experience powered by Shopsense during the CMT Music Awards red carpet pre-show coverage airing on CMT on Sunday, April 7. The live CMT Music Awards will air on CBS and Paramount+ directly following the red carpet coverage. “Paramount’s premium entertainment content consistently influences consumer shopping journeys,” said John Halley, President of Paramount Advertising. “TV is no longer just a top-of-the-funnel awareness generator. It is a 1:1 vehicle that brings the full funnel to the living room. We’re thrilled to launch with the Shopsense AI platform at the CMT Music Awards to capitalize on fandom and see it expressed through commerce.” For consumers, Shopsense makes it easy to find and purchase products and curated collections inspired by their favorite content, including shows, movies, sports events, live awards broadcasts and more. A recent consumer study found that 85% of Gen Zers use a “second screen” mobile device while watching TV. Shopsense’s solution lets publishers like Paramount quickly tap into the retail media market, the fastest-growing advertising segment in the U.S., and activate second-screen shopping experiences for viewers. Broadcasters can now offer full-funnel marketing strategies within their own content-driven retail walled garden. “With so many consumers scrolling on their phones while they watch TV on a bigger screen, content publishers like Paramount have been looking for ways to activate a frictionless, personalized and convenient second-screen shopping experience for their viewers,” said Glenn Fishback, CEO and Co-founder of Shopsense AI. “Shopsense AI provides an end-to-end solution that makes it easy for consumers to shop their favorite products on a second device while they watch TV—without having to deal with clunky QR codes or find the missing remote. Our AI-curated storefronts instantly turn every show into a shopping journey that features an endless selection of products to browse and purchase versus a labor-intensive experience where they have to manually select items.” Shopsense offers broadcasters an easy-to-integrate, no-SDK solution to activate second-screen shopping that doesn’t disrupt viewers’ lean-back experience.

Announces Unaudited Balance Sheet Information as of March 31, 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc. (NYSE: EMO) reported its financial position as of March 31, 2024, with net assets of $566.3 million and a net asset value per share of $44.29. The Fund's asset coverage ratios under the 1940 Act were 437% for senior indebtedness and 361% for total leverage. Top ten equity holdings included Energy Transfer LP, ONEOK Inc., and Targa Resources Corp. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financials of ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc. (EMO) provide a snapshot of the company's fiscal health as of March 31, 2024. The net asset value (NAV) per share is a critical indicator for investors as it represents the value of a share after liabilities are subtracted from assets. An NAV of $44.29 suggests robust underlying asset performance, especially when considering the volatility often associated with energy investments.Another significant metric here is the asset coverage ratio, which exceeds the minimum 300% required by the 1940 Act for senior securities, indicating a strong protective cushion for debt holders. The high coverage ratios (437% for senior indebtedness and 361% for total leverage) imply that the fund maintains a conservative leverage strategy, which can be appealing to risk-averse investors, particularly in the energy sector which is subject to commodity price fluctuations.It's important to note the fund's status as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. This means that while there could be higher reward potential due to concentrated investments, there's also heightened risk. The top ten equity holdings, representing 71.4% of total investments, are concentrated in the midstream segment of the energy sector, which involves the transportation, storage and wholesale marketing of crude or refined petroleum products. Midstream companies can offer stable cash flows, which might be reflected in the fund's performance. Market Research Analyst Assessing the market implications of EMO's financial statement, the concentration in top midstream energy companies is noteworthy. Companies like Energy Transfer LP and ONEOK Inc. have historically provided steady dividend yields due to their midstream operations, which can be less sensitive to oil and gas prices compared to upstream producers. This positions EMO potentially as a stable income-generating investment.However, the energy sector is undergoing significant transformation with the shift towards renewable energy sources. Investors should be aware of the long-term implications of this transition on midstream companies. While current investments may be lucrative, the sector's evolution could necessitate strategic shifts in portfolio composition to maintain performance.Moreover, the fund's non-diversified nature could mean that any negative developments within the energy sector, or regulatory changes affecting midstream operations, could have an outsized impact on the fund's performance. Continuous monitoring of sector trends and regulatory environments is essential for stakeholders to anticipate and react to potential risks. Legal Expert From a regulatory perspective, the fund's adherence to the 1940 Act is important for compliance and investor protection. The asset coverage ratios are well above the statutory minimum, which provides a degree of safety for investors against potential downturns in the energy market. This compliance is a positive sign for potential investors who are concerned about the legal and regulatory risks associated with investment funds.Additionally, the unaudited nature of the financial data calls for cautious interpretation. While the fund is obliged to file semi-annual and annual reports with the SEC and its portfolio holdings are publicly available, the unaudited status means that the figures have not undergone the scrutiny of an external audit. This could introduce an element of risk, as audited financials provide an additional layer of assurance regarding the accuracy of the reported data. 04/05/2024 - 08:00 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund Inc.

Announces Unaudited Balance Sheet Information as of March 31, 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc. (NYSE: CEM) reported its unaudited assets and liabilities, net asset value, and asset coverage ratio as of March 31, 2024. The Fund's net assets stood at $658.2 million, with a net asset value per share of $49.51. The asset coverage ratio for senior indebtedness was 459%, and for total leverage, it was 356%. Top ten equity holdings included Energy Transfer LP, ONEOK Inc., and MPLX LP. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed net asset value (NAV) of ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc. provides an essential snapshot for investors assessing the intrinsic value of the fund's shares. With a NAV per share of $49.51, the fund's valuation is a key metric for potential buy or sell decisions. The reported asset coverage ratios, at 459% for senior indebtedness and 356% for total leverage, significantly exceed the 300% minimum typically required under the 1940 Act, indicating a robust buffer against potential declines in asset values.Moreover, the top ten equity holdings, comprising nearly 75% of the fund's investments, reflect a concentrated exposure to the energy sector. This concentration could lead to higher volatility in the fund’s performance, especially considering the fluctuating nature of energy markets. Investors should be aware of the implications of this sector focus on the fund's risk profile and its potential performance in various market conditions. Market Research Analyst An examination of ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc.'s portfolio reveals a significant allocation towards midstream energy companies. This sector is known for its fee-based income, which can provide a relatively stable cash flow. However, the fund's performance is inherently tied to the health of the energy sector and specifically to the demand for transportation and storage of oil and gas. Market trends such as the transition to renewable energy sources and fluctuating commodity prices could affect the valuation of these holdings.Investors should also consider the potential impact of regulatory changes on the midstream sector, which could influence the fund's asset coverage ratios and overall performance. The fund's reliance on a few key holdings also presents a concentration risk, which could be mitigated by diversification strategies within the broader investment portfolio. Tax Specialist The presence of a deferred tax liability on ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc.'s balance sheet is indicative of the fund's strategy of deferring taxable events. For investors, understanding the tax implications of the fund's investment strategy is critical, as it can affect the after-tax return on their investment. The fund's decision to defer taxes may be advantageous in the short term, but it is important to recognize that this liability represents a future outflow that could impact returns.Additionally, the change in reporting income tax payable, now separated from other liabilities, enhances transparency for shareholders. This allows for a clearer assessment of the fund's tax position and potential obligations that may arise from portfolio turnover. Investors should monitor how these tax liabilities evolve over time and consider their effect on the fund's net asset value and distributions. 04/05/2024 - 08:00 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund Inc.

The project is a significant step in the economic and social development of the Haisla Nation, allowing them to own and participate in a major industrial development in their territory. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Technology Analyst The order awarded to Baker Hughes by Black & Veatch for the Cedar LNG project in Canada underscores the ongoing transition within the energy sector towards lower carbon intensities and the increasing demand for electrically-driven solutions. By supplying turbomachinery equipment such as main refrigeration compressors, boil-off gas compressors and centrifugal pumps, Baker Hughes is positioning itself as a key player in the LNG market's shift to more sustainable practices.From an energy technology perspective, the use of electric-driven equipment, powered by renewable electricity, represents a significant advancement in reducing the carbon footprint of LNG facilities. The integration of such technologies is expected to enhance the operational efficiency and environmental compatibility of Cedar LNG, potentially setting a new standard for future developments in the industry. This could lead to a competitive advantage for Baker Hughes, as demand for green technologies is likely to increase in response to global decarbonization efforts.Moreover, the project's significance for the Haisla Nation's economic and social development could serve as a model for other indigenous communities seeking to participate in sustainable industrial developments. This aspect of the project may influence investor perception positively, as it aligns with growing trends in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. Market Research Analyst The Cedar LNG project is indicative of a broader industry trend where companies and investors are increasingly attentive to the environmental impact of energy production. The partnership between the Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline Corporation, along with the involvement of a global player like Baker Hughes, reflects a collaborative approach to energy projects that could become more prevalent.From a market standpoint, Baker Hughes' involvement in Cedar LNG may boost investor confidence in the company's ability to secure significant orders and maintain a strong position in the LNG equipment market. The project's emphasis on low-carbon intensity and the potential to supply customers transitioning away from higher carbon feedstocks could open up new markets and drive demand for Baker Hughes' services.Furthermore, the announcement of this order booking in the first quarter of 2024 could have positive implications for Baker Hughes' financial performance in the short to medium term. It also highlights the company's positive demand momentum following several major LNG orders over the past year, which is a noteworthy consideration for stakeholders assessing the company's market trajectory and growth potential. Environmental Policy Analyst The Cedar LNG project represents a convergence of environmental sustainability and indigenous economic empowerment, which is increasingly relevant in policy discussions. The project's design, which prioritizes low carbon intensity by leveraging renewable electricity, aligns with Canada's environmental policies and its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The involvement of the Haisla Nation is particularly significant as it reflects an evolving framework for indigenous participation in major industrial developments. This could influence future policy-making by demonstrating the viability of such partnerships, potentially shaping how governments and corporations approach resource development projects with respect to indigenous lands and communities.For stakeholders, the project's compliance with stringent environmental standards and its potential to contribute to Canada's decarbonization goals are important considerations. These factors could impact the regulatory landscape for LNG facilities and influence investor sentiment towards companies that are proactive in adopting environmentally responsible practices. 04/05/2024 - 08:00 AM Baker Hughes will supply Black & Veatch with turbomachinery equipment consisting of four electric-driven main refrigeration compressors, two electric-driven boil-off gas compressors and six centrifugal pumpsCedar LNG will be powered by renewable electricity to make it one of the lowest carbon intensity LNG facilities in the worldProject is a key element of the Haisla Nation’s economic and social development, marking the first major industrial development in its territory it will own and in which it will participate HOUSTON & LONDON, April 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR), an energy technology company, announced Friday it was awarded an order from Black & Veatch, a global engineering, construction and consulting leader, to supply Cedar LNG in Canada with electric driven liquefaction technologies.

Today, the Haisla people are centered on Kitamaat Village. Home to approximately 700 of the 2,023+ Haisla membership, Kitamaat Village sits at the head of the Douglas Channel in British Columbia, Canada. “Black & Veatch is committed to helping our clients and the communities they serve make meaningful progress on their decarbonization journey,” said Laszlo von Lazar, president of Black & Veatch’s Energy & Process Industries business. “The Cedar LNG project represents an important step toward reducing carbon emissions through lower-carbon LNG facilities that can supply customers looking to move away from more carbon intensive feedstocks. This is an important aspect of near-term decarbonization plans around the world, and Canada’s abundant natural gas supply means Cedar LNG is in a strong position to accelerate this phase of the energy transition.
