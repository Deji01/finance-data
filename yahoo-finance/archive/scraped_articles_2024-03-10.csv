Motley Fool,Billionaire Bill Gates Has Over Half of His $42 Billion Portfolio Invested in These 3 Dividend Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-bill-gates-over-half-185000568.html,One of these dividend stocks won't be a surprise at all.,"Do billionaires like dividend stocks? Absolutely. Just take a look at the holdings of famous billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett and Ken Griffin. They're loaded with dividend stocks.Bill Gates stands out as another great example. Although he doesn't manage a public company or hedge fund like Buffett and Griffin do, he's donated a boatload of money to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. And over half of this charitable foundation's $42 billion portfolio is invested in these three dividend stocks.1. MicrosoftIt should come as no surprise that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) remains Gates' favorite stock. After all, he co-founded the technology company along with Paul Allen and led it for years. Microsoft ranks as the top holding for the Gates Foundation Trust by far, making up 33.98% of its total portfolio at the end of 2023.Many tech companies don't pay dividends, but Microsoft is an exception. The company initiated a dividend program in 2003. Over the last 10 years, Microsoft has increased its dividend payout by nearly 168%. Its dividend yield, though, is still only 0.74%.One key reason why the yield is so low is that Microsoft's share price has soared. The stock has been a 10-bagger over the last 10 years and is up almost 60% over the last 12 months.2. Canadian National RailwayThe Gates Foundation isn't just betting on tech stocks such as Microsoft. Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) ranks as its third-largest holding, making up nearly 16.3% of the total portfolio.Canadian National Railway isn't limited to just Canada. It has 20,000 or so miles of rail that transport products in the middle part of the U.S. as well. The company also offers transportation and logistics services in addition to rail operations.The transportation company has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years, most recently boosting its dividend payout by 7% in the first quarter of 2024. Its dividend yield currently stands at 1.94%.Story continues3. CaterpillarCaterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is the fifth-largest position for the Gates Foundation. It makes up 5.14% of the total portfolio. That brings the combined weight of these three dividend stocks to 55.41%.The Gates Foundation has owned Caterpillar since the fourth quarter of 2005. However, the last time it added shares of the equipment manufacturer was back in the fourth quarter of 2013. The most recent transaction involving Caterpillar came in 2022 Q1, with the sale of roughly 24% of the foundation's stake in the company.Caterpillar has generated nice dividend income for the Gates Foundation through the years. The company has paid a dividend every quarter since 1933 and has increased its payout for 29 consecutive years. Its dividend now yields 1.55%.Are Bill Gates' top dividend stocks smart picks for other investors?It isn't a good idea to buy any stock just because a billionaire investor owns it. For one thing, the factors at play when the billionaire first bought the stock could have changed over time.My view is that income investors can find plenty of other stocks that offer more attractive dividends than Microsoft, Canadian National Railways, and Caterpillar. Value investors can find better choices as well.Are any of these stocks good picks for growth-oriented investors? We can cross Canadian National Railways and Caterpillar off the list. Microsoft, however, should have tremendous growth prospects thanks largely to the rising adoption of generative AI. Its shares have a lot of growth baked in, though, with a forward earnings multiple of over 31x. Still, I think Microsoft is still worthy of consideration for long-term growth investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?Before you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Caterpillar wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is Fisker Stock Going to Zero?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fisker-stock-going-zero-184100877.html,"After setbacks, delays, and numerous other challenges in 2023, Fisker's ability to continue operating is in doubt.","It wasn't long ago that electric vehicle (EV) sales were gaining traction and appeared on the cusp of breaking into mainstream territory. Oh, how quickly things can change. Start-up EV maker Fisker (NYSE: FSR) is now struggling to survive amid high interest rates, charging infrastructure challenges, intensifying competition, and a dwindling cash pile. But is Fisker stock doomed to drop to zero, or is there still hope for long-term investors?The ugly numbersIn late February, Fisker reported a rough fourth-quarter net loss of $463 million while announcing plans to slash 15% of its workforce. While the company managed to generate $200 million in revenue, Fisker's cash and cash equivalents dwindled to $396 million.Those ugly numbers were driven by a full year of challenges, including delays with suppliers and troubles delivering vehicles to customers. In fact, Fisker only managed to produce 10,000 vehicles in 2023, which was less than a quarter of its initial guidance, and it couldn't even deliver half of those vehicles.In the middle of February, Fisker received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) due to its stock closing below $1 per share on average for 30 consecutive trading days, which could lead to an eventual delisting from the exchange.If you want to pile on the bad news, you can throw on the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opening a preliminary evaluation after receiving four claims of unintended vehicle movement in 2023 Fisker ocean vehicles. The complaints allege people were unable to shift into park and/or the vehicle did not shift into the intended gear. One complaint involves an alleged injury.In its Feb. 29 report, Fisked noted challenges and said it ""expects to conclude there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern when its annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, are filed with the SEC.""Story continuesOverall, things are looking pretty dire for the EV start-up company, but there is a glimmer of hope for investors in the form of a potential partnership.Enter Nissan2024 is sure to bring some unexpected developments in the EV industry, but Nissan (OTC: NSANY) potentially coming to Fisker's rescue is unexpected, to put it mildly. That could be the case, however, as Nissan and Fisker are in advanced talks for a deal that would provide the Japanese automaker with a platform for an electric pickup truck and throw a lifeline to the struggling EV company.The potential financial lifeline would send more than $400 million in investment to Fisker, enabling Nissan to build its own electric pickup on Fisker's truck platform while also producing Fisker's planned Alaska pickup in 2026 at one of Nissan's U.S. assembly plants.Is it enough?While Nissan's potential lifeline would be welcomed by investors, the truth is that Fisker is likely to need much more help, as the threat of bankruptcy is a real one. Fisker previously mentioned that it was in talks with a debt holder about potential investment, which is desperately needed.Even if Nissan and Fisker close the deal, the latter's Alaska truck -- anticipated to debut with a price tag around $45,000 -- might be far from the saving grace it needs. The truck would be competing in a segment with Ford's F-150 Lightning, General Motors' Chevrolet Silverado EV, Rivian's R1T and its upcoming R2 platform of vehicles, and Tesla's Cybertruck.There are many avenues for Fisker stock to avoid hitting zero and without significant help, Fisker's story could realistically end in the next 12 months.Should you invest $1,000 in Fisker right now?Before you buy stock in Fisker, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Fisker wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ai-stock-nvidia-vs-183000082.html,Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have made investors huge profits over the past year.,"You're a very happy investor if you've owned Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) over the past year. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock is up 530%, while Supermicro's has risen an astounding 1,300%.In other words, if you invested $10,000 in each company on Jan. 1, 2023, you'd have nearly $205,000. But after that kind of performance, many investors may wonder if they can still invest in these two AI leaders without the risk of losing serious capital in just a few months.So, are either of these two stocks a buy right now? And if so, which is the better purchase?Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are not competitorsNvidia makes best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) that are perfect for training AI models. GPUs can process intense calculations efficiently, making them the best tool for the job. When a client wants to build a supercomputer capable of training AI models, it doesn't order a handful of GPUs; it orders thousands. With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, costing an estimated $30,000 a piece, that's a massive growth driver for Nvidia.However, you can't just connect these GPUs together with a few cables and call it a day. You need a specialized server that properly networks these devices and combines them in clusters to maximize efficiency. That's where Super Micro Computer comes in.While some tech giants may have this expertise in-house, many do not, so they contract Supermicro to build their servers. Supermicro has many different server designs based on the application and expected workload size, so customers of all varieties can find what they need.This highlights the first difference between these two investments: Nvidia is a company that nearly all AI-focused businesses work with, while only some work with Supermicro. This doesn't mean Supermicro is doomed to fail, but it is a risk factor investors should consider. Supermicro could be dethroned by a competitor undercutting pricing, while Nvidia might only be knocked off its pedestal by someone creating a more powerful GPU -- something competitors have been struggling to do for a long time.Story continuesWhen examining each company's financials, Nvidia also starts to pull away.Nvidia's stock is cheaper than Supermicro'sBoth companies are growing rapidly, and their projections for the next quarter are also quite strong. In Q4 of FY 2024 (ending Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. It also gave guidance for Q1 revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% growth.Supermicro also delivered strong results, with its Q2 FY 2024 (ending Dec. 31) revenue rising 103% to $3.67 billion. For its next quarter, Supermicro projects growth of 188% to 219%, placing it in the same realm as Nvidia.While Nvidia experienced the first wave of GPU demand, Supermicro's growth is just starting. However, the stock already responded with strong price appreciation because investors know what kind of growth to expect based on Nvidia's performance over the past year.As a result, Supermicro's stock is much more expensive than Nvidia's on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartUsing a forward P/E ratio when a company is undergoing a massive change is wise, as it uses analyst projections to value it. There is still room for error (as no one has a crystal ball), but it gives investors an idea of what they're paying for.Because Nvidia is cheaper from this metric and has stronger growth and vital product positioning, I think it's a much better buy than Super Micro Computer.Should the strong AI demand persist for a few years, both stocks could be excellent picks, but Nvidia remains the king of AI investment opportunities right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Super Micro Computer Stock Is Going to $941. Is It a Sell Around $1,140?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-160000317.html,"Up more than 1,000% over the last year, can the red-hot AI stock really keep marching higher?","Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been on an incredible run over the last year, and it's attracting lots of attention on Wall Street. On Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts published a note initiating coverage on Supermicro. The investment firm assigned a ""neutral"" rating on the stock, indicating that it does not recommend buying or selling shares right now.Goldman's analysts also put a one-year price target of $941 per share on the stock. With the artificial intelligence (AI) stock priced at roughly $1,140 per share, that would imply potential downside of 17% over the next year. Has Supermicro stock become too risky?Can Supermicro stock keep rising or is it time to sell?In Goldman's note on Supermicro, the analysts indicate that the massive run-up for the server specialist's valuation has been warranted. The analysts pointed to the company's strengths in the high-performance server market and status as an ""AI winner"" with valuable business relationships as legitimate catalysts for its incredible stock gains. Supermicro's share price is up more than 1,000% over the last year.On the other hand, Goldman now thinks that most of the positive near-term growth catalysts are already priced into the stock. Given that Super Micro Computer stock is trading at roughly 52 times this year's expected earnings, the stage may be set for shares to see some volatility in the near term. Of course, the stock could go on to deliver stronger long-term performance, even if Goldman's team winds up being exactly correct with its pricing forecast.Explosive gains have pushed Supermicro stock to more speculative valuation levels, but the business's outlook is evolving in very favorable directions. I wouldn't recommend selling the stock right now.For investors with high-risk tolerance, I think taking a buy-and-hold approach to the stock could still have substantial payoffs. But investors should take a balanced approach to constructing their portfolio of AI stocks and avoid betting too heavily on any single name or making huge investments all at once -- particularly in cases where valuations have seen dramatic run-ups.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Arm Holdings Faces a Huge Test This Week. Will the Hot AI Stock Fly or Die?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-holdings-faces-huge-test-144700415.html,Its post-IPO lockup period is set to expire on Tuesday. Here's what to expect.,"Move over, Nvidia. There's a new artificial intelligence (AI) stock making waves across Wall Street.Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) has been public for less than six months, but the chip company best known for licensing its low-power processor designs has edged out even Nvidia so far in 2024. Through March 6, Arm stock is up 82% for the year, compared to a 79% gain for Nvidia.Arm shares surged on its earnings report in February after the company beat quarterly estimates and raised its guidance significantly for the fiscal year. The company also made it clear that it was fully participating in the AI boom.""The AI wave drove licensing growth, as these new devices require Arm's performant and power-efficient compute platform,"" said CEO Rene Haas in the fiscal Q3 2024 press release. The company further noted that its better-than-expected license revenue growth of 18% was due to demand for more advanced Arm CPUs as companies ramp up spending on AI.Image source: Getty Images.This coming week, Arm will face arguably its biggest test as a publicly traded company. The company's post-IPO lockup period will expire on Tuesday, meaning that insiders will have an opportunity to sell their stock for the first time. For high-flying tech IPOs like Arm, lockup expirations often create share price volatility.If there's major selling among insiders, the stock is likely to fall as the share price finds a new equilibrium at a higher float count. However, if the insiders hold their shares, Arm is likely to gain, as that would be a sign of confidence in its future from those who know the company best.What to expect from Arm's lockup expirationLess than 10% of Arm's 1.03 billion shares outstanding are currently publicly traded. Prior to the IPO, Arm had been owned by Softbank Group (OTC: SFTBF), which took the company private back in 2016.Softbank sold 95.5 million shares in the IPO and gave underwriters the option of selling an additional 7 million shares. That left Softbank with roughly 90.6% of the stock. In addition to Softbank Group and CEO Masayoshi Son being able to sell that stock, Arm employees will also be able to sell 11.4 million restricted shares that had previously been off-limits.Story continuesWhy Arm stock should pass the testSome Arm employees are likely to take advantage of their opportunity to sell, as the company's shares have nearly tripled from their IPO price of $51, but a little game theory should explain why Softbank is likely to hold on to its stake in the company.Son has over $100 billion worth of Arm stock, and he wants to protect its value. Dumping a significant amount of stock and crashing the share price would be a terrible mistake. It is likely that Softbank will unload Arm shares gradually over time as the company chose to take Arm public, but it won't jeopardize the value of the stock in doing so. Softbank could also retain its entire stake, as Arm looks like its most promising play on the AI boom at the moment.Softbank has had both hits and misses over the years. Famously, the company lost billions on WeWork, and Son surely wants to protect the gains he's made with Arm, which his company took private for $32 billion in 2016. Therefore, a post-lockup share price crash seems unlikely, as that would only happen if Son started selling a significant piece of Softbank's stake.Image source: Getty Images.Whatever happens, Arm looks like a good long-term buyWhile the stock is likely to be volatile this week, long-term investors should look past the noise and focus on the company's fundamentals and its bright future in AI.Arm stock is expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 112 based on this year's expected adjusted EPS, but the company has several competitive advantages that should help its growth accelerate as AI applications go mainstream.First, it has a close working relationship with Nvidia, which tried to buy it in 2020. Nvidia, for example, is licensing Arm's technology for its GH 200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which is a key component in AI servers from Super Micro Computer, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and others, and represents the next generation of the enormously popular H100, which has been in high demand for running AI models since the launch of ChatGPT.Additionally, Arm's unique business model should also give it an advantage. Rather than selling its products directly to end users like most semiconductor companies, Arm licenses its technologies to chip partners like Nvidia or Alphabet's Google, and receives royalties as they sell products that use Arm's architecture. That gives Arm a smoother revenue stream than most chipmakers. Part of the reason the stock soared so much on its earnings report last month is that Arm's licensing revenue jumped more than expected, which bodes well for its royalty revenue in the coming quarters, as royalties follow new licenses.In the same vein, Arm's low-power CPU architecture, which is prized in smartphones, is also highly valuable in running AI models, which tend to use relatively enormous amounts of power. That advantage should also lead to increased demand for licenses over the coming quarters and more royalties down the road. The company did not offer guidance for its fiscal 2025, but sales and profit growth are likely to accelerate as it benefits more from the AI boom.Current shareholders and those considering buying the stock should pay attention to what happens when the lockup period expires on Tuesday. However, the business looks well positioned for strong growth over the coming years, no matter what happens this week. Still, if the market reacts to the lockup expiration with a significant sell-off, it would present a good buying opportunity for the hot AI stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Small Semiconductor Stock Up 50% in 2024 Alone -- Is It Too Late to Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-small-semiconductor-stock-50-143000032.html,It isn't just Nvidia and Super Micro Computer that are off to the races.,"2024 has gotten off to quite the start. As investors warm up to the idea that a new bull market has begun, interest has flooded into the semiconductor industry, with names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and their artificial intelligence (AI) system assembler partner Super Micro Computer skyrocketing.Small-cap stock ACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) has gone wild, too, up 50% so far in 2024 alone and up some 270% since the beginning of 2023 (as of March 6, 2024). The chip manufacturing equipment company has picked up steam on a better-than-expected growth and profit outlook. But can the run continue?An odd business model, hidden by a stellar stock chartThe U.S. has been tightening export controls to China on the most advanced semiconductors used in AI systems, as well as the most advanced equipment used to manufacture said semiconductors. Besides these AI chips, though, there's a world of other types of semiconductors needed for things like electric vehicles and industrial machinery. China has been building its own chip manufacturing industry in support of these more ""mature"" types of not quite cutting-edge chips.Enter ACM Research (ACMR), which provides critical equipment for chip manufacturing. Specifically, ACMR provides machines that ""clean"" silicon wafers between manufacturing process steps. Everything from power management devices to sensors to more basic logic and memory go through dozens of steps before the silicon wafers are cut up into chips. ACMR can help facilitate nearly all of these steps, regardless of the individual processes for each type of semiconductor.The company's sales rocketed 43% higher in 2023 to $558 million, including a 56% year-over-year increase in sales in Q4. That's impressive, given ACMR's equipment type is dominated by industry giants like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron. Management believes revenue will rise as much as another 30% in 2024, and reach a range of $650 million to $725 million.Story continuesBut here's where some oddities come into play. Though it's a Silicon Valley-based business, ACMR operates through a majority-owned subsidiary called ACM Shanghai (which had an initial public offering in China a few years ago) that accounts for nearly all of the company's sales. ACMR is quite transparent about this, pointing this fact out at the top of its investor relations homepage.At this point, there's no reason to believe that ACMR is skirting U.S. export controls, given that most of its machines are used for those more ""mature"" chips versus those used in AI. Nevertheless, geopolitical risk (or perhaps the threat of it at some point) does pose a particular reason for concern for would-be ACMR investors.Is it too late to buy this semiconductor stock?Geopolitical intrigue aside, ACMR is making solid financial progress. Shares trade for 24 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), and just 19 times EPS based on Wall Street's consensus estimates for 2024. For such a fast-growing business, even one that participates in the highly cyclical semiconductor manufacturing space, ACMR looks cheap.And given investor appetite for all things semiconductors right now, it's hard to call a top in stocks like ACMR. The market is eyeing long-term potential for the industry, as China, the U.S., and other countries are all trying to onshore semiconductor manufacturing in the wake of the pandemic. ACMR could be sitting on years of growth as a result.Do bear in mind that said growth does come at a cost. ACMR has been operating in the red on a free-cash-flow (FCF) basis, as its rapid pace of expansion has it spending cash. Note that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and EPS are positive because capital expenditures used to calculate FCF are amortized over time.ACMR Net Income (TTM) ChartAt any rate, there are plenty of reasons for optimism for this stock. I'm sitting on my hands given the heightened political uncertainty, but ACM Research is nevertheless a fascinating story to watch unfold.Should you invest $1,000 in ACM Research right now?Before you buy stock in ACM Research , consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ACM Research wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Entertainment Stocks Set to Soar as the Digital Future Unfolds,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-entertainment-stocks-set-soar-142100421.html,Step into the future of entertainment with a diverse range of insights on the next big investment opportunities.,"In today's rapidly evolving economy, the technology and media sectors are converging before our eyes -- creating unique investment opportunities along the way.Discerning investors are constantly on the lookout for companies poised to lead these transformations. Three Motley Fool contributors, who focus on tech and media investing, have joined forces to explore the advancements in digital advertising, content streaming, and interactive platforms. Let's take a closer look at three exciting investment ideas in widely separate corners of the entertainment sector.The Sphere launched into orbit last quarter, and insiders are buying bigBilly Duberstein (Sphere Entertainment): Sphere Entertainment (NYSE: SPHR), formerly known as MSG Entertainment, was formed when MSG Entertainment split into two companies, Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. and Sphere Entertainment, in April 2023.Sphere seems to be the more interesting of the two remaining companies, as it includes the new-age concert venue The Sphere in Las Vegas. Additionally, Sphere also holds the MSG cable networks, which are profitable but face growth headwinds due to cord-cutting. Sphere also held the Tao restaurant/club business, but Sphere has since divested that business, leaving just The Sphere and MSG Networks.The company just reported the first full quarter of operating results for The Sphere Las Vegas, and they were encouraging. Featuring a residency by the band U2 and showings of director Darren Aronofsky's Postcard from Earth, the venue hauled in $167.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million in non-GAAP (adjusted) operating income. While that may not seem like much profit, it seems as though the venue will be able to get more efficient with its showings of both movies, concerts, and dance parties going forward, packing more events into the schedule while also getting more efficient with costs.In fact, The Sphere only had $67.3 million in ""direct"" operating expenses, with the majority of costs taken up by selling, general, and administrative costs. Going forward, it's probably a decent bet The Sphere won't need as much marketing investment as it becomes more of a well-known destination. Jam bands Phish and Dead & Co. have already announced residencies this spring, so the venue seems like it's becoming a trendy destination for entertainers and customers alike.Story continuesThe company also plans to franchise The Sphere to other cities internationally. But the company won't have to undertake the immense costs that were associated with building the owned venue in Vegas. In fact, The Sphere owns the construction company that will build future Spheres, so the company will rake in construction revenue while future Spheres are built, then capital-light franchise fees going forward.Meanwhile, the company's valuation seems compelling. The consolidated company raked in $51.4 million in total operating income last quarter, annualizing to $205 million. The Sphere's $1.67 billion market cap goes for just about 8 times those adjusted profits.Management seems to agree, with chairman and CEO James Dolan buying around $2.4 million worth of stock on Feb. 26, then another $3.1 million worth of stock on Feb. 28. Those buys were made around $40 to $41 per share, not much lower than today's $48 share price.Overall, The Sphere is a new consumer entertainment franchise investors shouldn't ignore.The Trade Desk charges into the future of effective advertising with tight privacyAnders Bylund (The Trade Desk): Imagine if Madison Avenue's ad execs had a matchmaking service, but for ads and eyeballs. That's what The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) does, connecting advertisers to consumers across many different channels, optimizing the living daylights out of the marketing budget.Billboards and TV ads are going digital in a big way, and The Trade Desk is there to help ad buyers make the most out of digital ad channels. It's not just about placing ads; it's about making meaningful, long-lasting connections.That's not as easy as it sounds. The identity of each potential ad viewer is protected by many layers of privacy protections nowadays, and their privacy will only grow more robust when Alphabet removes support for third-party tracking cookies in the ubiquitous Chrome web-browsing engine later this year.But The Trade Desk stands ready to roll with that incoming punch, equipped with a new system for tracking anonymized user behavior. Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) provides an encrypted, user-consented identifier that enables personalized advertising while respecting user privacy. In this system, the web user's online content consumption patterns are blended into anonymous cohorts of people with similar habits, giving ad buyers the data they need and connecting viewers to ads that should feel relevant to them.UID2 is an open system, available for any marketing project manager or ad buyer, but The Trade Desk invented it and remains the driving force behind it. By making UID2 accessible to all, it's not just leading by example; it's inviting the entire industry to elevate its game. This approach not only cements The Trade Desk's position as a pioneer, but also challenges the market to adopt higher standards of privacy and personalization.It's a bold move, indicative of a leader that's confident not just in its innovation but in the positive ripple effects it can create across the digital landscape. Against that audacious backdrop, it's not surprising to see The Trade Desk coming back from the inflation-based digital ad market downturn stronger than before. The company is outpacing the revenue growth of every digital advertising player worth mentioning while generating $543 million of free cash flows in the last four quarters.Remember, the ad market's downturn is still going on, albeit with brighter days ahead. The Trade Desk has already started its return to business as usual while most of its rivals are lagging behind. I can't wait to see how this innovative marketing expert will perform when the digital cookie jar goes away. The stock is richly valued at 230 times trailing earnings and 21 times sales, but for all the right reasons. You should consider picking up a few shares before the stock runs any higher.The best yet to come for Netflix stock?Nicholas Rossolillo (Netflix): For years, I've been content to sit on the sidelines and watch the Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) party from afar. Part of the reason was discomfort with the company's in-house production strategy. Just over a decade ago, Netflix went down the original content creation rabbit hole, and began making its own TV shows and movies, funded with debt (House of Cards was its first foray in 2013). I was unclear how producing content, much of which has limited shelf life, with long-term debt, would pan out.Also influencing my decision to sit it out with Netflix, Walt Disney was in my portfolio, and I thought I was already sitting on a long-term winner in the media and entertainment industry. Turns out, not so much. I recently exited my longtime market-losing position in the House of Mouse (and house of Marvel, and Star Wars, making things all that more confounding), and re-allocated much of the proceeds to Netflix.But why buy Netflix now? After all, Netflix now has a market cap of nearly $260 billion (much larger than Disney's), as the TV streaming leader has been on a hot streak in the last year. However, it looks like the hot streak could keep going.You see, after funding years worth of content using debt and steadily picking up millions of sticky subscribers along the way, Netflix turned an important corner in the last couple of years. The company is now profitable by all metrics -- both on a GAAP net income and free-cash-flow basis. In the past, I was skeptical of the negative free cash flow in particular, as it was reflective of the current outflow of money to fund productions. GAAP net income was positive, though, because video content expenses are amortized over time in this profit metric.NFLX Net Income (TTM) ChartNFLX Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) ChartGranted, the recent big jump in free cash flow will moderate in 2024 as Netflix will ramp up productions in the U.S. once again after writer and actor strikes in 2023 hampered its efforts. Nevertheless, the trend is quite clear. Netflix has grown up, and it's looking like a highly profitable media business with a long runway ahead. Building a digital ads business, expanding to more places around the globe, and gradually increasing its reach with more content (self-funded with profit now) are all levers Netflix can pull to keep things moving higher.None of this is groundbreaking insight. Many investors have known this for years, and it shows in the premium valuation (nearly 50 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, and 35 based on earnings estimates for 2024). But with Netflix now a highly profitable enterprise, I'm finally ready to hop aboard the bandwagon and hold for the long term, as the good times for shareholders could just be getting started.Should you invest $1,000 in Sphere Entertainment right now?Before you buy stock in Sphere Entertainment, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sphere Entertainment wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Incredible Growth Stock Down 77% You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-incredible-growth-stock-down-141500222.html,Short-term challenges are offering a great opportunity to buy this stock as it turns things around.,"Investing in growth stocks requires a lot of patience and a tolerance for pain. A growth stock could go up much faster than the market, but it could also fall a lot harder.Such is the case of Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). The once high-flying stock, fueled by a deluge of early pandemic purchases, is currently suffering a massive hangover in its earnings three years later. Shares currently trade around 77% below their all-time high reached in 2021.To be sure, Etsy's most recent earnings report was disappointing. Gross merchandise sales (GMS) fell 0.7% year over year, ending the full year down 1.2%. Guidance wasn't very inspiring, either, with management expecting another year-over-year decline in GMS.But right now could be a great time to buy Etsy stock. Here's why.A durable competitive advantageEtsy's position as the leading marketplace for non-commoditized and customizable products is untouchable. And that competitive advantage shows up in its finances. Despite the declining merchandise sales in the back half of the year, Etsy still managed to grow revenue. Revenue climbed 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 7.1% for the full year.How can a marketplace grow revenue despite producing fewer sales for merchants? Simple: It's taking a bigger bite of the apple. Etsy's seller fees increased from 5% to 6.5% in 2022. It's also pushing more sellers to use its advertising platform. As a result, the take rate has climbed from 17.8% before the fee increase to 21% in its most recent quarter.One might think increasing the take rate would motivate sellers to find another marketplace to sell their goods on, but that hasn't been the case. While it initially saw some pushback, active sellers have increased from 7,654 before the price hike to 9,035 by the end of 2023. That speaks to the fact that Etsy is the place where consumers shop for customizable and other non-commoditized products.The competition is winning right now, but the tide will turnEtsy's fourth-quarter earnings presentation included a couple of slides comparing its performance relative to the overall e-commerce industry, as well as in select categories.Story continuesThe recent pattern is clear. Against the backdrop of the overall e-commerce market, Etsy has been losing share over the last two years after several years of well-above-average growth. But if you zoom in on categories like apparel, toys and games, and party supplies, Etsy is doing much better than pure-play e-commerce companies in those areas.CEO Josh Silverman provided more context during Etsy's earnings call. He said Amazon, Walmart, Temu, and SHEIN are the only e-commerce companies gaining share right now. And the reason they're currently winning is because they're able to offer better prices than anyone else either through economies of scale or simply outspending everyone. (Temu also dropped about $50 million on Super Bowl ads and promotions.)Currently, there's a preference for the cheapest version of a product. There's a lot of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures are still very strong. But Silverman believes the tide will turn eventually, if not soon. And when you look at how Etsy holds up against direct competitors in its biggest categories, it's encouraging to know that when people return to more specialty retailers, Etsy stands to benefit more than others.The stock price is dirt cheapAfter several quarters of disappointing gross merchandise sales growth, investors have severely punished Etsy stock. And while it might not have deserved the sky-high valuation it was trading for in late 2021, the stock looks downright cheap today.Shares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.4. That's lower than the S&P 500 despite the fact that analysts are expecting average earnings growth of 22.6% over the next five years. That also means Etsy's PEG ratio is less than 1, which is a sign the stock is undervalued.Etsy is also cheap on a price-to-sales measurement. It trades for less than 3 times forward sales estimates. As revenue reaccelerates from a turnaround in GMS and higher take rates, that multiple should prove to be far below fair value.To be sure, an investment in Etsy will require patience. But management has done well to hang on to its pandemic-fueled gains and improve its standing in hand-crafted and non-commoditized products. As long as that position stays intact, investors should feel comfortable holding the stock, even if its price is volatile.Should you invest $1,000 in Etsy right now?Before you buy stock in Etsy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Etsy wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Looking at ExxonMobil? Consider These 3 Energy Stocks Instead,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-exxonmobil-consider-3-energy-141200087.html,These stocks could be better investments than ExxonMobil for some investors.,"ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a great oil company. It has delivered peer-leading growth across several key metrics over the past several years. It also has the longest dividend-growth streak in the oil patch at 41 consecutive years.However, ExxonMobil might not be the best energy stock for all investors. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as potentially better investment opportunities. Here's why investors looking at ExxonMobil should also consider these energy stocks.Chevron has a higher yield and lower leverageReuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): ExxonMobil, with a market cap of nearly $420 billion, is a much larger company than Chevron, which has a market cap a touch below $280 billion. So if you want the 800-pound gorilla in the energy sector you should buy ExxonMobil. But after that one data point, ExxonMobil and Chevron are very similar integrated energy companies. Chevron, meanwhile, has a couple of key stats that might tip the scale in its direction.CVX Debt to Equity Ratio ChartFirst off, Chevron's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.12 times versus ExxonMobil's 0.18 times. Chevron's lower leverage is a trend that has been in place for a number of years at this point but winds up being important because of the cyclical nature of the oil patch. When oil prices fall, Chevron and ExxonMobil both lean on their balance sheets to support their businesses and continue to pay their dividend. Chevron simply has more leeway on that front today.And then there's the dividend. Yes, ExxonMobil's 41-year streak of annual increases is better than the 36 years Chevron has put up, but both are still impressive shows of dividend commitment. They really stand toe-to-toe on this factor. But Chevron's dividend yield is 4.3% today compared to ExxonMobil's 3.6%. That makes Chevron a much more attractive dividend stock.If you are looking at ExxonMobil, Chevron is very similar and, perhaps, even better in two very important ways.Story continuesA much bigger yield than ExxonMobilNeha Chamaria (Enterprise Products Partners): Investors in energy often flock to ExxonMobil for two reasons: the oil giant's rock-solid dividend-growth streak, backed by steady cash flows and strong financials. After all, 41 years of consecutive annual dividend increases in a cyclical sector like energy is no joke.Yet, while there's no denying that ExxonMobil has proven its mettle, there's another energy stock that looks promising for long-term investors: Enterprise Products Partners. Enterprise Products may not have a long dividend-growth track record like ExxonMobil, but it has raised its dividends every year for the past 25 consecutive years nonetheless, and the dividend yield is a solid 7.2%, or twice ExxonMobil's yield.Importantly, its high yield is well-supported by cash flows, making Enterprise Products' dividends reliable. In 2023, for example, Enterprise Products generated enough distributable cash flows (DCF) to cover its dividends by 1.7 times. In fact, its DCF has consistently remained above 1.5 times since 2018. Operating in the midstream oil and gas space helps as Enterprise Products' cash flows tend to be more stable than ExxonMobil's given the largely contractual nature of its services.XOM Cash from Operations (TTM) ChartAs for its financial fortitude, Enterprise Products has manageable debt and ample liquidity, and it boasts one of the highest credit ratings in the midstream energy space.Like ExxonMobil, Enterprise Products has proven its mettle over the years, and with management committed to dividend growth while expanding the company's infrastructure, an investment in Enterprise Products stock should pay off in the long run.A much, much lower-risk energy stockMatt DiLallo (Enbridge): As an oil and gas producer, ExxonMobil is a price taker. It must sell its output at the going market rate, which could be high or low depending on market conditions. Because of that, its earnings can be very volatile. For example, while ExxonMobil earned $36 billion last year, that was about $20 billion less than it hauled in during 2022 when oil and gas prices were much higher. Commodity prices don't matter much to Enbridge. The Canadian pipeline and utility company gets 98% of its earnings from stable, predictable cost-of-service arrangements and long-term contracts. It gets paid the same rate no matter the price of the oil and gas flowing through its massive pipeline systems. Enbridge also generates predictable earnings from operating natural gas utilities and renewable energy assets. Because of that, its cash flow has steadily grown (and achieved the company's annual guidance) despite significant market dislocations over the years: Image source: Enbridge.Enbridge's business model also gives it much more visibility into its earnings growth. The company expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to rise by 7% to 9% annually through 2026 and grow at around a 5% annual rate after that. The company's stable revenue frameworks and growing backlog of expansion projects give it lots of visibility into future earnings growth. They also drive Enbridge's view that it can continue increasing its 7.7%-yielding dividend, which it has raised for 29 straight years. That higher yield, along with its more predictable business model, makes Enbridge a much lower-risk way to invest in energy stocks.
