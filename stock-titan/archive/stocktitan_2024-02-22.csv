Flex LNG - Ex Date Q4 2023,2024-02-22T06:13:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Flex LNG Ltd. (FLNG) announces a dividend of USD 0.75 per share for Q4 2023, payable on February 22, 2024, with shares trading ex-dividend as of the same date.","Flex LNG - Ex Date Q4 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Flex LNG Ltd. (FLNG) announces a dividend of USD 0.75 per share for Q4 2023, payable on February 22, 2024, with shares trading ex-dividend as of the same date. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Flex LNG Ltd.'s ex-dividend date signifies a critical juncture for investors, as it marks the cutoff for entitlement to the company's declared dividend. At USD 0.75 per share, this dividend payment reflects the company's financial health and profitability. Shareholders must have owned the stock before this date to receive the dividend, which is an essential factor in the investment strategies of income-focused portfolios.Dividend payments often signal a company's confidence in its current financial position and future earnings prospects. This particular dividend payout could attract new investors looking for stable income streams, potentially increasing demand for the stock. Conversely, the stock price may adjust downwards on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equivalent to the dividend payout, as new buyers will not receive this dividend. This is a standard market reaction and should not unduly concern long-term investors.Investors should also consider the dividend yield, which is a ratio of the annual dividends per share to the stock's price. A high yield can be attractive, but it's essential to assess it in the context of the overall market and the company's payout ratio, which indicates what portion of earnings is paid out as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high may not be sustainable in the long run. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, Flex LNG's dividend declaration may influence investor perception of the company's sector, particularly if it contrasts with industry norms. If the dividend amount is higher than average for the LNG shipping sector, it could suggest that Flex LNG is outperforming its peers, or it may reflect a strategic decision to distribute more profits to shareholders.Furthermore, the timing and consistency of dividend payments can impact the stock's attractiveness to different investor segments. For instance, regular dividends are often a hallmark of mature, stable companies and can thus appeal to risk-averse investors. In contrast, growth-oriented investors might prioritize reinvestment of profits over immediate payouts.It's also worth noting that dividends are just one aspect of shareholder return, with stock buybacks and price appreciation also playing significant roles. A holistic view of the company's total return to shareholders is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of its investment potential. Economist Examining the broader economic implications, Flex LNG's dividend payment must be contextualized within the current macroeconomic environment. Factors such as interest rates, inflation and economic growth can all influence dividend sustainability. In a low-interest-rate environment, high-dividend stocks can become more attractive as they offer better returns than bonds or savings accounts.However, during times of economic uncertainty or inflationary pressure, companies may re-evaluate their dividend policies to conserve cash. Thus, the ability of Flex LNG to maintain or increase its dividend payout in such economic conditions could be a testament to its operational resilience and financial management.Additionally, the LNG market is subject to geopolitical influences, supply and demand dynamics and regulatory changes. These factors could affect Flex LNG's business operations and, subsequently, its ability to sustain dividend payments. Investors should consider these macroeconomic and sector-specific risks when evaluating the company's long-term dividend prospects. 02/22/2024 - 01:13 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The shares in Flex LNG Ltd.

Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The collaboration between Samsung Electronics, Juniper Networks and Wind River to develop a virtual cell site router (vCSR) represents a significant step in the evolution of 5G network infrastructure. The move towards end-to-end virtualization is a transformative shift that aligns with the broader industry trend towards network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN). By enabling service providers to deploy virtualized network functions across mobile core, radio access and transport elements, the vCSR facilitates a more flexible and agile network management approach.From a business perspective, this innovation is likely to have a pronounced impact on the operational and capital expenditure of telecommunications companies. The reduction in the need for physical router hardware not only translates to direct cost savings but also to indirect benefits such as energy efficiency and reduced space requirements. These factors contribute to a lower total cost of ownership (TCO), which is a critical consideration for service providers looking to scale their 5G networks while managing costs effectively. Additionally, the ability of vCSR to support diverse applications and security features such as firewalls offers a competitive edge in delivering value-added services. Financial Analyst The strategic partnership and technological advancement announced by Samsung, Juniper and Wind River have the potential to influence the stock performance of these companies. Investors typically view innovations that promise operational efficiency and cost savings positively, as they can lead to improved margins and profitability in the long term. The capability to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) through less hardware investment and operational expenditures (OpEx) through energy savings can be particularly attractive in the capital-intensive telecommunications sector.Moreover, the development of vCSR technology may enhance the market positioning of the involved companies, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue growth. This could be reflected in the stock valuation of these companies as investors anticipate the capture of future market opportunities enabled by this collaboration. The ability to deploy 5G services faster and more efficiently with vCSR technology also suggests a more favorable time-to-market (TTM), which is an important factor in the highly competitive telecommunications industry. Sustainability Expert The environmental implications of a move towards a virtualized network infrastructure are noteworthy. By consolidating multiple software network elements on the same server and eliminating the need for physical cell site routers, there is a significant opportunity for energy savings. The claim of a 30% reduction in energy use is substantial, considering the vast energy demands of global telecommunications networks. This shift not only supports the sustainability goals of the companies involved but also aligns with broader societal objectives to reduce carbon footprints and combat climate change.Furthermore, the adoption of virtualized network components can contribute to the circular economy by reducing electronic waste associated with physical network hardware. This is particularly relevant as the telecommunications industry faces increasing regulatory and consumer pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility. The sustainability benefits of the vCSR technology could serve as a differentiator for service providers, potentially influencing consumer preferences and regulatory compliance. 02/22/2024 - 03:01 AM Companies successfully create a new path toward an end-to-end virtualized network, spanning the mobile core, radio access and transport elements SEOUL, South Korea & SUNNYVALE, Calif. & ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Juniper Networks® (NYSE:JNPR) and Wind River® have collaborated on a virtual cell site router (vCSR) to allow service providers to operate their networks with end-to-end virtualization. This software-based network ensures more flexibility, agility, sustainability and faster time-to-market (TTM) for the introduction of new services. vCSR is part of a new architecture in which the distributed unit and CSR functions coexist as virtualized network elements on one server. In this joint effort, the companies integrated the Juniper Cloud-Native Router, a fully containerized network element, with the Samsung virtualized DU (vDU) on Wind River Studio Cloud Platform. By running multiple network elements on a single virtualized RAN (vRAN) server, the companies are essentially eliminating the need for physical router hardware typically deployed at a cell site and reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for network deployments of 5G and beyond. Compared to traditional networks, this software-based infrastructure offers a more resilient and intelligent mobile network. This development plays a pivotal role in realizing the potential of vRAN by fostering flexibility and interoperability among different components. By consolidating multiple software network elements on the same server, operators can benefit from the following: End-to-end automation with Samsung’s CognitiV Network Operations Suite: The solution supports plug-and-play deployment, management visibility, and massive software upgrades, delivering a more streamlined and efficient deployment and operation process. Greater agility and flexibility: Built on Software-Defined Networking principles, the virtualized architecture enables the greater scalability and flexibility needed to meet operators’ various network configurations and service demands. Ability to support diverse applications: With software-centric architecture, vCSR can support security applications such as firewalls and intelligently steer data flows. Reduced CapEx thanks to simplified deployment with less hardware: There is no need to purchase legacy hardware since it can be combined within the existing server with the vDU and other software platforms. It also frees up additional rack space. Reduced OpEx with energy savings: By eliminating the physical CSR hardware through server consolidation, approximately 30% of energy use can be saved. “Leveraging our expertise in real-world vRAN deployments, Samsung, along with Juniper and Wind River, are paving the way for end-to-end virtualized networks across the world,” said Ji-Yun Seol, Vice President, Head of Product Strategy, Networks Business at Samsung Electronics. “With this revolutionary approach, we are giving operators the confidence to transform their networks and embrace virtual and open approaches.” “The compelling objective of vRAN is the flexibility and agility it can bring to operators.

Negative Full year 2023 revenue declined by 9.2% compared to the prior year. Full year 2023 gross margin declined by 430 basis points compared to 2022. Net earnings decreased in Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023. Net profit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, decreased compared to the previous year. Financial Analyst The reported 22.2% increase in Q4 revenue year-over-year indicates a strong quarterly performance for ChipMOS, potentially reflecting increased demand for their semiconductor services or successful market expansion strategies. However, the full-year revenue decline of 9.2% suggests that the company faced challenges throughout the year that may have impacted its overall performance. This could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to maintain growth and could affect the stock's performance if the trend continues.The improved gross margin in Q4, both sequentially and year-over-year, is a positive sign of operational efficiency and cost management. This improvement could contribute to higher profitability and may be seen as a positive indicator of management's effectiveness. The tripling of net earnings per share in Q4 compared to the same period last year also stands out as a significant achievement, suggesting that the company has effectively leveraged its revenues into profits, which can be attractive to investors.However, the decrease in full-year net earnings compared to the previous year indicates that the company has faced profitability challenges over the longer term. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as increased competition, pricing pressure, or higher costs and would require further investigation to understand the underlying causes. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and ChipMOS's performance must be contextualized within broader market trends. The increase in Q4 revenue could be indicative of a rebound in the semiconductor market or the result of new product introductions or client acquisitions. It's also important to consider the company's position within the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) sector and how shifts in technology demand, such as the rise of 5G and IoT, may be influencing its financial performance.The foreign exchange losses highlighted in the report underscore the impact of currency volatility on multinational companies. ChipMOS's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could be a point of concern for investors, particularly if the company does not have effective hedging strategies in place.Lastly, the strong financial position with a substantial balance of cash and cash equivalents provides the company with strategic flexibility. This could enable further investments in technology, potential acquisitions, or shareholder returns, all of which could influence investor sentiment and the company's market value. Economist The company's financials reflect broader economic trends, such as exchange rate movements which have led to increased non-operating expenses in Q4. This financial detail points to the importance of macroeconomic factors on corporate profitability. Additionally, the decline in full-year revenue and net earnings may be symptomatic of economic headwinds, such as reduced consumer spending or supply chain disruptions, which could have implications for the sector's outlook.The dividend authorization signals confidence by the board in the company's liquidity and financial health, which is reassuring for shareholders, especially in a context of declining annual revenue and net earnings. It is also indicative of the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders despite short-term earnings volatility.Moreover, the company's liquidity position, with over US$400 million in cash and cash equivalents, suggests a robust balance sheet that may shield the company against market volatility and provide a buffer for strategic maneuvers, such as R&D investment or market expansion, which could drive long-term growth. 02/22/2024 - 02:00 AM Financial Highlights: 22.2% Increase in Q4 2023 Revenue Compared to Q4 2022; 2.6% Increase Compared to Q3 2023; Full Year 2023 Revenue Declines 9.2% Compared to Prior Year560 Basis Point Increase in Q4 2023 Gross Margin Compared to Q4 2022, and 420 Basis Point Increase Compared to Q3 2023; Full Year 2023 Gross margin Declines 430 Basis Points Compared to 2022Net Earnings Tripled to NT$0.66 Per Common Share in Q4 2023 From NT$0.22 in Q4 2022, and Decreased NT$0.14 Compared to NT$0.80 in Q3 2023; Full Year 2023 Net Earnings of NT$2.60 Per Common Share Compared to NT$4.64 for the Full Year 2022Strong Financial Position and Liquidity with NT$12,354.0 Million or US$403.5 Million Balance of Cash and Cash EquivalentsDividend of NT$1.8 Per Share Authorized by Board Pending Shareholder Approval at May 2024 AGMHSINCHU, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC.

Teekay Tankers Ltd. Reports Fourth Quarter and Annual 2023 Results and Declares Dividend,2024-02-22T06:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Teekay Tankers Ltd. (NYSE: TNK) reported its financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, declaring a cash dividend of $0.25 per share.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Annual 2023 Results and Declares Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Teekay Tankers Ltd. (NYSE: TNK) reported its financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, declaring a cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a $0.25 per share dividend by Teekay Tankers Ltd. is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate positive cash flow. Dividends are typically distributed by companies that are confident in their stable earnings and cash reserves. Investors might view this news as a sign of management's confidence in the ongoing profitability of the company. Moreover, the size of the dividend relative to the company's share price can provide insights into the dividend yield, which is a key metric for income-focused investors. However, it's also crucial to assess the sustainability of such dividends. If the dividend payout ratio—how much of the company's net income is paid out as dividends—is too high, it may suggest that the company is not reinvesting enough into its own growth, which could impact long-term value. Additionally, stakeholders should consider the company's debt levels and free cash flow to evaluate whether the dividend is being funded in a manner that is fiscally responsible. Market Research Analyst The tanker industry, within which Teekay Tankers operates, is subject to cyclical fluctuations and is influenced by global economic conditions, oil supply and demand dynamics. The announcement of a dividend could be interpreted as a positive signal within the market, potentially leading to an increase in investor demand for TNK shares. It is important to analyze this dividend announcement in the context of the sector's performance and commodity price trends, as these factors can significantly impact the company's future earnings potential. Furthermore, examining the company's historical dividend patterns and comparing them to industry peers can provide additional context. A consistent history of paying dividends could indicate a robust business model and a competitive advantage within the sector. On the other hand, if the dividend amount represents an increase or decrease from previous quarters, it could suggest a shift in the company's strategic focus or a reaction to changing market conditions. Economist Dividend announcements can also reflect broader economic trends. In a low-interest-rate environment, for example, high-dividend stocks like Teekay Tankers become more attractive to investors seeking yield, which could drive up the stock price. Conversely, if interest rates are rising, dividend-paying stocks might lose some appeal as investors have access to higher yields elsewhere with potentially lower risk. It is also valuable to consider the macroeconomic factors affecting the shipping industry, such as international trade policies, geopolitical tensions and changes in environmental regulations. These factors could influence the company's operational costs, access to shipping routes and ultimately, its profitability. Thus, the declared dividend must be weighed against these potential risks and economic indicators to gauge the long-term sustainability of the company's financial performance. 02/22/2024 - 01:00 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teekay Tankers Ltd.

The company also completed refinancing, secured a credit facility, and declared a cash dividend. Positive Total operating revenues increased by 15% to $220.6 million in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter. Net income surged to $28.4 million, a substantial increase of $28.1 million from the previous quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 20% to $105.9 million in Q4 2023. The company successfully refinanced all secured debt and established a $180 million revolving credit facility. Borr Drilling completed a private placement of new shares, generating gross proceeds of $50.0 million. The total contract revenue backlog as of December 31, 2023, stood at $1.75 billion, including Mexico rigs. In 2024 year-to-date, the company secured three new contract commitments, totaling 495 days and $82.2 million in potential contract revenue. The Board declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter, payable to shareholders of record on March 4, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total operating revenues by 15% and net income surge for Borr Drilling in the fourth quarter of 2023 is a strong indicator of operational efficiency and market demand. This performance, particularly the net income jump from virtually zero in the previous quarter, suggests a significant turnaround in profitability. The substantial rise in adjusted EBITDA by 20% also reflects improved earnings quality and potential for reinvestment and debt servicing.Moreover, the completion of the refinancing of the company's secured debt, establishment of a $180 million RCF (Revolving Credit Facility) and the execution of a private placement to raise $50 million in capital demonstrates strategic financial management. These moves likely improve the company's liquidity and reduce interest expenses, which can be conducive to shareholder value in the long term.The disclosure of a $1.75 billion contract revenue backlog offers visibility into future earnings and operational stability. This backlog, coupled with the new contract commitments worth $82.2 million, provides a clear revenue stream and could be a positive signal for investors assessing the company's future performance. Market Research Analyst The offshore drilling sector, where Borr Drilling operates, is subject to cyclical demand influenced by oil prices and global energy needs. The announcement of new contract commitments and a robust backlog is indicative of a healthy market environment and Borr Drilling's competitive positioning within the industry. The awarding of contracts for 495 days reflects not only current demand but also confidence in Borr Drilling's operational capabilities.Additionally, the declaration of a cash dividend, albeit modest at $0.05 per share, is a sign of management's confidence in the company's cash flow and commitment to returning value to shareholders. This could be appealing to income-focused investors and may positively influence the stock's attractiveness in a sector known for its volatility. Economist The financial results of Borr Drilling need to be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. The offshore drilling industry is closely tied to global economic conditions and energy markets. The company's ability to increase revenues and secure new contracts may be reflective of a larger trend in increased energy consumption and investment in exploration and production activities.From an economic standpoint, the successful refinancing and capital raise may allow Borr Drilling to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the drilling industry more effectively. This financial restructuring could mitigate risks associated with volatile commodity prices and enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities as the global economy recovers from any downturns. 02/22/2024 - 01:01 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --Borr Drilling Limited (""Borr"", ""Borr Drilling"" or the ""Company"") announces unaudited results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Highlights Fourth Quarter of 2023 Total operating revenues of $220.6 million, an increase of $29.1 million or 15% compared to the third quarter of 2023Net income of $28.4 million, an increase of $28.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2023Adjusted EBITDA of $105.9 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 20% compared to the third quarter of 2023Completed the refinancing of all the Company's secured debt, established a $180 million RCF and completed a private placement of new shares for gross proceeds of $50.0 millionTotal contract revenue backlog as at December 31, 2023 of $1.75 billion, including Mexico rigs Subsequent events 2024 year to date, the Company has been awarded three new contract commitments, representing 495 days and $82.2 million of potential contract revenueThe Board declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter to shareholders of record on March 4, 2024. Payment date will be on or about March 18, 2024. CEO, Patrick Schorn commented: ""Our fourth quarter performance has been strong, enabling us to close the year having achieved several major milestones. On the operational front, we finished the year with excellent technical utilization for the quarter at 98.7% and a total recordable injury frequency of 0.65, the latter being well below the industry average. These numbers reflect the professionalism of our operational team, who have activated rigs continuously for the last three years, and who have successfully commenced operations in numerous new countries and regions. On the contracting front, we closed the year with all of our 22 delivered rigs contracted. Over the course of 2023, we also secured several new contracts adding $728 million, at an implied rate of approximately $161,000 per day, to our revenue backlog, which stood at $1.75 billion at year end. Following the award of three additional contracts in 2024, we have 87% of our available capacity in 2024 already covered by firm contracts and priced options, and we expect this to further increase in the coming months as we progress current negotiations. This strong contract coverage provides both solid near-term revenue and earnings visibility as well as the ability to balance contracts to optimize our market position and earnings. In addition, we have two newbuilds scheduled for delivery later this year. They are already attracting considerable customer interest and come with yard financing in place. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20% from the third quarter to $105.9 million, reflecting a close to fully operational fleet. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to continue to increase throughout 2024 as more rigs end their current contracts and commence new ones at higher dayrates and improved contract terms. Based on our positive business outlook and strong fleet coverage, we maintain our estimate of Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 to be between $500 to $550 million. With the issuance of our $1.54 billion secured bonds in November 2023, the future of the Company is further cemented, and having commenced both our dividend program and share buybacks, our focus is now on how best to return value to shareholders. Subsequent to the period covered by this quarter's report, there has been significant focus in the media on the announcements by Saudi Aramco regarding their production targets for 2027. While we fully respect that only Saudi Aramco can give meaningful information about how this will potentially affect the onshore and offshore activity levels going forward, a few comments specifically in relation to Borr Drilling are appropriate. First, out of our fleet of 24 rigs, we have three working in the Kingdom, all of which are on multi-year contracts. Second, regardless of an adjustment in production levels to be pursued going forward, the activity levels required in the Kingdom to maintain current production capacity remain world leading.

(TSXV: GEL) (OTCQB: GELEF) (FSE: 97G0) (""Graphano"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report further assay results from the 2023-24 winter drilling program at its 100% owned Standard Mine Project (""Standard""). The primary focus of the drilling program was on graphite zone expansion, following up on the excellent results from the 2022-23 trenching and drilling programs.Luisa Moreno, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated: ""We are excited to continue the release of the Standard Mine drill results from a very successful drilling campaign. To date we have drilled over 3,000 metres at Standard in connection with ongoing Mineral Resource estimation work. We firmly believe Standard complements our Lac-Aux-Bouleaux graphite project well and we eagerly look forward to continuing to advance the two projects to become a significant regional supplier of sustainable graphite to the North American market."" Key Highlights from the Western Graphite Trend (See Full Results in Table 1)Current HolesDrill Hole ST23-21 intersected 15.57% graphitic carbon (Cg) over 15.04 metres (m) starting at 68.79 m drilled depth; andDrill Hole ST23-19 intersected 6.28% Cg over 5.23m at 25.75m drill depth, and 5.57% Cg over 4.14m at 40.43m drill depth and 4.89% over 5.26m at 52.47m drill depth.Previous HolesDrill Hole ST23-13 intersected 8.99% Cg over 11.3 m starting at 4.2 m drilled depth, and 7.65% Cg over 13.0 m at 56 m drill depth; andDrill Hole ST23-05 intersected 5.79% Cg over 14.4 m at 4.6 m drill depth.(Note: All intersections reported are based on drilled width and have not been converted to the true width. True widths are not currently known.)The seven drill holes reported in this update were drilled as step-outs to extend the mineralization on the Western Trend. Previous Western Trend trenching and drilling completed by Graphano in early 2023 returned multiple zones of significant graphite mineralization, such as in hole ST23-13 noted above. The current drilling has extended this mineralization and indicates the zones dip to the southeast towards the northwest dipping Eastern Trend (see news release dated February 15, 2024 – Reports 18.8m grading 9.79% Cg). Drilling to date has encountered significant graphite mineralization over an approximate strike length of 350m and mineralization remains open in both the strike and dip directions for continued expansion. In addition, Drill Hole ST23-22 intersected a new area of near surface mineralization grading 7.34% Cg over 3.03m at a drilled depth of 8.92m and warrants further exploration. Full assay results from the seven holes are presented in Table 1 and drill hole locations in Figure 2.

The company now holds 2,070 Bitcoin and is preparing for the Bitcoin Halving event in April 2024. Positive HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. purchases 1,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers for enhanced Bitcoin mining capacity. The S21 provides 200 petahash per second of high efficiency mining capacity. HIVE now holds 2,070 Bitcoin on its balance sheet as of February 21, 2024. The company is strategically preparing for the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event in late April 2024. HIVE aims to increase target Exahash to 5.5 EH/s by upgrading to the most efficient machines available. The company plans to stay lean during the Halving by minimizing fixed costs and optimizing variable costs. HIVE continues to HODL 100% of the Bitcoin it mines, believing in the scarcity of Bitcoin and strong US Bitcoin ETF inflows. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of 1,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers by HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. is a strategic move to bolster its Bitcoin mining capacity ahead of the anticipated Bitcoin Halving event. The S21 model's high efficiency, quantified at 17.5 J/TH, represents a significant improvement in the energy-to-performance ratio, which is a critical metric in the cryptocurrency mining industry. By focusing on efficiency, HIVE is effectively lowering its cost of production per Bitcoin, which could potentially enhance its profitability margins in a sector where electricity costs are a major operational expense.Furthermore, the decision to hold all mined Bitcoin reflects a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency's future value. This strategy of building a Bitcoin treasury must be weighed against the potential benefits of liquidity and the risks associated with the volatility of Bitcoin's price. Investors might view this approach as a double-edged sword: it could lead to substantial gains if Bitcoin's value appreciates post-Halving, but it also exposes the company to significant risk if the market moves unfavorably. Financial Analyst HIVE's update on its Bitcoin holdings, now totaling 2,070, serves as a key indicator of the company's operational success and its commitment to cryptocurrency. The strategy to 'HODL'—a term used within the cryptocurrency community to denote holding onto assets rather than selling—could be seen as a confidence move that aligns with the scarcity principle inherent to Bitcoin's design. The Halving event, which will reduce the block reward by half, is historically associated with an increase in Bitcoin's price, although this is not guaranteed.Investors should consider the implications of the Halving on HIVE's revenue stream, as the reduction in daily Bitcoin rewards will directly impact mining profitability. However, HIVE's proactive upgrade to more efficient mining equipment may mitigate some of the negative effects of the reduced block reward. The company's emphasis on maintaining low fixed costs and the capability to adjust variable costs provides it with flexibility to adapt to market changes, which is a prudent approach in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency Expert By upgrading to Bitmain's latest S21 Antminers, HIVE is demonstrating its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the hash rate race—a measure of processing power in the Bitcoin network. The increase in hash rate from 5.3 EH/s to 5.5 EH/s, while seemingly marginal, is significant when considering the global competition in Bitcoin mining. The company's strategic focus on efficiency, particularly ahead of the Halving, is an attempt to maximize returns in an environment where the reward for mining will be halved.The Halving is a core feature of Bitcoin's economic model, intended to control inflation by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. HIVE's strategic preparation for this event, along with its impressive Bitcoin reserves, positions the company as a potentially resilient player in the post-Halving landscape. However, the true impact of these strategic moves will largely depend on the post-Halving price dynamics of Bitcoin and the overall market's reception to such scarcity-induced changes. 02/22/2024 - 01:00 AM This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 1, 2023.Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 22, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the ""Company"" or ""HIVE"") is pleased to announce the purchase of 1,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers (the ""S21""), which would provide 200 petahash per second (""PH/s"") of high efficiency Bitcoin mining capacity. The S21 is the newest and most efficient Bitmain Bitcoin mining ASIC system, boasting 17.5 joules per Terahash (""J/TH""). Additionally, HIVE now has 2,070 Bitcoin on the balance sheet as of February 21, 2024.HIVE is continuing its strategic preparation for the Bitcoin Halving event, expected to occur in late April 2024. Rather than expanding our footprint at this time, we are upgrading our fleet with the most efficient machines available, which in turn will lower our average costs to produce a Bitcoin.By upgrading our existing ASICs in our inventory to the S21, we will increase our target Exahash from 5.3 EH/s at 24.7 J/TH by the end of June 2024 to 5.5 EH/s by running only our most efficient machines in our 140 MW of operating infrastructure globally. HIVE believes it is important to stay lean during the Halving, as having low fixed costs, and an inventory of highly efficient ASIC we can run at variable load to minimize variable costs, will allow the Company agility, thus putting HIVE in a strong position to navigate the rest of 2024.In addition, we continue to HODL 100% of the Bitcoin we are mining. With the Halving, the Bitcoin block reward will drop from 900 Bitcoin per day, to 450 Bitcoin per day. With this pre-determined scarcity in the Bitcoin ecosystem, along with the strong US Bitcoin ETF inflows, HIVE believes it is prudent to hold a treasury of Bitcoin on our balance sheet.About HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a sustainable green energy focus.HIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain and high-performance computing industry. As a company whose shares trade on major stock exchanges, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sectors and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns green energy-powered data center facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source geothermal and hydroelectric energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency and high-performance computing space.We encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.For more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit https://hivedigitaltechnologies.com/.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The earnings report from Teekay Corporation represents a critical financial update that directly affects investor sentiment and can influence the company's stock price. From a financial analyst's perspective, the key figures to scrutinize are the revenue, profit margins, earnings per share and guidance for future quarters. These metrics are essential in determining the company's operational efficiency and financial health. Additionally, comparing these results with analysts' expectations and industry benchmarks can provide insight into the company's performance relative to its peers. It is also important to examine the management's discussion and analysis section, as it may offer context for the numbers reported, including any one-time events or changes in accounting practices that could have affected the results. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, Teekay's earnings report can signal broader trends in the shipping and logistics industry. Factors such as global trade volumes, charter rates and fuel costs are crucial for interpreting the company's performance. For instance, an increase in revenue might reflect higher demand for shipping services or the successful deployment of new vessels. Conversely, a decline could indicate an oversupplied market or operational challenges. Understanding these dynamics is vital for stakeholders to assess the company's strategic positioning and potential for growth amidst global economic conditions. Economist An economist's view would extend beyond the company's performance to consider macroeconomic factors impacting Teekay's business environment. Fluctuations in oil prices, changes in international trade policies and currency exchange rates are all external variables that can have a significant impact on Teekay's bottom line. The company's exposure to these factors, along with its hedging strategies, can inform stakeholders about its resilience to economic cycles and its ability to navigate complex global markets. This perspective is particularly relevant for long-term investors concerned with the sustainability of Teekay's financial performance in a volatile economic landscape. 02/22/2024 - 01:00 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teekay Corporation (Teekay or the Company) (NYSE:TK) today reported results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS Fourth quarter and full-year sales In Q4 2023, consolidated sales stood at €6.7 bn, up +5.1% on a like-for-like basis, led by an increase of +4.3% from price and +0.8% from volume/mix. On a reported basis, sales decreased by -5.0%, mainly penalized by the strong negative impact from forex (-6.0%), reflecting the depreciation of the majority of currencies against the euro. Reported sales were also penalized by a negative effect from scope (-5.8%), mainly resulting from the deconsolidation of EDP Russia starting from July 2023. Besides, hyperinflation contributed positively to reported sales (+2.8%). In 2023, consolidated sales stood at €27.6 bn, up +7.0% on a like-for-like basis, with price up +7.4% and volume/mix down -0.4%. On a reported basis, sales decreased by -0.2%, reflecting notably a negative impact from forex (-4.3%) and scope (-3.4%), and a positive contribution of hyperinflation (+1.8%).

Recurring operating margin stood at 12.6%, up +40 basis points (bps) compared to last year. This increase was mainly driven by the improvement of the margin from operations, up +142 bps: topline drivers, including volume, mix and price, had a combined impact of c. +590 bps, partially offset by the still strong negative impact of input-cost inflation net of productivity, at c. -450 bps. Besides, Danone continued to step-up its reinvestments in A&P, product superiority and capabilities, that had a negative effect of -97 bps in 2023. Finally, Scope, Forex and others had a +13 bps positive impact on Recurring operating margin, partially offset by Overheads before reinvestments, that had a negative effect of -18 bps.

Share of profit of equity-accounted companies stood at €36 million, improving from -€32 million last year, which reflected the impairment related to the disposal of the remaining minority investments in Mengniu partnerships. Non-controlling interests stood at €72 million, up from €64 million in 2022. As a result, Reported EPS decreased by -8.0% to €1.36, while Recurring EPS was up +3.4% to €3.54. Cash flow and Debt Free cash flow reached €2,633 million in 2023, increasing from €2,127 million in 2022, reflecting the significant increase in cash-flow from operating activities. Capex stood at €847 million. As of December 31, 2023, Danone’s net debt stood at €10.2 billion, slightly increasing from €10.1 billion last year. While the company reduced its debt by c. €0.7 billion in 2023, this improvement was offset by the redemption of a c. €0.8 billion hybrid bond which was financed by a bond issuance. This reflects Danone’s continued improvement in the quality of its balance sheet. Dividend At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 25, 2024, Danone’s Board of Directors will propose a dividend of €2.10 per share in respect of the 2023 fiscal year, up +5.0% compared to last year, and back to 2019 record-level.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRS IAS 29: impact on reported data Danone has been applying IAS 29 in hyperinflation countries as defined in IFRS. Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency, leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover, its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.

Financial indicators not defined in IFRS Due to rounding, the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material. Like-for-like changes in sales reflect Danone's organic performance and essentially exclude the impact of: changes in consolidation scope, with indicators related to a given fiscal year calculated on the basis of the previous year's scope;changes in applicable accounting principles;changes in exchange rates, with both previous-year and current-year indicators calculated using the same exchange rates (the exchange rate used is a projected annual rate determined by Danone for the current year and applied to both previous and current years). Like-for-like changes in recurring operating margin are not disclosed anymore as the indicator is not constitutive of the company’s guidance nor used by the company to comment the results. Since January 1st, 2023, all countries with hyperinflationary economies are taken into account in like-for-like changes as follows: net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger the application of hyperinflationary accounting as defined in IFRS) is now excluded from the like-for-like net sales growth calculation.

IAS 29Contribution of hyperinflationReported changeFY 2023 Sales27,661+7.0%-3.4%-5.6%+1.8%-0.2%27,619 Margin from operations is defined as the Gross margin over Net sales ratio, where Gross margin corresponds to the difference between Net sales and Industrial costs excluding reengineering initiatives and Logistics / Transportation costs. Recurring operating income is defined as Danone’s operating income excluding Other operating income and expenses. Other operating income and expenses comprise items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value, thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include: capital gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructurings or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to major crisis and major litigations;in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised) and IAS 27 (Revised) relating to business combinations, (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations, (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of control, and (iii) changes in earn-outs relating to business combinations and subsequent to acquisition date. Recurring operating margin is defined as the Recurring operating income over Sales ratio. Other non-recurring financial income and expense corresponds to financial income and expense items that, in view of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring financial management. These mainly include changes in value of non-consolidated interests. Non-recurring income tax corresponds to income tax on non-recurring items as well as tax income and expense items that, in view of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring performance. Recurring effective tax rate measures the effective tax rate of Danone’s recurring performance and is computed as the ratio of income tax related to recurring items over recurring net income before tax. Non-recurring share of profit of equity-accounted companies includes items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to the companies' recurring activity and thereby distort the assessment of their recurring performance and trends in that performance. These items mainly relate to (i) capital gains and losses on disposals of investments in equity-accounted companies, (ii) impairment of goodwill, and (iii) non-recurring items, as defined by Danone, included in the share of profit of equity-accounted companies. Recurring net income (or Recurring net income – Group Share) corresponds to the Group share of the consolidated Recurring net income. The Recurring net income excludes items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value, thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution. Such non-recurring income and expenses correspond to Other operating income and expenses, Other non-recurring financial income and expenses, Non-recurring income tax, and Non-recurring income from equity-accounted companies. Such income and expenses, excluded from Net income, represent Non-recurring net income. Recurring EPS (or Recurring net income – Group Share, per share after dilution) is defined as the ratio of Recurring net income adjusted for hybrid financing over Diluted number of shares. In compliance with IFRS, income used to calculate EPS is adjusted for the coupon related to the hybrid financing accrued for the period and presented net of tax.

Negative None. 02/22/2024 - 12:22 AM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“DMG”), a vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, today announces its fiscal first quarter 2024 financial results. All financial references are in Canadian Dollars unless specified otherwise. Q1 2024 Financial Results Highlights Q1 2024 results of $9.7 million revenue, $1.5 million operating loss before other items, $7.0 million net income and $0.04 per share196 bitcoin mined, up 35% from the prior quarter on 0.96 EH/s, up 45% from the prior quarter$3.7 million cash flow from operations, up 163% from the prior quarterSigned agreement with Bitmain Technologies in December to purchase 4,550 T21 190 TH/s bitcoin miners, which is expected to approximately double hashrate to about 2 EH/sStrong balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 with $27.7 million in cash and digital currency, $91.0 million in total assets Sheldon Bennett, DMG Blockchain Solutions’ Chief Executive Officer, commented, “DMG Q1 2024 results benefitted from the confluence of our 45% higher hashrate and a 30% increase in the quarterly average price of bitcoin versus the prior quarter. With the purchase of 4,550 new 190 TH/s T21 miners and the infrastructure needed to energize those miners, we are positioned to approximately double our electrical infrastructure and hashrate. Regarding our Core+ Blockseer software strategy, we continue to invest in both Bitcoin network software infrastructure and applications, and we remain encouraged regarding the opportunity to monetize bitcoin transactions.” Q1 2024 Financial Results Review Revenue for the first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 was $9.7 million versus $7.2 million in the prior year period, an increase of 35%, primarily due to the increase in digital currency mining revenues as a result of bitcoin price increasing 100% over the year-ago period to an average of $49,129 in the December quarter. This increase was partially offset by an 81% increase in Bitcoin network difficulty that lowered DMG’s bitcoin generation per EH/s by 37% from the same period last year. In addition, revenue was also partially offset by a loss in net pool revenue of $1.0 million. Income before other items for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was -$1.5 million versus -$5.3 million in the prior year period. Operating and maintenance costs for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $5.1 million as compared to $4.4 million in the same quarter in the prior year. The increase is a result of a rise in utilities expense, driven by expanded digital currency mining operations related to additional miners. Net income for the three months ending December 31, 2023 was $7.0 million versus a loss of $7.0 million in the prior year period. The improvement in net income was driven primarily by an increase in unrealized revaluation gain on digital currency, which was a gain of $8.2 million versus a loss of $1.4 million in the prior year period. In addition, it was also driven by an increase in revenue of $2.5 million and a decrease in depreciation of $1.7 million, partially offset by an increase in operating and maintenance costs of $0.7 million all related to the increase in installation of new miners for self-mining. Research costs increased slightly to $0.4 million. Earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 was $0.04 versus -$0.04 in the prior year period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $2.2 million, digital currency of $25.5 million and total assets of $91.0 million. For more details, please refer to the Company’s filings.

AI drove a 4% uplift in GMV, with complex services contributing significantly. Take rate grew by 160 bps to 31.8%. The company supercharged its platform with AI innovation and expects GMV acceleration in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results indicating a significant year-over-year revenue increase and a notable improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflect a strong operational performance by Fiverr International Ltd. The growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) by 4% and the expansion of the take rate by 160 basis points are particularly noteworthy. These metrics are vital indicators of the company's ability to monetize its services and suggest a successful implementation of strategic initiatives, such as the adoption of AI technologies and a focus on complex service categories.However, the decrease in active buyers could signal a potential challenge in customer acquisition or retention. Despite this, the increase in spend per buyer implies that the existing customer base is spending more, potentially offsetting the decline in active users. The emphasis on AI-driven innovation and the strategic move to upscale services could be attracting higher-value projects, which is a positive sign for future revenue streams. Financial Analyst Fiverr's transition to GAAP profitability for the first time and more than doubling of the Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 are critical milestones that demonstrate the company's improving financial health and operational efficiency. The reported GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a robust bottom line, likely to be well-received by investors. The guidance for 2024 suggests a conservative yet optimistic outlook, with a focus on sustainable growth and margin expansion.The company's strategic priorities for 2024, including market share expansion and driving adoption of Fiverr Business Solutions, coupled with continued AI innovation, indicate a forward-looking approach that could further strengthen its competitive position. However, the market will be closely monitoring the actualization of these goals, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment and the potential for increased competition in the digital services sector. Technology Industry Analyst The integration of AI across Fiverr's platform, as demonstrated by the Winter Product Release, is a significant development that underscores the company's commitment to technological innovation. The introduction of Fiverr NeoTM and AI-powered personalization features are likely to enhance user experience and efficiency, potentially leading to increased user engagement and transaction volumes. The AI-driven seller leveling system may also improve the marketplace dynamics by incentivizing high-quality service delivery.As the company anticipates GMV acceleration in 2024, the role of AI in driving this growth cannot be understated. The strategic focus on complex service categories, which contributed to 32% of total GMV in 2023, is indicative of Fiverr's upmarket trajectory and its aim to capture more lucrative segments of the gig economy. This shift towards higher-value services could have significant implications for the company's long-term revenue potential and market differentiation. 02/22/2024 - 01:00 AM Delivered strong results for 2023.

Some amounts in this release may not total due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. We define each of our non-GAAP measures of financial performance, as the respective GAAP balances shown in the above tables, adjusted for, as applicable, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expenses, contingent consideration revaluation, acquisition related costs and other, income taxes, amortization of discount and issuance costs of convertible note, financial (income) expenses, net. Non-GAAP gross profit margin represents non-GAAP gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by GAAP weighted-average number of ordinary shares basic and diluted. We define GMV or Gross Merchandise Value as the total value of transactions ordered through our platform, excluding value added tax, goods and services tax, service chargebacks and refunds. Active buyers on any given date is defined as buyers who have ordered a Gig or other services on our platform within the last 12-month period, irrespective of cancellations. Spend per buyer on any given date is calculated by dividing our GMV within the last 12-month period by the number of active buyers as of such date. Take rate is revenue for any such period divided by GMV for the same period. Management and our board of directors use these metrics as supplemental measures of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations. We also use these metrics for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections, to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and capital expenditures and to evaluate our capacity to expand our business. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as well as operating metrics, including GMV, active buyers, spend per buyer and take rate should not be considered in isolation, as an alternative to, or superior to net loss, revenue, cash flows or other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. These metrics are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP metrics is an appropriate measure of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate directly to the performance of our underlying business. These non-GAAP metrics should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or other items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP metrics used herein are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as they do not reflect our tax payments and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP metrics as supplemental measures of our performance. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP metrics used herein is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. See the tables above regarding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We are not able to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the first quarter of 2024 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, and long term to net income (loss), the nearest comparable GAAP measure, because certain items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin cannot be reasonably predicted or are not in our control. In particular, we are unable to forecast the timing or magnitude of share based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets, income or loss on revaluation of contingent consideration, other acquisition-related costs, convertible notes amortization of discount and issuance costs and exchange rate income or loss, as applicable without unreasonable efforts, and these items could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, GAAP measures in the future.

Each unit comprises one common share and one warrant to purchase another share, with warrants exercisable at US$0.36 per share. The net proceeds will be utilized for general corporate purposes, new product development, growth initiatives, working capital, potential acquisitions, and research and development. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Draganfly Inc.'s public offering is a significant event that warrants the attention of investors and analysts. The pricing of the offering at US$0.27 per unit, with additional warrants, could potentially dilute existing shareholders but also provides the company with necessary capital. The gross proceeds of US$3.6 million, before expenses, suggest a targeted infusion of funds to bolster the company's financial position.From a financial perspective, the key factors to consider include the immediate exercisability of the warrants and their five-year expiration. This structure can impact the stock's liquidity and volatility in the short term. The exercise price of US$0.36 represents a potential premium to the current trading price, which could incentivize warrant holders to contribute additional capital in the future if the company's share price appreciates.Investors should also scrutinize the intended use of proceeds, as it reflects management's strategic priorities. Allocating funds towards growth initiatives, working capital and research and development indicates a focus on expanding the company's market presence and product offerings. However, the mention of potential acquisitions introduces an element of risk, as the success of such endeavors is not guaranteed and could affect the company's financial health if not executed prudently. Market Research Analyst The drone industry is experiencing rapid growth and innovation, with increasing applications across commercial, industrial and governmental sectors. Draganfly's move to raise capital through a public offering can be seen as an attempt to capitalize on market opportunities and strengthen its competitive position. The reference to funding capabilities to meet demand for new products suggests that the company is responding to market trends and consumer needs.It is important to note that the effectiveness of the capital raised in driving growth will depend on the company's ability to execute its strategic initiatives effectively. The drone market is characterized by fast-paced technological advancements and a highly competitive landscape. Companies that are not agile or fail to innovate may quickly fall behind. Therefore, Draganfly's research and development efforts, as well as any potential acquisitions, should be closely monitored for their potential to enhance the company's product offerings and market share. Legal Expert The legal implications of a public offering are multifaceted, particularly concerning regulatory compliance and disclosure requirements. Draganfly's engagement with Maxim Group LLC as the sole book-running manager indicates a structured approach to managing the offering. It is imperative for the company to adhere to securities laws and regulations, ensuring transparent communication with investors regarding the terms of the offering and the use of proceeds.Additionally, the issuance of warrants as part of the units adds complexity to the transaction. Warrants are contracts that grant the holder the right to purchase additional shares at a specified price, which can affect the company's shareholder structure and capitalization table. The legal team must ensure that all aspects of the warrant terms, including exercisability, pricing and expiration, comply with applicable laws and are clearly articulated to potential investors. 02/21/2024 - 11:00 PM Saskatoon, SK., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Draganfly Inc.

The underwriters have an option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Symbotic Inc.'s underwritten public offering represents a significant capital market transaction that could influence the company's financial structure and liquidity. The dual nature of the offering, with shares sold by both the company and the Selling Securityholders, suggests a strategic move to not only raise capital for corporate initiatives but also to enable partial liquidity for the founder's investments. The public offering price of $40.50 per share will be a benchmark for the market's valuation of the company post-offering.It is important to assess the potential dilution of existing shareholders due to the increase in outstanding shares. The additional 1,500,000 shares option for underwriters could further impact the earnings per share (EPS) and shareholder equity, depending on the uptake. Investors should consider the company's historical financial performance and growth prospects to determine whether the capital raised justifies potential dilution.Market reception to the offering will be critical, as it reflects investor confidence in the company's future. The involvement of Goldman Sachs as the sole book-running manager could be perceived as a positive signal due to the firm's reputation and expertise in capital market transactions. Market Research Analyst The use of A.I.-enabled robotics technology in supply chain management is a rapidly growing sector, with increasing demand for automation solutions in warehousing and logistics. Symbotic Inc.'s positioning within this industry and its decision to raise funds through a public offering could indicate plans for expansion or technology development to maintain a competitive edge. The company's ability to capitalize on current market trends and invest in innovation will be crucial for long-term growth.Investors should monitor the deployment of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, as this could encompass a range of activities from R&D to potential acquisitions. The specificity of these allocations, or lack thereof, might influence investor perceptions of the company's strategic focus and operational efficiency.The timing of the offering and market conditions at the time of closing will also play a role in the success of the transaction. Any shifts in market sentiment towards the tech sector or broader economic indicators could affect the uptake of the offering and the subsequent performance of the stock. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering is structured to comply with the SEC's regulations, utilizing a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. This approach allows for a more streamlined and timely offering process, as the company has already undergone the SEC's review and has the flexibility to issue securities over a three-year period.Investors should take note of the legal framework governing the offering, including the prospectus and prospectus supplement, which provide detailed information on the terms of the offering, the company's financials and risk factors. The legal disclosures and risk factors outlined in these documents are essential for informed investment decisions.The clear statement that this press release does not constitute an offer to sell securities is a standard disclaimer to ensure compliance with securities law and to mitigate the risk of potential legal disputes related to the offering process. 02/21/2024 - 08:30 PM WILMINGTON, Mass., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Symbotic Inc.

CVS Health invests nearly $35 million in affordable housing in Hawai'i,2024-02-22T01:45:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"CVS Health announces $35 million investment in affordable housing developments in Hawai'i, partnering with local organizations to address community needs and support residents.","CVS Health invests nearly $35 million in affordable housing in Hawai'i Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CVS Health announces $35 million investment in affordable housing developments in Hawai'i, partnering with local organizations to address community needs and support residents. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The equity investments of nearly $35 million by CVS Health into affordable housing in Hawai'i is a strategic move that reflects the company's broader commitment to social responsibility. This initiative could potentially enhance the company's reputation and goodwill within the community, which might translate into stronger customer loyalty and brand value. From a financial perspective, such investments may not yield immediate financial returns but could mitigate risk by diversifying the company's portfolio beyond its core retail and healthcare services.It's also worth noting that these investments align with current ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) trends, which are increasingly influencing investor decisions. Companies actively engaging in ESG-related activities may attract a broader investor base, particularly those focused on sustainability and social impact. This could lead to a positive impact on CVS Health's stock as socially responsible investing continues to gain traction. Urban Development Expert The partnership between CVS Health and various local entities to create new affordable housing units in Hawai'i addresses a critical need within the community. The development not only provides housing but also integrates supportive social and educational programs, which could lead to long-term community development and stability. The focus on early childcare and affordable housing is in line with state priorities and demonstrates how public-private partnerships can align with government initiatives to address societal challenges.The integration of educational facilities, such as the Bezos Academy Montessori preschool and the Kamehameha Schools-operated preschool, could have a significant impact on the local workforce by providing early education opportunities. This approach to community development is comprehensive, aiming to bolster the local economy by creating a stable environment conducive to both living and learning. Healthcare Industry Analyst CVS Health's investment in affordable housing in Hawai'i is an extension of its healthcare mission, addressing social determinants of health such as housing and education. By offering immunizations, health screenings and other health-related services in these communities, CVS is effectively expanding its healthcare footprint. This proactive approach to healthcare delivery, especially in underserved areas, could improve health outcomes and reduce long-term healthcare costs, which is beneficial for both the community and CVS Health's healthcare business.Furthermore, the creation of career skills labs and the expansion of the Longs Drugs store network in Hawai'i indicates CVS Health's investment in the local workforce. Such initiatives may lead to a more skilled workforce, which could be advantageous for CVS Health's operations in the region, potentially leading to improved service delivery and customer satisfaction. 02/21/2024 - 08:45 PM The investments are one of many initiatives ranging from retail to workforce and philanthropy that exemplify the company's longstanding commitment to the people of Hawai'i WOONSOCKET, R.I., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health® (NYSE: CVS) today announced its contribution of nearly $35 million in equity investments towards the creation of two new affordable housing developments in Hawai'i. Located in Lahaina, Maui and Kapolei, Oahu, the communities will also offer residents supportive social and educational programs tailored to address their specific needs. In addition to other multiple funding partners, these investments support the state of Hawai'i's priorities in early childcare and affordable housing and exemplify the power of public and private collaborations. In collaboration with Urban Housing Communities, Ikaika 'Ohana, and Hunt Capital Partners, CVS Health invested $17.5 million to help build 200 new affordable housing units at Kaiāulu o Kūku'ia in Lahaina, Maui. This development will bring critically needed affordable housing for families in the area, much of which was devastated by the 2023 Maui wildfires. Ikaika 'Ohana, co-developer and Hawai'i-based nonprofit, will be coordinating services to residents including immunizations and health screenings, childcare, GED and ESL classes, occupational certification courses, resume preparation and job referrals, and financial counseling. In addition, the Bezos Academy will be operating a Montessori preschool onsite free of charge for the pre-school aged children living at Kaiāulu o Kūku'ia. ""Hunt Capital Partners is proud to be part of the rebuilding of Lahaina. The affordable rental homes at Kaiāulu o Kūku'ia will be the first permanent housing to be delivered in Lahaina since the devasting fires in August,"" shared Steve Colón, Executive Vice President of Hunt Companies. ""Our partners UHC and Ikaika 'Ohana are delivering a critically needed rental housing community that will enable 200 area families to move into homes starting this coming December."" Colón continued, ""All of us at Hunt are grateful to have collaborated with the community and organizations like UHC and Ikaika 'Ohana as we create affordable housing for local families statewide, but particularly now on Maui, which needs so much of our support. With this investment, CVS Health is changing lives and helping to put island residents into their own homes."" Furthering its investment in the state, CVS Health also invested $17.3 million with The Kobayashi Group, The Ahe Group and CREA, LLC to build 169 new affordable housing units in Parkway Village at Kapolei, on the Island of O'ahu. Horizon Housing Foundation, a St. Louis-based nonprofit, will be providing no-cost services to residents, including education and building community, health, and wellness programs Kamehameha Schools, a Hawai'i-based, nationally recognized education group, will operate a tuition free preschool on the ground floor of one of the five residential buildings, along with the Board of Education and Partners in Development Foundation. ""Parkway Village is an incredible project in Hawai'i's fastest growing community that we are so proud of ,"" said Alana Kobayashi Pakkala, Executive Vice President and Managing Partner of Kobayashi Group. ""We know the importance of affordable housing and early childhood education, especially in West O'ahu, so we're grateful for this public-private collaboration with CVS Health, City and County of Honolulu and HHFDC."" The integration of early childcare facilities into both developments aligns with the state's universal access to preschool initiative, Ready Keiki, spearheaded by Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke. ""Partnerships, such as the collaboration with CVS Health, play a pivotal role in fostering nurturing communities, where families receive comprehensive support, and our children are provided with the environment to thrive and realize their full potential,"" said Luke. ""As we work to ensure all Hawaiʻi children are ready for kindergarten and beyond, the support from CVS Health and community partners is invaluable."" With the addition of Kaiāulu o Kūku'ia and Parkway Village, CVS Health has invested $62.2 million in affordable housing across Hawai'i to date, highlighting the company's efforts to advance health equity by addressing social determinants of health at the local level. Through these investments, CVS Health has provided historically underserved Hawai'i communities with quality housing and increased access to childcare and health care services based on the unique needs of each local population. Beyond its affordable housing investments, CVS Health's commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of Hawai'i residents can be seen through its philanthropic efforts, workforce initiatives and expanded retail presence in the region. Residents of Kaiāulu o Kūku'ia and Parkway Village will have access to educational opportunities and employment services and training through two new career skills labs in Kahului and Waimānalo. Funded in collaboration with CVS Health and the University of Hawai'i Maui College and Hawai'i Job Corps, respectively, the mock Longs Drugs pharmacy environments offer virtual and hands-on pharmacy technician skills training to help reduce employment barriers and provide the tools participants need to succeed in the workplace. And recently, CVS Health opened a new Longs Drugs store in Kapolei on O'ahu, marking the company's 60th Longs Drugs location in Hawai'i. Given the significance of local relationship to Lahaina residents, financing a new affordable housing investment after the wildfires reinforces the importance of Longs as an anchor in the community. Following the 2023 Maui wildfires, the area pharmacy team provided daily deliveries to three community shelters to help ensure continued access to medication and hosted a three-week drive-thru donation clinic to provide preventative care and essential goods to residents while working to reopen the impacted store for the community as quickly as possible. Also, following the fires, the CVS Health Foundation committed $450,000 to several organizations providing direct relief, including the Hawai'i Community Foundation's Maui Strong Fund, the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen. CVS Health customers contributed over $2 million to our in-store fundraising campaign to support the Maui Strong Fund and the Maui United Way. ""These investments and collaborations echo our longstanding commitment to supporting and uplifting the people of Hawai'i,"" said Scott Sutton, Regional Director, CVS Health. ""We're providing community members with access to meaningful affordable housing, health care, and educational and workforce opportunities to ensure that they have the resources they need to improve their overall wellbeing.""

The resulting study, Reflecting Me, revealed that audiences craved better representation both on- and off-screen.In 2023, as part of our Content for Change initiative, Paramount Insights set out to refresh their understanding and build upon those findings from two years earlier. In addition to a new global survey of consumers ages 13 to 49 in 15 countries, Paramount Insights spoke to a variety of leading figures shaping the global conversation around media and culture.Here's some of what was learned from this research about the current state of inclusion:People value diversity and believe their societies are becoming more diverse. Most adults globally (88%) agree their country is diverse, and 90% agree that the diversity of society has either stayed the same or increased over the last 2 years. Today, 62% of adults identify with at least one marginalized identity, up from 51% in 2021. Alongside these changes is a widespread sentiment that acceptance is something to work towards. Most adults (85%) agree that it's important for people to become more open minded and accepting.At the same time, people around the world see their societies dividing rather than uniting, with the rights of marginalized groups under attack. People are more likely to believe the ""togetherness of society"" in their country is decreasing (35%) rather than increasing (25%), with 40% thinking it's stayed the same. Close to 7 in 10 (68%) believe discrimination toward minority groups is a problem. LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and those with non-conforming body types are perceived as facing the least societal acceptance.The increasing societal division is in part a backlash to the progress of the last few years. Young males are driving some of this change. More than other demographics, males 13 to 24 differed from the overall global sample in their disagreement with several statements - that all people should have the right to live as whatever gender feels right to them (28% vs. 22%), that transgender people should have the same rights as everyone else (29% vs. 23%), in supporting same sex marriage (40% vs. 33%), and that there's too much violence against women in their country (34% vs. 23%).People value diversity and believe their societies are becoming more diverse.

The partnerships mark key milestones in XPENG's global expansion strategy, aiming to establish a strong presence in the smart EV sector. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of XPENG into new international markets is a strategic move that could potentially increase the company's global footprint and market share within the electric vehicle (EV) sector. By establishing partnerships in the UAE, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Jordan and Lebanon, XPENG is accessing diverse consumer bases and mitigating the risks associated with reliance on a single market. The choice of countries indicates a targeted approach, focusing on regions where EV growth is expected to be robust.The introduction of the G6 SUV and G9 SUV models, built on XPENG's SEPA 2.0 platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and cost efficiency.

Financial Analyst The announcement of XPENG's partnerships and subsequent market entries is a significant development for investors, as it signals the company's aggressive pursuit of growth and its potential to diversify revenue streams. By tapping into new markets, XPENG is not only expanding its sales potential but also spreading its operational risk across a wider geographic area. This could be seen as a positive move by investors who are looking for companies with a clear strategy for sustainable growth.However, the costs associated with establishing a presence in new markets, including setting up branded showrooms and service networks, will likely impact XPENG's short-term financials.

SJW Group Announces 2023 Financial Results,2024-02-22T03:06:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) exceeded financial expectations in 2023 with $2.68 diluted earnings per share, surpassing 2022's $2.43.

A 2024 guidance of $2.68 to $2.78 diluted earnings per share was issued.","SJW Group Announces 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) exceeded financial expectations in 2023 with $2.68 diluted earnings per share, surpassing 2022's $2.43. They invested $272 million in infrastructure, achieving a 10.01% return on equity in California. A 2024 guidance of $2.68 to $2.78 diluted earnings per share was issued. Positive Exceeded 2023 financial expectations with $2.68 diluted earnings per share compared to $2.43 in 2022. Invested $272 million in infrastructure, surpassing 2023 guidance. Achieved a 10.01% return on equity in California as of January 1, 2024. Issued 2024 guidance of $2.68 to $2.78 diluted earnings per share. Negative Quarterly net income decreased by 43% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Operating revenue for Q4 2023 was slightly lower compared to Q4 2022. Operating expenses increased by 11% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The reported earnings of $2.68 per diluted share represent a significant 10.3% increase from the prior year's $2.43, surpassing the initial guidance range and aligning with the updated forecast. This suggests a robust financial performance that may appeal to investors seeking companies with strong earnings growth. The 15% rise in net income and an 8% increase in operating revenue are indicative of effective cost management and revenue enhancement strategies, which could positively influence investor sentiment and stock valuation.The company's capital expenditure of $272 million, which exceeded its guidance, reflects a commitment to long-term growth through infrastructure investments. This level of reinvestment is substantial and may affect short-term cash flows but is expected to enhance service reliability and regulatory compliance, potentially yielding long-term benefits for shareholders. The 10.01% WCCM-adjusted return on equity in California is a critical metric, as it indicates the profitability from shareholders' equity, which is above the standard utility sector average of 9-10%, making it a significant point for investor consideration. Market Research Analyst The customer base growth in Texas by 12%, driven by organic growth and strategic acquisitions, is a vital indicator of the company's market expansion and could signal future revenue increases. The investments in the water supply portfolio in this rapidly growing service area align with demographic trends and may present opportunities for increased market share and revenue.Regulatory outcomes, such as the WCCM-adjusted return on equity and revenue increases in Maine, are essential for utility companies like SJW Group, which operate in a highly regulated environment. These outcomes can provide stability and predictability in earnings, which are favorable factors for investors. The regulatory approval for capital expenditure plans, including treatment for PFAS, demonstrates the company's proactive approach to addressing environmental concerns, which may enhance its public image and potentially lead to increased customer trust and market growth. Economist The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, which includes factors such as inflationary pressures on operational costs and interest rates affecting borrowing costs. The decrease in income taxes due to the partial release of an uncertain tax position reserve has a non-recurring positive impact on earnings, which analysts should consider when projecting future tax rates and net income.The reported decrease in maintenance costs and increase in general and administrative expenses reflect a shift in spending priorities. The proactive asset management and advanced leak detection programs that contributed to lower maintenance expenses may indicate operational efficiency and could result in reduced long-term costs. However, the increase in water production costs and interest expenses due to higher borrowing costs are concerns that require monitoring, as they could impact future profitability if not managed effectively. 02/21/2024 - 10:06 PM $2.68 of diluted earnings per share in 2023 surpassing $2.43 per diluted share in 2022, initial 2023 guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 and inline with the updated guidance of $2.65 to $2.70 $272 million in infrastructure investments, exceeding 2023 guidance 10.01% Water Cost of Capital Mechanism (WCCM)-adjusted return on equity in California as of January 1, 2024 2024 guidance issued of $2.68 to $2.78 diluted earnings per share SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) today reported financial results for 2023. “With a strong fourth quarter, our 2023 financial results and operating performance exceeded expectations and the initial earnings per share guidance we set for SJW Group at this time last year,” stated SJW Group Chair, CEO, and President, Eric W. Thornburg. “The results we announce today are a testament to our talented teams across the country delivering on our company’s mission to be a force for good every day for our customers, communities and shareholders.” Continued Thornburg, “I’m also pleased to share that we met and surpassed our annual capital expenditure goal in 2023 by $17 million, with $272 million invested in improving and maintaining our water supply and infrastructure across our local operations. We secured constructive regulatory outcomes that in 2024 are providing a 10.01% WCCM-adjusted return on equity in California, and a $2.6 million revenue increase in Maine related to operating and financing costs for our award-winning Saco River Drinking Water Resource Center. Importantly, we grew our customer base in Texas by 12% in 2023 through organic growth and acquisitions, while also significantly increasing our water supply portfolio in this rapidly growing service area through strategic acquisitions. I’m confident that our continued focus on executing our proven growth strategy will position us for further success in 2024.” 2023 Operating Results Net income in 2023 was $85.0 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, up 15% compared to $73.8 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, in 2022, surpassing initial guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share and inline with updated guidance of $2.65 to $2.70 per diluted share announced in October 2023. The increase was primarily driven by rate filings in California and Maine, a decrease in income taxes due to the partial release of an uncertain tax position reserve (which had a $0.14 positive impact on net income per diluted share), and lower maintenance costs; partially offset by higher water production costs and increased interest expense from higher cost of borrowings for our short-term debt and new long-term debt. Operating revenue for 2023 was $670.4 million, up 8% compared to $620.7 million for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by $46.6 million in rate filings, $5.7 million due to regulatory mechanism adjustments, and customer growth of $3.8 million; partially offset by lower customer usage of $6.6 million driven primarily by weather conditions in California, Maine, and Texas. Operating expenses for 2023 were $520.9 million, up 6% compared to $489.7 million for 2022. This change in operating expenses reflects: An increase in water production expenses of $23.4 million, to $256.2 million in 2023 compared to $232.8 million in 2022, due to the higher cost of purchased water, partially offset by lower usage; A decrease in the gain on sale of nonutility properties of $6.2 million due to the recording of a non-recurring sale of non utility properties in 2022, and no recorded gain on the sale of nonutility properties in 2023; An increase in general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million primarily due to allowances for customer credit losses; An increase in depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million primarily due to increases in depreciation related to new utility plant additions; partially offset by a $2.4 million one-time impact related to amortization on certain Cupertino concession assets in 2022; and A decrease in maintenance expenses of $5.0 million primarily due to a one-time cost incurred in the prior year. In addition, our proactive asset management and advanced leak detection programs, which enable us to reduce emergency projects and replace them with scheduled improvements, also contributed to lower maintenance expenses for the year. The effective consolidated income tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were approximately 7% and 10%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily due to the partial release of an uncertain tax position reserve. Note Regarding Fourth Quarter Operating Results Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 fourth quarter operating results are affected by and reflect the delay in San Jose Water Company's (SJWC) 2022 to 2024 general rate case (GRC) proceeding. As a reminder, while the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the settlement agreement and SJWC recorded the authorized revenue increase from the GRC in the fourth quarter of 2022, the revenue increase was retroactive to January 1, 2022. This delayed recognition of GRC-authorized revenues affects quarter-over-quarter comparisons through 2023. As noted last quarter, the CPUC approved SJWC's request for reinstatement of the Water Conservation Memorandum Account (WCMA) and Water Conservation Expense Memorandum Account (WCEMA) on October 2, 2023. The WCMA and WCEMA are temporary revenue protection mechanisms that allow water utilities to track for potential future recovery revenue losses and incremental expenses in response to water conservation efforts. The mechanisms were no longer available after the end of the drought emergency on April 11, 2023. SJWC requested authorization to reinstate the mechanisms based on our water wholesaler’s, Valley Water, request for a voluntary 15% reduction in water usage. Valley Water has cited restricted local storage over the next decade and precipitation volatility as the basis for continuing voluntary conservation. The reinstated WCMA and WCEMA protections were retroactive to April 20, 2023 and remain in effect. Quarterly Operating Results Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $18.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, a 43% decrease compared to $33.5 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the delayed decision in SJWC's 2022 GRC proceeding and higher production costs in 2023. Operating revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $171.3 million, a slight decrease compared to $171.4 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by SJWC's delayed 2022 GRC, which resulted in approximately $20.7 million being reflected entirely in the fourth quarter of 2022; partially offset by $12.5 million in rate filings, an increase of $6.6 million due to regulatory mechanism adjustments, customer growth of $0.8 million, and higher customer usage of $0.7 million driven primarily by weather conditions and the end of California mandatory water conservation requirements. Operating expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $134.8 million, up 11% compared to $121.0 million for the same quarter last year. This change in operating expenses reflects: An increase in water production expenses of $11.6 million due to increased groundwater extraction charges, resulting in $64.7 million in water production expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $53.1 million in the same quarter last year; An increase in taxes other than income tax of $1.1 million; An increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million primarily due to increases in new utility plant additions; A decrease in the gain on the sale of nonutility properties of $0.7 million due to the recording of a non-recurring sale of non utility properties in the fourth quarter 2022, and no recorded gain on the sale of nonutility properties in the fourth quarter 2023; and A decrease in maintenance expenses of $3.2 million primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year related to the Order of Instituting Investigation settlement agreement. The effective consolidated income tax rates for the fourth quarter of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately 9% and 13%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the partial release of an uncertain tax position reserve. Capital Expenditures In 2023 SJW Group invested $272 million in infrastructure and water supply, which exceeded our 2023 capital expenditures guidance of $255 million. SJW Group plans to invest more than $1.6 billion in capital over the next 5 years to build and maintain its water and wastewater operations, including approximately $230 million to install treatment for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), subject to regulatory approvals and availability of funding. Rate Activity and Regulatory Updates California On December 28, 2023, the CPUC approved SJWC's Advice Letter 603 establishing a Group Insurance Balancing Account effective on January 1, 2024. The purpose of the account is to capture the difference between authorized and actual medical, dental, and opt-out insurance costs. On January 1, 2024, new rates went into effect that included a WCCM-adjusted return on equity (ROE) of 10.01%, less 20 basis points (bps) for use of the WCMA, a 5.28% cost of debt, a capital structure of 54.55% equity, and a 7.75% overall rate of return (ROR) including the 20 bps ROE reduction due to the WCMA. On January 1, 2023, the ROE was 8.80%, the cost of debt was 6.20%, the capital structure was 53.28% equity, and the overall ROR was 7.64%. On January 2, 2024, SJWC filed its 2024 GRC application with the CPUC for new rates spanning 2025 to 2027. The company proposed an increase over current authorized revenues of approximately $55.2 million, or 11.1%, in 2025, approximately $22.0 million, or 4.0%, in 2026, and approximately $25.8 million, or 4.5%, in 2027. SJWC is also proposing a 3-year $540 million capital expenditure program focusing on: Treating PFAS in drinking water; Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through solar generation, energy storage systems, continued electrification of our vehicle fleet, and expansion of our advanced leak detection program; and Advancing the CPUC’s Environmental and Social Justice Action Plan by improving access to high-quality water service, climate resiliency, and economic and workforce development. On February 2, 2024, SJWC, along with three other Class A California water utilities, received approval from CPUC granting a one-year deferment in their 2024 Cost of Capital (COC) filings to May 1, 2025 in response to the water utilities' request for a one-year postponement of their COC filings otherwise scheduled to be filed on May 1, 2024. This deferment alleviates administrative processing costs for both the water utilities and CPUC staff. The approved deferral includes a provision that the WCCM remains in place for 2025 and allows it to adjust up or down in accordance with movements of 100 bps or more in the Moody’s Aa Utility Bond Index between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Connecticut On October 3, 2023, The Connecticut Water Company (CWC) filed a GRC application with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) to amend rates. CWC is requesting a $21.4 million, or approximately 18.1%, increase over current authorized revenues to recover approximately $135 million in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure investment, as well increased operating and borrowing costs. CWC expects any PURA authorized increase in rates to be effective on or about July 1, 2024. Maine On January 5, 2024, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved a stipulation agreement between Maine Water Company (MWC) and the Office of the Public Advocate to settle MWC’s March 2023 rate application in the Biddeford Saco Division. Under the approved agreement, MWC annual revenues will increase by $2.6 million, or 17.6%, effective January 1, 2024. MWC had requested a $2.9 million revenue increase in March 2023 to cover the operating expenses and increased borrowing costs of the $60 million Saco River Drinking Water Resource Center that went in-service in June 2022. Texas On January 5, 2024, The Texas Water Company (TWC) filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) to acquire 3009 Water Company, a water system serving approximately 270 water customers in Comal County, Texas. On January 26, 2024, TWC closed on the acquisition of Elm Ridge, a water system serving approximately 21 water customers in Comal County, Texas. TWC's completed application for a system improvement charge (SIC) is pending before the PUCT. We expect the PUCT to issue a final decision on the application in the first quarter of 2024. The SIC would allow TWC to add certain utility plant additions made since 2020 to its rate base, thereby increasing revenue and avoiding the need for a general rate case in 2024. At the time of filing in December 2022, the SIC was projected to increase TWC’s annualized water revenue by $1.6 million, and sewer revenue by $29,000 within one year of the SIC's approval. Corporate Responsibility Recognition SJW Group was recently recognized in the Newsweek Excellence 1000 Index 2024. SJW Group was the highest ranked water utility company in the index, which ranks a select group of 1000 companies globally that have been identified as exemplars of corporate success and responsibility. 2024 Guidance The following is the company’s 2024 full-year guidance: Net income per diluted common share of $2.68 to $2.78; and Regulated infrastructure investments of approximately $332 million in 2024 In addition, we reiterate our non-linear long-term diluted EPS growth of 5% to 7%, anchored off 2022's diluted EPS of $2.43. When considering the company's 2024 guidance relative to actual results in 2023, it is important to note that the company's adjustment to income tax reserves in 2023 resulted in an increase of $0.14 per diluted share. Our guidance is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those factors outlined in the “Forward Looking Statements” of this release and the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company also announces a normal course issuer bid to repurchase common shares. Positive Pan American Silver Corp. enters 2024 with $440.9 million in cash and short-term investments and $750.0 million available credit facility. Record silver production of 4.8 million ounces in Q4 2023 and 20.4 million ounces in FY 2023. Record gold production of 267.8 thousand ounces in Q4 2023 and 882.9 thousand ounces in FY 2023. Record revenue of $669.6 million in Q4 2023 and $2.3 billion in FY 2023. Net loss of $67.8 million in Q4 2023 and $104.9 million in FY 2023. $16.5 million in additional earnings due to finalization of PPA asset values for Yamana acquisition. $36.2 million impairment charge for crushing and agglomeration plant at Shahuindo in Q4 2023. Adjusted loss of $16.3 million in Q4 2023 and adjusted earnings of $39.3 million in FY 2023. Cash flow from operating activities of $167.4 million in Q4 2023 and $450.2 million in FY 2023. Working capital of $765.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with $440.9 million in cash and short-term investments. Capital expenditures of $429.7 million in 2023, below the 2023 Guidance range. Announcement of $0.10 per common share cash dividend. Negative Net losses recorded for Q4 2023 and FY 2023. Higher than expected Silver Segment Cash Costs and AISC in FY 2023. Higher Gold Segment Cash Costs in Q4 2023. Total debt of $801.6 million related to construction and loans. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Pan American Silver Corp. demonstrate a mixed financial performance with significant strategic developments. Despite achieving record revenue in both Q4 2023 and FY 2023, the company faced a net loss for both periods. The discrepancy between high revenue and net loss may suggest operational challenges or high costs that could be concerning to investors. The adjusted earnings provide a more normalized view of performance by excluding one-time charges, offering a glimpse into the company's operational efficiency.The completion of the new ventilation system at La Colorada is expected to improve operations and reduce costs, which could be a positive indicator for future profitability. However, the higher-than-guidance cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for silver and slightly above-guidance cash costs for gold in FY 2023 may raise questions about cost control and operational efficiency. Investors may need to watch for improvements in cost management in future quarters.The company's liquidity position, with significant cash and short-term investments, alongside an undrawn credit facility, suggests strong financial flexibility. However, the total debt level post-Yamana acquisition will require careful monitoring. The intention to repurchase shares indicates management's belief that the current share price undervalues the company, which could be an attempt to instill shareholder confidence. Mining Sector Analyst The strategic initiatives outlined, including the advancement of the La Colorada Skarn project and the optimization of the Jacobina operations, indicate an aggressive growth and optimization strategy. The capital expenditure focused on these projects, although below the 2023 Guidance range, represents a significant investment in the company's future growth. The mining sector often requires substantial upfront capital investments with long-term payoffs and these projects could potentially increase production capacity and reduce costs in the long run.The impairment charge for the Shahuindo plant and the closure and decommissioning expense at Alamo Dorado reflect asset-specific challenges and the ongoing need to manage legacy issues effectively. The impairment charge, in particular, may highlight the risks associated with acquisitions and the importance of due diligence and post-acquisition integration.Investors in the mining sector are typically interested in both the operational aspects, such as production levels and costs, as well as strategic developments that can drive long-term value. The record gold production within guidance suggests operational success in this area, while the slightly below guidance silver production may warrant attention to operational challenges in the silver segment. Economist The financial results of Pan American Silver Corp. reflect broader economic trends in the precious metals market. Record revenues amidst a net loss might indicate external pressures such as fluctuating commodity prices, exchange rates, or increased operational costs. The strategic focus on optimizing operations and reducing costs is a common response to such macroeconomic challenges.Investments in projects like the La Colorada Skarn project could be seen as a long-term bet on the price of silver and the company's ability to bring this project online efficiently will be crucial in a market where prices can be volatile. The company's sustainability-linked credit facility also reflects a growing trend in the finance sector, where lenders provide incentives for borrowers to achieve certain sustainability performance targets, which may have favorable implications for the company's cost of capital.The declared dividend, despite the net loss, suggests a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which could be a positive signal to the market about the company's future cash flow expectations. However, the balance between rewarding shareholders and maintaining sufficient capital for operations and debt management is a delicate one that requires prudent financial stewardship. 02/21/2024 - 09:18 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE: PAAS) (TSX: PAAS) (""Pan American"" or the ""Company"") reports fourth quarter (""Q4 2023"") financial results and audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 (""FY 2023""). ""Pan American enters 2024 in a solid financial position with cash and short-term investments totaling $440.9 million and the full $750.0 million available under our undrawn credit facility,"" said Michael Steinmann, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We expect cash flow generation in 2024 to benefit from a full year contribution of the assets we acquired through the Yamana Gold transaction, improved operations at La Colorada with higher throughput and lower costs in the second half of the year following completion of the new ventilation system, and reduced care and maintenance costs. Strategic initiatives in 2024 include advancing our La Colorada Skarn project, with engagement on long-term development partnerships currently underway, completing a study to optimize the Jacobina operations, and further portfolio rationalization."" ""Today we also announced our intention to make a normal course issuer bid to repurchase our common shares when we believe that the market price of our shares, from time to time, may not fully reflect the underlying value of our mining operations, properties and future growth prospects,"" added Mr. Steinmann. Q4 2023 and FY 2023 HIGHLIGHTS: Silver production was 4.8 million ounces in Q4 2023 and 20.4 million ounces in FY 2023. Gold production achieved record levels of 267.8 thousand ounces in Q4 2023 and 882.9 thousand ounces in FY 2023. Silver production was slightly below the guidance range provided in Pan American's news release dated April 27, 2023 (the ""2023 Guidance"") and gold production was within the 2023 Guidance range. Record revenue of $669.6 million and $2.3 billion was recorded for Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively. A net loss of $67.8 million, or $0.19 basic loss per share, was recorded for Q4 2023 and a net loss of $104.9 million, or $0.32 basic loss per share, for FY 2023. Pan American finalized the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") asset values for the Yamana Gold Inc. (""Yamana"") acquisition in Q4 2023. International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") for business acquisitions require that all accounting impacts to earnings from the finalization of PPA asset values be retrospectively recast to prior quarters since the date of the acquisition. As a result, an additional $16.5 million ($0.05 per share) in earnings for the year related to revised depreciation charges for the final PPA asset values must be retroactively applied to Q2 2023 and Q3 2023 rather than applied to Q4 2023 earnings. There is no impact on FY 2023 earnings. In addition, Q4 2023 earnings were impacted by a $36.2 million impairment charge for the crushing and agglomeration plant at Shahuindo, which has never been operated and was built before Pan American acquired the mine in February 2019, and a $13.8 million closure and decommissioning expense, largely due to revised estimates at Alamo Dorado to further bolster waste dump covers and site drainage systems. Adjusted loss of $16.3 million, or $0.04 basic adjusted loss per share, in Q4 2023. FY 2023 adjusted earnings were $39.3 million, or $0.12 basic adjusted earnings per share. The impact of the impairment charge and closure and decommissioning expense was adjusted from Q4 2023 earnings. Cash flow generated from operating activities was $167.4 million in Q4 2023 and $450.2 million for FY 2023. Silver Segment Cash Costs were $19.31 and $13.07 per ounce in Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively. Silver Segment all-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") were $26.55 and $18.17 per ounce in Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively. FY 2023 Silver Segment Cash Costs and AISC were above the 2023 Guidance ranges. The higher costs were largely affected by the ventilation-driven production shortfalls at La Colorada and an increase in underground mine developments at Huaron, partially offset by lower than expected costs at Cerro Moro from higher throughput and higher gold prices, process plant optimizations and organizational enhancements. Gold Segment Cash Costs were $1,096 and $1,113 per ounce in Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively. Gold Segment AISC were $1,411 and $1,371 per ounce in Q4 2023 and FY 2023, respectively. FY 2023 Gold Segment Cash Costs were slightly above the 2023 Guidance range while AISC were within the 2023 Guidance range. The higher than forecast Gold Segment Cash Costs were due to lower than anticipated gold production at El Peñon. Capital expenditures totaled $429.7 million in 2023, comprised of $288.5 million of sustaining capital, $94.5 million of project capital, which was largely directed to the La Colorada Skarn project and Jacobina, and $46.8 million in non-recurring non-sustaining expenditures largely related to MARA. The new ventilation shaft at La Colorada was fully excavated to a depth of 581 meters on schedule in December 2023. Sustaining and project capital expenditures were both below the 2023 Guidance range. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of $765.8 million, inclusive of cash and short-term investments of $440.9 million, and $750.0 million available under its revolving Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. Total debt of $801.6 million was related to construction and other loans, leases and two senior notes Pan American assumed through the acquisition of Yamana. A cash dividend of $0.10 per common share has been declared, payable on or about March 15, 2024, to holders of record of Pan American’s common shares as of the close on March 4, 2024. The dividends are eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes. Pan American Silver Announces Intention to Make a Normal Course Issuer Bid Pan American today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a normal course issuer bid (the ""Bid"") to purchase up to 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. The Bid is subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX""). It is expected that the Bid will begin on or around March 6, 2024, and will continue until on or around March 5, 2025, or an earlier date should the Company complete its purchases. All common shares acquired by the Company under the Bid will be cancelled and purchases will be funded out of Pan American’s working capital. Although the Company has a present intention to acquire its common shares pursuant to the Bid, it is not obligated to make any purchases, and the actual number of common shares to be purchased, and the timing of any purchases, will be at the Company’s discretion. Purchases pursuant to the Bid would be made on the open market through the facilities of the TSX and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and alternative trading systems. Pan American will pay the market price at the time of acquisition of any common shares in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX and NYSE and applicable securities laws. Pan American believes that the market price of its common shares, from time to time, may not fully reflect the underlying value of its mining operations, properties and future growth prospects. Under such circumstances, the repurchase of common shares represents an appealing investment for Pan American since a portion of the Company’s excess cash generated on an annual basis can be invested for an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital through the Bid. ILO 169 Consultation for the Escobal Mine A new government took office in Guatemala in January 2024 and we had our first meeting with the new Minister of Energy and Mines (""MEM"") on February 7, 2024. A meeting for the ILO 169 consultation was held on February 21, 2024, with the newly appointed Vice Minister of Energy and Mines and Xinka representatives, during which a presentation on the observations of the Xinka’s appointed consultants was communicated. We look forward to receipt of the report and working with the MEM to ensure accurate information is communicated to the Xinka participating in the consultation process. As usual, we are not providing a timeframe for completion of the consultation or a potential restart of the mine. Pan American appoints Senior Vice President, Operations and Projects Pan American is pleased to announce that Scott Campbell has been appointed Senior Vice President, Operations and Projects, effective April 2, 2024. Scott will oversee the Company's operations and lead the Corporate Projects Group, reporting to Pan American's Chief Operating Officer, Steve Busby. Scott was most recently General Manager for Dundee Precious Metals in Ecuador. Previous to that role, he was Pan American’s Vice President of South American Projects from 2018 to 2022, and held senior positions with Barrick Gold Corporation as well as other engineering and exploration companies. Scott earned a bachelor’s degree in Earth Sciences from Dalhousie University in Canada and has completed business and project management programs at various universities. George Greer, Senior Vice President, Projects, will support Scott in his new position until George retires in June 2024. Pan American extends its best wishes to George for his retirement, and its appreciation for his more than 17 years of distinguished service to the Company. Throughout his career with Pan American, George demonstrated his unwavering commitment to safety, personnel development and efficiently delivering high-quality, ""fit-for-purpose"" projects that are a hallmark of Pan American's history. 2024 OPERATING OUTLOOK Pan American provided its operating outlook for 2024 in the news release dated January 17, 2024, as further detailed below and in the Company's Management's Discussion & Analysis for the period ended December 31, 2023.

These measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS as an indicator of performance, and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions. These non-GAAP financial measures include: Cash Costs. Pan American's method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and, accordingly, Pan American's Cash Costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Investors are cautioned that Cash Costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs, depreciation and amortization, and royalties determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of performance. Adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share. Pan American believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management's judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors, which are unrelated to operations in the period, and/or relate to items that will settle in future periods. All-in Sustaining Costs per silver or gold ounce sold, net of by-product credits (""AISC""). Pan American has adopted AISC as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively, and Pan American believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce, as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration, the cost of ongoing capital investments (sustaining capital), general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affect Pan American's consolidated earnings and cash flow. Total debt is calculated as the total current and non-current portions of: long-term debt, finance lease liabilities and loans payable. Total debt does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Pan American and certain investors use this information to evaluate the financial debt leverage of Pan American. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. Working capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Pan American and certain investors use this information to evaluate whether Pan American is able to meet its current obligations using its current assets. Total available liquidity is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents, Short-term Investments, and the amount available on the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. Total available liquidity does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Pan American and certain investors use this information to evaluate the liquid assets available to Pan American. Readers should refer to the ""Alternative Performance (non-GAAP) Measures"" section of Pan American’s Q4 2023 MD&A for a more detailed discussion of these and other non-GAAP measures and their calculation.

(EQX) releases its audited financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023, reporting strong production and low cash costs. The company plans to produce 660,000 to 750,000 ounces of gold in 2024 with favorable cost projections. Positive Equinox Gold reported its strongest quarter of production in Q4 2023 with 564,458 ounces of gold produced at all-in sustaining costs of $1,622 per ounce. The construction at Greenstone was completed at the end of 2023, with focus shifting to hot commissioning and operations ramp up for first gold production in the first half of 2024. The company anticipates producing between 660,000 to 750,000 ounces of gold in 2024 with cash costs ranging from $1,340 to $1,445 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs between $1,630 to $1,740 per ounce. Equinox Gold started 2024 with $360 million in total liquidity, bolstered by cash flow from operating mines and marketable investments. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Equinox Gold Corp. regarding its audited consolidated financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is a key indicator of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The reported full-year production of 564,458 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,622 per ounce is a crucial metric for investors. AISC is a comprehensive cost measure used in the mining industry that reflects the full cost of gold production from current operations, which investors closely monitor as it impacts profitability.Furthermore, the projection for 2024 with an anticipated gold production increase to between 660,000 and 750,000 ounces and a reduction in cash costs, suggests that Equinox Gold is expecting to improve operational efficiency and cost control. However, the forecasted AISC range of $1,630 to $1,740 per ounce indicates that costs are not expected to decrease significantly, which could be a concern if gold prices do not remain favorable. The company's total liquidity of $360 million at the start of 2024 provides a cushion for strategic initiatives or to weather potential downturns in the gold market. Market Research Analyst Equinox Gold's performance and projections can have implications for the broader gold mining sector. The company's strongest quarter of production at the end of 2023 might reflect well on its operational capabilities, potentially setting a benchmark within the industry. The successful completion of the Greenstone project construction and the scheduled commencement of gold production in the first half of 2024 could provide additional production capacity and revenue streams.Investors and stakeholders often look at such developments as indicators of a company's growth trajectory and its ability to execute on strategic plans. The company's operational updates and forward-looking statements are significant as they can influence market perceptions and investment decisions. However, the reliance on market conditions, particularly the volatile nature of gold prices, remains a risk factor that could affect the company's performance against its projections. Mining Industry Expert The completion of the Greenstone project construction is a substantial achievement for Equinox Gold, considering the scale and complexity typically involved in such large-scale mining projects. The transition to hot commissioning, which is the testing of the plant's systems at operational temperatures and pressures, followed by the ramp-up of operations, is a critical phase that precedes full-scale production. Successfully navigating this phase can lead to increased investor confidence in the company's project management and technical capabilities.Additionally, the mention of marketable investments in the financial report suggests that Equinox Gold is diversifying its portfolio, which could mitigate risk and potentially provide additional revenue. This strategy might be particularly appealing to investors who are looking for companies with a balanced approach to growth and risk management within the mining sector. 02/21/2024 - 09:08 PM All financial figures are in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated.Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 21, 2024) - Equinox Gold Corp.

Gold ounces sold in Q4 2023 were marginally higher compared to Q4 2022 primarily due to higher production at RDM, offset partially by lower production at Fazenda and Santa Luz. At RDM, the higher production was primarily due to higher grades from the mining of in-situ ore, and reduced reliance on rehandling low-grade ore stockpiles. At Fazenda, the lower production was primarily due to lower ore tonnes and grades from open pit mining due to mine sequencing. At Santa Luz, the lower production was primarily due to challenges with the elution and electrowinning circuits.For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 5% more gold ounces compared to 2022.The increase in gold sales for the year was primarily due to higher production at Los Filos, RDM, Santa Luz and Aurizona, offset partially by lower production at Mesquite and not having production from Mercedes after it was sold in April 2022. The higher gold production at Los Filos was driven by increased ore mining and stacking activity in 2023 compared to 2022. The higher gold production for the year at RDM was for the reasons mentioned above. In addition, RDM had a temporary suspension of operations in 2022 that affected gold production for that year. The higher production at Santa Luz was due to a full year of commercial operations in 2023. Santa Luz achieved commercial production at the beginning of Q4 2022. The higher production at Aurizona was due to better access to higher-grade ore benches of the main pit and increased ore processed. The lower production at Mesquite was primarily due to a smaller pit approach to reduce waste stripping and a longer leach cycle for some of the ore being placed.Revenue was higher in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 primarily due to higher gold prices. The Company realized $1,983 per ounce sold in Q4 2023 generating $297.8 million in revenue, compared to $1,733 per ounce sold in Q4 2022 generating $259.3 million in revenue.Cash cost per oz sold and AISC per oz sold were 10% and 9% higher in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, respectively, primarily driven by higher cash costs at Los Filos and Fazenda. Cash cost per oz sold and AISC per oz sold for 2023 were in line with 2022 results. While input costs were generally lower in 2023, the strengthening of the Mexican Peso (""MXN"") and Brazilian Réal (""BRL"") compared to the USD more than offset these lower costs in Mexico and Brazil.In Q4 2023, income from mine operations was $38.6 million (Q4 2022 - $32.0 million) and for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $109.0 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - $85.0 million). The higher income from mine operations in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 was mainly the result of higher income from operations at RDM, Los Filos and Mesquite, driven by higher average realized gold price per ounce sold at each site, as well as higher production at RDM, and lower operating costs at Mesquite, offset partially by lower income from mine operations at Santa Luz, which was primarily due to lower production. The higher income from mine operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was mainly the result of higher production at Los Filos, Aurizona and RDM, and higher average realized gold price per ounce sold, offset partially by lower income from mine operations at Mesquite and Santa Luz, which was primarily due to lower production. Income from mine operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was also impacted by the sale of Mercedes in April 2022. Net income for Q4 2023 was $3.9 million (Q4 2022 - net income of $22.6 million) and net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $28.9 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - net loss of $106.0 million). The lower net income in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 was mainly due to a lower tax recovery and higher finance expense, offset partially by higher income from mine operations. The higher net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was mainly due to higher income from mine operations, in addition to a tax recovery of $14.1 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - tax expense of $7.6 million) and other income of $31.1 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - other expense of $67.9 million). Other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a $46.2 million gain on change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts and a $34.5 million gain on sale of the Company's partial interest and reclassification of investment in i-80 Gold, offset partially by $13.8 million in expected credit losses and write-offs. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $69.9 million loss on change in fair value of share purchase warrants.In Q4 2023, adjusted EBITDA was $95.3 million (Q4 2022 - $74.3 million) and for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $304.4 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - $168.0 million). In Q4 2023, adjusted net income was $2.4 million (Q4 2022 - $7.0 million) and for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $21.7 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - adjusted net loss of $91.5 million). The increase in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income in Q4 2023 was primarily due to higher income from mine operations, in addition to a $6.9 million realized gain on foreign exchange contracts in Q4 2023 (Q4 2022 - realized gain of $1.2 million). The increase in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher income from mine operations, in addition to a $32.8 million realized gain on foreign exchange contracts (year ended December 31, 2022 - realized gain of $1.2 million) and a $0.8 million realized gain on gold contracts (year ended December 31, 2022 - realized loss of $33.0 million).2024 GUIDANCE AND OUTLOOKFor 2024, the Company expects to produce 660,000 to 750,000 ounces of gold. The midpoint of 2024 guidance of 705,000 ounces represents an increase of more than 140,000 ounces compared to 2023 gold production. Cash costs for 2024 are estimated at $1,340 to $1,445 per oz, with AISC of $1,630 to $1,740 per oz.

(5)2024 Guidance at Greenstone reflects the Company’s 60% ownership of the project. Greenstone gold production guidance for 2024 includes all ounces expected to be produced during the pre-commercial production and commercial production periods. 2024 cash cost per ounce and AISC per ounce guidance figures are the expected costs of gold production after commercial production is achieved.(6)Total is the sum or average of the individual mine-level amounts. Numbers may not sum due to rounding.The Company may revise guidance during the year to reflect changes to expected results.Cash costs for 2024 reflect the life cycle stages of the assets in the Company's portfolio and also that, while consumables inflation has abated, labour and equipment costs are expected to face continued upward pressure throughout 2024. In addition, compared to many other countries the BRL and MXN were top performing currencies compared to the USD in 2022 and 2023 and management expects relative stability in the BRL and MXN compared to the USD throughout 2024.Sustaining expenditures in 2024 of $212 million includes investing: (i) $60 million in capitalized stripping programs, with the largest investments at Aurizona and Los Filos, (ii) $58 million in equipment costs, of which $17 million relates to the Los Filos open pit and underground fleets and processing equipment and $22 million relates to the RDM mobile fleet costs, and (iii) $40 million for tailings storage facility (""TSF"") lifts and maintenance at all four Brazilian operations and Greenstone.Sustaining expenditures for 2024 include $13 million for exploration with a focus on reserve replacement across the portfolio. Non-sustaining expenditures include $13 million for step-out and regional exploration, primarily at Aurizona and in the Bahia district. Production and cash flow are expected to grow each quarter through 2024 due to normal seasonality and Greenstone ramp up throughout the year. The Company's primary development focus for 2024 continues to be advancing Greenstone to commercial production, with Equinox Gold's 60% share of capital in 2024 forecast to be $95 million. In addition, the Company is advancing engineering and permitting for the Castle Mountain Phase 2 expansion, expects to start underground portal development for the Aurizona underground expansion in the second half of the year and is advancing dialogue with local communities at Los Filos to agree on a long-term development plan for the mine.Cost and production guidance for Los Filos is subject to the successful execution of new social and land access agreements with local community stakeholders and landowners and collective agreements with unions. These new agreements are necessary to help ensure the long-term economic and investment viability of the mine, including the addition of a new 10,000 tpd carbon-in-leach (""CIL"") processing plant to increase recoveries from higher-grade ore. If the Company is unable to satisfactorily complete these agreements, the Company will re-evaluate the current operation and may elect to suspend operations indefinitely or until such time as new agreements are in place. Accordingly, Los Filos production and cost guidance for 2024 is subject to change.SELECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022$ amounts in millions, except per share amountsThree months endedYear ended December 31,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Revenue$297.8$259.3$1,088.2$952.2 Cost of sales Operating expense(198.2)(168.2)(764.2)(680.1) Depreciation and depletion(61.0)(59.0)(215.0)(187.2)Income from mine operations38.632.0109.085.0Care and maintenance expense-(1.4)(1.4)(9.5)Exploration and evaluation expense(3.3)(4.5)(11.7)(18.4)General and administration expense(10.0)(12.8)(46.2)(46.7)Income (loss) from operations25.313.349.610.4Finance expense(17.9)(12.4)(60.2)(40.4)Finance income2.42.611.75.6Share of net income (loss) in associate(0.4)(3.6)(17.5)(6.2)Other income (expense)(1.0)(4.9)31.1(67.9)Net income (loss) before taxes8.3(5.0)14.8(98.4)Income tax recovery (expense)(4.5)27.614.1(7.6)Net income (loss)$3.9$22.6$28.9$(106.0)Net income (loss) per share attributable to Equinox Gold shareholders Basic$0.01$0.07$0.09$(0.35) Diluted$0.01$0.07$0.09$(0.35) Additional information regarding the Company's financial results and the Company's business strategy are available in the Company's 2023 audited consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying news release for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, which will be available for download on the Company's website at www.equinoxgold.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCASTEquinox Gold will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 22, 2024 commencing at 7:30 am Vancouver time to discuss the Company's fourth quarter results and activities underway at the Company.

Their measurement and presentation is consistently prepared and is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Numbers presented in the tables below may not sum due to rounding.Cash Costs and Cash Costs per oz SoldCash costs is a common financial performance measure in the gold mining industry; however, it has no standard meaning under IFRS. The Company reports total cash costs on a per oz sold basis. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate operating income and cash flow from mining operations. Cash costs are calculated as mine site operating costs and are net of silver revenue. Cash costs are divided by ounces sold to arrive at cash costs per oz sold. In calculating cash costs, the Company deducts silver revenue as it considers the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The measure is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under IFRS or operating costs presented under IFRS.AISC per oz SoldThe Company uses AISC per oz of gold sold to measure performance. The methodology for calculating AISC was developed internally and is calculated below. Current IFRS measures used in the gold industry, such as operating expenses, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain gold production. The Company believes the AISC measure provides further transparency into costs associated with producing gold and will assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company in assessing its operating performance, its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value. AISC includes cash costs (described above) and also includes sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining lease payments, reclamation cost accretion and amortization and exploration and evaluation costs. This measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, therefore, expansionary capital and non-sustaining expenditures are excluded. Prior to Q2 2023, the Company's calculation of cash costs included the principal portion of sustaining lease payments. Commencing in Q2 2023, to improve the comparability of the Company's financial performance measures with its peers and align to the standards outlined by the World Gold Council, the Company has excluded sustaining lease payments from its calculation of cash costs and has included them as a component of AISC.

Sustaining capital expenditures can include, but are not limited to, capitalized stripping costs at open pit mines, underground mine development, mining and milling equipment and TSF raises.The following table provides a reconciliation of sustaining capital expenditures to the Company's total capital expenditures for continuing operations: Three months endedYear ended $'s in millionsDecember 31,2023September 30,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Capital additions to mineral properties, plant and equipment(1)$157.0$153.5$163.2$596.4$642.2Less: Non-sustaining capital at operating sites(8.1)(8.4)(10.8)(25.3)(81.2)Less: Non-sustaining capital at development projects(94.6)(101.4)(103.4)(390.4)(389.4)Less: Capital expenditures - corporate0.1(0.2)-(0.3)(10.2)Less: Other non-cash additions(2)(11.7)(11.5)(5.9)(60.4)(22.2)Sustaining capital expenditures$42.7$32.0$43.1$119.9$139.2 (1) Per note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Capital additions exclude non-cash changes to reclamation assets arising from changes in discount rate and inflation rate assumptions in the reclamation provision.(2) Non-cash additions include right-of-use assets associated with leases recognized in the period, capitalized depreciation for deferred stripping activities, and capitalized non-cash share-based compensation.Total Mine-site Free Cash FlowMine-site free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial performance measure. The Company believes this measure is a useful indicator of its ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or usage of existing cash. In calculating total mine-site free cash flow, the Company excludes the impact of fair value adjustments on acquired inventories as these adjustments do not impact cash flow from operating mine sites. Mine-site free cash flow is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures of performance presented by other mining companies. Mine-site free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.Prior to Q1 2023, mine-site free cash flow was calculated inclusive of fair value adjustments on acquired inventories. The calculation of mine-site free cash flow for comparative periods has been adjusted to conform with the current methodology and is different from the measure previously reported.In Q4 2023, the Company revised the calculation to include changes in non-cash working capital and present mine-site free cash flow after changes in non-cash working capital. The Company believes it is useful to provide mine-site free cash flow before and after changes in non-cash working capital as working capital can fluctuate significantly between periods due to numerous factors. The following table provides a reconciliation of mine-site free cash flow to the most directly comparable IFRS measure on an aggregate basis:Three months endedYear ended $'s in millionsDecember 31,2023September 30,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Operating cash flow before non-cash changes in working capital$168.2$82.6$80.0$527.5$144.3Less: Fair value adjustments on acquired inventories(1.6)(1.6)(12.2)6.9(16.1)Less: Operating cash flow (generated) used by non-mine site activity(1)(71.1)(5.2)7.1(223.2)97.2Cash flow from operating mine sites$95.6$75.9$74.9$311.2$225.4 Mineral property, plant and equipment additions$157.0153.5163.2$596.4642.2Less: Capital expenditures relating to development projects and corporate and other non-cash additions(106.2)(113.1)(109.3)(451.2)(421.8)Capital expenditure from operating mine sites50.840.453.9145.2220.4Lease payments related to non-sustaining capital items7.04.43.920.516.8Non-sustaining exploration expense3.12.65.411.517.8 Total mine-site free cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital$34.7$28.4$11.8$134.0$(29.6)(Increase) decrease in non-cash working capital$(42.3)$(13.4)$(34.4)$(169.0)$(87.8)Total mine site free cash flow after changes in non-cash working capital$(7.6)$15.1$(22.6)$(35.0)$(117.4) (1) Includes taxes paid and proceeds from gold prepayments that are not factored into mine-site free cash flow and are included in operating cash flow before non-cash changes in working capital in the statement of cash flows.AISC Contribution Margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors, and other stakeholders use AISC contribution margin, AISC contribution margin per gold ounce sold and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flows and service debt. AISC contribution margin is defined as revenue less AISC. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted to exclude specific items that are significant but not reflective of the underlying operating performance of the Company, such as the impact of fair value changes of warrants, foreign exchange contracts and gold contracts; unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, transaction costs, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. It is also adjusted to exclude items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated in advance or that are not considered representative of core operating performance, such as impairments and gains and losses on disposals of assets.The following tables provide the calculation of AISC contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company:AISC Contribution MarginThree months endedYear ended $'s in millionsDecember 31,2023September 30,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Revenue$297.8$284.7$259.3$1,088.2$952.2Less: silver revenue(0.6)(0.6)(0.2)(2.1)(3.0)Less: AISC(248.3)(241.7)(227.6)(901.9)(825.7)Less: Santa Luz revenue(1)$-$-$-$-$(40.0)AISC contribution margin$48.9$42.5$31.5$184.2$83.5 Gold ounces sold149,861148,231149,386559,481532,137Less: Santa Luz gold ounces sold(1)----(22,945)Adjusted gold ounces sold149,861148,231149,386559,481509,192 AISC contribution margin per oz sold$326$286$211$329$164 (1) AISC contribution margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 excludes Santa Luz results while the mine was in pre-commercial production up until the achievement of commercial production at the end of Q3 2022.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAThree months endedYear ended $'s in millionsDecember 31,2023September 30,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Net income (loss)$3.92.222.6$28.9(106.0)Income tax (recovery) expense4.5(8.1)(27.6)(14.1)7.6Depreciation and depletion61.358.959.8216.1188.8Finance expense17.915.312.460.240.4Finance income(2.4)(3.0)(2.6)(11.7)(5.6)EBITDA$85.2$65.2$64.6$279.4$125.2 Non-cash share-based compensation expense2.62.51.18.53.7Unrealized (gain) loss on warrants-(1.6)(2.9)1.869.9Unrealized (gain) loss on gold contracts12.7(6.2)-4.0-Gain on gold contracts acquired in a business combination----(33.3)Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange contracts(4.3)17.8(7.7)(13.4)(16.8)Unrealized (gain) loss on power purchase agreement(3.3)0.6-4.4-Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss1.5(2.2)3.15.34.7Share of net (income) loss of investment in associate0.4-3.617.56.2Other (income) expense0.55.112.5(3.1)8.4 Adjusted EBITDA$95.3$81.2$74.3$304.4$168.0 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPSAdjusted net income and adjusted EPS are used by management and investors to measure the underlying operating performance of the Company. Adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to exclude specific items that are significant but not reflective of the underlying operating performance of the Company, such as the impact of fair value changes in the value of warrants, foreign exchange contracts and gold contracts, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, and non-cash share-based compensation expense. It is also adjusted to exclude items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated in advance or that are not considered representative of core operating performance, such as impairments and gains and losses on disposals of assets. Adjusted net income per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding on a basic and diluted basis as determined by IFRS.The following table provides the calculation of adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, as adjusted and calculated by the Company:Three months endedYear ended $'s and shares in millionsDecember 31,2023September 30,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022 Net income (loss) attributable to Equinox Gold shareholders$3.9$2.2$22.6$28.9$(106.0)Add (deduct): Non-cash share-based compensation expense2.62.51.18.53.7Unrealized (gain) loss on warrants-(1.6)(2.9)1.869.9Unrealized (gain) loss on gold contracts12.7(6.2)-4.0-Gain on gold contracts acquired in a business combination----(33.3)Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange contracts(4.3)17.8(7.7)(13.4)(16.8)Unrealized (gain) loss on power purchase agreement(3.3)0.6-4.4-Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss 1.5(2.2)3.15.34.7Share of net (income) loss of investment in associate0.4-3.617.56.2Other (income) expense0.55.112.5(3.1)8.4Income tax impact related to above adjustments0.6(0.3)(3.0)(0.8)(2.5)Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss recognized in deferred tax expense(12.2)10.7(22.2)(31.3)(25.8)Adjusted net income (loss)$2.4$28.7$7.0$21.7$(91.5) Basic weighted average shares outstanding313.7313.0305.2312.8304.0Diluted weighted average shares outstanding317.3316.5351.4316.3304.0 Adjusted income (loss) per share - basic ($/share)$0.01$0.09$0.02$0.07$(0.30)Adjusted income (loss) per share - diluted ($/share)$0.01$0.09$0.02$0.07$(0.30) Net DebtThe Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use net debt to evaluate the Company's performance.

Everest Medicines' Partner Pfizer Announces European Commission Approves VELSIPITY® for Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis,2024-02-22T00:48:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Pfizer Inc. and Everest Medicines' partner, Pfizer Inc., received marketing authorization from the European Commission for VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) in the EU to treat ulcerative colitis patients 16 years and older. The approval is based on positive Phase 3 data and offers a convenient once-daily oral treatment option for patients.","Everest Medicines' Partner Pfizer Announces European Commission Approves VELSIPITY® for Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Pfizer Inc. and Everest Medicines' partner, Pfizer Inc., received marketing authorization from the European Commission for VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) in the EU to treat ulcerative colitis patients 16 years and older. The approval is based on positive Phase 3 data and offers a convenient once-daily oral treatment option for patients. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Expert The European Commission's approval of VELSIPITY for ulcerative colitis represents a significant regulatory milestone for Everest Medicines and its partner Pfizer. The authorization expands the treatment landscape for UC patients in the EU, offering a novel oral therapy option. The regulatory decision is based on the comprehensive ELEVATE UC Phase 3 program, which demonstrated the drug's efficacy and safety in a patient population that included those with isolated proctitis—a subset not always covered in clinical trials for UC. This inclusion could indicate a broader therapeutic scope for VELSIPITY and potentially influence future clinical trial designs to be more inclusive of this patient group. Medical Research Analyst VELSIPITY's mechanism of action as an S1P receptor modulator distinguishes it from conventional UC therapies and positions it as a potential first-line treatment for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to other medications. The drug's ability to provide corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing addresses critical unmet needs in UC management. The reported improvement in health-related quality of life, as measured by the total inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score, underscores the potential impact of VELSIPITY on patient well-being beyond mere symptom control. However, the reported adverse reactions, including lymphopenia in 11% of patients, warrant continued post-marketing surveillance to ensure long-term safety. Healthcare Market Analyst The approval of VELSIPITY in the EU, following its FDA and Health Canada authorizations, signifies a growing global footprint for the therapy. This expansion into the EU market could have positive financial implications for Everest Medicines and Pfizer, particularly as the incidence of UC is reportedly on the rise in Asia, indicating a large potential market. Everest Medicines' plans to submit a New Drug Application in Greater China within the year could further extend the drug's market presence. The company's strategy to expedite the Phase 3 study in Asia and leverage positive 12-week data could accelerate market penetration and uptake in this region, provided regulatory approval is obtained. Stakeholders should monitor Everest's progress in Asia, as it could significantly influence the company's valuation and market share in the UC treatment space. 02/21/2024 - 07:48 PM --VELSIPITY is the first and only oral advanced ulcerative colitis therapy approved for use in patients 16 years of age or older in the EU-- SHANGHAI, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Everest Medicines (HKEX 1952.HK, ""Everest"", or the ""Company"")'s partner Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) in the European Union to treat patients 16 years of age and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy, or a biological agent. ""We congratulate our partner Pfizer for achieving another significant milestone for patients in the European Union who struggle to achieve remission on conventional therapy. Etrasimod is a convenient once-daily oral treatment with a favorable benefit-risk profile, and the approval to treat patients as young as 16 years old further validates this,"" said Rogers Yongqing Luo, Chief Executive Officer of Everest Medicines. ""Everest will advance our Phase 3 study in Asia as quickly as possible and plans to submit a New Drug Application in Greater China this year, as the incidence of UC has been rapidly increasing in this region."" ""The approval of etrasimod in European Union is another important milestone. This new-generation S1P receptor modulator is an oral, once-daily treatment that can provide patients with a chance for corticosteroid-free remission, mucosal healing, and rapid symptom relief,"" said Prof. Wu Kaichun with the First Affiliated Hospital of AFMU who is the principal investigator for etrasimod's clinical trial in China. ""Patient recruitment for the Phase 3 clinical trial in Asia was completed and positive 12-week data have been reported. We hope China and other Asian countries can obtain approval as soon as possible to benefit more patients."" The marketing authorization for VELSIPITY is valid in all 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. It follows VELSIPITY's approval for adults with moderately to severely active UC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023, and for adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or an advanced treatment in Canada in January 2024. The approval was based on results from the ELEVATE UC Phase 3 registrational program (ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of VELSIPITY 2 mg once-daily on clinical remission in UC patients who had previously failed or were intolerant to at least one conventional, biologic, or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy. Additionally, ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 were the only studies of advanced therapies for UC to include patients with isolated proctitis, which affects approximately 30% of those diagnosed with UC. Both studies achieved all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, with a favorable benefit-risk profile consistent with previous studies of VELSIPITY. VELSIPITY also demonstrated improvement in the total inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score, which measures health-related quality of life. The most common adverse reactions were lymphopenia (11%) and headache (7%). About VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) VELSIPITY is a once-daily, oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that selectively binds with S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4, and 5. Regulatory applications for VELSIPITY in ulcerative colitis have been submitted to additional countries including Australia, India, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK.

The presence of pre-filled syringes with sterile water is vital for the proper functioning of the feeding tube and any compromise in sterility could lead to severe patient infections.From a research perspective, the recall could indicate a need for improved quality control measures and possibly a reevaluation of supplier relationships and risk management strategies. In the short-term, Avanos Medical may face operational disruptions and financial implications due to the recall process, product replacements and potential legal liabilities. In the long-term, the company may need to invest in more robust quality assurance protocols to prevent similar incidents, which could affect profit margins but potentially enhance the brand's reputation for safety and reliability. Financial Analyst The voluntary recall by Avanos Medical, Inc. can have a tangible impact on the company's financial health. Investors and stakeholders should be aware of the immediate costs associated with the recall, including the logistics of withdrawing the affected lots from the market and the expenses related to providing replacements or refunds. Additionally, the market's reaction to such recalls can often be swift, with potential declines in stock prices as investor confidence may waver due to concerns over quality control and the potential for future recalls.Moreover, the recall might lead to a temporary loss of market share as healthcare providers and patients seek alternatives, potentially benefiting competitors. It's also crucial to consider the impact on the company's revenue forecasts and whether this event will prompt revisions in their financial guidance. Long-term implications could include increased regulatory scrutiny and higher operational costs if the company decides to bolster its quality assurance measures. It's important to monitor Avanos Medical's forthcoming financial statements and any strategic announcements that address the recall's impact. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the recall of medical products, especially those that are critical to patient care, can expose a company to significant risk. Avanos Medical's proactive approach to the recall could mitigate some of the potential legal repercussions by demonstrating a commitment to patient safety. However, there is still the possibility of facing lawsuits from affected parties, especially if any harm can be traced back to the use of the recalled products.Compliance with FDA regulations and the execution of the recall process are critical to minimizing legal fallout. The company must ensure that the recall is conducted efficiently and in accordance with all regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could result in fines, further legal action and damage to the company's reputation. It is also essential for the company to communicate effectively with stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers and investors, to maintain trust and transparency throughout the recall process. 02/21/2024 - 07:18 PM ALPHARETTA, Ga., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In direct response to the Nurse Assist, LLC voluntary recall of pre-filled syringes and other sterile water products, Avanos Medical, Inc.

The company aims to achieve key milestones in advancing the Clearwater Project, positioning itself as a leader in Canadian lithium development. E3 Lithium plans to discuss its 2024 guidance in a webinar on February 22. Positive E3 Lithium is poised for growth in 2024 with a focus on advancing the Clearwater Project. The company made substantial progress in 2023 towards commercial lithium production in Alberta. E3 Lithium's financial position remains strong, enabling it to accelerate commercial lithium production. The company aims to establish the Clearwater Project as a leading lithium development in Canada and North America. E3 Lithium is actively exploring additional resource areas beyond the Clearwater Project. The company has been building relationships with potential customers in automotive and manufacturing sectors. E3 Lithium has raised significant capital in 2023 and has a strong balance sheet to support its 2024 plans. The long-term outlook for EV uptake and lithium demand bodes well for E3 Lithium's future. E3 Lithium's commercial production is expected to coincide with rising lithium demand, creating favorable pricing environments. The company benefits from Alberta's efficient permitting regime, supporting its regulatory work in 2024. Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 07:16 PM Highlights: E3 Lithium is looking forward to another significant year of growth in 2024 as it advances its Clearwater Project towards commercial operations and revenue generation With the commercial viability of Direct Lithium Extraction Technology and E3 Lithium’s brines-to-battery flow sheet demonstrated in 2023, achieving the milestones set for 2024 marks a fundamental shift in E3 Lithium’s business and sets it on a clear and demonstrated pathway to commercial operations E3 Lithium looks forward to discussing its 2024 guidance during its February 22 webinar at 10 a.m. MST / 12 p.m. EST – details to join are provided below CALGARY, Alberta--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- E3 LITHIUM LTD. (TSXV: ETL) (FSE: OW3) (OTCQX: EEMMF), “E3 Lithium” or the “Company,” a leader in Canadian lithium, is pleased to share its plans for the upcoming year. The Company made significant progress in 2023 on the path for producing commercial lithium in Alberta. Looking ahead into 2024, E3 Lithium’s primary focus remains on advancing the Clearwater Project to commercial operations. The milestones it will achieve in 2024 will establish its project as one of the few advanced stage lithium developments in Canada and North America. In addition to the Clearwater Project, the magnitude of E3 Lithium’s resources enables the Company to unlock the potential of the significant land package throughout 2024 across its permit areas. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240221541557/en/E3 Lithium's Alberta Assets (Graphic: Business Wire) Going into 2024, E3 Lithium maintains a strong financial position. In the current market conditions, E3 Lithium has positioned itself to continue accelerating a path forward to producing first commercial lithium from its significant resources in South-Central Alberta. “E3 Lithium had a very successful 2023 by progressing all core aspects of our business, putting us in position to deliver ambitious targets in 2024 moving us closer to first commercial lithium,” said Chris Doornbos, President and CEO of E3 Lithium. “The achievement of this year’s goals will mark a fundamental shift in our business, one that sees us move from a technology and resource developer to a commercialization company on a clear and demonstrated pathway to operations.” E3 Lithium is focusing on the following goals in 2024. Progressing the Clearwater Project Towards Commercial Operations E3 Lithium’s Clearwater Project is the Company’s primary focus for its first commercial lithium facility, located in South-Central Alberta. The milestones the Company will achieve in advancing its development this year, including progressing engineering studies and commercial permitting, will establish the Clearwater Project as one of the few advanced stage lithium projects in Canada and North America. The PFS for the Clearwater Project represents a monumental milestone for Canadian lithium brines as it results in the booking of reserves. To move towards commercial operations in the Clearwater Project, the Company looks forward to completing the PFS and releasing the NI 43-101 report, aiming for late Q2 2024. E3 Lithium is working diligently to deliver the PFS report in Q2; the critical path to be able to do so is receiving engineering packages from external vendors. If delivery is delayed, the public report may be delayed as well. The Company will update the market on its progress and delivery times as they become firm. The PFS is designed to a level of detail that will enable the Company to move directly into Feasibility Study (FS) and includes the full design of the first commercial facility, along with an updated cost estimate and development schedule. With the publication of the PFS NI 43-101 report, E3 Lithium will book Canada’s first lithium-in-brine reserves in the Clearwater Project area, a significant milestone for the Canadian lithium brine industry. E3 Lithium has initiated the permitting process for the commercial facility and will look to advance this throughout 2024. The milestones E3 Lithium looks forward to completing include publishing the PFS NI 43-101 report, selecting the EPC for and kicking off the FS, completing environmental and wildlife surveys and public consultation for its commercial facility, and preparing regulatory applications for approval. While the PFS will outline details of the first commercial facility, the Clearwater area is likely to be able to support further production expansion. Based on the sheer size and consistency of E3 Lithium’s resources in Alberta, demonstrating a successful development in the Clearwater area supports the value of the remaining land in the Exshaw (northern Bashaw) and Rocky areas. E3 Lithium believes it has enough brines to produce approximately 150,000 tonnes of battery grade lithium per year once fully operational across multiple commercial facilities, which is enough lithium for approximately 2.2M EVs1 annually. Developing E3 Lithium’s Other Significant Resource Areas In addition to its Clearwater area in Alberta, E3 Lithium’s significant land package includes the Exshaw and Rocky areas and its Saskatchewan property. While E3 Lithium’s focus remains firmly on the Clearwater Project, the team is evaluating and progressing additional projects across its resource base. Exshaw Area In the Northern part of the Bashaw District lies the Exshaw area. The brine composition in the Exshaw area is very similar to the Clearwater Project, and the development of this area is expected to be similar to the Clearwater area. This area is larger by total brine volume than the Clearwater. E3 plans to begin the evaluation of how to develop the Exshaw area once theClearwater PFS is complete. Rocky Area In the Western trend of the Leduc Aquifer lies the Rocky area. This portion of the aquifer is largely disconnected from the Bashaw District and hosts a significant volume of lithium enriched brine. The Company plans to update the resource to include the full aquifer trend in 2024. Once complete, the Company will evaluate how this area fits into its larger development plans. Nisku Aquifer across E3 Lithium’s Alberta Resource Areas Recent sampling results indicate that the Nisku Aquifer, located above the Leduc Aquifer, has similar concentrations of lithium to the Leduc. This aquifer is coincident with the Leduc in the Bashaw Area, making it a candidate for co-production. As the Company’s production wells will go through the Nisku to reach the Leduc, it offers the potential to add more production to the plant in a commercial setting by co-producing both the Leduc and the Nisku. If successful, the benefit would be an increase to the lifespan of each well and therefore, a reduction in the well capital required over the life of the plant. Saskatchewan E3 Lithium holds a strategic land position in the heart of the Estevan lithium belt in Saskatchewan. Resource holders that surround E3 Lithium have recently completed resource updates and economic studies that look to advance Saskatchewan into a commercially producing region for lithium. E3 Lithium plans to complete an inaugural resource in Saskatchewan in 2024. As this area does not form the core of E3 Lithium’s focus, the Company is evaluating the best options for creating value from the land for its shareholders. Advancing Commercial Development and Offtake E3 Lithium has been developing strong relationships with potential customers that include companies in the automotive, cell and cathode manufacturing sectors. The completion of the PFS is a major milestone for these discussions to mature towards sale contracts. E3 Lithium has been working to grow its commercial team to support this effort and will continue to prioritize identifying mutually beneficial arrangements with offtakers. E3 Lithium’s Strengths Going into 2024 Balance sheet strength supports ability to execute 2024 plans: E3 Lithium raised more than $30M CAD via capital raises and grant funding in 2023 and has more than $20M remaining to draw down on from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The Company is in a strong financial position to execute on its goals in 2024. E3 Lithium continues to actively seek, identify and pursue all sources of non-dilutive funding to meet the Company’s ongoing needs for capital. Long-term outlook for EV uptake and lithium demand: The long-term outlook for EV uptake and demand remains strong, with North American policy objectives in full alignment with a comprehensive shift to EVs into the 2030s. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, entering 2024, North America is expected to grow lithium production to approximately 40,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium, while demand is expected to be more than 150,000 tpa. By 2030 global demand could exceed 3M tpa, growing at over 15% per year. Commercial production to coincide with rising demand: E3 Lithium’s initial commercial production is likely to be timed in to coincide with the increase in demand for and shortfall of supply of lithium, which may create favourable pricing environments for E3 Lithium’s offtake. Lithium offtake sold in long-term contracts: Most lithium today is sold in long-term offtake arrangements that contain negotiated sales prices. The best gauge for these prices is long term price forecasts provided by reputable research firms, which are outlining prices much higher than current spot prices. The price forecasts provided by reputable research firms will be relied upon for the PFS. Efficient and well-known permitting regime: Alberta is home to one of the world’s most efficient and well known regulatory and permitting processes for energy project development, led by the Government of Alberta and the Alberta Energy Regulator. Recently E3 Lithium’s permits to its significant land position in Alberta were converted to the province’s new Brine-Hosted Mineral Licences, reaffirming E3 Lithium’s ownership of ‘surface to basement’ mineral rights to saline aquifers throughout its operating areas and underscoring the province’s commitment to providing regulatory certainty and growing the lithium industry. The requirements for E3 Lithium’s commercial permits are well understood and the Company looks forward to progressing its regulatory work in 2024.

By partnering with the SANS Institute, BlackBerry is leveraging the expertise of a well-respected educational entity to enhance the skills of cyber professionals.This initiative is particularly timely as the demand for cybersecurity talent is surging globally, driven by an increase in cyber threats and the adoption of advanced technologies such as Machine Learning and AI. The focus on forensics and incident response training is crucial, given that these areas are pivotal in mitigating the impact of cyber incidents.From a business perspective, this move could strengthen BlackBerry's position in the cybersecurity market by showcasing their commitment to education and capacity building. It could also serve as a differentiator, potentially driving demand for BlackBerry's suite of cybersecurity solutions.

The company's CEO highlighted improved performance across all operations, with a focus on production growth and cost efficiency. OceanaGold's 2024 outlook includes a 13% increase in gold production and a lower unit cost of gold produced, positioning the company for continued growth and value creation. Positive OceanaGold met its 2023 production guidance, producing 477,313 ounces of gold and 14,172 tonnes of copper, with AISC of $1,587 per ounce. The company achieved record full-year revenue of $1.0 billion, driven by strong sales at record average realized gold prices. OceanaGold's 2024 outlook includes a 13% increase in gold production, with production guidance of 510,000 to 570,000 ounces and 12,000 to 14,000 tonnes of copper. The company plans to monetize 20% of Didipio in mid-2024 to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet. OceanaGold declared a $0.01 per share semi-annual dividend in February 2024, payable in April 2024. Negative The net loss in Q4 2023 was $18.9 million, primarily due to a non-cash write-down of historic tax receivables in the Philippines. AISC for Haile was high in Q4 2023 due to production stripping expenditures and lower than estimated ore grades. The Company's net loss was driven by the write-down of indirect tax receivables, impacting the financial performance negatively. 02/21/2024 - 07:10 PM (All financial figures in United States dollars unless otherwise stated) VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - OceanaGold Corporation (TSX: OGC) (OTCQX: OCANF) (""OceanaGold"" or the ""Company"") reported its operational and financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023. The consolidated financial statements and the Management Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") are available at www.oceanagold.com. Gerard Bond, President and CEO of OceanaGold, said ""Strong fourth quarter gold production, driven by increased quarter-on-quarter performance at all four of our operations, allowed us to deliver our full year production guidance. At Haile, the Horseshoe Underground mine increased its production of higher-grade ore feed and, with the underground mine ramping up to full capacity and with access to ore in Ledbetter open pit improving through the first half of 2024, we expect improved performance quarter on quarter from Haile over the coming year. Didipio had an exceptional fourth quarter, beating increased guidance for the year due to earlier access into higher grade areas of the mine. Both New Zealand sites rebounded with improved fourth quarter performance, with Macraes also achieving the higher end of its increased production guidance for the year. 2024 is a transformational year for OceanaGold as we begin to deliver production growth, both for 2024 and beyond. Our 3-year outlook remains robust with organic, near-mine production growth of at least 30%1 through 2026 at a declining AISC per ounce, which in turn underpins OceanaGold's projected improvement in Free Cash Flow generation. This exciting profile positions the Company to continue strengthening the balance sheet, which we expect to be further enhanced this year with the completion of the monetization of 20% of Didipio. We will also continue to explore and invest in growth options such as Palomino and Wharekirauponga, especially with the improved investment climate in New Zealand. All of this will be in service of increasing the value of OceanaGold and improving returns to shareholders."" _______________________ 1 Based on the mid-point of production guidance.

Refer to ""Non-IFRS Financial Information"" section of the MD&A. 4 As at December 31, 2023, there was a non-cash write-down of indirect tax receivables in the Philippines totalling $38.3 million. The loss was primarily driven by the non-cash write-down relating to historic tax receivables in the Philippines (relating to Excise Taxes and VAT). The Company had been seeking recovery of indirect taxes assessed between 2013 and 2019 which it believed were not due and payable at the time, pursuant to the FTAA. These recovery actions were in various stages of court proceedings. Given the lack of definitive progress, ongoing administrative costs incurred in respect of these recovery actions, and with the additional government share payments now current, the Company has elected to write down these tax receivables and has commenced the process of discontinuing legal proceedings in these matters. All these historic taxes paid have been included as part of the government share as at December 31, 2023. As these taxes have already been paid and considered as part of the Government share, this write down of the receivable will not result in a cash payment. Were these taxes recovered, it would have resulted in a cash refund to the Company and an associated credit to the Additional Government Share, also with no net cash flow impact to the Company. There were two write-offs in 2022 totalling $4.4 million related to exploration projects in New Zealand and the Sam's Creek investment. 5 Represents costs related to the relocation of the corporate office from Australia to Canada.

In the prior year, Free Cash Flow was calculated as Cash flows from Operating Activities, less Cash flows used in Investing Activities less finance lease principal payments which are reported as part of cash flow used in financing activities in 2022. Operations The Company produced 129,830 ounces of gold and 3,848 tonnes of copper in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter gold production was 31% higher than the previous quarter and 7% higher than the corresponding quarter in 2022. The quarter-on-quarter increase was driven by higher production at all operations during the quarter and includes first production from the Horseshoe Underground at Haile. The Company produced 477,313 ounces of gold and 14,172 tonnes of copper in 2023, which was broadly in line with production in 2022. The Company recorded a fourth quarter AISC1 of $1,658 per ounce on gold sales of 118,821 ounces. This was a 13% reduction in AISC1 compared to the previous quarter and a 3% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2022. The quarter-on-quarter reduction was driven by 21% higher comparative gold sales in the fourth quarter. For 2023, the Company recorded an AISC1 of $1,587 on sales of 467,895 ounces of gold. Haile produced 37,566 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter. The 62% increase compared to the previous quarter was primarily due to the addition of first production from the Horseshoe Underground. Haile's fourth quarter AISC1 was $2,570 per ounce, a reduction compared to the previous quarter largely driven by the higher quarter-on-quarter gold sales. Annual 2023 production at Haile was 152,481 ounces of gold at an AISC1 of $1,921 per ounce sold. The high AISC1 of Haile in the fourth quarter reflects both the high level of production stripping expenditures in the open pit and the fact that Horseshoe underground is still in ramp up, whilst the full year AISC1 outcome of Haile also reflects lower than estimated ore grades encountered in the now-completed Mill Zone pit, as previously reported. During the third quarter, first development ore was mined and stockpiled from the Horseshoe Underground mine at Haile. First production ore was mined in mid-October and three stopes were mined as planned during the fourth quarter of 2023. Didipio produced 42,807 ounces of gold and 3,848 tonnes of copper in the fourth quarter. The 40% increase in gold production compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to higher grade breccia stopes being mined, which was facilitated by completion of the crown pillar strengthening project. Copper production increased by 13% quarter-on-quarter. Didipio's fourth quarter AISC1 was $737 per ounce on gold sales of 39,734 ounces and 3,923 tonnes of copper, a 15% reduction from the previous quarter due to higher sales. Annual 2023 production at Didipio was 138,527 ounces of gold and 14,172 tonnes of copper at an AISC1 of $730 per ounce. Macraes produced 36,117 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter. The 4% increase compared to the previous quarter resulted from record mill throughput achieved during the fourth quarter of 2023. Macraes fourth quarter AISC1 was $1,468 per ounce, a 5% decrease compared to the previous quarter mainly due to the higher quarter-on-quarter gold sales. Annual 2023 production at Macraes was 137,018 ounces of gold at an AISC1 of $1,570 per ounce. Waihi produced 13,340 ounces of gold for the fourth quarter. The 23% increase compared to the previous quarter was driven by a 24% increase in feed grade, as mining of the remnant areas shifted into higher grade zones. Waihi's fourth quarter AISC1 was $1,829 per ounce, a 17% reduction compared to the previous quarter mainly driven by the higher quarter-on-quarter gold sales. Annual 2023 production at Waihi was 49,286 ounces of gold at an AISC1 of $1,914 per ounce. Financial The Company recorded fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $267.3 million, a 25% increase compared to the previous quarter largely driven by 21% higher quarter-on-quarter gold sales volumes across the operations due to strong production, particularly from Didipio and Haile. Fourth quarter revenue was 12% above the corresponding period in 2022, reflecting higher gold sold from Didipio combined with a 13% higher average realized gold price which partly offset the lower gold sales volumes from Haile underpinned by lower production. The Company achieved record annual consolidated revenue of $1.0 billion, a 6% increase relative to the previous year, mainly reflecting an 8% higher average realized gold price received. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA1 was $94.6 million, a 50% increase relative to the previous quarter mainly due to the 25% higher revenue. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA1 was 4% lower than the corresponding quarter in 2022 as higher revenues were offset by higher cost of sales and accrual of the Additional Government Share at Didipio, along with lower foreign exchange gains and net other expenses compared with other income in 2022. Annual consolidated Adjusted EBITDA1 was $410.1 million, a 11% increase compared to 2022, driven by higher revenue and lower cost of sales which was partially offset by higher G&A costs, indirect taxes, corporate restructuring costs and recognition of the Additional Government Share at Didipio. Fourth quarter net loss was $18.9 million or $0.03 per share fully diluted, compared with a net loss of $5.5 million and $0.01 per share fully diluted in the previous quarter. The net loss was primarily driven by the non-cash write-down of historic tax receivables in the Philippines, totaling $38.3 million ($22.1 million excise taxes and $16.2 million of value added taxes). The Company had been seeking recovery of indirect taxes assessed and paid relating to periods from 2013 and 2019 which it believed were not due and payable at the time, pursuant to the Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement (""FTAA""). These recovery actions were in various stages of court proceedings. Given the lack of definitive progress, ongoing administrative costs incurred in respect of these recovery actions, and with the Additional Government Share payments now applicable, the Company has written down these indirect tax receivables and has commenced the process of discontinuing legal proceedings in these matters. The Additional Government Share calculation as at December 31, 2023 reflects these taxes paid. As these taxes have already been paid and considered as part of the Government share, this write-down of the indirect tax receivables will not result in a cash payment. Were these taxes recovered, it would have resulted in a cash refund to the Company and an associated credit to the Additional Government Share also with no net cash flow impact to the Company. Fourth quarter Adjusted Net Profit1 was $9.6 million or $0.01 per share fully diluted compared with an Adjusted Net Loss1 of $1.7 million or $0.00 per share in the previous quarter. Annual Adjusted Net Profit1 was $115.4 million, a 20% decrease compared to the previous year mainly due to the first accrual of the Additional Government Share at Didipio of $20.3 million, expected to be paid in April 2024. Fourth quarter cash flows from operating activities were $94.8 million, which was 52% above the previous quarter reflecting both the higher revenue and Adjusted EBITDA1. Annual cash flows from operating activities totaled $384.2 million, which was 4% above the corresponding period in 2022 due to higher revenue, partly offset by higher indirect tax and G&A costs. Fourth quarter investing cash flow totaled $78.7 million, which was 15% below the previous quarter, due primarily to lower pre-strip and capitalized mining and growth capital at Haile partly offset by higher sustaining and growth capital at Didipio and pre-strip and capitalized mining spend at Macraes. Annual investing cash flow of $341.8 million was 22% above the previous year due to higher pre-stripping and capitalized mining costs and sustaining capital at Haile and Macraes. Annual Free Cash Flow 1 was $42.4 million, of which $16.1 million was generated in the fourth quarter. Following the completion of refinancing in December, as at December 31, 2023, the Company's available revolving credit facilities decreased to $200 million, with $135 million drawn and $65.0 million undrawn. The Company had immediately available Liquidity1 of $126.7 million including $61.7 million in cash as at December 31, 2023. The debt structure includes an accordion feature of $50 million (i.e. pre-approved but not committed capacity under the facility) and is excluded from Liquidity1. The Company's Net Debt1 position, inclusive of lease liabilities, decreased to $170.1 million from $171.6 million in the previous quarter. The Company's Leverage Ratio1 was 0.41x as at December 31, 2023. Outlook The Company's 2024 full year guidance is presented in the tables below.

Consolidated gold production in 2024 is expected to be higher than 2023 driven by increases at Haile and Waihi. The first quarter is expected to be the weakest of the year, with approximately 55% to 60% of consolidated gold production weighted to the second half of the year. The production profile is driven by sequencing of open pit mining at both Haile and Macraes, and the ramp-up of the Horseshoe Underground at Haile. Consolidated AISC1 profile follows the production trend and is expected to peak in the first quarter, and then come down significantly quarter over quarter in 2024. In 2024, Haile is expected to produce 195,000 to 225,000 ounces of gold at an AISC1 of between $1,530 and $1,630 per ounce. Gold production is expected to be 60% to 65% weighted to the second half of the year. Reflecting this profile, Haile's AISC1 is expected to be significantly above full-year guidance in the first quarter and progressively reduce throughout the year. Mill feed ore sequencing at Haile includes a higher proportion of low grade stockpiles in the first quarter while mining progresses into higher grade ore in the Ledbetter pit in the second quarter and Horseshoe Underground reaches full target mining rates by mid-year. At Haile, total capital investment is expected to range between $155 million and $175 million. Pre-stripping costs have been accelerated in 2024 to optimize the longer-term mine plan at Haile which is expected to benefit 2025 and 2026. Capitalized mining costs relate to continued development in the Horseshoe Underground mine. Sustaining capital includes a new lift and additional maintenance on the TSF, construction of West PAG Phase 2 and 3, which has been accelerated to reduce overall costs and improve mine flexibility, and on-going planned component replacement of the mobile fleet. Growth capital is expected to be between $20 million and $25 million in 2024 and relates to ongoing decline development at Horseshoe Underground and an upgrade to electricity infrastructure. Exploration expenditure at Haile is expected to range between $7 million and $9 million and will focus on resource definition and conversion of both the Horseshoe Underground and Ledbetter 4, in addition to several early-stage targets. In 2024, Didipio is expected to produce 120,000 to 135,000 ounces of gold and 12,000 to 14,000 tonnes of copper at an AISC1 between $750 and $850 per ounce. Gold and copper production is expected to be lower in the first and last quarters of the year due to planned mine grades. At Didipio, total capital investment is expected to range between $45 million and $55 million. Sustaining capital for the year includes underground development, ongoing TSF construction, and purchases of new underground equipment in support of the underground optimization efforts. Exploration expenditure at Didipio in 2024 will focus on extension and conversion drilling in the underground as well as planned regional exploration activities. In 2024, Macraes is expected to produce 120,000 to 135,000 ounces of gold at an AISC1 of between $1,775 and $1,875 per ounce. Gold production is expected to be approximately 55% weighted to the second half of the year as mill feed ore sequencing has a higher proportion of low grade stockpiles until open pit mining reaches ore at Innes Mills 7. Underground mining will continue at Golden Point Underground (""GPUG"") and will wind-down at Frasers Underground (""FRUG"") by mid-year 2024. As a result of the open pit production profile, AISC1 is expected to follow the production trend, starting out higher in the first half and progressively reducing throughout the year. Approximately $100 per ounce of AISC1 in 2024 is expected to relate to the planned drawdown from ore stockpiles at Macraes, which is a non-cash item. At Macraes, total capital investment is expected to range between $90 million and $110 million. Pre-strip and capitalized mining costs are associated with Innes Mills 7, primarily in the first half of the year, underground development and a major planned component replacement of the mobile fleet. In 2024, Waihi is expected to produce 55,000 to 75,000 ounces of gold, at an AISC1 of between $1,350 and $1,500 per ounce. The increase in production from 2023 is in-line with the mine plan and reflects the expected larger ratio of ore from higher grade fresh stopes. At Waihi, total capital investment is expected to range between $45 million and $55 million. Sustaining capital for the year primarily includes underground development and TSF expansion. The largest component of the investment at Waihi is exploration expenditure which is expected to be between $15 million and $20 million in 2024. Ongoing exploration will continue to focus on resource growth, resource definition and conversion drilling of the Martha Underground and Wharekirauponga, with exploration spend expected to be approximately evenly distributed between operation and project. Growth capital is expected to range between $5 million and $10 million and includes study costs related to the Waihi North Project. Three Year Outlook The company's three year outlook is presented in the tables below.

The Company expects to deliver production growth of at least 30% from 2023 through 2026 at a declining AISC1. On a consolidated basis, the Company expects to produce 510,000 to 570,000 ounces of gold in 2024, increasing to 540,000 to 600,000 ounces in 2025 and 620,000 to 680,000 ounces in 2026. Consolidated AISC1 is expected to be $1,475 to $1,600 in 2024, decreasing to $1,425 to $1,575 per ounce in 2025 and $1,250 to $1,400 per ounce in 2026. This three-year outlook reflects an increasing production trend at both Haile and Macraes over time, with a steady contribution from Didipio. Compared with the prior year outlook for this period, there has been a moderation of Waihi's production outlook to reflect the inherent risk with remnant mining. Mine plan optimization at Haile related to the Ledbetter pit, has shifted a portion of previously expected 2024 and 2025 gold production at Haile into 2026. The 3-year outlook also now excludes the Round Hill open pit at Macraes, which as been removed from Mineral Reserves. The 3-year outlook does not include the potential increase in production or the associated capital related to the underground optimization work at Didipio or the Palomino Underground at Haile. 1 Refer to ""Non-IFRS Financial Information"" in the MD&A Dividend The Company is pleased to announce a semi-annual dividend payment of $0.01 per common share.

This resulted in improvements to all major financial categories:Revenue was $972.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a 12% increase compared to $866.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS1 and adjusted EBITDA1 for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $243.1 million and $235.6 million, compared to $197.8 million and $188.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.Free cash flow1 and free cash flow per share1 for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $161.6 million, $0.74 per share basic and $0.73 per share diluted compared to $157.0 million, $0.65 per share basic and $0.64 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 2022. Profit and profit per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $121.0 million, $0.56 per share basic and $0.55 per share diluted compared to $79.2 million, $0.33 per share basic and $0.32 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 2022.During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company returned an aggregate of $112.8 million to shareholders, consisting of $34.3 million from quarterly dividends and $78.5 million from the Company's Normal Course Issuer Bid (""NCIB"") programs.The Company's board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.045 per share, representing an increase of 12.5% over the prior quarter dividend.The Company's balance sheet remains strong with positive working capital, including cash, of $153.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $169.4 million at December 31, 2022, providing significant financial flexibility. The Company had loans and borrowings of nil at December 31, 2023 compared to $29.8 million at December 31, 2022.Trican operates the newest, most technologically advanced fleet of fracturing equipment in Canada. We developed our fleet by upgrading existing equipment with CAT Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending (""DGB"") engine technology and building new fully electric ancillary equipment. The combination of Tier 4 DGB engines and fully electric ancillary equipment can displace up to 90% of the diesel used in a conventional fracturing operation with cleaner burning and less expensive natural gas resulting in lower overall fuel cost and reduced carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions. Our fracturing fleet upgrades also include industry leading continuous heavy duty pumps (3,000 HHP) and idle reduction technology packages which enable longer pumping times and improved operating efficiencies.Trican has completed its fifth Tier 4 DGB fleet (42,000 HHP) which brings Trican's total Tier 4 DGB fleet to 210,000 HHP.Tier 4 upgrades and electric ancillary equipment are key components of Trican's Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") strategy. Our ongoing ESG initiatives, including fleet upgrades, are intended to reduce our environmental impact, improve efficiency and reduce our emissions profile thereby improving the sustainability of our operations and supporting our customers in achieving their ESG goals. RETURN OF CAPITALThe Company continues to be active in its NCIB program as a key component of its return of capital strategy:During the year ended December 31, 2023, Trican purchased and cancelled 22,702,683 common shares at a weighted average price of $3.46 per share, equating to approximately 10% of the 229,776,553 outstanding shares at December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2023 the Company purchased an additional 1,839,800 common shares.On October 2, 2023, the Company announced the renewal of its NCIB program, commencing October 5, 2023, to purchase up to 21,004,897 common shares for cancellation before October 4, 2024, subject to the TSX NCIB rules. The 2022-2023 NCIB program was fully completed in Q3 2023 resulting in the purchase of 23,083,554 common shares. Since the initiation of our NCIB programs in 2017, Trican has purchased 146,586,882 common shares, equating to approximately 42% of total shares outstanding at the start of the NCIB programs. All common shares purchased under the NCIB are returned to treasury for cancellation. In 2023, Trican added an additional component to its return of capital strategy by instituting a quarterly dividend program:During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.04 per share for each quarter, or approximately $34.3 million in aggregate to shareholders. On February 21, 2024, the Company's board of directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share reflecting an increase of 12.5% from the previous quarterly dividend payment of $0.04 per share. The increase will offset the reduction in share count as a result of the Company's ongoing NCIB program to keep the annual expected dividend payout at approximately $36 million. The distribution is scheduled to be made on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2024.The dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.FINANCIAL REVIEW ($ millions, except $ per share amounts.

The Company has approved a capital budget for 2024 of $76 million funded with available cash resources and free cash flow1. The Company has $15 million carry forward from the 2023 capital program, bringing the total for 2024 to approximately $90 million. Financial PositionWe continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant positive working capital including cash. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and financial flexibility will allow us to execute our strategic plans including investment in our industry leading fleet, continued participation in our NCIB program and the payment of a quarterly dividend as a part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy which includes a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.OUTLOOK Our overall outlook for the next few years remains unchanged. We expect annual oilfield activity in Canada to remain relatively stable allowing us to continue generating sector leading returns for our shareholders. Canadian market fundamentals remain strong for fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services for the year and we expect the Canadian fracturing market to remain balanced under the current supply and demand dynamic. Trican saw some work scheduled for the fourth quarter deferred into the first quarter of 2024 due to customer budget exhaustion and volatility in natural gas prices. Although we had a relatively slow start to the new year, we anticipate first quarter of 2024 to be active as our customers look to complete their first quarter programs before the onset of spring break-up conditions.The Montney reservoir in Northeastern British Columbia and Northwest Alberta remains one of the premier resource plays in North America. We expect that the combination of attractive well economics, future demand from LNG export facilities and British Columbia's agreements with First Nations should lead to ongoing and growing activity in the play. Montney development requires large, high-pressure fracturing, cementing and coiled tubing services which will directly benefit Trican. Additional Canadian export capacity is in the late stages of construction through the Trans Mountain Pipeline, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and the LNG Canada facility. We are also encouraged by the progress being made for additional LNG export facilities on the west coast of Canada. This creates a positive backdrop for oil and natural gas development activity in Western Canada and the associated oilfield services required as we move through 2024 and beyond. We continue to experience inflationary pressures on specific components in our supply chain but generally at a much lower rate compared to the last two years. We will work diligently to ensure that we mitigate supply chain challenges such as long lead times on key inputs, parts and components. Challenges remain in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the oilfield services industry and thus expect to see ongoing wage inflation.Trican continues to build on the investments made in our equipment fleet over the last two years to ensure that we are on the forefront of pressure pumping technology and design in Canada. Demand for our Canadian market-leading low emissions Tier 4 DGB fracturing fleets is robust and expected to remain strong for 2024. We have completed our fifth fleet of Tier 4 DGB fracturing equipment containing high pressure pumps which is anticipated to be field ready in early 2024 bringing Trican's total Tier 4 fleet to an industry leading 210,000 HHP. To further reduce emissions and fuel costs from diesel consumption, we continue to invest and enhance our equipment offering and have recently developed two fully electric sets of certain ancillary equipment required for on-site fracturing operations and are deploying them into our fleets going forward. This equipment includes sand handling, blending and other items used on-site for chemical blending. We believe these ongoing technological advancements will augment our differentiation strategy and add value for our customers. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow1 and our financial flexibility allows for continued progress in our fleet upgrade and electrification program. We will continue to serve our customers with state-of-the-art equipment and generate industry-leading returns in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In turn, this will allow Trican to focus on returning capital to our shareholders both through our ongoing NCIB program and our quarterly dividend program. We believe our ability to deliver a multi-layered return of capital strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet will lead to long-term value creation for our shareholders.

Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to translate historical variability in the Company's principal business activities into future financial expectations. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, taxation strategy and non-cash charges, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities. Adjusted EBITDAS (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation) is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the applicable financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance, cash flow to complement profit / (loss) and to provide meaningful comparisons of operating results.The items included in this calculation of adjusted EBITDA have been specifically identified as they are non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principal business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows: Non-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, impairment of non-financial assets, and equity-settled share-based compensation; Consideration as to how the Company chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses and finance costs; Taxation in various jurisdictions; and Other income / expense which generally results from the disposition of equipment, as these transactions generally do not reflect quarterly operational field activity. The item adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDAS from adjusted EBITDA, is as follows:Cash-settled share-based compensation.($ thousands; unaudited)Three months endedYear endedDecember 31, 2023December 31, 2022September 30, 2023December 31, 2023December 31, 2022Profit for the period (IFRS financial measure) 28,761 26,217 36,375 121,009 79,215 Adjustments:Cost of sales - depreciation and amortization 17,730 19,852 17,318 73,557 76,764 Administrative expenses - depreciation 875 903 907 3,646 3,460 Current income tax expense 8,305 - 10,973 36,370 - Deferred income tax expense 1,073 11,090 430 1,591 28,667 Finance costs and amortization of debt issuance costs 644 996 514 2,587 2,570 Foreign exchange (gain) / loss (117) (5) (42) 58 (274)Other (income) / loss (953) 44 (937) (3,802) (3,145)Administrative expenses - equity-settled share-based compensation 80 261 128 587 1,222 Adjusted EBITDA 56,398 59,358 65,666 235,603 188,479 Administrative expenses - cash-settled share-based compensation 2,421 737 2,830 7,536 9,312 Adjusted EBITDAS 58,819 60,095 68,496 243,139 197,791 Certain financial measures in this news release - namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted EBITDA percentage, adjusted EBITDAS percentage and free cash flow are not prescribed by IFRS and are considered non-GAAP measures.

Management adjusts for other (income) / loss, realized (gain) / loss, non-cash income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows, net changes in other liabilities and change in non-cash operating working capital.Management reconciles free cash flow from adjusted EBITDA for the applicable financial periods by adjusting for interest paid, income taxes, and maintenance capital expenditures included within purchase of property and equipment from the statement of cash flows as they are considered non-discretionary.In 2023, the Company moved into a cash taxable position due to improved operating results and utilization of its available non-capital loss pools. The Company elected to defer its 2023 current tax installments which are expected to be remitted in Q1 2024. The Company expects to remit current tax installments for 2024 beginning in early 2024. The Company is able to defer its 2023 current tax installments until Q1 2024 but has elected to present these amounts as a reduction of free cash flow in the current periods to clearly show the impact of such non-discretionary items.Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing free cash flow by the Company's basic or diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.Free cash flow and free cash flow per share are not standardized measures and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities.($ thousands, unaudited)Three months endedYear endedDecember 31, 2023December 31, 2022September 30, 2023December 31, 2023December 31, 2022Cash flow from operations 81,909 68,145 43,498 248,456 152,232 Other income (892) (196) (601) (2,690) (690) Realized foreign exchange gain (366) (258) (77) (45) (612) Maintenance capital expenditures (8,841) (11,327) (6,462) (35,249) (29,964) Net changes in other liabilities (117) 1,910 (1,623) (475) 2,884 Change in non-cash operating working capital (32,963) (11,215) 13,007 (48,406) 33,163 Free cash flow2 38,730 47,059 47,742 161,591 157,013 2 The Company expects to pay the current tax liabilities in Q1 2024, see definition above for more details.

The brand continues its strategic growth plan into new markets, with recent successful openings in various states. Franchisees Niraj Patel and Ed Zausch join the expansion, aiming to bring the challenger brand to communities nationwide. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Jack in the Box's expansion into Michigan and further development in Orlando signifies a strategic move to capitalize on untapped markets and increase market share. This decision aligns with the broader trend in the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) sector where brands continuously seek new growth opportunities. The entry into Michigan, a new territory for the brand, indicates a competitive strategy to establish a foothold in the Midwest, potentially increasing regional brand visibility and customer base. From a market research perspective, this expansion could be driven by demographic studies and consumer behavior analytics that suggest a demand for Jack in the Box's offerings in these areas. The creation of 40 to 50 new jobs per location may also have a positive impact on local economies. These developments are likely to be closely monitored by competitors, as they could disrupt market dynamics, prompting rivals to reassess their own expansion strategies. Financial Analyst Financially, the expansion through franchising is a capital-efficient way to grow the business, as it leverages the investment and operational capabilities of franchisees. The signing of 123 new restaurant commitments in the fiscal year 2023 is a strong indicator of Jack in the Box's aggressive growth strategy and may be well-received by investors looking for companies with a clear path to revenue growth. This expansion could potentially lead to increased revenues over the long term, as the brand taps into new customer segments. However, investors should also consider the risks associated with rapid expansion, including the challenges of maintaining consistent quality and service across new locations. Additionally, the initial investment in the CRAVED design concept for each new location will require upfront capital, which could affect short-term financials but may be justified if it enhances customer experience and brand differentiation. Economist The expansion of Jack in the Box into new markets has broader economic implications. The introduction of 40 to 50 jobs per new location could stimulate local economies by reducing unemployment and increasing consumer spending. Moreover, as the QSR industry is known for its competitive labor market, this move may also lead to wage growth within the sector in these areas as companies vie for qualified workers. Furthermore, the economic multiplier effect could come into play, as the employment and operational spending by new Jack in the Box locations circulate money through the local economy. However, it is essential to assess whether the new restaurants will contribute to market saturation, which could lead to a zero-sum game with existing food service establishments. The long-term sustainability of this growth will depend on the brand's ability to adapt to local tastes and effectively compete with established players. 02/21/2024 - 06:05 PM The Brand Announces a Five-store Agreement in Michigan, its Fifth New Market Entry Since Mid-2023 New Franchisee Joins Planned Market Expansion with Second Large Multi-Unit Development Agreement in Orlando SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK), one of the nation’s leading QSR chains, announced today the signing of five new restaurant commitments with Niraj Patel that will expand the brand into Michigan. It also announces an additional 10-store development agreement for Orlando, FL with owner, Ed Zausch. This historic expansion follows recent successful openings and development agreements in areas throughout Utah, Kentucky, Arkansas, Florida, Montana, and Wyoming. “The continued expansion into Florida and Michigan matches up with our strategic growth plan for new markets,” said Tim Linderman, chief development officer. “With the recent success from our new market openings in Salt Lake City and Louisville, we’ve recognized how much pent-up demand Jack in the Box has across the country. We’re thrilled to partner with restaurant operators like Ed and Niraj to bring our challenger brand to communities throughout the USA.” “We are excited to announce five Jack in the Box locations in our West Michigan area over the span of five years,” said Niraj Patel, new Jack in the Box franchisee. “We will open the first Jack in the Box location in Battle Creek, Michigan. This is very exciting because we can give our community more food options and help provide 40 to 50 new jobs per location. We have been in our West Michigan community for decades, and we love to see the growth in our community. We own and operate a dozen hotels in the West Michigan area and want to expand our hospitality portfolio with the addition of a QSR concept.” The brand signed 123 new restaurant commitments during its 2023 fiscal year. The Michigan agreement builds upon this and will result in new restaurant development in the southwest and southcentral sections of the state, including Kalamazoo, Calhoun, and Kent. Each location will showcase the brand's innovative CRAVED design, featuring modern aesthetics and vibrant signage that reflect Jack in the Box's commitment to providing an inviting and contemporary dining experience. “Our team is beyond excited to bring ten new Jack in the Box locations to the greater Orlando area,” said Ed Zausch, new Jack in the Box franchisee. “I've been a huge fan of Jack in the Box for many years. When I moved to Orlando, I noticed there weren't any locations nearby which drove me to inquire about franchise opportunities. I was considering other brands, but I ultimately chose Jack in the Box for the great relationships I built with their team, their vast training and operational support, modern store design, and - my favorite reason - I love the variety of menu items and how we have something to offer everyone.” Jack in the Box is known for its iconic menu that features customer favorites like burgers, tacos, chicken sandwiches, milkshakes, breakfast, and late-night snacking options. The new locations will offer dine-in, drive-thru, and mobile ordering options and will be open 24 hours per day.

Huntsman Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings,2024-02-21T21:45:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Huntsman Corporation reports fourth quarter 2023 results with a net loss of $71 million, adjusted net loss of $36 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million.

The company repurchased shares, increased the quarterly dividend by 5%, and experienced a decline in revenues compared to the prior year. CEO Peter R. Huntsman remains cautiously optimistic about future demand. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported fourth quarter results for Huntsman Corporation indicate a contraction in both top-line revenue and bottom-line net income. Specifically, a year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue from $1,650 million in 2022 to $1,403 million in 2023 is a notable contraction that warrants analysis. The reduction in net income, from a loss of $91 million in 2022 to a loss of $71 million in 2023, suggests some cost control, yet the company is still operating at a loss.Adjusted EBITDA is a critical metric for assessing a company's operational performance and the decline from $87 million to $44 million year-over-year is concerning. This could potentially signal operational inefficiencies or a challenging market environment. Additionally, the decline in free cash flow from $211 million to $83 million suggests less financial flexibility for Huntsman Corporation. However, the company's decision to increase its quarterly dividend by 5% and repurchase shares could be seen as a management signal of confidence in the company's future cash flows. Market Research Analyst The chemicals industry, where Huntsman Corporation operates, is cyclical and highly sensitive to global economic conditions. The reported moderate improvement in early 2024 might not yet be reflected in the financials but suggests that the company may be starting to experience a recovery. It is important to note that the lack of a clear inflection point in demand could be indicative of broader market uncertainty. This may affect investor sentiment and could lead to volatility in the stock price.Investors should monitor industry trends, including raw material costs and end-market demand, which could impact Huntsman's performance. The share repurchase indicates that the company believes its stock is undervalued, which could be an encouraging sign for investors. However, this must be weighed against the overall financial health of the company. Economist From an economic perspective, the performance of Huntsman Corporation must be contextualized within the broader macroeconomic environment. The decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA could be reflective of a slowdown in industrial demand, which is often correlated with economic cycles. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, from $297 million to $166 million, could be interpreted as a potential indicator of decreased operational efficiency or a tightening cash conversion cycle.Investors should consider the potential impact of inflation, interest rates and global trade tensions on Huntsman's operations. These factors could affect input costs, pricing power and international sales. The company's ability to navigate these economic headwinds will be crucial for its long-term financial stability and growth prospects. 02/21/2024 - 04:45 PM Fourth Quarter Highlights Fourth quarter 2023 net loss attributable to Huntsman of $71 million compared to a net loss of $91 million in the prior year period; fourth quarter 2023 diluted loss per share of $0.41 compared to a diluted loss per share $0.48 in the prior year period.Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted net loss attributable to Huntsman of $36 million compared to adjusted net income of $8 million in the prior year period; fourth quarter 2023 adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.21 compared to adjusted diluted income per share of $0.04 in the prior year period.

THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN) today reported fourth quarter 2023 results with revenues of $1,403 million, net loss attributable to Huntsman of $71 million, adjusted net loss attributable to Huntsman of $36 million and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million. Peter R. Huntsman, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented: ""In early 2024 we have seen a moderate improvement from the lows experienced in the fourth quarter 2023, and while we are yet to see a clear inflexion point in demand, we remain positive about the future. We are well positioned to benefit significantly from volume leverage once our end markets improve and as we continue to control our cost base. While the exact timing of a recovery remains uncertain, we are confident that construction spending and industrial activity in our core markets will return to past cycle averages and the world will continue to value energy efficiency and light weighting which impacts two-thirds of our total sales. ""The portfolio changes we have made over the past several years have placed Huntsman in a position to withstand one of the toughest demand environments we have seen in well over a decade. The financial strength of our Company remains our priority as we consider both internal and external investments as well as returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and buybacks."" Segment Analysis for 4Q23 Compared to 4Q22 Polyurethanes The decrease in revenues in our Polyurethanes segment for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 was primarily due to lower MDI average selling prices and lower sales volumes combined with an adverse sales mix.

Footnotes (1) We use adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our business and for planning and evaluating the performance of our business segments. We provide adjusted net income (loss) because we feel it provides meaningful insight for the investment community into the performance of our business. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss). Additional information with respect to our use of each of these financial measures follows: Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is computed by eliminating the following from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (b) interest expense, net; (c) income taxes; (d) depreciation and amortization; (e) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (f) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain other items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA in Table 4 above. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share are computed by eliminating the after tax impact of the following items from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (b) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (c) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain other items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) in Table 4 above. The income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We may disclose forward-looking adjusted EBITDA because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted EBITDA represents the forecast net income on our underlying business operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our adjusted EBITDA to differ. (2) Management internally uses free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate our liquidity, (b) evaluate strategic investments, (c) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (d) evaluate our ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. (3) During the first quarter 2023, we completed the divestiture of our Textile Effects business, which is reported as discontinued operations on the income and cash flow statements and held for sale on the December 31, 2022 balance sheet. (4) We believe the adjusted effective tax rate provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses' operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. In our view, effective tax rate is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted effective tax rate. The reconciliation of historical adjusted effective tax rate and effective tax rate is set forth in Table 4 above. Please see the reconciliation of our net income to adjusted net income in Table 4 for details regarding the tax impacts of our non-GAAP adjustments. Our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate is calculated based on our forecast effective tax rate, and the range of our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate equals the range of our forecast effective tax rate. We disclose forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate represents the forecast effective tax rate on our underlying business operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our effective tax rate to differ. (5) Net debt is a measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account our total cash. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total debt, including the current portion, and subtracting total cash.

Aerospace Engineer The successful return of Rocket Lab's spacecraft for Varda Space Industries marks a significant milestone in the realm of in-space manufacturing, particularly for pharmaceuticals. From an engineering perspective, the mission's extension from four to over eight months demonstrates the spacecraft's robustness and the reliability of its subsystems, which include in-house developed engines, avionics and propulsion systems. The precision required for the hypersonic reentry at speeds greater than Mach 25, with a margin of error of less than 0.05%, is a testament to the advanced capabilities of Rocket Lab's engineering team and their 3D printed Curie propulsion system. This event signals a potential shift towards more frequent and complex missions beyond the International Space Station, opening up new opportunities for space-based R&D and manufacturing. Pharmaceutical Scientist The growth of Ritonavir crystals in microgravity conditions could lead to significant advancements in pharmaceutical science. The unique microgravity environment allows for the formulation of purer and potentially more effective pharmaceuticals, due to the altered particle behavior in the absence of gravity. This successful mission paves the way for the commercialization of orbital drug processing, which could revolutionize how certain medications are produced, potentially leading to enhanced drug properties and therapeutic efficacy. The laboratory analysis of the space-grown crystals will be critical in determining the viability and advantages of space-manufactured pharmaceuticals compared to Earth-based methods. Market Analyst The announcement of Rocket Lab's successful mission with Varda Space Industries has implications for the stock market and investor sentiment. As Rocket Lab is publicly traded under the ticker RKLB, such a successful demonstration of their end-to-end space system solutions could positively influence their stock performance. The company's ability to deliver on complex missions and the potential for future contracts in the burgeoning field of in-space manufacturing may attract investor interest. Furthermore, the fact that Rocket Lab has additional spacecraft in development for Varda and over 25 spacecraft under development in their facility, reflects a strong product pipeline which can be a positive signal for the company's growth prospects and financial health in the long-term. 02/21/2024 - 05:53 PM The Rocket Lab spacecraft designed, built, and operated for Varda Space Industries which enabled the production of pharmaceutical products on orbit, has been returned to Earth LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its custom spacecraft for Varda Space Industries (“Varda”), a leading in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry logistics company, successfully returned to Earth the world’s first space manufacturing mission conducted outside of the International Space Station. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240221287474/en/Rocket Lab's spacecraft for Varda Space Industries (Photo: Business Wire) Rocket Lab conducted in-space operations, deorbit, and reentry positioning maneuvers for its spacecraft, enabling Varda’s reentry capsule and payload of pharmaceutical crystals to return to Earth. With Rocket Lab’s role in the mission complete, the Varda team then took over management of the capsule’s hypersonic reentry, parachute deployment, and touchdown in the designated zone at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) near Salt Lake City shortly after 21:30 UTC today. Today’s mission is a successful demonstration of Rocket Lab’s end-to-end space systems solutions tailored to enable novel and innovative missions for a range of customers. Rocket Lab designed, manufactured and operated a bespoke spacecraft to enable Varda’s capsule manufacturing demonstration. The spacecraft included a full suite of Rocket Lab sub-systems and components built in-house, spanning spacecraft engine, flight software, avionics, reaction wheels, star trackers, capsule dispenser, solar panels, radio, composite structures and tanks, and more. While initially designed for a four-month lifespan on orbit, the mission timeline was more than doubled with Rocket Lab’s spacecraft successfully provided power, communications, ground control, and attitude control to Varda’s capsule on orbit for more than eight months. This enabled Varda’s capsule to grow Ritonavir crystals, commonly used in antiviral medication. As particles function differently when no longer under the force of gravity, Varda’s capsule utilizes microgravity conditions in space to formulate a range of pharmaceutical products. Rocket Lab also supported the mission with 24/7 satellite operations to return Varda’s capsule to Earth. Rocket Lab’s operations team completed multiple on-orbit trajectory optimization maneuvers that set the mission on its return-to-Earth trajectory, including four engine relights of Rocket Lab’s 3D printed Curie propulsion system to move Varda’s mission from a circular Earth orbit to an elliptical one, positioning Varda’s capsule for a return to Earth at hypersonic speeds greater than Mach 25, or approximately 30,000 km per hour. Deploying Varda’s capsule on a hypersonic reentry trajectory to land within the incredibly tight boundaries of the mission’s landing zone within the UTTR was an especially complex task that demanded pinpoint accuracy with a margin of error of less than 0.05%. Varda’s recovery operations are now in full swing and once the capsule is retrieved by Varda, the company will conduct laboratory analysis of the space-grown crystals and determine its next steps for commercializing orbital drug processing and microgravity manufacturing. Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, says: “This mission was a phenomenal feat and impressive display of teamwork between the Rocket Lab and Varda teams to develop a unique and highly capable spacecraft, successfully demonstrate in-space manufacturing, and bring back the capsule and finished pharmaceutical product – all on the first attempt. Being part of the first pharmaceutical in-space mission to happen outside of the International Space Station is immensely exciting and we look forward to building on this success with more Rocket Lab spacecraft in development for Varda right now. The success of this reentry mission will also inform our work on developing a reentry capsule for Neutron to potentially enable human spaceflight missions.” Today’s returned mission is the first of four Rocket Lab spacecraft ordered by Varda to support its in-space pharmaceutical processing. The remaining spacecraft are currently undergoing assembly, integration, and testing at Rocket Lab’s spacecraft production facility in Long Beach, California, with the next spacecraft scheduled to launch before the end of the year. These spacecraft for Varda are just some of the 25+ spacecraft currently under development at Rocket Lab’s advanced spacecraft development and manufacturing complex, which features a 10,000 sq. ft. cleanroom and 40,000 sq. ft. of production & test facilities designed to support constellation class manufacturing and satellite assembly, integration and test for commercial, civil and national security customers. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

While the company achieved record annual total gold production, surpassing the upper half of its annual guidance, it reported a net loss attributable to shareholders in Q4 2023. The reported net loss contrasts with the adjusted net income, which excluded certain expenses and reflects a more favorable view of the company's profitability. The significant upfront payment from the Gold Prepay arrangement indicates a strategic move to enhance financial flexibility and liquidity, which could be seen as a positive step for future investments and managing operational costs.However, investors should consider the potential implications of hedging future gold production at a forward curve price, as it could limit the upside potential should gold prices increase beyond the agreed-upon prices. The company's strong liquidity position, with substantial cash and cash equivalents, positions it well to fund ongoing projects and potentially weather market volatility. The declaration of a quarterly dividend suggests confidence in the company's financial health and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Nonetheless, the dividend policy's sustainability will depend on the company's future financial performance and cash flow generation. Market Research Analyst B2Gold's operational achievements, such as exceeding production expectations at its mines and progressing construction at the Goose Project ahead of schedule, demonstrate operational efficiency and effective project management. The anticipated increase in gold production for 2025, particularly from the Fekola Complex and the commencement of the Goose Project, suggests potential for growth in output and revenue. However, the market may have already priced in these expectations and the actual impact on the stock will depend on the company's ability to meet these targets and the prevailing gold market conditions at the time.The geopolitical risk associated with mining operations, highlighted by the tragic attack in Mali, may introduce concerns for investors regarding the safety of operations and potential disruptions. This risk factor could have an adverse effect on investor sentiment and the company's valuation. The ongoing Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Gramalote Project will be a key factor to watch, as it will provide insights into the project's viability and potential impact on the company's growth prospects. Economist From an economic perspective, B2Gold's operational and financial results must be contextualized within the broader gold market and economic trends. The company's ability to maintain low consolidated cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs below the guidance range reflects effective cost management strategies. This is particularly noteworthy given the inflationary pressures experienced across industries, which have increased input costs for many mining companies. The weaker Namibian dollar has had a favorable impact on costs, showcasing the influence of currency fluctuations on multinational operations.The gold market dynamics, including the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset amidst economic uncertainties, will continue to play a critical role in the company's revenue and profitability. The hedging strategy through the Gold Prepay arrangement may provide short-term financial stability but could also limit B2Gold's participation in potential gold price rallies. Long-term, the company's financial health will be influenced by its ability to manage operational costs, navigate currency and commodity price volatility and execute on its development projects. 02/21/2024 - 05:59 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2Gold Corp.

Exterior cladding of the mill building and truck shop is complete, and cladding of the power house will start in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, the ball mill will be set in place in the first quarter of 2024, approximately four months ahead of schedule. Following the successful completion of the 2023 sealift, construction of the 2024 winter ice road (“WIR”) is being finalized and scheduled to be fully operational by February 23, 2024, transporting all required materials from the Marine Laydown Area (“MLA”) to the Goose Project site by the end of April 2024.Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) underway on the Gramalote Project with completion expected by the end of the second quarter of 2024: In 2023, B2Gold entered into a purchase agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited (“AngloGold”) to acquire AngloGold's 50% interest in the Gramalote Project located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. B2Gold now owns 100% of the Gramalote Project. In 2023, the Company completed a detailed review of the Gramalote Project, including the facility size and location, power supply, mining and processing options, tailings design, resettlement, potential construction sequencing, and camp design to identify potential cost savings to develop a smaller scale project. A formal study commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the goal of completing a PEA by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Subsequent to year-end 2023, announced positive exploration drilling results from the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine in Namibia: On January 31, 2024, the Company announced positive exploration drilling results from the Antelope deposit, located approximately 3 kilometers (“km”) south of the Otjikoto Phase 5 open pit. The Antelope deposit has the potential to be developed as an underground mining operation, which could complement the expected processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto mill from 2026 through 2031. Subsequent to year-end 2023, received an upfront payment of $500 million, to further enhance financial flexibility and provide additional cash liquidity: In January 2024, B2Gold entered into a series of prepaid gold sales (the “Gold Prepay”) with a number of existing lenders to further enhance financial flexibility and provide additional cash liquidity at attractive terms as the Company continues to fund sustaining, development, and growth projects across the operating portfolio, and increase financial capacity for potential growth projects in Namibia and Colombia. The Company received an upfront payment of $500 million, based on gold forward curve prices averaging approximately $2,191 per ounce, in exchange for equal monthly deliveries of gold from July 2025 to June 2026 totaling 264,775 ounces, representing approximately 10% of expected annual gold production in each of 2025 and 2026 (subject to finalization of production guidance for 2025 and 2026). Gold deliveries can be from production from any of the Company's operating mines and the Gold Prepay can be settled prior to maturity through accelerated delivery of the remaining deliverable gold ounces.Q1 2024 dividend of $0.04 per share declared: On February 21, 2024, B2Gold's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.04 per common share (or an expected $0.16 per share on an annualized basis), payable on March 20, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2024.B2Gold consolidated gold production expected to increase to record levels in 2025: Based on current estimates, consolidated gold production is expected to be between 1,130,000 and 1,260,000 ounces in 2025, driven by a significant increase in gold production from the Fekola Complex, relative to 2024, as a result of the scheduled mining and processing of higher-grade ore from the Fekola and Cardinal pits made accessible by the meaningful stripping campaign that will be undertake throughout 2024, a full year contribution of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional, and commencement of mining the higher-grade Fekola underground (subject to receipt of necessary permits for Fekola Regional and Fekola underground). In addition, the Goose Project is expected to commence gold production in the first quarter of 2025 and contribute between 220,000 and 260,000 ounces of gold production in calendar year 2025. Update on Off-Site Attack in Mali On February 15, 2024, the Company reported three fatalities from an off-site armed attack in Mali. Traveling on the national highway under Malian gendarme escort, a bus transporting B2Gold employees from the Fekola Mine to Bamako was involved in an incident when it was attacked approximately 75 km west of Bamako. This tragic event was the result of an armed attack on the employee transport convoy, which included Malian gendarmerie vehicles in front and in the rear of the transport convoy. Unfortunately, as of February 21, 2024, B2Gold deeply regrets to report that a fourth employee has passed away as a result of injuries sustained in the attack. Three employees remain in intensive care and are being treated for their injuries in Bamako. All B2Gold employees traveling on the bus have now been accounted for. B2Gold wishes to express its deepest condolences to the families of the deceased employees and extends its best wishes for a full recovery to all those employees who were injured in the attack. The attack occurred over 300 km northeast of the Fekola Mine site, along a transport route that has been the focus of increased security presence by the Malian armed forces. Mining and processing activities at the Fekola Mine were not impacted by this incident. The Company is actively engaged with the Malian government on a full investigation into the cause of the attack, and on further improvements to security along the national highway.

For a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable measures specified, defined or determined under IFRS and presented in the Company’s financial statements, refer to “Non-IFRS Measures”. The Fekola Mine in Mali (owned 80% by the Company and 20% by the State of Mali) was a strong performer in 2023, producing 590,243 ounces of gold, near the mid-point of the annual guidance range of 580,000 to 610,000 ounces. For the year ended December 31, 2023, mill feed grade was 2.13 grams per tonne (“g/t”), mill throughput was a record 9.41 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 92.3%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Fekola Mine produced 143,010 ounces of gold. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Fekola processing facilities continued to outperform expectations as a result of continued favourable ore fragmentation and continued optimization of the grinding circuit. For the fourth quarter of 2023, mill feed grade was 1.99 g/t, mill throughput was 2.42 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 93.4%. Mined ore tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with the Fekola resource model. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Fekola Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) of $572 per gold ounce produced ($566 per gold ounce sold) were at the lower end of Fekola's guidance range of between $565 and $625 per gold ounce produced. Fekola’s cash operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $605 per gold ounce produced ($646 per gold ounce sold), slightly lower than expected due to higher than anticipated production in the fourth quarter. All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the Fekola Mine for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1,194 per gold ounce sold, near the low end of the revised guidance range of between $1,175 and $1,235 per gold ounce sold, but higher than the original guidance range of between $1,085 and $1,145 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the Fekola Mine for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1,444 per gold ounce sold. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023, totalled $299 million, primarily consisting of $80 million for deferred stripping, $84 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $39 million for tailings storage facility expansion and equipment, $39 million for the development of the Fekola underground mine, $18 million for the expansion of the solar plant, $12 million for site general capital, $12 million for other mining sustaining capital, $10 million for process and power plant, and $5 million for Bantako road construction. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2023 totalled $88 million, primarily consisting of $24 million for deferred stripping, $18 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $16 million for tailings storage facility expansion and equipment, $14 million for the development of the Fekola underground mine, $7 million for the expansion of the solar plant, $5 million site general capital, and $3 million for other mining sustaining capital. The Fekola Complex is comprised of the Fekola Mine (Medinandi permit hosting the Fekola and Cardinal pits and Fekola underground) and Fekola Regional (Anaconda Area (Bantako, Menankoto, and Bakolobi permits) and the Dandoko permit). The Fekola Complex is expected to produce between 470,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold in 2024 at cash operating costs of between $835 and $895 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce. The Fekola Complex's total 2024 gold production is anticipated to decrease relative to 2023, predominantly as a result of the delay in receiving an exploitation license for Fekola Regional from the Government of Mali, delaying the 80,000 to 100,000 ounces that were scheduled in the life of mine plan to be trucked to the Fekola mill and processed in 2024. The contribution of this gold production from Fekola Regional is now assumed to commence at the beginning of 2025. If an exploitation license is received in the first half of 2024, there is potential for 2024 Fekola Complex production to be supplemented with up to 18,000 ounces of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the State of Mali introduced a new mining code (the “2023 Mining Code”). Receipt of an exploitation license for Fekola Regional remains outstanding pending finalization of an implementation decree for the new 2023 Mining Code by the State of Mali. B2Gold recently held meetings with representatives of the Government of Mali regarding the 2023 Mining Code. The Government of Mali assisted the Company in clarifying the application of the 2023 Mining Code to existing and future projects in Mali, and also expressed their desire for B2Gold to rapidly progress the development of Fekola Regional and committed to assisting the Company in such development. The haul road from Bantako North to Fekola is complete and construction of the mining infrastructure (warehouse, workshop, fuel depot, and offices) will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. Mining operations will commence upon receipt of an exploitation license, with initial gold production approximately three months after commencement. Fekola is expected to process 9.4 million tonnes of ore during 2024 at an average grade of 1.77 g/t gold with a process gold recovery of 90.9%. Gold production is expected to be evenly weighted between the first half of 2024 and the second half of 2024. In the second half of 2024, gold production is expected to be weighted approximately 40% to the third quarter and approximately 60% to the fourth quarter. The expected increase in Fekola's all-in sustaining costs for 2024 relative to 2023 reflects the expected decrease in production at Fekola in 2024 due to the delay in receiving an exploitation license for Fekola Regional and higher sustaining capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2024 at Fekola are expected to total approximately $309 million, of which approximately $202 million is classified as sustaining capital expenditures and $107 million is classified as non-sustaining expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are anticipated to include $80 million for deferred stripping, $45 million for ongoing construction of the new tailings storage facility (expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025), $39 million for new and replacement Fekola mining equipment, including capitalized rebuilds, and $19 million for the expansion of the Fekola solar plant (expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024). Non-sustaining capital expenditures are anticipated to include $64 million for underground mine development and $43 million for mine development and infrastructure at Fekola Regional.

The Masbate Mine in the Philippines continued its strong operational performance in 2023, producing 193,502 ounces of gold, exceeding the upper end of its guidance range of 170,000 to 190,000 ounces. For the year ended December 31, 2023, mill feed grade was 0.97 g/t, mill throughput was a record 8.30 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 74.5%. Gold recoveries for 2023 of 74.5% were in-line with those of 2022. Average 2023 gold recoveries were as expected despite processing a higher percentage of sulphide and transitional ore than planned. Masbate's mill throughput was higher than anticipated in 2023 as a result of continued improvements to optimization of mill operations and blending of mill feed. Mined ore tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with the Masbate resource model. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Masbate produced 46,490 ounces of gold. Lower ore gold grade during the quarter was offset by higher than expected mill throughput. Fourth quarter 2023 mill feed grade was 0.90 g/t, mill throughput was 2.08 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 77.0%. The Masbate Mine’s cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) of $859 per gold ounce produced ($844 per gold ounce sold) for the year ended December 31, 2023 were at the low end of the revised guidance range of between $855 and $915 per gold ounce produced and significantly below the original guidance range of between $985 and $1,045 per gold ounce produced. As a result of lower than anticipated diesel and heavy fuel oil costs, Masbate experienced lower than expected mining and processing costs throughout 2023, which with the higher than anticipated gold production, contributed significantly to the lower than expected cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for Masbate for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Masbate Mine's cash operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $910 per gold ounce produced ($817 per gold ounce sold). All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the Masbate Mine were $1,143 per gold ounce sold for the year ended December 31, 2023, below the lower end of the revised guidance range of between $1,155 and $1,215 per gold ounce sold and well below the original guidance range of between $1,370 and $1,430 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were lower than anticipated as a result of higher than expected gold ounces sold, lower than expected cash operating costs as described above, and lower than anticipated sustaining capital expenditures. All-in sustaining costs for the Masbate Mine for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1,118 per gold ounce sold. Capital expenditures totalled $30 million in 2023, primarily consisting of mobile equipment rebuilds and purchases of $17 million, $3 million for the completion of a new powerhouse generator and other powerhouse engine rebuilds, $2 million in deferred stripping, $2 million for tailings storage facility projects, and $2 million for capitalized mill maintenance. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2023 totalled $9 million, primarily consisting of $5 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and purchases, $1 million for capitalized mill maintenance, $1 million for powerhouse rebuilds, and $1 million for the tailings storage facility. The Masbate Mine is expected to produce between 170,000 and 190,000 ounces of gold in 2024 at cash operating costs of between $945 and $1,005 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,300 and $1,360 per ounce. Gold production is scheduled to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Masbate is expected to process 7.9 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0.93 g/t with a process gold recovery of 76.0%. Mill feed will be a blend of mined fresh ore and low-grade ore stockpiles. Capital expenditures for 2024 at Masbate are expected to total $49 million, of which approximately $33 million is classified as sustaining capital expenditures and $16 million is classified as non-sustaining capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are anticipated to include $16 million for mining and mobile equipment replacement and rebuilds, $6 million for deferred stripping, $6 million for process plant, and $3 million for tailings storage facility expansion. Non-sustaining capital expenditures are anticipated to include $16 million for land acquisition and mine development.

For a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable measures specified, defined or determined under IFRS and presented in the Company’s financial statements, refer to “Non-IFRS Measures”. The Otjikoto Mine in Namibia, in which the Company holds a 90% interest, had a strong finish to 2023 and produced an annual record of 208,598 ounces of gold, at the upper end of the guidance range of 190,000 to 210,000 ounces, mainly due to improved processed grade as a result of higher-grade ore mined from the Wolfshag underground mine. For the year ended December 31, 2023, mill feed grade was 1.91 g/t, mill throughput was 3.44 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 98.6%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Otjikoto Mine produced a quarterly record of 81,111 ounces of gold. For the fourth quarter of 2023, mill feed grade was 2.88 g/t, mill throughput was 0.89 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 98.5%. As of the beginning of 2023, the Probable Mineral Reserve estimate for the Wolfshag deposit included 203,000 ounces of gold in 1.1 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 5.55 g/t gold. Open pit mining operations at the Otjikoto Mine are scheduled to ramp down throughout 2024 and conclude in 2025, while underground mining operations at Wolfshag are expected to continue through 2026. Processing operations will continue through 2031, when economically viable stockpiles are forecast to be exhausted. On January 31, 2024, the Company announced positive exploration drilling results from the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine. The Antelope deposit, comprised of the Springbok Zone, the Oryx Zone, and a possible third structure, Impala, subject to further confirmatory drilling, is located approximately 3 km south of the Otjikoto Phase 5 open pit. The Antelope deposit has the potential to be developed as an underground mining operation, which could complement the expected processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto mill from 2026 through 2031. The Otjikoto Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $585 per gold ounce produced ($568 per gold ounce sold), within its revised guidance range of between $545 and $605 per gold ounce produced and below its original guidance range between $590 and $650 per gold ounce produced. Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the year ended December 31, 2023 were lower than expectations as a result of higher than expected gold ounces produced and lower operating costs due to a weaker than anticipated Namibian dollar. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Otjikoto Mine's cash operating costs were $451 per gold ounce produced ($503 per ounce gold sold). All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the Otjikoto Mine for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $984 per gold ounce sold, within its revised guidance range of between $950 and $1,010 per ounce sold and well below its original guidance range of between $1,080 and $1,140 per ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were below the low end of its original guidance range as a result of higher than anticipated gold ounces sold, lower than expected cash operating costs and lower than anticipated sustaining capital expenditures primarily related to deferred stripping and underground development. All-in sustaining costs for the Otjikoto Mine for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $816 per gold ounce sold. Capital expenditures totalled $61 million in 2023, primarily consisting of $47 million for deferred stripping for the Otjikoto pit, $10 million for Wolfshag underground development, and $2 million in mobile equipment rebuilds. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2023 totalled $15 million, primarily consisting of $10 million for deferred stripping for the Otjikoto pit and $3 million for Wolfshag underground development. The Otjikoto Mine is expected to produce between 180,000 and 200,000 ounces of gold in 2024 at cash operating costs of between $685 and $745 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $960 and $1,020 per ounce. Gold production at Otjikoto is expected to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Otjikoto is expected to process a total of 3.4 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1.77 g/t with a process gold recovery of 98.0%. Processed ore will be sourced from the Otjikoto pit and the Wolfshag underground mine, supplemented by existing medium and high-grade ore stockpiles. Capital expenditures in 2024 at Otjikoto are expected to total $33 million, of which approximately $32 million is classified as sustaining capital expenditures and $1 million is classified as non-sustaining capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures are anticipated to include $32 million for deferred stripping and deferred underground development. Goose Project Development On April 19, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Sabina Gold & Silver Corp. (“Sabina”), resulting in the Company acquiring Sabina's 100% owned Back River Gold District located in Nunavut, Canada by issuing approximately 216 million common shares of B2Gold as consideration. The Back River Gold District consists of five mineral claims blocks along an 80 km belt. B2Gold recognizes that respect and collaboration with the Kitikmeot Inuit Association (“KIA”) is central to the license to operate in the Back River Gold District and will continue to prioritize developing the project in a manner that recognizes Inuit priorities, addresses concerns, and brings long-term socio-economic benefits to the Kitikmeot Region. B2Gold looks forward to continuing to build on its strong collaboration with the KIA and Kitikmeot Communities. Construction at the Goose Project continues to progress on track, with the project remaining on schedule to pour first gold in the first quarter of 2025. Concrete and steel works in the mill area to date are progressing ahead of schedule. Exterior cladding of the mill building and truck shop is complete and cladding of the power house will commence in the first quarter of 2024. Enclosure of these buildings has allowed for work to continue through the colder months and remain on schedule. Additionally, the ball mill will be set in place in the first quarter of 2024, approximately four months ahead of schedule, and the focus will switch to piping, electrical, and mechanical systems as materials begin to arrive via the WIR from the MLA. Crews for installation of piping, electrical, and mechanical systems have been mobilized and will work within the enclosed workshops and buildings as the site ramps up to peak 2024 construction season. Progress to date has considerably de-risked the Goose Project as the site ramps up to the peak 2024 construction season. Following the successful completion of the 2023 sealift, construction of the 163 km WIR between the MLA and the Goose Project is being finalized. The WIR is scheduled to be fully operational by February 23, 2024, transporting all required materials from the MLA to the Goose Project site by the end of April 2024, keeping the Goose Project on schedule to pour first gold in the first quarter of 2025. After completing a detailed review of the Goose Project design, materials, and construction schedule as part of the 2024 budgeting process, the Company has revised the total construction capital estimate from C$800 million to C$1,050 million. Most of the increase in the construction capital estimate relates to underestimated labour and site operating costs in the feasibility study, along with additional general inflationary impacts on construction materials, consumables, and transportation costs. In addition, a detailed review of the project design has identified deficiencies in project components including power generation and distribution, laboratory, piping, and controls and instrumentation, which are being corrected to deliver a reliable operation. In 2024, B2Gold expects to incur approximately C$280 million in construction capital costs. Future construction cost variance is expected to be minimal as over half of the construction capital costs to be incurred in 2024 are related to labour in order to bring the project close to commissioning by the end of the year, and all major components have been purchased or are under contract. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and post-acquisition to December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $126 million (C$171 million) and $282 million (C$381 million), respectively for construction activities at the Goose Project. In addition, the net cost of open pit and underground development, deferred stripping, and sustaining capital expenditures to be incurred prior to first gold production is estimated at approximately C$200 million (including approximately C$125 million of direct mining costs related to open pit and underground development). The cost of these initiatives is primarily related to optimization changes in the underground mine plan as a result of switching the underground mining method to long-hole stoping and prioritizing ore from the Umwelt crown pillar area ahead of the zones below. It is anticipated that the increase in underground development costs will be offset during operations through lower sustainable operating costs than could be achieved with the cut-and-fill underground mining method. Additionally, B2Gold has elected to advance open pit mining of the Echo Pit, which is underway and will produce construction fill, stockpile ore, and provide tailings storage capacity. Open pit mining of the Umwelt Pit is expected to commence later in the first quarter of 2024 and will produce much of the commissioning ore as well as future tailings storage. In 2024, B2Gold expects to incur approximately C$170 million in open pit and underground development, deferred stripping, and sustaining capital expenditures. In 2024, the Company will undertake a buildup of working capital over the Goose Project construction period up to the first quarter of 2025 in order to materially de-risk the execution of the production ramp-up phase and initial years of operation by including 2025 and certain 2026 consumables and sustaining capital equipment on the 2024 sealift. Areas of focus for working capital include: accelerated purchase and additional storage of diesel fuel to manage the requirements for operations in 2025 and part of 2026; critical inventory of consumables and spares for mining and processing to avoid the requirement for air transport; and development of open pit and underground ore stockpiles to provide a consistent and uninterrupted feed to the process plant. The Company estimates that approximately C$205 million of fuel, reagents, and other working capital items will be purchased in 2024 to build up site inventory levels, which will substantially de-risk the project from operational and supply chain disruptions. Post-acquisition to December 31, 2023, $57 million of consumables inventory costs were incurred, including long-term consumables of $44 million. Fekola Complex Development Based on B2Gold's preliminary planning, the Anaconda Area could provide selective higher-grade saprolite material (average annual grade of up to 2.2 g/t gold) to be trucked approximately 20 km and fed into the Fekola mill at a rate of up to 1.5 million tonnes per annum. Trucking of selective higher-grade saprolite material from the Anaconda Area to the Fekola mill will increase the ore processed and has the potential to generate approximately 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of gold production per year from Fekola Regional sources. Receipt of a mining permit for the Fekola Regional licenses remains outstanding pending finalization of an implementation decree for the new 2023 Mining Code by the State of Mali. The Company does not currently forecast any production from Fekola Regional in the Company's 2024 guidance, with production now expected to commence at the beginning of 2025. If an exploitation license for Fekola Regional is received in the first half of 2024, there is potential for 2024 Fekola Complex production to be supplemented with up to 18,000 ounces of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional. In addition, if the Company is successful in discovering additional sulphide ore across the Fekola Complex, the trucking of oxide ore from Fekola Regional to the Fekola mill may potentially be extended. B2Gold recently held meetings with the representatives of the Government of Mali regarding the 2023 Mining Code. The Government of Mali assisted the Company in clarifying the application of the 2023 Mining Code to existing and future projects in Mali, and also expressed their desire for B2Gold to rapidly progress the development of Fekola Regional and committed to assisting the Company in such development. For the fourth quarter of 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company invested $10 million and $56 million respectively, in the development of Fekola Regional (Anaconda Area) saprolite mining including road construction, mine infrastructure, and mining equipment. For 2023, the Company had budgeted a total of $63 million for Fekola Regional development. Gramalote Project Development B2Gold's in-house projects team has commenced work on various smaller scale project development plans for the Gramalote Project, with the goal of identifying a higher-return project than the previously contemplated joint venture development plan. Based on the results of the 2022 Gramalote feasibility study, the contemplated larger scale project did not meet the combined investment return thresholds for development by both B2Gold and AngloGold. In 2023, B2Gold completed a detailed review of the Gramalote Project, including the facility size and location, power supply, mining and processing options, tailings design, resettlement, potential construction sequencing, and camp design to identify potential cost savings to develop a smaller scale project. The results of the review allowed the Company to determine the optimal parameters and assumptions for a formal study, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the goal of completing a PEA by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Exploration B2Gold executed another year of aggressive exploration in 2023 incurring $78 million (including $2 million of target generation costs included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations) compared to a revised budget of approximately $84 million (original budget of $64 million). Exploration in 2023 was focused predominantly in Mali, other operating mine sites in Namibia and the Philippines, both infill and generative exploration at the Back River Gold District, as well as a continued focus on grassroots targets around the world. B2Gold is planning another year of extensive exploration in 2024 with a budget of approximately $63 million. A significant focus will be exploration at the Back River Gold District, with the goal of enhancing and growing the significant resource base at the Goose Project and surrounding regional targets. In Namibia, the exploration program at the Otjikoto Mine will be the largest program since 2012, with 39,000 meters of drilling planned to define and expand the recently discovered Antelope deposit. In Mali, the exploration program will be a more strategic search for near-mine, near-surface sources of additional sulphide-related gold mineralization. In the Philippines, the exploration program at Masbate will focus on converting inferred mineral resource areas and expanding the existing open pits. Early stage exploration programs will continue in Finland, the Philippines, and Cote d'Ivoire in 2024. Finally, the search for new joint ventures and strategic investment opportunities will continue, building on existing equity investments in Snowline Gold Corp. and Matador Mining Ltd. Outlook Total gold production in 2024 is anticipated to be between 860,000 and 940,000 ounces, including 40,000 to 50,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre. Production is expected to be relatively consistent throughout 2024, with third quarter production expected to be slightly lower and fourth quarter production expected to be slightly higher. The expected decrease in gold production relative to 2023 is predominantly due to lower production at the Fekola Complex as a result of the delay in receiving an exploitation license for Fekola Regional from the Government of Mali, delaying the 80,000 to 100,000 ounces that were scheduled in the life of mine plan to be trucked to the Fekola mill and processed in 2024. The contribution of this gold production from Fekola Regional is now assumed to commence at the beginning of 2025. The Company's total consolidated cash operating costs for the year (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) are forecast to be between $835 and $895 per gold ounce produced and total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (including estimate attributable results for Calibre) are forecast to be between $1,360 and $1,420 per gold ounce sold. The anticipated increase in the Company's consolidated cash operating costs per ounce for 2024 reflects the processing of lower-grade ore at Fekola in 2024. The total consolidated all-in sustaining costs per ounce for 2024 reflect the final full year of spending on both the new Fekola tailings storage facility and the Fekola solar plant expansion, in addition to the ongoing substantial capitalized stripping campaign planned at Fekola for 2024. B2Gold consolidated gold production is expected to increase to record levels in 2025. Based on current estimates, consolidated gold production in 2025 is expected to be between 1,130,000 and 1,260,000 ounces, driven by a significant increase in gold production from the Fekola Complex, relative to 2024, as a result of the scheduled mining and processing of higher-grade ore from the Fekola and Cardinal pits made accessible by the meaningful stripping campaign that will be undertaken throughout 2024, a full year contribution of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional, and commencement of mining from the higher-grade Fekola underground (subject to receipt of necessary permits for Fekola Regional and Fekola underground). In addition, the Goose Project is expected to commence gold production in the first quarter of 2025 and contribute between 220,000 and 260,000 ounces of gold production in calendar year 2025. The Company still expects gold production from the Goose Project to be approximately 300,000 ounces per year over the first five years of operation. As a result of the expected completion of several capital projects in 2024 and early 2025, the Company also expects that there will be a significant decrease in both sustaining and growth capital expenditures in 2025. Construction of the Goose Project is progressing on track, with the project remaining on schedule for first gold pour in the first quarter of 2025. Construction continues ahead of schedule within the mill and processing buildings, along with preparatory work for peak construction activities in the second and third quarters of 2024. Mine development is well underway at the Echo Pit and Umwelt Underground mine to generate high-grade stockpiles prior to mill commissioning. Following the successful completion of the 2023 sealift, construction of the WIR is being finalized and scheduled to be fully operational by February 23, 2024, transporting all required materials from the MLA to the Goose Project site by the end of April 2024. Results of the Fekola Complex technical report outlining the trucking of ore from the Anaconda Area will be released in the first quarter of 2024. Results indicate that the trucking of both oxide and sulphide ore from Fekola Regional to be toll milled by the Fekola mill is the optimal option to maximize the value of Fekola Regional, and to extend the processing life of the Fekola mill. The Company has completed a detailed review of the Gramalote Project, including the facility size and location, power supply, mining and processing options, tailings design, resettlement, potential construction sequencing, and camp design to identify potential cost savings to develop a smaller scale project. A formal study commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the goal of completing a PEA by the end of the second quarter of 2024. The Company's ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines, further advance its pipeline of remaining development and exploration projects, evaluate new exploration, development and production opportunities and continue to pay an industry leading dividend yield.

Forward-looking statements necessarily involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond B2Gold's control, including risks associated with or related to: the volatility of metal prices and B2Gold's common shares; changes in tax laws; the dangers inherent in exploration, development and mining activities; the uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates; not achieving production, cost or other estimates; actual production, development plans and costs differing materially from the estimates in B2Gold's feasibility and other studies; the ability to obtain and maintain any necessary permits, consents or authorizations required for mining activities; environmental regulations or hazards and compliance with complex regulations associated with mining activities; climate change and climate change regulations; the ability to replace mineral reserves and identify acquisition opportunities; the unknown liabilities of companies acquired by B2Gold; the ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions; fluctuations in exchange rates; the availability of financing; financing and debt activities, including potential restrictions imposed on B2Gold's operations as a result thereof and the ability to generate sufficient cash flows; operations in foreign and developing countries and the compliance with foreign laws, including those associated with operations in Mali, Namibia, the Philippines and Colombia and including risks related to changes in foreign laws and changing policies related to mining and local ownership requirements or resource nationalization generally; remote operations and the availability of adequate infrastructure; fluctuations in price and availability of energy and other inputs necessary for mining operations; shortages or cost increases in necessary equipment, supplies and labour; regulatory, political and country risks, including local instability or acts of terrorism and the effects thereof; the reliance upon contractors, third parties and joint venture partners; the lack of sole decision-making authority related to Filminera Resources Corporation, which owns the Masbate Project; challenges to title or surface rights; the dependence on key personnel and the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel; the risk of an uninsurable or uninsured loss; adverse climate and weather conditions; litigation risk; competition with other mining companies; community support for B2Gold's operations, including risks related to strikes and the halting of such operations from time to time; conflicts with small scale miners; failures of information systems or information security threats; the ability to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting as required by law, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; compliance with anti-corruption laws, and sanctions or other similar measures; social media and B2Gold's reputation; risks affecting Calibre having an impact on the value of the Company's investment in Calibre, and potential dilution of our equity interest in Calibre; as well as other factors identified and as described in more detail under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in B2Gold's most recent Annual Information Form, B2Gold's current Form 40-F Annual Report and B2Gold's other filings with Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), which may be viewed at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov, respectively (the ""Websites""). The list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect B2Gold's forward-looking statements. B2Gold's forward-looking statements are based on the applicable assumptions and factors management considers reasonable as of the date hereof, based on the information available to management at such time. These assumptions and factors include, but are not limited to, assumptions and factors related to B2Gold's ability to carry on current and future operations, including: development and exploration activities; the timing, extent, duration and economic viability of such operations, including any mineral resources or reserves identified thereby; the accuracy and reliability of estimates, projections, forecasts, studies and assessments; B2Gold's ability to meet or achieve estimates, projections and forecasts; the availability and cost of inputs; the price and market for outputs, including gold; foreign exchange rates; taxation levels; the timely receipt of necessary approvals or permits; the ability to meet current and future obligations; the ability to obtain timely financing on reasonable terms when required; the current and future social, economic and political conditions; and other assumptions and factors generally associated with the mining industry. B2Gold's forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management and reflect their current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof. B2Gold does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change other than as required by applicable law. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what benefits or liabilities B2Gold will derive therefrom. For the reasons set forth above, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Non-IFRS MeasuresThis news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""), including ""cash operating costs"" and ""all-in sustaining costs"" (or ""AISC""). Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data presented is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and should be read in conjunction with B2Gold's consolidated financial statements. Readers should refer to B2Gold's Management Discussion and Analysis, available on the Websites, under the heading ""Non-IFRS Measures"" for a more detailed discussion of how B2Gold calculates certain of such measures and a reconciliation of certain measures to IFRS terms.

operating costs per gold ounce’’ and “total cash costs per gold ounce” are common financial performance measures in the gold mining industry but, as non-IFRS measures, they do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measures, along with sales, are considered to be a key indicator of the Company’s ability to generate earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. Cash cost figures are calculated on a sales basis in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per gold ounce sold are derived from amounts included in the statement of operations and include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, smelting, refining, transportation costs, royalties and production taxes, less silver by-product credits. The tables below show a reconciliation of cash operating costs per gold ounce sold and total cash costs per gold ounce sold to production costs as extracted from the annual consolidated financial statements on a consolidated and a mine-by-mine basis (dollars in thousands): For the three months ended December 31, 2023 FekolaMineMasbateMineOtjikotoMineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrandTotal $$$$$$ Production costs82,92143,73337,752164,40617,395181,801Royalties and production taxes20,8916,1855,96633,0421,41834,460 Total cash costs103,81249,91843,718197,44818,813216,261 Gold sold (ounces)128,32153,50075,100256,92118,059274,980 Cash operating costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)646817503640963661 Total cash costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)8099335827691,042786 For the three months ended December 31, 2022 FekolaMineMasbateMineOtjikotoMineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrandTotal $$$$$$ Production costs85,05347,22827,278159,55916,636176,195Royalties and production taxes32,6605,7573,31641,7331,13742,870 Total cash costs117,71352,98530,594201,29217,773219,065 Gold sold (ounces)237,80053,86547,690339,35515,141354,496 Cash operating costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)3588775724701,099497 Total cash costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)4959846425931,174618 For the year ended December 31, 2023 FekolaMineMasbateMineOtjikotoMineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrandTotal $$$$$$ Production costs333,215160,952122,030616,19767,766683,963Royalties and production taxes95,57623,43916,688135,7035,053140,756 Total cash costs428,791184,391138,718751,90072,819824,719 Gold sold (ounces)588,460190,800214,800994,06068,7251,062,785 Cash operating costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)566844568620986644 Total cash costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)7299666467561,060776 For the year ended December 31, 2022 FekolaMineMasbateMineOtjikotoMineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrandTotal $$$$$$ Production costs326,529177,705122,292626,52658,368684,894Royalties and production taxes83,89322,88711,188117,9684,163122,131 Total cash costs410,422200,592133,480744,49462,531807,025 Gold sold (ounces)599,600214,015155,540969,15555,1171,024,272 Cash operating costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)5458307866461,059669 Total cash costs per ounce ($/gold ounce sold)6849378587681,135788 Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced In addition to cash operating costs on a per gold ounce sold basis, the Company also presents cash operating costs on a per gold ounce produced basis.

The original World Gold Council standard became effective January 1, 2014 with further updates announced on November 16, 2018 which were effective starting January 1, 2019. Management believes that the all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce measure provides additional insight into the costs of producing gold by capturing all of the expenditures required for the discovery, development and sustaining of gold production and allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company has applied the principles of the World Gold Council recommendations and has reported all-in sustaining costs on a sales basis. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. B2Gold defines all-in sustaining costs per ounce as the sum of cash operating costs, royalties and production taxes, capital expenditures and exploration costs that are sustaining in nature, sustaining lease expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs, share-based payment expenses related to RSUs/DSUs/PSUs/RPUs, community relations expenditures, reclamation liability accretion and realized (gains) losses on fuel derivative contracts, all divided by the total gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.

The RESPONSE Phase 3 trial data, showing a high percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint of ALP and total bilirubin normalization, suggest that seladelpar could become a leading therapy in the PBC market, especially for patients who have an inadequate response to the current first-line treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).Furthermore, the safety profile of seladelpar appears comparable to placebo, with no serious adverse events linked to the treatment. This is crucial for patient compliance and long-term management of the disease. The New Drug Application (NDA) acceptance by the FDA for priority review and the breakthrough designation previously granted could expedite the availability of seladelpar to patients, potentially altering the current treatment paradigm for PBC. Healthcare Economist The acceptance of seladelpar's NDA for priority review by the FDA, coupled with the breakthrough designation and PRIME status by the EMA, underscores the unmet medical need in the PBC treatment landscape. If approved, seladelpar could command a significant market share, given the drug's potential to offer better efficacy and safety than existing treatments. This could lead to increased healthcare spending in the short term due to the introduction of a novel therapy, but potentially reduce long-term costs associated with the management of PBC complications. Insurers and healthcare providers will need to assess the cost-effectiveness of seladelpar in comparison to existing therapies. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The publication of the Phase 3 trial results in a prestigious journal like The New England Journal of Medicine provides validation for CymaBay Therapeutics' research and development efforts. The market's reaction to such a publication is typically positive, as it not only raises awareness among healthcare professionals but also among investors. The detailed data suggest that seladelpar has a strong efficacy profile, which could lead to a competitive advantage in the market. The potential approval and subsequent market entry of seladelpar could significantly impact CymaBay's financial performance and stock valuation, as the company could capture a new segment of the PBC market, particularly among patients who are intolerant or non-responsive to UDCA. 02/21/2024 - 05:43 PM - Seladelpar demonstrated normalization of liver biomarkers and significant reductions across three measures of patient-reported itch vs. placebo - NEWARK, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBAY), a biopharmaceutical company focused on innovative therapies for patients with liver and other chronic diseases, today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) has published detailed results from the RESPONSE Phase 3 trial evaluating seladelpar, an investigational agent, and the only potent, selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) agonist or delpar, being studied in adults with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Results showed rapid and sustained improvements in reducing cholestasis and liver injury, together with significant reductions in pruritus (itching) across the numerical rating scale (NRS), 5-D Itch Scale, and the PBC-40 questionnaire. Publication of these detailed findings from RESPONSE follows topline data presented as a late breaker at The Liver Meeting® 2023 of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in November 2023. RESPONSE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study of one-year duration that randomized 193 people with PBC in a 2:1 ratio to receive seladelpar 10 mg or placebo, once daily. Eligible participants had an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with alkaline phosphatase, or ALP ≥ 1.67× the upper limit of normal (ULN) after at least 12 months of treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite of ALP and total bilirubin at Month 12, which supported authorization for current second line treatment in PBC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for registrational studies in PBC. The primary endpoint was achieved in 61.7% (79/128) of patients treated with seladelpar vs. 20.0% (13/65) treated with placebo (95% CI 27.7 to 53.4; P<0.001) at Month 12. ""Many people living with PBC do not experience a normalization of ALP or meaningful symptom relief with currently available treatments. Pruritus or severe itch significantly impairs the quality of life of our patients, and current second-line treatment frequently worsens itch. New options, that are potent, effective, and safe, are needed for people living with this chronic debilitating autoimmune condition,"" said Gideon Hirschfield, M.D., Lily and Terry Horner Chair in Autoimmune Liver Disease Research, Toronto Centre for Liver Disease. ""The RESPONSE data are genuinely exciting. The data, together with the existing substantial experience gained from prior studies, robustly support the potential for seladelpar to raise the bar in PBC treatment. In this rigorous international trial, people living with PBC saw substantial rates of normalization of serum liver tests, and clear statistically significant improvement in itch. Benefits were also noted in those people living with compensated cirrhosis."" The key secondary endpoint of ALP normalization was reached in 25.0% (32/128) of patients treated with seladelpar vs. 0.0% for patients treated with placebo (95% CI 18.3 to 33.2; p<0.001). The average decrease in ALP for patients on seladelpar was 42.4% vs. 4.3% for patients on placebo. Compared to placebo, seladelpar reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at Month 12 by 23.5% vs. 6.5% (p=0.003), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) by 39.1% vs. 11.4% (p<0.0001). The study also measured change in patient-reported pruritus as a key secondary endpoint using the daily numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10). Approximately 37.3% of patients enrolled had moderate-to-severe pruritus based on an NRS (0-10) score ≥ 4 at baseline. Improvement in pruritus was seen as soon as Week 4 and significance achieved at Month 6 among patients with baseline NRS > 4 reporting decreases of 3.2 points with seladelpar (n=49) vs. 1.7 for patients on placebo (n=23; least-squares mean difference -1.5 points, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.5; P<0.005). These improvements were sustained through Month 12 (p<0.005). A statistically significant reduction in pruritus was also observed at Month 6 and at Month 12 for patients in the intent-to-treat population, which includes all patients irrespective of their NRS score at baseline. Further, 5D-itch results in both the moderate-to-severe population and overall population, showed significance as early as 4 weeks which continued through Month 12 and had a positive impact on sleep. Similar results demonstrating reductions in itch and improvements in sleep were observed using the PBC-40 questionnaire. Safety as reflected in adverse events (AEs) was similar in the seladelpar-treated and placebo-treated groups. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the study overall (≥10% in either the seladelpar or placebo group) were COVID-19 and pruritus. Consistent with the positive effect of seladelpar on pruritus NRS, pruritus AEs were reported more frequently in participants receiving placebo compared with seladelpar. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 7.0% and 6.2% of seladelpar-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. No SAE occurred in more than one patient, and none were considered to be associated with seladelpar treatment. ""The publication of the pivotal Phase 3 data for seladelpar in The New England Journal of Medicine recognizes the importance of these findings, the potential of this investigational agent to help people living with PBC, and the significant need for innovation in this area,"" said Charles McWherter, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development at CymaBay. ""We are thrilled that these results are now available to benefit researchers, patients, and the broader medical community in our collective pursuit of PBC treatment transformation."" A New Drug Application (NDA) for seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, including pruritus in adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh A) who are inadequate responders or intolerant to UDCA, was accepted for priority review by the FDA in February 2024. This application reflects the updated breakthrough designation that was granted by the agency in October 2023. The company also plans to file marketing authorization applications in the first half of 2024 with the EMA where seladelpar has received Priority Medicines (PRIME) status and plans to file with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). About PBCPBC is a rare, chronic inflammatory liver disease primarily affecting women (1 in 1,000 women over the age of 40 or about 130,000 total people in the U.S.). PBC is characterized by impaired bile flow (known as cholestasis) and the accumulation of toxic bile acids in the liver, leading to inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts within the liver and causing increased levels of ALP, ALT, and GGT, enzymes found primarily in the liver, as well as total bilirubin. The most common early symptoms of PBC are pruritus and fatigue, which can be debilitating for some patients. Progression of PBC is associated with an increased risk of liver-related mortality. About SeladelparSeladelpar, an investigational treatment for people with PBC, is a first-in-class oral, selective PPARδ agonist, or delpar, shown to regulate critical metabolic and liver disease pathways in indications with high unmet medical need. Preclinical and clinical data support its ability to regulate genes involved in bile acid synthesis, inflammation, fibrosis and lipid metabolism, storage, and transport.

Despite challenges, the company focused on efficiency improvements, successfully ramping up the Aripuanã mine towards full capacity by mid-2024. Nexa achieved operational guidance with strong financial discipline, maintaining high metal production and sales. The CEO emphasizes the company's commitment to ESG initiatives for a sustainable future, despite anticipating challenges in the zinc market for 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported full-year net loss of US$289 million juxtaposed with an Adjusted EBITDA of US$391 million for Nexa Resources indicates a complex financial situation. While EBITDA is positive, suggesting operational profitability before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the net loss highlights the substantial costs or write-downs that may not be reflected in the EBITDA figure. Investors should scrutinize the depreciation charges, interest expenses and any one-off items impacting the net result. Moreover, the mention of 'operational guidance' being achieved implies that the company met its forecasted targets, which can be a positive indicator of management's ability to navigate tough market conditions.It's crucial to analyze the company's cash flow statements and balance sheet to understand the liquidity position and long-term solvency, especially when the net loss is significant. The operational discipline and cost efficiency measures could potentially lead to improved margins in the future, but the current net loss may affect investor confidence and the company's ability to raise capital or service debt in the short term. Market Research Analyst The global economic outlook mentioned, particularly concerning zinc prices, can have material implications for Nexa Resources. The anticipated challenging year ahead due to geopolitical instabilities and uncertainties could lead to volatility in metal prices. For a resource company like Nexa, commodity price fluctuations are a critical external factor that can significantly impact revenue and profitability. Investors should be aware of the company's price sensitivity to zinc and how it might affect future earnings.Furthermore, the progress at the Aripuanã mine is a pivotal factor for Nexa's growth prospects. Reaching nameplate capacity, which refers to the full production level that the mine is designed to achieve, by mid-2024 could substantially increase output and revenue. However, any delays or operational issues could pose risks. The company's strategic focus on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) is also noteworthy as it aligns with a broader industry trend towards sustainable practices, which could enhance its reputation and stakeholder relationships in the long run. Environmental Analyst Nexa Resources' emphasis on its ESG commitments reflects a growing trend in the mining sector towards sustainability. The transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy is not just a regulatory requirement but increasingly a competitive advantage. Investors and consumers alike are showing a preference for companies with strong ESG profiles. The company's confidence in its ESG efforts may lead to operational efficiencies and open doors to new environmentally conscious investors.However, the environmental impact of ramping up production at the Aripuanã mine should be carefully considered. Increased production often leads to greater environmental footprints and the company must balance this with its ESG objectives. The ability to coexist with the environment while pursuing business practices may be scrutinized by stakeholders and how well Nexa manages this balance could impact its public perception and, by extension, its market valuation. 02/21/2024 - 06:10 PM Full Year Net Loss of US$289 million and Adjusted EBITDA of US$391 millionLUXEMBOURG / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Nexa Resources S.A. (""Nexa Resources"", ""Nexa"", or the ""Company"") announces today its results for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023.CEO Message - Ignacio Rosado""In 2023, we continued to focus on increasing efficiency across our organization. We deployed several initiatives, which streamlined our cost base and supported our strategic priorities. Significant effort was also made on overcoming the challenges we encountered in the ramp-up of our Aripuanã mine, which is now firmly on track to reach nameplate capacity in mid-2024. We closed the year achieving operational guidance with strong financial and operational discipline despite a very challenging environment. Metal production and sales were at the high-end and mid-range, respectively, while mining and smelting costs were in line.On the ESG front, we hold a strong belief in our commitments, and we are confident that our ongoing efforts will catalyze our journey to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy, fostering a future where our business practices and products seamlessly coexist with the environment.We expect 2024 will likely be another challenging year for zinc price, due to a sluggish global economic growth, mainly driven by geopolitical instabilities and uncertainties about the easing of monetary policy by central banks in key economies. However, we will remain focused on our priorities, including completing the Aripuanã ramp-up, making meaningful progress in the Cerro Pasco integration project, maintaining discipline in capital allocation, and aiming for continued operational efficiency and positive cash flow generation.We firmly believe that the long-term strong fundamentals of our business, together with the unique quality of our assets and the resilient performance culture we are developing will allow us to continue to improve our performance in the coming years. With this aim in mind, we will keep focused on identifying and capturing opportunities and strengthening our execution capabilities, advancing our sustainability agenda, and creating value for all our stakeholders, including the communities in which we operate.""Summary of Financial PerformanceUS$ million (except per share amounts) 4Q23 3Q23 4Q22 2023 2022 Net revenues 630 649 780 2,573 3,034 Gross profit 69 67 84 296 639 Net income (loss) (108) (63) (81) (289) 76 EBITDA (1) 4 67 36 143 650 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (""EPS"") (0.71) (0.56) (0.62) (2.18) 0.37 Adjusted net income (loss) (1) (7) (49) 3 (41) 187 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 105 82 120 391 760 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (1) (0.01) (0.43) (0.04) (0.41) 1.14 Cash provided by operating activities before working capital (1) (2) 96 47 141 315 733 Capex 111 82 116 309 381 Free cash flows (1) 43 14 (20) (41) (246)Total cash (3) 468 422 516 468 516 Net debt (1) 1,269 1,242 1,161 1,269 1,161 Net Debt/LTM Adj.

Working capital in 4Q22 had a negative impact of US$10 million, totaling negative US$235 million in 2022.(3) Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments.Executive SummaryOperational PerformanceZinc production of 90kt in 4Q23 rose by 21% compared to 4Q22, mainly explained by the increase in treated ore volume from all the mines and higher production at the Aripuanã mine. Compared with 3Q23, zinc production increased by 3%, mainly due to the higher volumes from Cerro Lindo, Atacocha, and Morro Agudo, in addition to further production from the Aripuanã ramp-up.Run-of-mine mining cost in 4Q23 was US$48/t, up 3% from 4Q22, mainly explained by higher operational costs and higher variable costs. Compared to 3Q23, run-of-mine mining cost was up 10% due to higher variable costs.Mining cash cost net of by-products1 in 4Q23 increased to US$0.45/lb compared to US$0.20/lb in 4Q22. This increase was primarily due to lower by-products credits from our Peruvian mines with a negative impact of US$0.25/lb, higher operational costs explained by mine development in Cerro Lindo and El Porvenir and higher TCs. Compared to 3Q23, cash cost was up US$0.10/lb due to lower by-products credits from Cerro Lindo and higher operational costs.The smelting segment delivered total production (zinc metal and oxide) of 144kt in 4Q23, down 8% from 4Q22, mainly driven by lower volumes in Cajamarquilla and Três Marias. Compared to 3Q23, production was down 4%, also impacted by lower volumes from these two smelters units.In 4Q23, zinc metal and oxide sales were 143kt, down 14% from 4Q22 following lower production volumes, in addition to a slowdown in demand, particularly for zinc oxide in the period. Compared to 3Q23, metal sales were down 7%, explained by the aforementioned reasons.Smelting conversion cost was US$0.29/lb in 4Q23 compared with US$0.25/lb in 4Q22 explained by higher maintenance and energy costs, and FX impact, which were partially offset by lower personnel costs. Compared to 3Q23, conversion cost was relatively flat.Smelting cash cost1 was US$1.00/lb in 4Q23 compared to US$1.20/lb in 4Q22. This decrease was driven by lower cost of raw materials explained by lower zinc prices, which was partially offset by lower by-products contribution. Compared to 3Q23, cash cost decreased by US$0.01/lb.Financial PerformanceNet revenues in 4Q23 were US$630 million compared with US$780 million in 4Q22. This decrease was mainly due to lower zinc prices and smelting sales volume. Compared to 3Q23, net revenues decreased by 3% due to lower smelting sales volume, which was partially offset by higher zinc prices and higher mining production volumes. In 2023, net revenues amounted to US$2,573 million, down by 15% compared to 2022 due to the aforementioned reasons.In 4Q23, net loss was US$108 million, totaling US$289 million in 2023, resulting in basic and diluted loss per share of US$0.71 and US$2.18, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA2 in 4Q23 was US$105 million, compared with US$120 million in 4Q22 and US$82 million in 3Q23. Compared to 4Q22, the decrease was mainly driven by lower smelting sales volume and zinc prices (zinc down by 17%). Compared to 3Q23, the increase was due to higher zinc LME prices, partially offset by lower smelting sales volume. In 2023, Adjusted EBITDA amounted to US$391 million, down by 49% compared to 2022, mainly due to lower LME metal prices, the impact of Aripuanã's ramp-up and lower smelting sales volume.Adjusted EBITDA for the mining segment in 4Q23 was US$47 million compared with US$40 million in 3Q23. This increase was mainly driven by higher volumes from Cerro Lindo and higher zinc prices. Compared to 4Q22, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 40%.In 2023, Adjusted EBITDA for the mining segment totaled US$149 million, down 66% compared to US$440 million in 2022, mainly driven by lower zinc prices and the impact of the Aripuanã's ramp-up.Adjusted EBITDA for the smelting segment in 4Q23 was US$58 million compared with US$49 million in 3Q23. This increase was mainly driven by higher zinc prices, positive raw material inventory effect (higher inventory consumption in addition to lower raw material costs) and higher by-products contribution, which were partially offset by lower sales volume. Compared to 4Q22, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 27%.In 2023, Adjusted EBITDA for the smelting segment was US$247 million, down 24% compared to 2022, mainly due to lower zinc prices and sales volume, as well as higher operating costs.Adjusted net loss in 4Q23, was US$7 million, totaling US$41 million in 2023. Adjusted net loss attributable to Nexa's shareholders was US$1 million in 4Q23 and US$54 million in 2023, resulting in adjusted basic and diluted loss per share of US$0.01 and US$0.41, respectively. Refer to our ""Net income (loss)"" section for further details.Financial Position, Investments and FinancingTotal cash3 at December 31, 2023, was US$468 million compared to US$516 million at December 31, 2022. Our available liquidity in 4Q23 remained at US$788 million, including our undrawn sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of US$320 million.At December 31, 2023, our free cash flow was negative US$41 million, impacted by the reasons explained above and partially offset by the positive impact of working capital variations of US$101 million, as a result of initiatives deployed throughout the year relating to inventories levels, as well as trade account receivables payment terms. Our investments in sustaining CAPEX (including HS&E investments) amounted to US$309 million, including US$80 million related to Aripuanã. Refer to our ""Net cash flows from operating activities excluding working capital variations and free cash flow - Reconciliation"" section for further details.Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio for the last twelve months (""LTM"") increased to 3.24x compared with 3.06x at the end of September 2023 and 1.53x at the end of 4Q22. This increase was mainly explained by lower LTM Adjusted EBITDA, impacted by the reasons explained above. Total debt slightly increased due to a new US$50 million export financing line effective in 4Q23._________________________________________________________1 Our cash cost net of by-products credits is measured with respect to zinc sold.2 Adjusted EBITDA exclude the items presented in the ""Net income (loss) reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA"" section on page 16 of this earnings release - US$101 million in 4Q23, totaling US$248 million in 2023.3 Cash and cash equivalents and financial investments.Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") and Corporate HighlightsDuring 2023, we advanced the waste dry disposal system on an industrial scale at our Três Marias smelting unit, which consists of filtering the waste pulp for subsequent disposal through the dry stacking process, as waste disposal in this unit was going directly to its tailings deposit. The initiative achieved excellent results, filtering an average of 74% of the operation's material throughout the year. In December 2023, filtration reached more than 90%. And from 2024 onwards, we expect filtration to reach between 95% and 100%.In 2Q23, we obtained the authorization from the Regional Superintendence for the Environment of the State of Minas Gerais to use biofuel to replace fossil fuels, used in all 47 furnaces in the zinc oxide operation in Três Marias. At the end of 2023, we achieved our goal for the year, to expand the use of biofuel to 12 furnaces. This initiative supports our goal to reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions by 20% until 2030.In July 2023, we registered our carbon emissions on ""LMEpassport"", the London Metal Exchange platform which promotes sustainability and transparency across the base metals sector. Nexa's zinc production has one of the lowest carbon footprints recorded in the sector, with an emission intensity of 0.36 tons of CO2 equivalent (scopes 1 and 2) according to the GHG protocol methodology, an achievement that positions Nexa as a global leader in carbon reduction within the zinc industry.In September 2023, Nexa was recognized as a leader in Social Governance and awarded ""Company of the Year - Mining Sector 2023"" by Brasil Mineral (a Brazilian magazine specializing in the mining sector). This recognition was partly in acknowledgement of our training program for 1,987 people in Aripuanã, which focused in giving support to participants to get back into the job market.In October 2023, Nexa announced the successful closing of a US$320 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The applicable margin is subject to compliance with carbon reduction key performance indicators, reflecting the company's unwavering commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. Such efforts are consistent with Nexa's ESG ambitions, targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement.Also in October 2023, Nexa delivered school material kits to more than 2,700 students from schools in the Cajamarquilla region, from kindergarten to high school. This initiative aims to foster local development and contribute to the academic degree of children, embracing our commitment to quality education.In 4Q23, Nexa carried out medical services campaigns benefiting more than 1,600 individuals in the Cerro Pasco region in Peru, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. These campaigns offered General Medicine, Geriatrics, Pediatrics, Gynecology, Dentistry, Ultrasound, Nutrition, Psychology, Laboratory, and Pharmacy. Our support of these medical initiatives reaffirm our commitment to enhance the quality of life and health of the communities in the areas where we operate.In February 2024, CDP (""Carbon Disclosure Project"") concluded its 2023 evaluation for the cycle of the year 2022 and announced that our rating in the Climate Change questionnaire was upgraded, changing from C to B. This result reflects the efforts, disclosure, and transparency of Nexa related to governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, and targets.Nexa declared in February 2023 and paid in March 2023 a distribution to Nexa's shareholders of US$25 million in respect of fiscal 2023.

Supermicro Announces Proposed Offering of $1.5 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029,2024-02-21T22:09:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Super Micro Computer, Inc.

The company will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and business expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Super Micro Computer, Inc. of its intent to offer $1.5 billion in convertible senior notes due 2029, with an additional $225 million option for initial purchasers, is a significant strategic financial move. The use of convertible notes is a hybrid financing option that offers potential cost savings compared to traditional equity financing, as it typically carries lower interest rates than comparable non-convertible debt and defers equity dilution. This move could be indicative of the company's confidence in its future growth prospects, as convertibles are often issued by companies expecting stock price appreciation.The potential impact on the company's stock price due to the capped call transactions should also be noted. These transactions are designed to offset the dilutive effect of the conversion feature of the convertible notes on the common stock. However, the market's reaction to this news could vary as the hedging activities by the option counterparties might influence the stock's volatility in the short term. Investors will be interested in the initial conversion rate and interest rate, which will be determined through negotiations and will significantly affect the attractiveness of these notes.Furthermore, the decision to allocate a portion of the net proceeds towards the cost of entering into capped call transactions, with the remainder for general corporate purposes, indicates a balanced approach to managing the proceeds in a way that supports growth while also attempting to minimize dilution to existing shareholders. Market Research Analyst Supermicro's decision to issue convertible notes can be analyzed within the context of the broader IT solutions market, especially in sectors such as AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, where the company operates. With the tech market's rapid evolution, companies like Supermicro need substantial capital for R&D and to scale their operations. The funds raised could help the company maintain a competitive edge by investing in new technologies and expanding its market share.Given the company's strategic focus on growth areas like AI and cloud computing, the additional capital might enable Supermicro to invest in partnerships, acquisitions, or expand its global footprint. Such expansions could increase the company's long-term revenue potential, but they also come with risks, such as integration challenges and increased competition. Investors will be monitoring how effectively the company deploys the raised capital to ensure it translates into revenue growth and market share gains. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering of convertible notes under Rule 144A is significant as it restricts the sale to 'qualified institutional buyers,' thereby limiting the investor base. This is a common practice for companies looking to raise capital more quickly and with fewer disclosure requirements than a public offering. However, it does mean that retail investors are excluded from participating directly in the offering.The fact that the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and are being offered only through a private offering memorandum, underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in such transactions. Companies must navigate complex securities regulations to ensure that such offerings are conducted lawfully and failure to do so could result in significant legal and financial repercussions. 02/21/2024 - 05:09 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) (“Supermicro” or the “Company”), a Total IT Solution Manufacturer for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are to be offered and sold to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also expects to grant a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The initial conversion rate, interest rate and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of pricing in negotiations with the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more financial institutions which may include one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the “option counterparties”). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of the Convertible Notes by the Company to the extent the Company elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect noteholders’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Company expects to use a portion of net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund working capital for growth and business expansion. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional Convertible Notes to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offer of these securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

All reconciling items are presented on a before-tax basis and adjusted for income taxes in the income tax recovery on adjusted operating earnings adjustments line. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this news release.Suncor's adjusted operating earnings were $1.635 billion ($1.26 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $2.432 billion ($1.81 per common share) in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product realizations reflecting a weaker business environment in the current quarter, and decreased sales volumes in Exploration and Production (E&P), partially offset by lower income taxes, increased sales volumes in Oil Sands and increased refinery production in Refining and Marketing (R&M). Adjusted operating earnings were also impacted by a weakening of benchmark pricing in both periods, resulting in an increased realization of intersegment profit in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.Suncor's net earnings were $2.820 billion ($2.18 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2023, which included a $1.125 billion non-cash gain as a result of the acquisition of TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. (TotalEnergies Canada), compared to $2.741 billion ($2.03 per common share) in the prior year quarter. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted operating earnings, net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the prior year quarter were impacted by the reconciling items shown in the table above.Adjusted funds from operations were $4.034 billion ($3.12 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $4.189 billion ($3.11 per common share) in the prior year quarter, and were influenced by the same factors impacting adjusted operating earnings, as well as one-time tax benefit of approximately $880 million relating to the acquisition of TotalEnergies Canada in the fourth quarter of 2023.Cash flow provided by operating activities, which includes changes in non-cash working capital, was $4.318 billion ($3.34 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $3.924 billion ($2.91 per common share) in the prior year quarter.Suncor's total operating, selling and general (OS&G) expenses were $3.395 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $3.556 billion in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily due to lower commodity costs, primarily natural gas, decreased share-based compensation expenses and the impacts of the sale of the U.K. E&P portfolio. The decrease in OS&G was partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with the company's additional working interests in Fort Hills acquired in the first and fourth quarters of 2023.As at December 31, 2023, Suncor's net debt was $13.678 billion, an increase of $683 million compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to a long-term debt issuance and a net increase in leases associated with the Fort Hills acquisition during the quarter, and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents being partially offset by a decrease in short-term indebtedness.Operating ResultsQ4 Q3 Q4 (mbbls/d, unless otherwise noted)202320232022Total Oil Sands bitumen production 866.2 787.0 810.1 SCO and diesel production 495.6 488.9 531.1 Internally consumed diesel and internal transfers (19.9) (19.6) (13.6)Upgraded production - net SCO and diesel 475.7 469.3 517.5 Bitumen production 327.0 207.7 178.5 Internal bitumen transfers (45.3) (30.9) (7.9)Non-upgraded bitumen production 281.7 176.8 170.6Total Oil Sands production 757.4 646.1 688.1Exploration and Production (mboe/d) 50.7 44.4 75.0Total upstream production (mboe/d) 808.1 690.5 763.1Refinery utilization (%) 98 99 94Refinery crude oil processed 455.9 463.2 440.0 ""Fourth quarter operational performance was exceptionally strong and contained several production records, including record Oil Sands production, record gross production at Fort Hills and the second-highest quarterly upstream production in our company's history,"" said Kruger. ""These results demonstrate how our heightened focus on the fundamentals translates to delivering exceptional performance and meeting our commitments.""Total Oil Sands bitumen production increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the company's increased working interest and strong bitumen production at Fort Hills, partially offset by decreased bitumen production at Oil Sands Base and Firebag, as a result of planned turnaround and maintenance activities.The company's net synthetic crude oil (SCO) production was 475,700 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 517,500 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, reflecting significant planned turnaround activities at Oil Sands Base Upgrader 2 that were completed in the first part of the fourth quarter of 2023. Oil Sands Base upgrader utilization was 83% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 93% in the prior year quarter. Syncrude upgrader utilization was 101% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 99% in the prior year quarter.Internal bitumen transfers reached 45,300 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2023, demonstrating the increased level of integration within Suncor's regional Oil Sands assets. The increase was primarily driven by 41,800 bbls/d of bitumen transferred from Fort Hills to upgrading at Oil Sands Base, taking advantage of the yield uplift from Fort Hills barrels.The company's saleable non-upgraded bitumen production increased to 281,700 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 170,600 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, reflecting the company's increased working interest and strong production at Fort Hills, as well as increased In Situ and Fort Hills bitumen production sent to market in the current quarter due to lower upgrader availability as a result of the planned turnaround at Oil Sands Base Upgrader 2.E&P production during the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the divestment of the company's U.K. portfolio.Refinery crude throughput was 455,900 bbls/d and refinery utilization was 98% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 440,000 bbls/d and 94% in the prior year quarter, reflecting strong utilization across all refineries in the current quarter, and the impact of unplanned maintenance in the prior year quarter. Refined product sales were 575,500 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 548,200 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, with the increase due to higher refinery production, partially offset by a larger build of refined product inventory in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.Corporate and Strategy UpdatesClosed purchase of TotalEnergies' Canadian operations. On November 20, 2023, Suncor completed the acquisition of TotalEnergies Canada, which held the remaining 31.23% working interest in Fort Hills, for $1.468 billion before closing adjustments and other closing costs, making Suncor the sole owner of Fort Hills. The effective date of the transaction was April 1, 2023.Terra Nova return to production. The Terra Nova Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading vessel safely restarted production in the fourth quarter of 2023, with production expected to continue ramping up in the beginning of 2024.Quarterly dividend increase. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Suncor's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.545 per share, an increase of approximately 5% over the prior quarter dividend.Corporate Guidance UpdatesThere have been no changes to the corporate guidance ranges previously issued on December 5, 2023.For further details and advisories regarding Suncor's 2024 corporate guidance, see www.suncor.com/guidance.Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted a notice filed by Suncor to renew its NCIB to purchase the company's common shares through the facilities of the TSX, New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading systems. The notice provides that, beginning February 26, 2024, and ending February 25, 2025, Suncor may purchase for cancellation up to 128,700,000 common shares, which is equal to approximately 10% of Suncor's public float of 1,287,130,400 common shares as of February 12, 2024. On February 12, 2024, Suncor had 1,287,461,183 common shares issued and outstanding. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Suncor. Suncor believes that, depending on the trading price of its common shares and other relevant factors, purchasing its own shares represents an attractive investment opportunity and is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The company does not expect the decision to allocate cash to repurchase shares will affect its long-term strategy. Pursuant to Suncor's previous NCIB, Suncor agreed that it would not purchase more than 132,900,000 common shares between February 17, 2023, and February 16, 2024. Between February 17, 2023, and February 16, 2024, and pursuant to Suncor's previous NCIB, Suncor repurchased 47,106,802 shares on the open market for approximately $2.0 billion, at a weighted average price of $42.87 per share. Subject to the block purchase exemption that is available to Suncor for regular open market purchases under the NCIB, Suncor will limit daily purchases of Suncor common shares on the TSX in connection with the NCIB to no more than 25% (1,970,790 common shares) of the average daily trading volume of Suncor's common shares on the TSX during the previous six-month period (7,883,161 common shares). Purchases under the NCIB will be made through open market purchases at market price, as well as by other means as may be permitted by securities regulatory authorities. Suncor expects to enter into an automatic share purchase plan in relation to purchases made in connection with the NCIB on February 26, 2024.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresCertain financial measures in this news release - namely adjusted funds from operations, adjusted operating earnings, free funds flow and net debt, and related per share or per barrel amounts - are not prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses the information to analyze business performance, leverage and liquidity, as applicable, and it may be useful to investors on the same basis. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Therefore, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures are calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific adjusting items may only be relevant in certain periods.Adjusted Operating EarningsAdjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net earnings for significant items that are not indicative of operating performance. Management uses adjusted operating earnings to evaluate operating performance because management believes it provides better comparability between periods. Adjusted operating earnings are reconciled to net earnings in the news release above.Adjusted Funds From (Used In) OperationsAdjusted funds from (used in) operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts a GAAP measure - cash flow provided by operating activities - for changes in non-cash working capital, which management uses to analyze operating performance and liquidity. Changes to non-cash working capital can be impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, the timing of offshore feedstock purchases and payments for commodity and income taxes, the timing of cash flows related to accounts receivable and accounts payable, and changes in inventory, which management believe reduces comparability between periods.Three months ended December 31Oil SandsExploration and ProductionRefining and MarketingCorporate and EliminationsIncome TaxesTotal($ millions)202320222023202220232022202320222023202220232022Earnings (loss) before income taxes 2 660 1 625 133 578 598 1 517 (1) (182) - - 3 390 3 538Adjustments for: Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment 1 214 1 080 99 130 256 226 29 29 - - 1 598 1 465 Accretion 116 64 15 15 2 2 - - - - 133 81 Unrealized foreign exchange gainon U.S. dollar denominated debt - - - - - - (199) (200) - - (199) (200) Change in fair value of financial instruments and trading inventory (65) 105 (1) (11) (30) (121) - - - - (96) (27) Bargain purchase gain and revaluations (1 125) - - - - - - - - - (1 125) - (Gain) loss on disposal of assets - (5) 8 1 (2) (1) (3) (3) - - 3 (8) Loss on extinguishment of long-term debt - - - - - - - 32 - - - 32 Share-based compensation 30 66 4 5 10 30 24 66 - - 68 167 Settlement of decommissioning and restoration liabilities (70) (61) (24) (2) (16) (11) - (5) - - (110) (79) Other (109) 55 (6) 3 (7) 21 160 (10) - - 38 69 Current income tax recovery (expense) - - - - - - - - 334 (849) 334 (849)Adjusted funds from (used in) operations 2 651 2 929 228 719 811 1 663 10 (273) 334 (849) 4 034 4 189Change in non-cash working capital 284 (265)Cash flow provided by operating activities 4 318 3 924 Twelve months ended December 31Oil SandsExploration and ProductionRefining and MarketingCorporate and EliminationsIncome TaxesTotal($ millions)202320222023202220232022202320222023202220232022Earnings (loss) before income taxes 6 811 5 633 1 691 3 221 3 383 5 694 (1 296) (2 232) - - 10 589 12 316Adjustments for: Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment 4 902 7 927 483 (105) 934 844 116 120 - - 6 435 8 786 Accretion 460 249 64 60 8 8 - (1) - - 532 316 Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) losson U.S. dollar denominated debt - - - - - - (184) 729 - - (184) 729 Change in fair value of financial instruments and trading inventory 27 18 (3) (6) (29) (50) - - - - (5) (38) Bargain purchase gain and revaluations (1 125) - - - - - - - - - (1 125) - (Gain) loss on disposal of assets (39) (7) (600) 66 (28) (11) (325) (3) - - (992) 45 Loss on extinguishment of long-term debt - - - - - - - 32 - - - 32 Share-based compensation 71 139 12 6 25 50 - 133 - - 108 328 Settlement of decommissioning and restoration liabilities (326) (264) (29) (21) (35) (23) - (6) - - (390) (314) Other (56) 136 (6) (43) 10 49 143 (12) - - 91 130 Current income tax expense - - - - - - - - (1 734) (4 229) (1 734) (4 229)Adjusted funds from (used in) operations 10 725 13 831 1 612 3 178 4 268 6 561 (1 546) (1 240) (1 734) (4 229) 13 325 18 101Change in non-cash working capital (981) (2 421)Cash flow provided by operating activities 12 344 15 680 Free Funds FlowFree funds flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by taking adjusted funds from operations and subtracting capital expenditures, including capitalized interest.

Any figure presented in boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one bbl of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.To view a full copy of Suncor's fourth quarter 2023 Report to Shareholders and the financial statements and notes (unaudited), visit Suncor's profile on sedarplus.ca or sec.gov or visit Suncor's website at suncor.com/financialreports.

(NTR) increases quarterly dividend by approximately two percent to US$0.54 per share, equating to an annualized dividend of US$2.16 per share. The Board also approves the purchase of up to five percent of Nutrien's common shares through a normal course issuer bid (NCIB). Dividend payments will be made in either Canadian dollars or US dollars based on shareholder residency and intermediary participation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Nutrien Ltd. of a quarterly dividend increase and the initiation of a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase up to five percent of its outstanding shares is a strategic financial decision. The dividend increase, albeit modest at approximately two percent, signals confidence in the company's earnings stability and cash flow generation. This is often perceived positively by the market as it suggests a sustainable and potentially growing return on investment for shareholders.The NCIB is an important event as it indicates that the company believes its shares are undervalued and it is using its capital to buy back shares, which can be accretive to earnings per share over the long term. This can also be a signal to the market that the company's management is focused on creating shareholder value. The repurchase program can potentially support the stock price by reducing the supply of shares available in the market, thus creating a positive impact on the share price, all else being equal. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the dividend policy and share repurchase program announced by Nutrien Ltd. may influence investor sentiment and the company's stock market performance. Dividend increases are often used by companies to attract income-focused investors, which can lead to a broadening of the investor base. Additionally, the share repurchase program could be seen as a strategic move to improve key financial ratios such as earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE), which are closely watched by analysts and investors.It is also noteworthy that the dividend will be paid in local currency based on shareholder residence, with an option to change the payment currency. This flexibility caters to international investors and can affect the company's attractiveness to a global investor pool. The direct deposit option for dividend payments and currency election reflects Nutrien's commitment to accommodating shareholder preferences and streamlining the distribution process. Tax Expert For shareholders, the classification of dividends as eligible dividends under subsection 89(14) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) is significant. Eligible dividends are entitled to a more favorable tax treatment in the form of an enhanced dividend tax credit for Canadian residents. This tax efficiency is an important consideration for investors when assessing the after-tax return on their investment. Investors, particularly those in higher tax brackets, often favor companies that issue eligible dividends due to the tax advantages.For U.S. and international shareholders, the tax implications of these dividends can be different and may involve foreign tax credits or withholding taxes, depending on the investor's country of residence and tax treaties in place. This adds a layer of complexity to the investment decision-making process, as the net benefit of the dividend can vary significantly based on the investor's tax situation. 02/21/2024 - 05:27 PM SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nutrien Ltd.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024.","Kodiak Gas Services, Inc. Announces Receipt of Consents to the Merger Agreement from Supporting Unitholders Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Kodiak Gas Services, Inc. and CSI Compressco LP announce approval of Merger Agreement by majority unitholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement of the Merger Agreement between Kodiak Gas Services, Inc. and CSI Compressco LP is a significant event that warrants a close examination of its implications on the companies' financial health and market positioning. The merger's approval by a majority of the Partnership's unitholders, representing approximately 54% of the outstanding common units, is a critical milestone, indicating strong support from key stakeholders.From a financial perspective, the merger could result in operational synergies, which might manifest as cost savings, increased efficiency, or enhanced market reach. These synergies, if realized, could potentially lead to improved profitability and shareholder value over the long term. However, the immediate costs associated with mergers, such as legal fees, restructuring costs and integration expenses, can impact short-term financial performance. Investors should closely monitor the merger's progress and the companies' subsequent financial statements for indications of these effects.Additionally, the expectation of closing the transaction in the second quarter of 2024, pending Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, presents a timeline for stakeholders to anticipate changes in stock performance. The clearance is an antitrust regulatory requirement, ensuring that the merger does not lead to reduced competition. A smooth clearance process would likely be viewed favorably by the market, while any regulatory hurdles could create uncertainty and volatility in the stock prices of the involved companies. Market Research Analyst Exploring the market dynamics, the merger between Kodiak and the Partnership can be seen as a strategic move to consolidate market presence in the gas services industry. The combined entity may benefit from a broader service offering and a larger customer base, potentially leading to increased market share. Market consolidation trends are common in mature industries, where companies seek to gain competitive advantages through scale and scope of operations.It is essential to consider the potential impact on customers and competitors. A merger of this size could alter the competitive landscape, prompting responses from other industry players. For instance, competitors may engage in strategic partnerships or seek to innovate to maintain their market positions. Customers could benefit from more comprehensive service offerings but may also face reduced options if the merger leads to less competition. Market research will be vital in understanding the post-merger industry structure and competitive dynamics. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of the merger, particularly the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, play a pivotal role in the transaction's progression. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act requires parties to file pre-merger notifications and observe a waiting period for antitrust review. This process is designed to prevent anticompetitive mergers that could harm consumers by reducing competition.Legal scrutiny of the merger will focus on market concentration metrics and the potential for the combined entity to exert undue market power. The fact that the merger has reached the consent stage from a majority of unitholders suggests that due diligence has been conducted to anticipate and address antitrust concerns. However, the outcome of the regulatory review is not guaranteed and unexpected legal challenges could arise, delaying the merger or imposing conditions on its completion.Stakeholders should be aware of the legal context surrounding the merger, as any issues that surface during the Hart-Scott-Rodino review could have material consequences for the timing and terms of the transaction. Close attention to regulatory announcements and legal analyses will be crucial in assessing the merger's likelihood of success and its conformance with industry norms. 02/21/2024 - 04:45 PM MONTGOMERY, Texas and THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kodiak Gas Services, Inc.

Gerard Bond, President and CEO of OceanaGold, said ""I am pleased to share the updated Mineral Reserves and Resources estimates for the Company, including at Haile, where we were able to increase Horseshoe reserves and declare an initial reserve estimate of 380,000 ounces at Palomino. The opening and successful delivery of ore from the Horseshoe underground at Haile last year was a pivotal milestone for the Company. With growth in the Horseshoe reserve and the addition of Palomino to reserves, the projected longevity and profitability of the Haile mine is strengthened. Additionally, I am delighted by the increase in Indicated resources at Wharekirauponga in New Zealand, which now exceeds one million ounces and with a grade increase to 15.9 g/t, demonstrating how truly exceptional this deposit is. Our updated reserves and resources estimates continue to provide a strong base for organic growth in the coming years and I am excited about what our exploration programs will bring in 2024 and beyond.""

New Zealand reserves use 0.70 NZD/USD exchange rate.Reported estimates of contained metal are not depleted for processing losses.For underground reserves, cut-offs applied to diluted grades.For Haile Open Pit, the primary cut-off grade is 0.5 g/t Au whilst oxide material is assigned a 0.6 g/t Au cut-off grade.For Haile Underground, the cut-off is 1.87 g/t Au, with adjacent lower grade stopes included in the reserves based on an incremental stope cut-off grade of 1.74 g/t Au.For Didipio, gold equivalence (AuEq) is based upon the presented gold and copper prices as well as processing recoveries. AuEq = Au g/t + 1.37 x Cu%.For Didipio, the 18.0 Mt open pit stockpile inventory includes 5.3 Mt of low-grade stocks mined at an approximate 0.27 g/t AuEq cut-off.For Didipio Underground, incremental stopes proximal to development already planned to access main stoping areas are reported to a lower cut-off of 0.76 g/t AuEq.For Macraes Underground, Frasers Underground cut-off is 1.28 g/t Au whilst Golden Point Underground cut-off is 1.35 g/t Au.For Martha Underground, the cut-off for previously unmined stoping areas is 2.6 g/t Au, increasing to 3.1 g/t Au for stoping areas in close proximity to remnant workings.Mineral Reserves increased year-over-year at Haile, due to increases in the Haile underground, where additions were made at Horseshoe and the first Mineral Reserve estimate for Palomino was declared. Further details, including a detailed mine plan for Haile, is expected to be released in an updated technical report in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") by March 31, 2024. The technical report will include both Palomino and Horseshoe underground mines, with first ore from Palomino expected in 2027. The Company is also advancing a trade-off study on the potential option to mine Ledbetter phase 4 from underground as compared to the current plan to mine as an open pit. If the underground option is deemed to improve the economic value of the mine, this could result in the removal of lower-margin Mineral Reserves at Haile. The Macraes Future Options work was completed in 2023, as outlined in the 2022 Mineral Reserves and Resources statement. The work concluded that the Round Hill Open Pit did not generate sufficient economic return on capital, and therefore was removed from Mineral Reserves in 2023, which resulted in a 0.5 Moz reduction in reserves at Macraes. This was partially offset by the reserve additions mentioned above that contributed to a consolidated 0.31 Moz decrease in Mineral Reserves across the Company. An updated NI 43-101 technical report for Macraes is expected to be completed by March 31, 2024. The team is also focused on identifying potential additional ore sources that could extend mine life at gold prices above the current $1,500/oz Mineral Reserve price assumption.

Waihi Open Pit resources reported within a pit design limited by infrastructural considerations. Haile Open Pit resources reported within reserve design pit.Underground resources for Didipio, Horseshoe at Haile, and Frasers and Golden Point at Macraes, are reported within volumes guided by optimised stope designs. Underground resources for Palomino at Haile and Martha and Wharekirauponga at Waihi are reported within optimised stope designs based upon economic assumptions above.Haile Open Pit primary cut-off 0.50 g/t Au, oxide cut-off 0.60 g/t Au. Palomino resources and Horseshoe resources at a 1.55 g/t Au cut-off.For Didipio Open Pit, only stockpiles remain. These include 5.3 Mt of low grade at 0.27 g/t AuEq. Underground resources reported at a 0.67 g/t AuEq cut-off between the 2,460mRL and 1,920mRL with gold equivalence (AuEq) cut-off based on presented gold and copper prices. AuEq = Au g/t + 1.39 x Cu %.Waihi: Martha Underground at a 2.15 g/t Au cut-off, Wharekirauponga at a 2.5 g/t Au cut-off, Martha Open Pit at a 0.5 g/t Au cut-off and Gladstone Open Pit at a 0.56 g/t Au cut-off. The year-over-year decrease of 0.28 Moz was largely due to mining depletion across the operations and the previously mentioned removal of Round Hill Open Pit at Macraes. The decreases were offset by gains from conversion of Inferred material at Waihi (Wharekirauponga and Martha Underground), Haile (Horseshoe and Palomino), Macraes (Golden Point Underground), and Didipio (Figure 2).

(see OGC News Release here). The remaining 0.9 Moz decrease is due to the successful drilling conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources at Didipio, Haile (Horseshoe and Palomino) and Waihi (Wharekirauponga and Martha Underground) (Figure 3).

About OceanaGold OceanaGold is a growing intermediate gold and copper producer committed to safely and responsibly maximizing the generation of Free Cash Flow from our operations and delivering strong returns for our shareholders. We have a portfolio of four operating mines: the Haile Gold Mine in the United States of America; Didipio Mine in the Philippines; and the Macraes and Waihi operations in New Zealand. Notes to Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources EstimatesAll Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources were estimated as at December 31, 2023 and have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. All tonnage, grade and contained metal content estimates have been rounded; rounding may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content. Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimation of Mineral Resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.

Equitrans Midstream Announces Pricing of Private Offering of Senior Notes,2024-02-21T22:27:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Equitrans Midstream Corporation (ETRN) announces pricing of $600 million senior notes offering by its subsidiary EQM Midstream Partners, LP. The Notes will be used to repay outstanding debt and for general partnership purposes.","Equitrans Midstream Announces Pricing of Private Offering of Senior Notes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Equitrans Midstream Corporation (ETRN) announces pricing of $600 million senior notes offering by its subsidiary EQM Midstream Partners, LP. The Notes will be used to repay outstanding debt and for general partnership purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Equitrans Midstream Corporation regarding the pricing of a $600 million senior notes offering at 6.375% due in 2029 is a significant financial move. This action is indicative of the company's strategy to manage its debt profile. The decision to issue these notes at par shows confidence in the stability and demand for the company's debt instruments among qualified institutional buyers. However, the high-interest rate compared to current treasury yields suggests a premium is being paid by Equitrans for the risk investors are taking on, likely reflecting the company's credit rating and market perception.Investors and analysts should note that the use of proceeds to repay existing debt can be a positive signal, as it may improve the company's debt-to-equity ratio and potentially lower interest expenses in the long term. Nevertheless, the impact on the company's financial health will depend on the terms of the existing debt and the potential savings from lower interest payments. In the short term, the transaction is likely to be neutral to slightly positive for the stock, as it does not directly affect the company's operations but could improve financial ratios and reduce future refinancing risk. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering of the senior notes is noteworthy due to its structure and compliance with securities regulations. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which implies that they are being offered through exemptions that limit their sale to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons. This approach is commonly used in private placements to streamline the issuance process and avoid the more comprehensive disclosure requirements of a public offering.It is critical for investors to understand that the restrictions on the sale of these securities mean that there is a more limited secondary market, which can affect liquidity and pricing. The reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S for the sale of these notes indicates that Equitrans is targeting a specific investor base that is capable of evaluating and bearing the investment risk without the need for the same level of public disclosure as a registered offering. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the issuance of senior notes by Equitrans Midstream Corporation reflects ongoing trends in the energy sector, where companies often rely on debt financing to manage capital-intensive projects and operations. The interest rate set for these notes is a barometer of the risk perceived by the market and can be compared against offerings by similar companies in the midstream oil and gas industry.In terms of market dynamics, the appetite for such debt offerings provides insight into investor confidence in the energy sector and the creditworthiness of companies like Equitrans. A successful closing of this offering could signal to the market that there is robust demand for energy sector debt, which may encourage similar transactions by other firms. Conversely, any difficulties in closing could reflect market hesitations about the sector or the company's financial position, potentially influencing the stock's performance and investor sentiment. 02/21/2024 - 05:27 PM CANONSBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equitrans Midstream Corporation (NYSE: ETRN) (ETRN) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, EQM Midstream Partners, LP (EQM), has priced an offering of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% senior notes due 2029 (the Notes). The Notes will be issued at a price of par. EQM intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay certain outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under EQM’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2018, as amended, and for general partnership purposes. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the offering is expected to close on February 26, 2024. The offering of the Notes has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

The acquisition of Florida City Gas contributed to a 9% growth in adjusted net income. Despite warmer temperatures impacting customer consumption, the company delivered its 17th consecutive year of record earnings. Positive Chesapeake Utilities' adjusted gross margin increased by $33.9 million in 2023, driven by regulatory initiatives, natural gas growth, and pipeline expansion projects. However, warmer temperatures led to a reduction in EPS and adjusted EPS for the full year and fourth quarter. The FCG acquisition added incremental earnings growth. The acquisition of Florida City Gas for $923.4 million in cash significantly impacted the company's financial results for 2023. Adjusted net income excluding FCG transaction-related expenses grew by 9% compared to 2022. The company aims to achieve EPS of $6.15-$6.35 by 2025. The company's 2024 guidance includes an EPS range of $5.33-$5.45, reflecting the impact of integrating FCG. Capital expenditure guidance for 2024 is set at $300 million to $360 million. Long-term EPS guidance for 2025 and 2028 remains at $6.15-$6.35 and $7.75-$8.00 per share, respectively. Chesapeake Utilities uses non-GAAP financial measures like Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS to provide investors with a clearer understanding of its performance. The company's operating income increased by 5.5% in 2023, driven by improved gross margins and operational efficiencies. Negative Warmer temperatures negatively impacted customer consumption and reduced EPS and adjusted EPS for both the full year and fourth quarter. Increased interest expenses due to higher rates on short-term borrowings and the issuance of new senior notes and common shares for the FCG acquisition added to operating costs. Lower adjusted gross margin from reduced customer consumption in northern service territories offset some of the gains from regulatory initiatives and pipeline expansion projects. Financial Analyst The reported full-year earnings for 2023 and the subsequent acquisition of Florida City Gas (FCG) signify strategic corporate actions that can potentially influence Chesapeake Utilities Corporation's financial standing and shareholder value. The acquisition is a capital-intensive move, costing $923.4 million and has a direct bearing on the company's earnings per share (EPS). The reported adjusted EPS of $5.31, representing a 5.4% increase over the previous year, reflects operational efficiency and the ability to mitigate the impact of warmer temperatures and increased interest expenses.From an investment standpoint, the EPS growth and the integration of FCG into the company's portfolio suggest a positive outlook on the company's earnings potential. The addition of FCG's customer base and infrastructure to Chesapeake's regulated energy segment could lead to increased market penetration and economies of scale, which are critical factors for long-term growth. Furthermore, the guidance for 2024 and 2025, projecting an EPS of $5.33-$5.45 and $6.15-$6.35 respectively, indicates confidence in the company's strategic direction and operational capabilities. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is highly sensitive to regulatory changes and weather patterns, both of which have been highlighted in the report. The approval from the Florida Public Service Commission for a $23.3 million increase in base revenue for FCG and the introduction of new rates, including the RSAM, are regulatory factors that can significantly impact the profitability of energy companies. The warmer temperatures reducing customer consumption illustrate the environmental factors at play. Such external factors must be monitored closely as they can swiftly alter market dynamics and profitability.It is also worth noting the company's focus on organic growth and pipeline expansion projects, which are indicative of a proactive approach to capitalizing on market opportunities. The company's performance, despite challenges such as rising interest rates, underscores its resilience and the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives. Investors may find the company's ability to consistently deliver record earnings, as evidenced by the 17th consecutive year of such performance, to be a reassuring sign of stability and potential for continued growth. Economist The acquisition's impact on the company's capital structure, particularly the issuance of new senior notes and common shares, is an important consideration for long-term financial planning. The increased interest expense due to higher rates on short-term borrowings reflects the broader economic environment of rising interest rates. These financial maneuvers can influence the company's leverage and liquidity, which are crucial for maintaining financial health and pursuing further growth opportunities.Moreover, the capital expenditure guidance of $300 million to $360 million for 2024, with a five-year projection of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, indicates an aggressive investment in infrastructure and growth projects. This level of capital investment is significant and suggests a focus on expanding the company's operational capacity and market reach. The projected EPS growth rate of approximately 8% from the current guidance for 2025 and an 8.5% growth rate since 2018, reflects an optimistic view of the company's future performance in a competitive energy market. 02/21/2024 - 04:45 PM Full Year 2023 earnings per share (""EPS"")* was $4.73, including transaction-related expenses attributable to the acquisition of Florida City Gas (""FCG"") of $0.58 per share, compared to $5.04 per share in 2022Adjusted EPS**, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, was $5.31 for the year ended 2023, or an increase of 5.4 percent over 2022EPS for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.26, including transaction-related expenses of $0.38 per share, versus $1.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 Adjusted EPS** for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 12 percent to $1.64 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022Adjusted gross margin** increased by $33.9 million during the year driven by regulatory initiatives, natural gas organic growth and continued pipeline expansion projects, increased propane margins and fees and incremental margin from FCGSignificantly warmer than normal temperatures impacted customer consumption throughout 2023, lowering both EPS and Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.54 per share for the full year and $0.14 for the fourth quarterDOVER, Del., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE: CPK) (""Chesapeake Utilities"" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for the year and the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company's acquisition of FCG was completed on November 30, 2023, and the financial results of FCG have been included from the acquisition date. For 2023, adjusted net income**, which excludes transaction-related expenses related to the acquisition of FCG, was $97.8 million compared to $89.8 million in 2022, representing approximately 9 percent growth. Adjusted EPS** for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.31 compared to $5.04 per share reported in the prior-year, representing growth of more than 5 percent. Full year earnings were driven by contributions from the Company's regulatory initiatives, organic growth in the Company's natural gas distribution businesses and continued pipeline expansion projects, increased propane margins and fees, and contributions from FCG. These improvements were partially offset by significantly warmer weather in some of our service territories throughout the year, increased interest expense attributable to higher rates on our short-term borrowings, and the impact of new senior notes and common shares issued in connection with the FCG acquisition. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's adjusted net income was $33.1 million, compared to $26.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.64 per share, compared to $1.47 per share reported in the same prior-year period, representing growth of approximately 12 percent. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 were primarily driven by the factors discussed for the full year, with enhanced margin contributions during the quarter partially offset by reduced customer consumption compared to the prior-year period and lower adjusted gross margin from virtual pipeline services. ""In 2023, Chesapeake Utilities delivered its 17th year of consecutive record earnings, excluding transaction costs related to our Florida City Gas acquisition, despite rising interest rates and significantly warmer temperatures,"" commented Jeff Householder, chairman, president and CEO. ""Our team executed on all fronts, with our legacy businesses continuing to make growth investments, advance regulatory initiatives and prudently manage expenses. Our regulated natural gas distribution businesses gained customers at more than twice the national average, we executed on several opportunities to expand our natural gas transmission systems, and our non-regulated businesses also contributed meaningfully. In November, we successfully completed the FCG acquisition and immediately began to integrate the business, which will drive significant incremental earnings growth, as we deploy our operational and regulatory expertise on a broader scale. Our collective efforts resulted in year-to-date Adjusted EPS of $5.31 versus 2022 EPS of $5.04, largely driven by incremental adjusted gross margin of $33.9 million."" ""Our performance in 2023, coupled with the expected contribution of FCG and validation of our financial models for 2024, reinforces our commitment to achieving our 2025 guidance of $6.15-$6.35 per share. We are also introducing guidance of $5.33-$5.45 per share for 2024, which will be a transitional year as we begin to realize the impact of our FCG integration efforts. Across the organization, we remain committed to delivering on the attractive opportunities across our growth platforms, including executing on the incremental opportunities driven by FCG, achieving another record year of performance and driving increased shareholder value,"" concluded Householder. Acquisition of Florida City Gas On November 30, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of FCG for $923.4 million in cash, including working capital adjustments, pursuant to the previously disclosed stock purchase agreement with Florida Power & Light Company. Upon completion of the acquisition, FCG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included within the Company's Regulated Energy segment. FCG serves approximately 120,000 residential and commercial natural gas customers across eight counties in Florida, including Miami-Dade, Broward, Brevard, Palm Beach, Hendry, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River. Its natural gas system includes approximately 3,800 miles of distribution main and 80 miles of transmission pipe. Results for FCG are included within the Company's consolidated results from the acquisition date. In June 2023, FCG received approval from the Florida Public Service Commission (""PSC"") for a $23.3 million total increase in base revenue in connection with its May 2022 rate case filing. The new rates, which became effective as of May 1, 2023, included the transfer of its Safety, Access, and Facility Enhancement (""SAFE"") program provisions from a rider clause to base rates, an increase in rates associated with a liquefied natural gas facility, and approval of FCG's proposed reserve surplus amortization mechanism (""RSAM"") with a $25.0 million reserve amount. The RSAM is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued removal costs on the balance sheet, with a corresponding increase or decrease to depreciation and amortization expense. Capital Investment and Earnings Guidance Because of the significance of the FCG acquisition, the Company is providing annual guidance for 2024, the first full year as a combined company. The Company expects to generate EPS of $5.33 to $5.45 per share in 2024 given the investment opportunities within and surrounding FCG, incremental margin opportunities present across the Company's value chain, regulatory initiatives, operating synergies and other factors. The Company is also affirming its previously announced 2024 capital expenditure guidance of $300 million to $360 million. From a longer-term EPS perspective, the Company is also reaffirming its 2025 EPS guidance range of $6.15 to $6.35, as well as the 2028 EPS guidance range of $7.75 to $8.00 per share. This would imply an EPS growth rate of approximately 8 percent from the current 2025 EPS guidance range, or since 2018, an 8.5 percent growth rate. The Company continues to support its previously introduced capital expenditure guidance for the five-year period ended 2028 that will range from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. *Unless otherwise noted, EPS and Adjusted EPS information is presented on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP Financial Measures **This press release including the tables herein, include references to both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") and non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS. A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future performance that includes or excludes amounts, or that is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. Our management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. The Company calculates Adjusted Gross Margin by deducting the purchased cost of natural gas, propane and electricity and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue-producing activities from operating revenues. The costs included in Adjusted Gross Margin exclude depreciation and amortization and certain costs presented in operations and maintenance expenses in accordance with regulatory requirements. The Company calculates Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS by deducting costs and expenses associated with significant acquisitions that may affect the comparison of period-over-period results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions, and provide investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the Company under allowed rates for regulated energy operations and under the Company's competitive pricing structures for unregulated energy operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing a business unit's and the overall Company performance. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in a different manner. The following tables reconcile Gross Margin, Net Income, and EPS, all as defined under GAAP, to our non-GAAP measures of Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for each of the periods presented.

Excluding transaction-related expenses associated with the acquisition of FCG, operating income increased $18.2 million or 12.8 percent compared to the prior year. Adjusted gross margin during 2023 was positively impacted by regulatory initiatives, organic growth in the Company's natural gas distribution businesses and continued pipeline expansion projects, increased propane margins and fees and contributions from FCG. These increases were partially offset by a $13.6 million reduction in adjusted gross margin from reduced customer consumption resulting from the significantly warmer temperatures in our northern service territories throughout the year. Higher operating expenses were largely associated with increased employee costs driven by growth initiatives, the ongoing competitive labor market and higher benefits costs compared to the prior-year period. Increases in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to growth projects that were placed into service during the current year were offset by reductions related to revised depreciation rates approved in the Company's Florida Natural Gas rate case and electric depreciation study filing, and a $5.1 million RSAM adjustment from FCG.

Excluding transaction-related expenses associated with the acquisition of FCG, operating income increased $10.8 million or 25.2 percent compared to the same period in 2022, despite warmer temperatures in the Company's northern service territories during the quarter. Adjusted gross margin during the quarter was positively impacted by regulatory initiatives, organic growth in the Company's natural gas distribution businesses and continued pipeline expansion projects, increased propane margins and fees, and contributions from FCG. These increases were partially offset by a $3.9 million reduction in adjusted gross margin from reduced customer consumption attributable to intra-period weather volatility experienced in our northern service territories during the quarter. Also offsetting the increase in adjusted gross margin were higher employee costs driven by growth initiatives, the ongoing competitive labor market and higher benefits costs. Depreciation and amortization expense during the fourth quarter of 2023 includes the effects of the revised depreciation rates approved in the Company's Florida Natural Gas rate case and electric depreciation study filing, and the $5.1 million RSAM adjustment from FCG.

Recently Completed and Ongoing Major Projects and Initiatives The Company constantly pursues and develops additional projects and initiatives to serve existing and new customers, further grow its businesses and earnings, and increase shareholder value. The following table includes the major projects and initiatives recently completed and currently underway. Major projects and initiatives that have generated consistent year-over-year adjusted gross margin contributions are removed from the table at the beginning of the next calendar year. The discussion of the Company's major projects accompanying this table, includes those projects which began generating adjusted gross margin in the current year, or those which are expected to contribute adjusted gross margin beginning in future years. A comprehensive discussion of all projects reflected below can be found in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's practice is to add new projects and initiatives to this table once negotiations or details are substantially final and/or the associated earnings can be estimated.

Discussion of Major Projects and Initiatives Pipeline Expansions Southern ExpansionEastern Shore installed a new natural gas driven compressor skid unit at its existing Bridgeville, Delaware compressor station that provides 7,300 Dts/d of incremental firm transportation pipeline capacity. The project was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2023. Beachside Pipeline ExpansionIn June 2021, Peninsula Pipeline and FCG entered into a Transportation Service Agreement for an incremental 10,176 Dts/d of firm service in Indian River County, Florida, to support Florida City Gas' growth along the Indian River's barrier island. As part of this agreement, Peninsula Pipeline constructed approximately 11.3 miles of pipeline from its existing pipeline in the Sebastian, Florida area east under the Intercoastal Waterway and southward on the barrier island. The project was completed and went into service in April 2023. Subsequent to the acquisition of FCG, the agreement is now an affiliate agreement. North Ocean City ConnectorDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company began construction of an extension of service into North Ocean City, Maryland. The Company's Delaware natural gas division and its subsidiary, Sandpiper Energy, Inc. installed approximately 5.4 miles of pipeline across southern Sussex County, Delaware to Fenwick Island, Delaware and Worcester County, Maryland. The project reinforces the Company's existing system in Ocean City, Maryland and enables incremental growth along the pipeline. Construction of this project was completed in the second quarter of 2023. The Company filed a natural gas rate case application with the PSC for the state of Maryland in January 2024 as discussed below. Adjusted gross margin in connection with this project is contingent upon the completion of the rate case and inclusion of the project in rate base. St. Cloud / Twin Lakes ExpansionIn July 2022, Peninsula Pipeline filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreement with the Company's Florida subsidiary, Florida Public Utilities (""FPU""), for an additional 2,400 Dts/day of firm service in the St. Cloud, Florida area. As part of this agreement, Peninsula Pipeline constructed a pipeline extension and regulator station for FPU. The extension supports new incremental load due to growth in the area, including providing service, most immediately, to the residential development Twin Lakes. The expansion also improves reliability and provides operational benefits to FPU's existing distribution system in the area, supporting future growth. Construction is complete and the project went into service in July 2023. Wildlight ExpansionIn August 2022, Peninsula Pipeline and FPU filed a joint petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreement associated with the Wildlight planned community located in Nassau County, Florida. The project enables the Company to meet the significant growing demand for service in Yulee, Florida. The agreement allows the Company to build the project during the construction and build-out of the community, and charge the reservation rate as each phase of the project goes into service. Construction of the pipeline facilities will occur in two separate phases. Phase one consists of three extensions with associated facilities, and a gas injection interconnect with associated facilities. Phase two will consist of two additional pipeline extensions. Various phases of the project commenced in the first quarter of 2023, with construction on the overall project continuing through 2025. Lake WalesIn February 2023, Peninsula Pipeline filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreement with the Company's Florida natural gas distribution business, FPU, for an additional 9,000 Dt/d of firm service in the Lake Wales, Florida area. The PSC approved the petition in April 2023. Approval of the agreement enabled Peninsula Pipeline to complete the acquisition of an existing pipeline in May 2023 that is being utilized to serve the Company's current and new natural gas customers. NewberryIn April 2023, Peninsula Pipeline filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreement with FPU for an additional 8,000 Dt/d of firm service in the Newberry, Florida area. The petition was approved by the Florida PSC in the third quarter of 2023. Peninsula Pipeline will construct a pipeline extension, which will be used by FPU to support the development of a natural gas distribution system to provide gas service to the City of Newberry. A filing to address the acquisition and conversion of propane community gas systems in Newberry was made in November 2023, and the Florida PSC is scheduled to vote on this in March 2024. The Company anticipates beginning the conversions of the community gas systems in the second quarter of 2024. Worcester Resiliency UpgradeIn August 2023, Eastern Shore filed an application with the FERC requesting authorization to construct the Worcester Resiliency Upgrade, which consists of a mixture of storage and transmission facilities in Sussex County, DE and Wicomico, Worcester, and Somerset Counties in Maryland. The project will provide long-term incremental supply necessary to support the growing demand of the participating shippers. Eastern Shore has requested certificate authorization by December 2024, with a target in-service date by the third quarter of 2025. East Coast Reinforcement ProjectsIn December 2023, Peninsula Pipeline filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreements with FPU for projects that will support additional supply to communities on the East Coast of Florida. The projects are driven by the need for increased supply to coastal portions of the state that have experienced an increase in population growth. Peninsula Pipeline will construct several pipeline extensions which will support FPU's distribution system in the areas of Boynton Beach and New Smyrna Beach with an additional 15,000 Dts/day and 3,400 Dts/day, respectively. The Florida PSC is scheduled to vote on the projects in March 2024. Central Florida Reinforcement ProjectsIn February 2024, Peninsula Pipeline filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of its Transportation Service Agreements with FPU for projects that will support additional supply to communities located in Central Florida. The projects are driven by the need for increased supply to communities in central Florida that have experienced an increase in population growth. Peninsula Pipeline will construct several pipeline extensions which will support FPU's distribution system in the areas of Plant City and Lake Mattie with an additional 5,000 Dts/day and 8,700 Dts/day, respectively. CNG/RNG/LNG Transportation and Infrastructure The Company has made a commitment to meet customer demand for CNG, RNG and LNG in the markets we serve. This has included making investments within Marlin Gas Services to be able to transport these products through its virtual pipeline fleet to customers. To date, the Company has also made an infrastructure investment in Ohio, enabling RNG to fuel a third-party landfill fleet and to transport RNG to end use customers off its pipeline system. Similarly, the Company announced in March 2022, the opening of a high-capacity CNG truck and tube trailer fueling station in Port Wentworth, Georgia. As one of the largest public access CNG stations on the East Coast, it will offer a RNG option to customers in the near future. The Company constructed the station in partnership with Atlanta Gas Light, a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. The Company is also involved in various other projects, all at various stages and all with different opportunities to participate across the energy value chain. In many of these projects, Marlin will play a key role in ensuring the RNG is transported to one of the Company's many pipeline systems where it will be injected. The Company includes its RNG transportation services and infrastructure related adjusted gross margin from across the organization in combination with CNG and LNG projects. As new projects are finalized, we will provide additional detail on those projects at that time. Discussed below is a current project in which we are in the construction phase: Full Circle DairyIn February 2023, the Company announced plans to construct, own and operate a dairy manure RNG facility at Full Circle Dairy in Madison County, Florida. The project consists of a facility converting dairy manure to RNG and transportation assets to bring the gas to market. The first injection of RNG is projected to occur in the first half of 2024. Regulatory Initiatives Florida Gas Utility Access and Replacement Directive (""GUARD"") ProgramIn February 2023, FPU filed a petition with the Florida PSC for approval of the GUARD program. GUARD is a ten-year program to enhance the safety, reliability, and accessibility of portions of the Company's natural gas distribution system. The Company identified various categories of projects to be included in GUARD, which include the relocation of mains and service lines located in rear easements and other difficult to access areas to the front of the street, the replacement of problematic distribution mains, service lines, and maintenance and repair equipment and system reliability projects. In August 2023, the Florida PSC approved the GUARD program, which included $205 million of capital expenditures projected to be spent over a 10-year period. FCG SAFE ProgramIn June 2023, the Florida PSC issued the approval order for the continuation of the SAFE program beyond its 2025 expiration date and inclusion of 150 miles of additional mains and services located in rear property easements. The SAFE program is designed to relocate certain mains and facilities associated with rear lot easements to street front locations to improve FCG's ability to inspect and maintain the facilities and reduce opportunities for damage and theft. In the same order, the Commission approved a replacement of 160 miles of pipe that was used in the 1970s and 1980s and shown through industry research to exhibit premature failure in the form of cracking. The program includes projected capital expenditures of $205 million over a 10-year period. Maryland Natural Gas Rate CaseIn January 2024, the Company's natural gas distribution businesses in Maryland, CUC-Maryland Division, Sandpiper Energy, Inc., and Elkton Gas Company (collectively, ""Maryland natural gas distribution businesses"") filed a joint application for a natural gas rate case with the Maryland PSC. In connection with the application, we are seeking approval of the following: (i) permanent rate relief of approximately $6.9 million; (ii) authorization to make certain changes to tariffs to include a unified rate structure and to consolidate the Maryland natural gas distribution businesses under the new corporate entity which we anticipate will be called Chesapeake Utilities of Maryland, Inc.; and (iii) authorization to establish a rider for recovery of the costs associated with our new technology systems. The outcome of the application is subject to review and approval by the Maryland PSC. Other Major Factors Influencing Adjusted Gross Margin Weather and ConsumptionWeather had a significant impact on adjusted gross margin during 2023, driven largely by significantly warmer weather in some of the Company's service territories resulting in reduced consumption. This resulted in adjusted gross margin being negatively impacted by approximately $13.6 million compared to 2022. The following table summarizes HDD and CDD variances from the 10-year average HDD/CDD (""Normal"") for the year and quarter-to-date periods ended December 31, 2023 compared to the respective 2022 periods.

On the Delmarva Peninsula, a larger percentage of the adjusted gross margin growth was generated from residential growth given the expansion of gas into new housing communities and conversions to natural gas as our distribution infrastructure continues to build out. In Florida, as new communities continue to build out due to population growth and the additional infrastructure to support the growth, there is increased load from both residential customers as well as new commercial and industrial customers. The details on adjusted gross margin attributable to customer growth for our legacy natural gas distribution operations are provided in the following table: Adjusted Gross Margin** For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands) DelmarvaPeninsula Florida (1) Customer growth: Residential $ 1,895 $ 1,599 Commercial and industrial 589 2,131 Total customer growth $ 2,484 $ 3,730 (1) Customer growth amounts for our legacy Florida operations include the effects of revised rates associated with the Company's natural gas base rate proceeding, but exclude the effects of the FCG acquisition. Capital Investment Growth and Capital Structure Updates The Company's capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, which includes $923.4 million attributable to the purchase of FCG and $3.9 million related to an acquisition in the propane distribution business.

Actual capital requirements may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors, including changing economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, capital delays that are greater than currently anticipated, customer growth in existing areas, regulation, new growth and availability of capital. Historically, actual capital expenditures have typically lagged behind the forecasted amounts. See ""Capital Investment and Earnings Guidance"" discussed above for additional information on our capital expenditure forecast. The Company's target ratio of equity to total capitalization, including short-term borrowings, is between 50 and 60 percent. The Company's equity to total capitalization ratio, including short-term borrowings, was approximately 47 percent as of December 31, 2023 and included the impacts associated with financing the FCG acquisition.

Jacobson, co-chief executive officer of The Jacobson Group. “We’re seeing a shift in how companies are viewing their staffing plans, making the Q1 findings incredibly relevant to insurance leaders.” “Companies appear to be in more of a holding pattern around staffing plans for the first half of 2024, as they evaluate growth plans and anticipate greater efficiency gains from technology improvements,” added Jeff Rieder, partner at Aon and head of STG Performance Benchmarking. Some of the study’s key findings include the following: In the next 12 months, 52% of insurance carriers plan to increase staff and 38% plan to maintain their current staff size. Technology, underwriting and claims roles are the industry’s greatest need. Seventy-seven percent of companies expect to grow revenue during the next 12 months; this is 5 points higher than the July 2023 study. During the next six months, 76% of companies expect most employees in the office at least one day a week (hybrid). Just 6% require employees in the office every day. Recruiting difficulty has eased in five of the study’s 11 categories; however, most positions remain at least moderately difficult to fill. Actuarial, executive and analytics roles are the most challenging. If carriers follow through on their plans, the industry will see a 1.21% increase in employment during the next 12 months.

Collecting revenue and hiring projections from carriers across all sectors of the industry, it provides a valuable look at the insurance labor market outlook and hiring trends.

(NYSE: CSV) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Company Highlights: Exceeded full year 2023 guidance ranges for total revenue, adjusted consolidated EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, driven by strong fourth quarter performance;5.2% growth in total revenue over the prior year quarter and 3.3% growth over the prior full year;Preneed sales deliver 16.1% growth in cemetery operating revenue over the prior year quarter and 13.5% growth over the prior full year;41.6% increase in GAAP net income and 41.5% increase in diluted earnings per share over the prior year quarter;Founder and Executive Chairman, Mel Payne, to transition to special advisor to the Board of Directors;The Board of Directors concludes the previously announced review of strategic alternatives; andManagement announces 2024 outlook. Carlos Quezada, Vice Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased to announce our strong fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Total revenue grew by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year, despite the COVID “pull forward” impact resulting in modest declines in funeral contract volume experienced during the year. This success in growing our top line stems from our targeted efforts to better leverage our pricing power, which drove improved average revenue per contract, in addition to our preneed cemetery sales team’s exceptional performance, which resulted in a surge in preneed cemetery sales production of 25.0% for the fourth quarter and 19.6% for the full year. This increase in revenue, coupled with disciplined cost management, resulted in a year-over-year increase in adjusted consolidated EBITDA of 3.5%, and a significant 13.2% growth over the prior year quarter, which also included margin expansion of 230 basis points. This momentum, marking four out of five consecutive quarters of solid performance, instills confidence and excitement in our core initiatives as we advance into 2024 and focus on fulfilling our new purpose statement, which is ‘Creating premier experiences through innovation, empowered partnership, and elevated service.’ For those interested in learning more, we invite you to explore our newly launched website and discover our refreshed Carriage image, which aligns with our vision of the Carriage of the future,” concluded Mr. Quezada.

Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $4.9 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a 23.6% increase in the number of preneed interment rights (property) sold, a 1.2% increase in the average price per interment right sold and a 0.7% increase in the average revenue per funeral contract, offset by a 3.3% decrease in the funeral contract volume.Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $12.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a 9.4% increase in the average price per preneed interment right sold, an 8.6% increase in the number of preneed interment rights (property) sold and a 0.9% increase in the average revenue per funeral contract, offset by a 2.4% decrease in the funeral contract volume.Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $3.4 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in profit contribution from our businesses and a $2.9 million decrease in loss on divestitures, disposals and impairment charges, offset by a $1.4 million increase in interest expense and a $1.1 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses.Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $8.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as the $5.1 million increase in profit contribution from our businesses was offset by a $10.4 million increase in interest expense and a $4.7 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses. MEL PAYNE TRANSITIONS TO ADVISORY ROLE After 32 years of founding and building Carriage, Mel Payne, has chosen to step down from his role as Executive Chairman of the Board and transition to a new role as special advisor to the Board of Directors, which will allow him to be available and share his wealth of knowledge and insights with the Board of Directors and the senior leadership team. Mel will continue as a member of the Board until his current term expires at the May 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. Mel, who served as Carriage’s only CEO and Chairman of the Board for the Company’s first 32 years, started with a vision in 1991 that was born out of a very personal and impactful experience he had following the loss of a loved one. He turned that experience and vision into a team of more than 2,700 employees and 200 businesses, all driven by a collective mission of serving families during the most challenging time of their lives. “Next to my family, Carriage has been and continues to be, the greatest love of my life. The friendships I have made over the years are priceless, and watching the growth and development of so many wonderful leaders throughout the organization has been a true highlight of my career. I have complete confidence in Carlos’ vision and ability to lead Carriage into its next chapter of growth, and, as still a large shareholder, I will be cheering on the team and offering support,” stated Mr. Payne. “Mel has built a special company and is one of the true pioneers in this profession. He has handpicked an incredibly talented senior leadership team, and the Board is excited for the future of Carriage and our stockholders,” stated Lead Independent Director, Don Patteson. CONCLUSION OF REVIEW OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES The Board of Directors (the “Board”) has concluded the Company’s strategic review process, first announced on June 29, 2023, which was overseen by the Board with assistance from experienced financial and legal advisors. The Board has unanimously determined that continuing to execute on the Company’s strategic plan as an independent, public company is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at this time. In this regard, the Board’s determination took into account positive trends described above in the Company’s financial and operating results toward the end of 2023. The Board remains committed to maximizing stockholder value. While the Company received a number of proposals for transactions involving the Company in the course of the strategic review process, following a thorough review and evaluation of the proposals and alternatives available to the Company, the Board concluded that none of those proposals would be in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Board endorsed the Company’s continued execution of its standalone business plans as an independent publicly held company under the leadership of Carlos Quezada as CEO, Steve Metzger as President and Kian Granmayeh as CFO, as well as leadership from the Company’s Board, which added three talented new directors during the summer of 2023. OUTLOOK FOR 2024 The Company’s 2024 outlook incorporates previously stated organic growth initiatives around preneed sales, both in the cemetery and funeral businesses, and expected cost discipline while the Company continues to deleverage the balance sheet. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects to close two transactions to divest certain non-core businesses, reducing 2024 revenue and field EBITDA by ~$5.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively – the 2024 Outlook reflects the expected impact of these two divestitures. 2024 Outlook(1)(in millions - except per share amounts) Total revenue$380 - $390Adjusted consolidated EBITDA$112 - $118Adjusted diluted EPS$2.20 - $2.30Adjusted free cash flow$55 - $65 (1)Includes two transactions to divest certain non-core businesses.

financial measures to present the financial performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe the Non-GAAP results are useful to investors to compare our results to previous periods, to provide insight into the underlying long-term performance trends in our business and to provide the opportunity to differentiate ourselves as the best consolidation platform in the industry against the performance of other funeral and cemetery companies. Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures are also provided in this earnings release. The Non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and the definitions of them used by the Company for our internal management purposes in this earnings release are described below. Special items are defined as charges or credits included in our GAAP financial statements that can vary from period to period and are not reflective of costs incurred in the ordinary course of our operations. The change in uncertain tax reserves was not tax effected. Special items were taxed at the operating tax rate.Adjusted net income is defined as net income after adjustments for special items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Adjusted net income margin is defined as adjusted net income as a percentage of total revenue.Consolidated EBITDA is defined as operating income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock compensation and net loss on divestitures, disposals and impairment charges. Consolidated EBITDA margin is defined as consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.Adjusted consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated EBITDA after adjustments for acquisition expenses, severance and separation costs, litigation reserves, disaster recovery and pandemic costs and other special items. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.Adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, adjusted by special items as deemed necessary, less cash for maintenance capital expenditures, which include facility repairs and improvements, equipment, furniture and vehicle purchases and information technology infrastructure improvements. Adjusted free cash flow margin is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue.Funeral operating EBITDA is defined as funeral gross profit, plus depreciation and amortization and regional and unallocated costs, less financial EBITDA, ancillary EBITDA and divested EBITDA related to the Funeral Home segment. Funeral operating EBITDA margin is defined as funeral operating EBITDA as a percentage of funeral operating revenue.Cemetery operating EBITDA is defined as cemetery gross profit, plus depreciation and amortization and regional and unallocated costs, less financial EBITDA and divested EBITDA related to the Cemetery segment. Cemetery operating EBITDA margin is defined as cemetery operating EBITDA as a percentage of cemetery operating revenue.Preneed cemetery sales production is defined as cemetery property, merchandise and services sold prior to death.Financial EBITDA is defined as financial revenue, less the related expenses. Financial revenue and the related expenses are presented within Other revenue and Other expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Financial EBITDA margin is defined as financial EBITDA as a percentage of financial revenue.Ancillary revenue is defined as revenues from our ancillary businesses, which include a flower shop, a monument company, a pet cremation business and our online cremation businesses. Ancillary revenue and the related expenses are presented within Other revenue and Other expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.Ancillary EBITDA is defined as ancillary revenue, less expenses related to our ancillary businesses noted above. Ancillary EBITDA margin is defined as ancillary EBITDA as a percentage of ancillary revenue.Divested revenue is defined as revenues from certain funeral home and cemetery businesses that we have divested.Divested EBITDA is defined as divested revenue, less field level and financial expenses related to the divested businesses noted above. Divested EBITDA margin is defined as divested EBITDA as a percentage of divested revenue.Overhead expenses are defined as regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs and general, administrative and other costs, excluding home office depreciation and non-cash stock compensation.Adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS) is defined as GAAP basic earnings per share, adjusted for special items.Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items. Funeral Operating EBITDA and Cemetery Operating EBITDA Our operations are reported in two business segments: Funeral Home operations and Cemetery operations. Our operating level results highlight trends in volumes, revenue, operating EBITDA (the individual business’ cash earning power/locally controllable business profit) and operating EBITDA margin (the individual business’ controllable profit margin). Funeral operating EBITDA and cemetery operating EBITDA are defined above. Funeral and cemetery gross profit is defined as revenue less “field costs and expenses” — a line item encompassing these areas of costs: i) funeral and cemetery field costs, ii) field depreciation and amortization expense, and iii) regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs. Funeral and cemetery field costs include cost of service, funeral and cemetery merchandise costs, operating expenses, labor and other related expenses incurred at the business level. Regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs presented in our GAAP statement consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our regional leadership, incentive compensation opportunity to our field employees and other related costs for field infrastructure. These costs, while necessary to operate our businesses as currently operated within our unique, decentralized platform, are not controllable operating expenses at the field level as the composition, structure and function of these costs are determined by executive leadership in the Houston Support Center. These costs are components of our overall overhead platform presented within consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA. We do not directly or indirectly “push down” any of these expenses to the individual business’ field level margins. We believe that our “regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs” are necessary to support our decentralized, high performance culture operating framework, and as such, are included in consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA, which more accurately reflects the cash earning power of the Company as an operating and consolidation platform. Usefulness and Limitations of These Measures When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, our total EBITDA, consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical consolidated and business level performance and operating results. We believe our presentation of adjusted consolidated EBITDA, a key metric used internally by our management, provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Our total field EBITDA, consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Our presentation is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Funeral operating EBITDA, cemetery operating EBITDA, financial EBITDA, ancillary EBITDA and divested EBITDA are not consolidated measures of profitability. Our total field EBITDA excludes certain costs presented in our GAAP statement that we do not allocate to the individual business’ field level margins, as noted above. Consolidated EBITDA excludes certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. A reconciliation to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for additional information and are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, all of which are reflected in the tables below.

Despite revenue decline and decreased earnings, the company maintained a healthy net leverage ratio and continued investment in growth initiatives. Positive Acquired three businesses in Q4 2023, including Norlen, TSA, and Hudson Tool Steel Corporation. Published the 2023 Sustainability Report and announced a dividend increase for the first quarter of 2024. Maintained a net leverage ratio of 1.7x and generated $365 million in operating cash flow for the full year 2023. Completed second year of investment cycle with cumulative investments of $422 million and returns to shareholders of $209 million since 2022. Revenue declined by 10.8% in Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023, with a net income of $26 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $26 million. Gross margin expanded to 22.2% in Q4 2023, driven by LIFO income, but contracted to 16.9% excluding LIFO. Net income attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation was $25.8 million in Q4 2023, with diluted earnings per share of $0.74. Debt increased to $436.5 million in Q4 2023, with net debt of $382.2 million and a leverage ratio of 1.7x. Paid dividends of $0.72 per share for full year 2023 and repurchased 3.3 million shares, returning $113.9 million to shareholders. Outlook for Q1 2024 includes expected revenue range of $1.21 to $1.25 billion and Adjusted EBITDA range of $58 million to $62 million. Negative Revenue declined by 19.2% for full year 2023 compared to 2022. Net income attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation decreased by 62.7% for full year 2023 compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO, declined by 60.3% for full year 2023 compared to 2022. Gross margin contracted to 16.9% in Q4 2023, excluding LIFO. Net debt increased by 16.3% in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter. Share repurchase authorization remains with $39.4 million available out of $100.0 million. Full-year industry stainless volumes corrected down by 14% in 2023. End-market volumes decreased across most segments in 2023, except for commercial ground transportation and oil & gas. Fourth quarter volumes decreased due to holiday seasonality and ongoing destocking across non-ferrous product lines. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Ryerson Holding Corporation indicate a mixed performance with both positive and negative elements. The company's strategic acquisitions and consistent dividend increases underscore a commitment to growth and shareholder returns. However, this is juxtaposed against a backdrop of declining revenues and shipped tonnage year-over-year (YoY) and quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which could be a cause for concern among investors.The increase in gross margin is a positive sign, suggesting improved cost management or value-added services that could mitigate the impact of lower revenues. Yet, the contraction of gross margin excluding LIFO (Last In, First Out accounting method), along with increased warehousing and administrative expenses, suggests that efficiency gains may be offset by other cost pressures. The rise in debt levels and net debt is notable, but the company's leverage ratio remains within its target range, implying a managed approach to debt financing.Overall, the company's financial health appears stable with a strong liquidity position, evidenced by a global liquidity of $656 million. Nonetheless, the decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO, raises questions about the sustainability of current dividend levels and share repurchase activities in the longer term, especially in the context of a slowing manufacturing sector and potential headwinds in the industrial metals market. Market Research Analyst Ryerson's performance reflects broader trends in the industrial metals sector, where slowing manufacturing activity can significantly impact demand. The company's acquisitions, such as Norlen Incorporated and TSA Processing, are likely aimed at diversifying its product offerings and consolidating its market position. These strategic moves are critical for maintaining competitiveness, especially given the reported declines in industry stainless volumes and nickel prices.The company's focus on modernization and expansion, including the ERP system conversion and the opening of new service centers, indicates a long-term strategy to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience. These investments, while potentially beneficial for future profitability, may place short-term strain on cash flows and margins.Given the cyclical nature of the industry, Ryerson's belief in positioning itself for an anticipated industry upturn could be a prudent strategy, provided that the company can effectively manage the balance between investment in growth and maintaining financial resilience during industry downturns. Economist The reported results from Ryerson Holding Corporation offer insights into the economic forces at play within the industrial metals sector. The YoY and QoQ declines in revenue and tons shipped may be indicative of macroeconomic headwinds, such as reduced industrial production or shifts in global trade dynamics. The significant downturn in Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO, suggests that the company is not immune to these pressures despite its strategic initiatives.The company's investment in organic growth initiatives and acquisitions, while forward-looking, must be carefully balanced against the potential for continued economic softening. The impact of such investments on the company's financials will be critical to monitor, particularly in light of the company's increased debt and net leverage ratio.Ryerson's outlook for the first quarter of 2024, with expected increases in customer shipments and average selling prices, offers a cautiously optimistic view. However, the reliance on seasonal demand conditions and the absence of expected LIFO income in the first quarter suggest that the company's near-term performance will be closely tied to market fluctuations and inventory management strategies. 02/21/2024 - 07:14 PM Quarterly business highlights include three acquisitions and tenth consecutive increase in quarterly dividend. Results include strong cash flow generation and continued investment in organic growth initiatives, including the University Park, Illinois service center.

Management CommentaryEddie Lehner, Ryerson's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Reflecting on the fourth quarter, and full-year 2023, I want to start by thanking my Ryerson teammates for prioritizing operating safely throughout our entire organization as safety is always our first priority. As far as our over-all business performance, 2023 marked the second year of Ryerson's longest and most significant investment cycle in more than a generation. We are taking big steps to create our next-generation operating model and the industry's best customer experience. Over the past year, we invested in the modernization, integration and expansion of our network of interconnected intelligent service centers, highlighted by an Enterprise Resource Planning (""ERP"") conversion across our largest business unit, new and expanding facilities at Centralia, WA, University Park, IL, Las Vegas, NV, and Shelbyville, KY, as well as welcoming four excellent additions to the Family of Companies in BLP Holdings, LLC, Norlen Incorporated, TSA Processing, and Hudson Tool Steel Corporation. We finished the year with approximately two-thirds of our operating cash flow allocated to growth-oriented projects while increasing our dividend over four consecutive quarters and buying back approximately $114 million of Ryerson shares for the full-year. Over the fourth quarter and the entire year, as we carried out our investments in modernization, integration, and expansion, our business operated against a backdrop of slowing manufacturing activity. You could say the sun wasn't shining on our addressable markets as full-year industry stainless volumes corrected down 14% and nickel traded down by more than 40%, while other industrial metal-consuming verticals to which we have less exposure performed better, such as automotive, aerospace, defense and non-residential construction. Fourth quarter volumes decreased across most of our end-markets due to holiday seasonality and ongoing destocking across non-ferrous product lines. For the full-year 2023, our end-market volumes mainly increased in our commercial ground transportation and oil & gas end-markets, while decreasing across most other industrial and consumer end-markets. Despite moving through a counter-cyclical bottom across the majority of our commercial book of business, we continue to believe that our aforementioned investments in our next-gen operating model will position us to deliver higher thru-the-cycle earnings to our shareholders with less volatility as we inflect to an anticipated industry upturn as well as expected longer-term secular growth drivers in North American manufacturing."" Fourth Quarter ResultsRyerson generated revenue of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.8% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Revenue during the period was influenced by seasonally lower volumes and easing average selling prices, which decreased 5.9% to 450,000 tons and 5.2% to $2,472 per ton, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin expanded sequentially by 220 basis points to 22.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 20.0% in the third quarter. Gross margins reflected LIFO income of $59.3 million, as average inventory costs were impacted by decreases in commodity price for our metals products sales mix. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 17.3% in the third quarter. The compression in gross margins, excluding LIFO, was primarily driven by a decrease in prices of our aluminum and stainless-steel product mix due to above normal inventories in the channel that put downward pressure on average selling prices. Warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.5% to $203.7 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $193.0 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher depreciation expense, increased operating expenses from recent acquisitions, as well as reorganization expenses related to our ERP system conversion and start-up costs associated with the University Park, Illinois service center, partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses, lower delivery expenses, and lower fixed and variable operating expenses. Net income attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $25.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $35.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share in the previous quarter. Ryerson generated Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $45.0 million. For the full-year 2023, Ryerson generated $5.1 billion in revenue and earned $145.7 million in net income and $231.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO. Liquidity & Debt ManagementRyerson generated $90.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, supported by net income attributable to Ryerson Holding of $25.8 million and working capital release of $15.1 million. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $436.5 million of debt and $382.2 million of net debt, an increase of $69.5 million and $54.4 million, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Ryerson's leverage ratio as of the fourth quarter was 1.7x, which remains within the Company's target leverage range. Ryerson's global liquidity, composed of cash and cash equivalents and availability on its revolving credit facilities, was $656 million as of December 31, 2023. Shareholder Return Activity Dividends. On February 21, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1875 per share of common stock, payable on March 21, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Ryerson paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.1850 per share, amounting to a cash return of approximately $6.3 million. For the full-year 2023, Ryerson paid dividends of approximately $0.72 per share, which resulted in a return of $24.8 million to shareholders. Share Repurchase. Ryerson repurchased 219,614 shares for $6.3 million in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2023. Ryerson made these repurchases in accordance with its share repurchase authorization, which allows the Company to acquire up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of the Company's common stock through April of 2025. For the full-year 2023, the Company repurchased 3.3 million shares, resulting in a return of $113.9 million to shareholders. As of December 31, 2023, $39.4 million of the $100.0 million remained under the existing share repurchase authorization. Outlook CommentaryFor the first quarter of 2024, Ryerson expects normal seasonal demand conditions, with customer shipments expected to increase approximately 8% to 10%, quarter-over-quarter. The Company anticipates first-quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.25 billion, with average selling prices increasing 1% to 3%. LIFO income in the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be zero. We expect Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO in the range of $58 million to $62 million and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.24 to $0.34.

Adjusted EBITDA gives further effect to, among other things, reorganization expenses, gain on sales of assets, gain or loss on retirement of debt, benefit plan curtailment gain, purchase consideration and other transaction costs, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), provides useful information to investors regarding our operational performance because they enhance an investor's overall understanding of our core financial performance and provide a basis of comparison of results between current, past, and future periods. We also disclose the metric Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), to provide a means of comparison amongst our competitors who may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), are three of the primary metrics management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of our business without the effect of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, expenses, revenues, and gains (losses) that are unrelated to the day to day performance of our business. We also establish compensation programs for our executive management and regional employees that are based upon the achievement of pre-established EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), targets. We also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), to benchmark our operating performance to that of our competitors. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), do not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), is necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements. This release also presents gross margin, excluding LIFO expense (income), which is calculated as gross profit minus LIFO expense (income), divided by net sales. We have excluded LIFO expense (income) from gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales metrics in order to provide a means of comparison amongst our competitors who may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories as we do. Our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), gross margin, excluding LIFO expense (income), and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), as a percentage of sales may differ from that of other companies.

The company's focus on operational efficiency and customer relationships led to significant revenue growth and new contract awards. Despite positive financial highlights, Valaris experienced a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to capital expenditures and share repurchases. Positive Strong financial performance with net income of $829 million and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million. Contract backlog increased to over $3.9 billion, a nearly 60% rise from the previous year. Revenue efficiency reached 93% in the quarter and 96% for the year. New contracts and extensions worth more than $1.4 billion were awarded in the fourth quarter. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $636 million due to capital expenditures and share repurchases. Negative Decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $1.1 billion to $636 million. General and administrative expenses remained consistent at $24 million. Revenue from other sources decreased to $41 million from $46 million in the previous quarter. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $829 million for Valaris Limited, which includes a substantial tax benefit of $790 million, marks a significant increase from the previous quarter. This remarkable jump, largely due to changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, signals a potential one-time event rather than an operational trend. Investors should note the Adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, which provides a clearer picture of the company's operating performance by excluding non-cash and irregular items. The 44% increase in Adjusted EBITDA from the previous quarter suggests improved operational efficiency and cost management. However, the capital expenditures surge to $463 million, primarily for new drillship deliveries, indicates aggressive capital reinvestment which could affect free cash flow in the short term but may be justified if it enhances long-term earnings capacity.The increase in total contract backlog to over $3.9 billion demonstrates strong market demand and could provide revenue stability. The share repurchase program expansion to $600 million reflects management's confidence in the company's valuation and future cash flows. However, investors should scrutinize the balance between returning capital to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities, particularly in a cyclical industry like offshore drilling. Market Research Analyst Valaris' strategic positioning in securing contracts at higher market rates and successfully reactivating rigs aligns with the broader industry trend of increasing demand for offshore drilling services. The multi-year drillship contracts and jackup contracts across diverse geographical locations underscore the company's broad customer base and operational reach. The reported revenue efficiency of 93% for the quarter and 96% for the year is impressive, indicating effective management and reliable operations, which are critical factors for clients in the energy sector.Furthermore, the company's focus on returning future free cash flow to shareholders suggests an attractive proposition for investors. However, it is essential to consider the volatility of the oil and gas market, which can impact day rates and contract stability. The reported nearly 60% increase in contract backlog year-over-year provides a buffer against market downturns and positions Valaris favorably for the anticipated upcycle in the industry. Energy Sector Analyst The reported operational highlights from Valaris indicate a robust upturn in the offshore drilling sector, which has been recovering from previous downturns. The delivery of newbuild drillships and the recognition of VALARIS 110 as Rig of the Year reflect the company's commitment to maintaining a modern and competitive fleet. The sector is highly sensitive to oil price fluctuations and the current upcycle presents opportunities for companies like Valaris to capitalize on higher day rates and longer contract durations.Valaris' emphasis on operational performance and efficiency, as evidenced by their high revenue efficiency, is a critical factor in maintaining a competitive edge. The industry's move towards more technologically advanced and efficient rigs may also drive demand for Valaris' services. However, the significant capital expenditures for newbuild drillships could strain cash reserves and the company's ability to manage this while still rewarding shareholders will be critical to its financial health and stock performance. 02/21/2024 - 07:56 PM HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Valaris Limited (NYSE: VAL) (""Valaris"" or the ""Company"") today reported fourth quarter 2023 results. President and Chief Executive Officer Anton Dibowitz said, “We continue to execute on our operating leverage by repricing rigs from legacy day rates to meaningfully higher market rates and successfully delivering reactivated rigs with attractive contracts. At the same time, we remain laser focused on delivering high levels of operational performance to our customers, as evidenced by another strong year of revenue efficiency.” Dibowitz added, “During the fourth quarter, we were awarded new contracts and extensions with associated contract backlog of more than $1.4 billion. These awards include two multi-year drillship contracts at leading-edge day rates and several jackup contracts across the North Sea, Australia and Trinidad, demonstrating the depth of our customer relationships, track record of operational delivery and broad-based strength of the market.” Dibowitz concluded, “We remain confident in the strength and duration of this upcycle and the outlook for Valaris is positive. We expect to deliver significant earnings and cash flow growth over the next few years and we intend to return all future free cash flow to shareholders unless there is a better or more value accretive use for it.” Financial and Operational Highlights Net income of $829 million (including tax benefit of $790 million), Adjusted EBITDA of $58 million and Adjusted EBITDAR of $96 million; Delivered revenue efficiency of 93% during the quarter and 96% for the year; VALARIS DS-8 commenced a contract offshore Brazil late in the quarter, following its reactivation; VALARIS 110 received TotalEnergies' and North Oil Company's global jackup Rig of the Year award; Awarded new contracts and extensions with associated contract backlog of more than $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter; Increased total contract backlog to more than $3.9 billion as of February 15, 2024, representing a nearly 60% increase from twelve months ago; Took delivery of newbuild drillships VALARIS DS-13 and DS-14; Repurchased $50 million of shares during the fourth quarter and $200 million during the year; Valaris Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company's share repurchase program to $600 million from $300 million in February 2024; ARO Drilling took delivery of newbuild jackup Kingdom 1, and the rig started its maiden contract, during the fourth quarter. Fourth Quarter Review Net income increased to $829 million from $17 million in the third quarter 2023. Net income for the fourth quarter 2023 included a tax benefit of $790 million discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $58 million from $40 million in the third quarter primarily due to more operating days across the fleet and lower reactivation expense. Adjusted EBITDAR increased to $96 million from $91 million in the third quarter. Revenues increased to $484 million from $455 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, revenues increased to $453 million from $427 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to more operating days across the fleet, including for drillship VALARIS DS-17 that commenced a contract in early September, following its reactivation, and jackup VALARIS 107, which started a contract early in the fourth quarter after being idle for most of the third quarter. Contract drilling expense increased to $402 million from $391 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense increased to $374 million from $369 million in the third quarter primarily due to the increase in operating days mentioned above. This was partially offset by lower reactivation expense and lower repair and maintenance expense for the jackup fleet. Depreciation expense increased to $28 million from $26 million in the third quarter 2023. General and administrative expense of $24 million was in line with the third quarter 2023. Other income decreased to $0 million from $11 million in the third quarter 2023. This was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses during the quarter compared to gains in the third quarter and an increase in interest expense associated with a $400 million debt issuance that was completed in the third quarter. Tax benefit was $790 million compared to tax expense of $11 million in the third quarter 2023. The fourth quarter tax provision included $800 million of tax benefit due to changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased to $636 million as of December 31, 2023, from $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to capital expenditures and share repurchases, partially offset by positive operating cash flow. Capital expenditures increased to $463 million from $106 million in the third quarter 2023 primarily due to the Company exercising options to take delivery of newbuild drillships VALARIS DS-13 and DS-14 for an aggregate purchase price of $337 million during the quarter. Fourth Quarter Segment Review Floaters Floater revenues increased to $263 million from $243 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, revenues increased to $247 million from $232 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to more operating days for VALARIS DS-17, which commenced its contract with Equinor offshore Brazil in early September, following its reactivation. This was partially offset by fewer operating days for VALARIS DS-12 due to mobilization and a brief shipyard visit between contracts. Contract drilling expense increased to $226 million from $215 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense increased to $211 million from $206 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to more operating days for VALARIS DS-17, partially offset by lower reactivation expense. Jackups Jackup revenues increased to $179 million from $166 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, revenues increased to $170 million from $155 million in the third quarter primarily due to more operating days for VALARIS 107, 249 and Norway, all of which incurred some idle time during the third quarter. This was partially offset by fewer operating days for VALARIS 76 and 123, both of which completed contracts during the fourth quarter and are undergoing contract preparation and planned maintenance work prior to the start of their next contracts in 2024. Contract drilling expense increased to $123 million from $122 million in the third quarter 2023. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense increased to $115 million from $114 million in the third quarter. Contract drilling expense was largely flat on higher revenues primarily due to lower repair and maintenance expense. ARO Drilling Revenues increased to $134 million from $122 million in the third quarter 2023 primarily due to newbuild jackup Kingdom 1 commencing its maiden contract in November and more operating days for ARO 4001 following some out of service days for planned maintenance during the third quarter. Contract drilling expense decreased to $88 million from $92 million in the third quarter primarily due to lower bareboat charter expense, partially offset by more operating days for the owned fleet. Other Revenues decreased to $41 million from $46 million in the third quarter 2023 primarily due to lower revenues earned from bareboat charter agreements with ARO. Contract drilling expense decreased to $18 million from $19 million in the third quarter.

Contract drilling backlog includes drilling contracts subject to FID and drilling contracts which grant the customer termination rights if FID is not received with respect to projects for which the drilling rig is contracted. The contracted day rate excludes certain types of lump sum fees for rig mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, as well as customer reimbursables and bonus opportunities.

Beginning with the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting average daily revenue instead of the previously reported average day rate metric, which further excluded lump-sum revenues and amortization thereof.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Valaris’ condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, this press release provides investors with Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP measures. Valaris defines ""Adjusted EBITDA"" as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, depreciation expense, amortization, loss on impairment and equity in (earnings) losses of ARO. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that our management uses to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and analysts in allowing for greater transparency of our core operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered (a) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), (b) as an indication of cash flows from operating activities, or (c) as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Valaris defines ""Adjusted EBITDAR"" as Adjusted EBITDA before reactivation costs. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure that our management uses to assess the performance of our fleet excluding one-time rig reactivation costs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and analysts in allowing for greater transparency of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAR should not be considered (a) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), (b) as an indication of cash flows from operating activities, or (c) as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDAR may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Valaris defines ARO ""EBITDA"" as net income before income tax expense, other expense, net and depreciation expense. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that our management uses to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of ARO's core operating performance and to evaluate ARO's long-term financial performance against that of ARO's peers. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and analysts in allowing for greater transparency of ARO's core operating performance and makes it easier to compare ARO's results with those of other companies within ARO's industry. EBITDA should not be considered (a) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), (b) as an indication of cash flows from operating activities, or (c) as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the Company's forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed on its fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call, to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including forward-looking tax expense and other income (expense). Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The company aims to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024. Positive Strong demand and bookings exceeding expectations. Adjusted EPS for 2024 expected to be $9.90 - $10.10. Company aims to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upward revision of the Adjusted EPS (Earnings Per Share) forecast for Royal Caribbean Group suggests a stronger financial performance than previously anticipated. This revision, to a range of $9.90 - $10.10, indicates that the company is experiencing robust demand and operational efficiency. Investors should consider the potential for increased shareholder value, as EPS is a critical metric for assessing a company's profitability on a per-share basis. However, it is essential to scrutinize the factors driving this increase, such as cost management and revenue growth, to understand the sustainability of these earnings.Moreover, the achievement of the 'Trifecta goals'—which typically refer to a company's targets for revenue, profitability and market share—signals a comprehensive strategic success. This holistic performance improvement could lead to a favorable market perception, potentially impacting the stock positively. However, investors should be cautious of market volatility and sector-specific risks, such as changes in travel trends or economic downturns that could affect the cruise industry. Market Research Analyst The cruise industry is highly sensitive to consumer discretionary spending, which appears to be on the upswing for Royal Caribbean Group. The reported increase in demand and bookings is a positive sign of consumer confidence and willingness to spend on travel and leisure. This uptick might reflect broader economic trends or successful marketing strategies by the company.It is also important to analyze the competitive landscape and how Royal Caribbean's performance compares to its peers. Market share gains and customer satisfaction metrics would provide a deeper understanding of the company's position within the industry. Furthermore, the potential long-term benefits from repeat customers and brand loyalty could be significant, given the high customer acquisition costs in the travel sector. Economist The guidance update from Royal Caribbean Group could be indicative of a broader economic recovery, particularly in the leisure and hospitality sector. The increase in demand for cruises might suggest rising disposable incomes and a rebound in tourism post-pandemic. This could have a multiplier effect on the economy, with increased employment and spending in related industries such as travel agencies, airlines and destinations that are part of the cruise ecosystem.However, the long-term economic outlook remains uncertain with potential headwinds such as inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. These factors could influence consumer behavior and travel spending, which would directly affect the cruise industry. It is crucial to monitor economic indicators and consumer sentiment indices to anticipate any shifts that might impact the sector's recovery trajectory. 02/21/2024 - 05:19 PM Since last earnings call, demand and bookings have exceeded expectations Adjusted EPS in 2024 is now expected to be $9.90 - $10.10 The company expects to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024 MIAMI, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) today provided an update on demand and updated its 2024 guidance. The company continues to be very encouraged about the demand and pricing environment for 2024. Since its most recent update on its Q4 2023 earnings call, the WAVE booking season has exceeded the company's initial expectations, with the first 5 weeks of the year resulting in the best WAVE booking weeks in the company's history. Bookings have been significantly higher than during the same period last year, with the back half of the year up by more than the front half. For 2024, all four quarters and all key products are booked ahead of the same time last year in both rate and volume. Consumer spending for onboard purchases continue to exceed prior years driven by greater participation at higher prices, indicating quality and healthy future demand. ""Since our last earnings call, robust demand for our vacation experiences has significantly exceeded our initial expectations,"" said Jason Liberty, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean. ""As a result, we are increasing our 2024 guidance on stronger revenue outlook, and we expect to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024. Trifecta marks an important milestone as we remain intensely focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations and priceless memories for our guests while delivering exceptional long-term shareholder value."" As a result of the strong WAVE season, the company is increasing its 2024 Adjusted EPS guidance by $0.40 compared to its February guidance. For the full year, Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $9.90 to $10.10 driven by an increase in constant currency net yield growth of approximately 100 bps compared to the February guidance. Approximately $0.15 of the full year increase in adjusted EPS is driven by an improved revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2024. The company now expects to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Selected Operational and Financial Metrics Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. Constant Currency is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in ""Constant Currency"" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaning when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. Invested Capital represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus the most recent five-quarter average of Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below). Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC is also used as a key metric in our long-term incentive compensation program for our executive officers. Adjusted Gross Margin represent Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Net Yields represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses. Trifecta refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in November 2022 and seeking to achieve by the end of 2025. We designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under the Trifecta Program, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at lease $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025. Adjusted Measures of Financial Performance We have not provided in this press release a quantitative reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP projections would require unreasonable effort. Due to significant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs. In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful.

Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted NOI and EBITDA margins reached 98.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted Net Operating Income (Adjusted NOI)4 increased 19.7% to US$ 53.0 million, compared to US$ 44.3 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted NOI margin was 98.1%; a 220-basis-point year on year increase due to lower property-related costs. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA5 increased 12.0% to US$ 44.1 million, as compared to US$ 39.4 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 81.7%; a 365-basis-point decrease primarily due to the peso appreciation relative to the same period last year, which in turn impacted Vesta´s employee’s benefits, auditing, legal and consulting expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 Vesta funds from operations (Vesta FFO) increased by 20.0% to US$ 32.6 million, from US$ 27.2 million in 2022. Vesta FFO per share was US$ 0.0384 for the fourth quarter 2023 compared with US$ 0.0395 for the same period in 2022; a 2.7% decrease resulting from the Company’s December 2023 follow-on issuance. Fourth quarter 2023 Vesta FFO excluding current tax expense was US$ 14.4 million compared to US$ 13.2 million in the fourth quarter 2022, due to higher profit with a lower interest expense in the fourth quarter 2023 relative to the same period in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 total comprehensive gain was US$ 112.3 million, versus US$ 84.6 million in the fourth quarter 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues, higher gain on the revaluation of investment properties and a positive effect from income tax gain for the fourth quarter 2023. The total value of Vesta’s investment property portfolio was US$ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023; a 17.3% increase compared to US$ 2.7 billion at the end of December 31, 2022.

Positive Bel Fuse Inc. implements a $25 million share repurchase program. Net sales for Q4 2023 were $140.0 million, down from $169.2 million in Q4 2022. Gross profit margin increased to 36.6% in Q4 2023 from 31.0% in Q4 2022. Net earnings for Q4 2023 were $12.0 million compared to $14.0 million in Q4 2022.

The CFO highlights operational achievements, including facility consolidations and cost efficiencies. Bel anticipates a slow start in 2024 with a potential rebound in the second half of the year. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bel Fuse Inc.'s announcement of a $25 million share repurchase program signals a strong cash position and confidence in the company's intrinsic value. The repurchase program is likely to support the stock price by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share and return on equity. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of this capital allocation decision. The funds could alternatively be used for acquisitions, R&D, or debt reduction. It is crucial to assess whether the buyback is the most efficient use of capital for long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in gross profit margin in both the fourth quarter and full year, despite a decrease in net sales, suggests that Bel Fuse has effectively managed cost controls or has shifted towards higher-margin products. This improved margin performance is particularly notable given the 'tough macro environment' cited by the CEO. However, the decline in net sales year-over-year raises questions about demand for the company's products and the effectiveness of its market penetration strategies. The consolidation of the Magnetics facility in China and the ongoing project in Pennsylvania indicate a strategic move to streamline operations and may lead to further cost savings and operational efficiencies. Economist Bel Fuse's financial results reflect broader economic trends, such as the impact of global market conditions on the electronics components industry. The company's diverse product segments appear to provide a buffer against segment-specific downturns, showcasing the benefits of diversification. The forecast for a potential rebound in the second half of 2024 aligns with economic indicators predicting recovery following a period of normalization in inventory levels. Investors should monitor macroeconomic indicators, as these will likely influence the company's performance, particularly in the Magnetics group and the Connectivity segment. 02/21/2024 - 05:20 PM Announces New $25 Million Share Repurchase ProgramWEST ORANGE, N.J., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bel Fuse Inc. (Nasdaq: BELFA and BELFB) today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights •Net sales of $140.0 million compared to $169.2 million in Q4-22. Non-GAAP adjusted net sales (which exclude expedite fee revenue) were $139.6 million in Q4-23 as compared to $158.7 million in Q4-22•Gross profit margin of 36.6%, up from 31.0% in Q4-22•Net earnings of $12.0 million versus $14.0 million in Q4-22•Adjusted EBITDA of $24.0 million (17.1% of sales) as compared to $25.0 million (14.8% of sales) in Q4-22 Full Year 2023 Highlights •Net sales of $639.8 million compared to $654.2 million in 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net sales (which exclude expedite fee revenue) were $625.0 million in 2023, up from $621.7 million in 2022•Gross profit margin of 33.7%, up from 28.0% in 2022•Net earnings of $73.8 million versus $52.7 million in 2022•Adjusted EBITDA of $110.5 million (17.3% of sales), up from $83.0 million (12.7% of sales) in 2022 “In closing out 2023, we were very pleased with the financial turnaround that the team was able to achieve in a tough macro environment,” said Daniel Bernstein, President and CEO. “Our diversity in product segments and end markets served continues to be our strength, allowing us to focus on the future and growth. The Power and Connectivity segments were successful in mitigating the effects of a challenging Magnetics segment. Based on our strong 2023 cash flow generation, the Board has authorized a $25 million share repurchase program. This program is an output of our ongoing evaluation of the optimal use of capital and the various alternatives at present. “In January 2024, Bel celebrated its 75th year in business. In reflecting on our history and progress made over the decades, we understand the short-term cycles that our industry and end markets will face from time to time. We have always been successful in persevering and coming out on the other side as a stronger company. The time and effort spent by our global team in 2023 to strengthen Bel’s foundation will serve us well in the years to come as growth returns and new end markets take hold,” concluded Mr. Bernstein. Farouq Tuweiq, CFO, added, “Our priority for 2023 was resetting Bel operationally and this was achieved through a number of initiatives - the largest one being the completion of our previously-announced Magnetics facility consolidations in China. In light of the current level of sales within our Magnetics group, the more efficient cost structure now in place for this segment was particularly well-timed. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we began another consolidation project at our Pennsylvania facility within the Connectivity segment. “As our focus in streamlining the organization continues its momentum with material milestones achieved, the team will reemphasize and dedicate its focus on top line growth. It is expected that 2024 will be off to a slow start with various indicators forecasting a possible rebound in the second half of the year as inventory in the channel normalizes. Based on information available today, GAAP net sales in the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be in the range of $125 to $135 million, with gross margins holding at the full year 2023 level. We are ready and excited for another year of coordinated efforts across our versatile and resilient global team in building Bel for success in the years to come,” concluded Mr. Tuweiq. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as Non-GAAP net earnings, Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, exclude restructuring charges, gains on sales of business and properties, loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary and certain litigation costs. Non-GAAP adjusted net sales exclude expedite fee revenue.

Market Research Analyst The reported financial results of Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta S.A.B. de C.V. for the fourth quarter of 2023 demonstrate a robust performance with a significant 20.5% year-over-year increase in total income, surpassing the company's revenue guidance. This indicates a strong demand for industrial real estate in Mexico, likely driven by factors such as nearshoring and the growth of e-commerce. The company's aggressive growth strategy, evidenced by new construction and acquisitions, aligns with the broader industry trend of expanding industrial footprints to meet rising logistics demands.Moreover, the company's operational efficiency is highlighted by the impressive Adjusted NOI margin of 94.6% and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 82.0%, both exceeding guidance. Such high margins are indicative of effective cost control and operational optimization, which are critical for maintaining profitability in the real estate sector. The increase in Vesta's funds from operations (FFO) by 23.6% also reflects a healthy cash flow situation, which is vital for sustaining growth and shareholder returns. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Vesta's strong balance sheet, characterized by a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4x and a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 24.1%, suggests a conservative capital structure and a lower risk profile. These metrics are particularly relevant to investors and creditors, as they provide insight into the company's financial leverage and ability to service debt. The successful follow-on ADS offering and the IPO earlier in the year have evidently contributed to this solid financial standing.The reported cap rates on property acquisitions and sales, such as the 8.5% on the Toluca facility and the 6.5% on the Tijuana building, offer a glimpse into the investment yield and the attractiveness of these assets in the current market. These rates are within the typical range for industrial properties, indicating Vesta's transactions are aligned with market expectations. The use of proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt further strengthens the company's financial position. Sustainability Consultant On the sustainability front, Vesta's inclusion in the S&P/BMV Total ESG Mexico Index and the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook, as well as its progress towards ISO 14001:2015 Certification and alignment with IFRS ESG Standards, reflect a commitment to environmental and social governance that is increasingly valued by investors. These efforts can enhance the company's reputation and potentially attract a broader investor base that prioritizes ESG factors. The focus on sustainability is not only a response to regulatory pressures but also a strategic move to future-proof the business against environmental risks and to capitalize on the growing demand for green buildings. 02/21/2024 - 05:02 PM MEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta S.A.B. de C.V., (“Vesta”, or the “Company”) (BMV: VESTA; NYSE: VTMX), a leading industrial real estate company in Mexico, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.

Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted NOI and EBITDA margins reached 98.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted Net Operating Income (Adjusted NOI)4 increased 19.7% to US$ 53.0 million, compared to US$ 44.3 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted NOI margin was 98.1%; a 220-basis-point year on year increase due to lower property-related costs. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA5 increased 12.0% to US$ 44.1 million, as compared to US$ 39.4 million in the fourth quarter 2022. The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 81.7%; a 365-basis-point decrease primarily due to the peso appreciation relative to the same period last year, which in turn impacted Vesta´s employee’s benefits, auditing, legal and consulting expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 Vesta funds from operations (Vesta FFO) increased by 20.0% to US$ 32.6 million, from US$ 27.2 million in 2022. Vesta FFO per share was US$ 0.0384 for the fourth quarter 2023 compared with US$ 0.0395 for the same period in 2022; a 2.7% decrease resulting from the Company’s December 2023 follow-on issuance. Fourth quarter 2023 Vesta FFO excluding current tax expense was US$ 14.4 million compared to US$ 13.2 million in the fourth quarter 2022, due to higher profit with a lower interest expense in the fourth quarter 2023 relative to the same period in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 total comprehensive gain was US$ 112.3 million, versus US$ 84.6 million in the fourth quarter 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues, higher gain on the revaluation of investment properties and a positive effect from income tax gain for the fourth quarter 2023. The total value of Vesta’s investment property portfolio was US$ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023; a 17.3% increase compared to US$ 2.7 billion at the end of December 31, 2022.

Board of Directors declared a dividend of 23¢ per share for the fourth quarter. CEO highlighted challenges due to soft consumer demand but expressed optimism for 2024. Company celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 2024 with special commemorative firearms. Company maintained a debt-free balance sheet and strong cash position. Negative 9% reduction in sales from the prior year due to soft consumer demand. Profitability declined in 2023 as gross margin decreased from 30% to 25%. Unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs and inflationary cost increases impacted profitability. Finished goods inventory increased while distributor inventories decreased in 2023. Lower margin driven by various factors including increased promotional costs. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in net sales and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. reflects a challenging economic environment marked by inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. The 9% reduction in annual sales and the decline in gross margin from 30% to 25% suggest the company is facing increased costs and potentially a shift in consumer spending. The reduction in production and sales, coupled with inflationary costs in materials and services, has led to unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs. However, the company's strategy to manage promotions prudently and focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains is noteworthy. The increase in cash and short-term investments to $117.7 million and the maintenance of a debt-free balance sheet provides financial stability, which is significant in weathering economic downturns. The return of $122.6 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks indicates a strong commitment to shareholder value, despite the challenging year. Market Research Analyst Sturm, Ruger & Company's product mix and introduction of new firearms are strategic moves to stimulate market interest and counteract soft consumer demand. The launch of commemorative firearms for their 75th Anniversary and the introduction of new products like the Ruger American Rifle Generation II and the LC Carbine demonstrate the company's continued innovation and adaptation to market trends. The increase in new product sales to 23% of firearm sales in 2023, up from 14% in 2022, is a positive indicator of successful product launches and market acceptance. However, the greater reduction in sell-through compared to the adjusted National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) checks suggests competitive pressures, as competitors' aggressive promotions could be impacting Ruger's market share. Monitoring consumer response to new product lines and competitive actions will be critical for Ruger's market positioning and sales performance in the upcoming year. Economist The financial results of Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. are reflective of broader economic trends, including inflation and interest rate hikes, which typically lead to reduced consumer spending on discretionary items such as firearms. The company's acknowledgment of these macroeconomic challenges and their impact on consumer demand provides insight into the sector's sensitivity to economic cycles. Despite these headwinds, Sturm, Ruger & Company's disciplined approach to inventory management, as evidenced by the reduction of distributor inventories, positions them well to respond to changes in demand without the burden of excess supply. Additionally, the company's strong liquidity ratio, with a current ratio of 4.3 to 1, suggests a robust capacity to meet short-term obligations, which is particularly advantageous in uncertain economic conditions. 02/21/2024 - 05:05 PM SOUTHPORT, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE-RGR) announced today that for 2023 the Company reported net sales of $543.8 million and diluted earnings of $2.71 per share, compared with net sales of $595.8 million and diluted earnings of $4.96 per share in 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales were $130.6 million and diluted earnings were 58¢ per share. For the corresponding period in 2022, net sales were $149.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.06 per share. The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of 23¢ per share for the fourth quarter for stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024, payable on March 28, 2024. This dividend varies every quarter because the Company pays a percentage of earnings rather than a fixed amount per share. This dividend is approximately 40% of net income. Chief Executive Officer Christopher J. Killoy commented on the financial results for the year, “Consumer demand remained soft in 2023, likely dampened by inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, leading to a 9% reduction in sales from the prior year. Nevertheless, we remained disciplined and continued to focus on the long-term – reducing production levels where appropriate and offering only modest promotions on select product families, resisting the temptation to enhance short-term results at the expense of our long-term strategy. Encouraged by our increased quarterly sales and profitability in the fourth quarter, we enter 2024 with a strong, debt-free balance sheet, reduced inventories at our independent distributors, and a full pipeline of new products recently launched into the market and others still under development.” Mr. Killoy continued, “We are celebrating Ruger’s 75th Anniversary in 2024. To honor our proud heritage, we are offering commemorative firearms that will only be available this year, all of which are engraved with our 75th Anniversary logo: A special tribute to Bill Ruger’s first pistol, which launched the Company in 1949, a Mark IV target pistol, featuring a fully adjustable rear sight, an undercut Patridge front sight, and a heavy, tapered barrel, A pair of 10/22 Sporter rimfire carbines, each featuring a stainless steel barrel, silver-finished receiver, polished bolt, and match-sanded butt pad, and An LCP MAX double-stack, ten-round pistol, featuring a stainless steel slide and a silver-anodized aluminum trigger. Also, several special, limited production, editions of other products will be released throughout the year. The first of these is the Diamond Anniversary Limited Edition 1911 Pistol, which features an attractive, finely detailed, laser-engraved slide.” Mr. Killoy remarked, “In addition to these 75th Anniversary models, we have recently introduced several new products that have been met with strong demand and excitement: Ruger American Rifle Generation II, our first update to the American Rifle, which has been tremendously popular since its introduction in 2012. The Generation II models feature a three-position tang safety, a more ergonomic stock, and a spiral fluted barrel. The 60th Anniversary 10/22 Carbine, the Sixth Edition of the Ruger Collector's Series, features a stainless steel barrel and silver-finished receiver paired with a Gray Magpul Hunter X-22 stock, a blackened bolt laser engraved with a unique 60th Anniversary marking, and a red bolt handle and trigger, The Mini-14 with side-folding stock, reminiscent of classic side-folding Mini-14 rifles originally produced in the late-1970s, and The LC Carbine chambered in .45 Auto featuring a threaded barrel, adjustable folding stock, Ruger Rapid Deploy folding sights, and ambidextrous controls.” Mr. Killoy made the following observations related to the Company’s 2023 performance: The estimated unit sell-through of the Company’s products from the independent distributors to retailers decreased 7% in 2023 compared to the prior year period. For the same period, NICS background checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, decreased 4%. The greater reduction in the sell-through of the Company’s products relative to adjusted NICS background checks may be attributable to aggressive promotions, discounts, rebates, and the extension of payment terms offered by our competitors. Sales of new products, including the MAX-9 pistol, Security-380 pistol, Super Wrangler revolver, LCP MAX pistol, Marlin lever-action rifles, LC Carbine, Small-Frame Autoloading Rifle, and American Centerfire Rifle Generation II represented $121.7 million or 23% of firearm sales in 2023, an increase from $78.4 million or 14% of sales in 2022. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. Our profitability declined in 2023 from 2022 as our gross margin decreased from 30% to 25%. The lower margin was driven by unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs resulting from decreased production and sales, inflationary cost increases in materials, commodities, services, wages, energy, fuel, and transportation, a product mix shift toward products with relatively lower margins that remain in stronger demand, and increased promotional costs, which were partially offset by increased pricing. In 2023, the Company’s finished goods inventory increased 30,700 units and distributor inventories of the Company’s products decreased 39,100 units. Cash provided by operations during 2023 was $33.9 million. At December 31, 2023, our cash and short-term investments totaled $117.7 million. Our current ratio is 4.3 to 1 and we have no debt. In 2023, capital expenditures totaled $15.8 million related to new product introductions and upgrades to our manufacturing equipment and facilities. In 2024, the Company expects capital expenditures to approximate $15 million. In 2023, the Company returned $122.6 million to its shareholders through: the payment of $110.8 million of dividends, including a $5.00 per share special dividend paid in January 2023, and the repurchase of 264,062 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $44.71 per share, for a total of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2023, stockholders’ equity was $331.7 million, which equates to a book value of $19.00 per share, of which $6.74 per share was cash and short-term investments. Today, the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023. The financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are attached to this press release.

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA and EBITDA margin are useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying business, as EBITDA provides information on the Company’s ability to meet its capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. The Company believes that this reporting provides better transparency and comparability to its operating results. The Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial performance.

The Company’s EBITDA calculation also excludes any one-time non-cash, non-operating expense.

Financial Analyst The announcement by Blue Owl Capital Corporation III showcases a robust financial performance, with a notable increase in net investment income (NII) per share to $0.58 and an annualized NII return on equity (ROE) of 15.1% for Q4 2023, up from 12.9% in Q4 2022. The growth in NII is significant as it directly impacts the company's profitability and, by extension, shareholder value. The dividend yield of 12.7% is attractive and could influence investor sentiment positively. The declaration of a series of special dividends could be viewed as a strong signal of confidence in the company's future cash flows and financial stability.From an investment perspective, the company's increased net asset value (NAV) per share to $15.56 indicates a positive trend in asset valuation. The stock repurchase program authorized by the Board, allowing for up to $100 million in buybacks, may support the stock price and reflects management's belief in the company's intrinsic value. The capital allocation decisions, including the mix of dividends and share repurchases, are crucial for assessing management's strategy to enhance shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Blue Owl Capital's investment activity demonstrates a strategic focus on portfolio expansion and diversification, with $596.5 million in new investment commitments for the full year 2023. This activity is slightly lower compared to the previous year but still represents substantial growth and an active investment approach. The shift in portfolio composition towards more first lien senior secured debt investments, from 77.2% to 76.4%, suggests a conservative tilt, prioritizing loan security over potentially higher yields from riskier asset classes.Furthermore, the floating rate nature of 98.1% of the debt investments is a critical aspect to consider, especially in a fluctuating interest rate environment, as it may protect the company's interest income against rate decreases and enhance income when rates rise. However, it also introduces variability in investment income, which could affect the company's financial performance depending on market conditions. The weighted average total yield remaining consistent at around 12.1% is an indicator of the company's ability to maintain its income-generating capacity. Legal Expert The company's liquidity and capital resources, with $141.4 million in cash and significant undrawn credit facility capacity, indicate a strong liquidity position that enables the company to take advantage of new investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns. The stable net debt to equity ratio of 0.86x across the two most recent quarters suggests that the company is managing its leverage prudently, which is important for maintaining financial flexibility and solvency.Investors should also consider the regulatory environment that affects Business Development Companies (BDCs) like Blue Owl Capital, particularly with regard to leverage limits and the types of investments they can make. The company's adherence to these regulations, while managing a diversified and largely secured portfolio, could be seen as a positive indicator of risk management and compliance practices. 02/21/2024 - 05:02 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blue Owl Capital Corporation III (NYSE: OBDE, or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for its full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, two portfolio companies with an aggregate debt investment fair value of $18.8 million were on non-accrual status, representing 0.6% of the total fair value of the debt portfolio. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR AND QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 Investment Income Investment income increased by $143.9 million to $422.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $278.9 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in the base rates charged on our floating rate debt investments and debt investments made during the prior year earning a full year's worth of interest income during the year ended December 31, 2023. Dividend income increased period-over-period due to an increase in our portfolio of dividend income-producing equity investments which, at cost, increased from $146.0 million as of December 31, 2022 to $175.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns which are non-recurring in nature. Period over period, these fees increased due to an increase in repayment activity for the period. Other income increased period-over-period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and generally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments. Investment income increased to $111.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $90.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Expenses Total expenses increased by $60.9 million to $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $88.1 million for the same period in prior year due to an increase in management fees, interest expense and other expenses. The increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings, as well as an increase in the average interest rate period over period. Management fees increased primarily due to an increase in our investment portfolio. As a percentage of total assets, professional fees, directors' fees and other general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent period over period. Total expenses increased to $39.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $31.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, we had $141.4 million in cash, $1.8 billion in total principal value of debt outstanding, and $746.9 million of undrawn capacity on our credit facilities. The Company's weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 6.9% and 6.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Ending net debt to equity was 0.86x and 0.86x as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Trip.com Group Limited for Q4 and the full year of 2023 indicate a substantial recovery in the travel sector, with significant year-over-year growth in revenue and net income. The company's successful rebound is particularly noteworthy in the context of the global travel industry's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The robust growth in domestic hotel reservations and the recovery of outbound hotel and air reservations to over 80% of pre-COVID levels suggest that consumer confidence and discretionary spending on travel are on the rise. This trend is likely to have positive implications for the broader travel and hospitality industry, potentially leading to increased investor interest in related stocks. However, the reported decrease in net revenue and net income from the previous quarter, attributed to seasonality, serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility in the travel industry. Investors should consider this seasonality when evaluating the company's performance and future prospects. Market Research Analyst The strategic focus on globalization and AI innovations mentioned by Trip.com Group's Executive Chairman aligns with broader industry trends towards technological integration and international market expansion. This strategic direction is likely to enhance the company's competitive advantage and market share in the long term. The emphasis on technology and product innovation, as well as sustainable development, suggests that Trip.com Group is investing in key areas that could drive future growth and customer loyalty. The increased revenue in accommodation, transportation ticketing and packaged tours indicates a diversified revenue stream, which can be a buffer against market fluctuations in specific segments. Market analysts would be interested in how these investments and revenue diversification strategies might translate into sustained growth and market performance in a post-pandemic landscape where travel habits and consumer expectations have evolved. Economist The financial results of Trip.com Group reflect broader economic trends, including the rebound of the service sector and the resurgence of international travel as countries lift COVID-19 restrictions. The significant increase in accommodation and transportation ticketing revenue suggests that both leisure and business travel are contributing to economic recovery. The reported increase in product development and sales and marketing expenses indicates that the company is actively seeking to capture market demand and innovate its offerings. The rise in general and administrative expenses, albeit at a slower rate, could be indicative of strategic investments in corporate infrastructure to support expanded operations. The overall financial health of Trip.com Group, with a strong balance of cash and cash equivalents, positions it to weather potential economic headwinds and capitalize on the expected growth in global travel demand. 02/21/2024 - 05:00 PM SHANGHAI, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Trip.com Group Limited (Nasdaq: TCOM; HKEX: 9961) (""Trip.com Group"" or the ""Company""), a leading one-stop travel service provider of accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours, and corporate travel management, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Trip.com Group's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), Trip.com Group uses non-GAAP financial information related to adjusted net income attributable to Trip.com Group Limited, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share and per ADS, each of which is adjusted from the most comparable GAAP result to exclude the share-based compensation charges that are not tax deductible, fair value changes of equity securities investments and exchangeable senior notes recorded in other income/(expense), net of tax, and other applicable items. Trip.com Group's management believes the non-GAAP financial measures facilitate better understanding of operating results from quarter to quarter and provide management with a better capability to plan and forecast future periods. Non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for GAAP results. A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures is that non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges, fair value changes of equity securities investments and exchangeable senior notes recorded in other income/(expense), and their tax effects that have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in Trip.com Group's business for the foreseeable future. Reconciliations of Trip.com Group's non-GAAP financial data to the most comparable GAAP data included in the consolidated statement of operations are included at the end of this press release.

(the ""Company"" or ""Torex"") (TSX: TXG) reports the Company's financial and operational results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. Torex will host a conference call tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM (ET) to discuss the results. Jody Kuzenko, President & CEO of Torex, stated:""2023 was another strong year for Torex as we continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver operational excellence at ELG while making significant progress on building our future at the Media Luna Project. We closed 2023 on a high note with Q4 marking the second strongest quarter of production on record driven by new throughput and mining records achieved at our processing plant and at ELG Underground. ""We produced 453,778 ounces (""oz"") of gold in 2023, near the midpoint of the full-year guided range, marking the fifth consecutive year we have delivered on original production guidance. At the same time, we continued to distinguish ourselves as one of the safest operators in the industry, with no lost-time injuries in the full year at ELG and none in the second half of the year at Media Luna. In Q4, we achieved 10 million hours worked without a lost-time injury at ELG for the third time since 2020.""The exceptional work of our operations team was equally matched by our Media Luna Project team, where significant progress was made on both the north and south sides of the Balsas River. The project was 60% complete at year end and is well on track for first production in late 2024 and commercial production in early 2025. As at the end of the year, 84% of expenditures were committed and 56% incurred.""The strong operational performance combined with the robust gold price resulted in annual adjusted EBITDA1 of $442 million and annual cash flow from operations of $301 million. Torex exited the year with $173 million in cash and $465 million in available liquidity1. We have now reached the point where our current liquidity position exceeds the forecast $384 million of remaining upfront expenditures on Media Luna, with the funding outlook further enhanced by robust and consistent cash flow anticipated from ELG through 2024. The successful completion of Media Luna is expected to result in a return to positive free cash flow in mid-2025 as production ramps up and capital expenditures normalize.""There is no doubt that 2024 will be a pivotal year for Torex as we bring Media Luna into production by year end, while spending $30 million on drilling and exploration to continue to demonstrate the exceptional resource endowment of our Morelos asset. We remain fully focused on driving long-term value for our shareholders as we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver with excellence and set the foundation for our ambitious growth agenda."" FULL YEAR 2023 HIGHLIGHTSStrong safety performance continues: The Company exited the year with a lost-time injury frequency of 0.31 per million hours worked on a rolling 12-month basis. On October 18, the Company reached 10 million hours worked without a lost-time injury (""LTI"") at its El Limón Guajes (""ELG"") Mine Complex for the third time since 2020.Annual gold production: Delivered annual gold production of 453,778 oz for the year, near the midpoint of the guided range of 440,000 to 470,000 oz, marking the fifth consecutive year that original production guidance has been achieved. During the year, the Company also achieved record annual mill throughput of 13,178 tonnes per day (""tpd"") and a record annual mining rate from ELG Underground of 2,070 tpd, surpassing the previous annual record set in 2022.Annual gold sold: Annual gold sold of 444,750 oz at an annual average realized gold price1 of $1,952 per oz, the highest annual realized price achieved by the Company, contributing to revenue of $882.6 million.Achieved full year revised cost guidance: Total cash costs1 of $866 per oz sold, at the upper end of the revised guided range of $840 to $870 per oz sold. All-in sustaining costs1 of $1,200 per oz sold, at the upper end of the revised guided range of $1,160 to $1,200 per oz sold. Full year cost guidance was impacted by the appreciation of the Mexican peso and the high strip, low grade phase of the open pit mine plan resulting in the lower average gold grade of ore processed. All-in sustaining costs margin1 of $752 per oz sold, implying an all-in sustaining costs margin1 of 38%. Cost of sales was $600.1 million or $1,349 per oz sold.Strong profitability and EBITDA1: Reported net income of $204.4 million, or earnings of $2.38 per share on a basic basis and $2.34 per share on a diluted basis. Adjusted net earnings1 of $148.4 million, or $1.73 per share on a basic basis and $1.72 per share on a diluted basis. Net income includes a derivative loss of $25.3 million related to gold forward contracts and foreign exchange collar contracts entered into to reduce downside price risk and capital expenditure risk during the construction of the Media Luna Project. Generated EBITDA1 of $422.6 million and adjusted EBITDA1 of $442.2 million. Cash flow generation: Net cash generated from operating activities totalled $300.8 million and $340.8 million before changes in non-cash operating working capital, including income taxes paid of $116.2 million and negative free cash flow1 of $185.4 million net of cash outlays for capital expenditures, lease payments and interest, including borrowing costs capitalized. Negative free cash flow in 2023 was a direct result of $366.3 million invested in the Media Luna Project.Strong financial liquidity: The Company extended and increased the available credit facilities with a syndicate of international banks in the third quarter of 2023, providing a total of $300.0 million in credit maturing in 2026. The year closed with net cash1 of $140.8 million, including $172.8 million in cash and $32.0 million of lease-related obligations, $nil borrowings on the credit facilities of $300.0 million and letters of credit outstanding of $7.9 million, providing $464.9 million in available liquidity1.Media Luna Project: During Q4 2023, $124.0 million was invested in the project, the highest quarterly spend to date. Total spend in 2023 was $366.3 million, in line with revised annual project guidance of $360 to $390 million. Expenditures during the year were primarily focused on continued development of the Guajes Tunnel and South Portals. The successful breakthrough of the Guajes Tunnel was completed on December 21, 2023, three months earlier than scheduled in the March 2022 Technical Report. Breakthrough of the Guajes Tunnel represents a key de-risking milestone in the development of the Media Luna Project as the tunnel unifies the Morelos Complex by connecting the existing operations on the north side of the Balsas River with the growing resource base of the Media Luna Cluster on the south side. The Company also received the amended permit for in-pit tailings deposition in November, which means the project is now fully permitted for both the development and operational phases. As of December 31, 2023, physical progress on the Project was approximately 60%, with detailed engineering, procurement activities, underground development, and surface construction advancing. With 84% of upfront expenditures committed as at December 31, 2023 (including 56% incurred), expenditures to date have tracked reasonably well to the initial budget of $874.5 million, noting the strength of the Mexican peso and general inflationary environment remain headwinds to contend with. Quarterly expenditures are expected to remain consistent through Q3 2024 before declining in Q4 2024 as the project nears completion.Exploration and Drilling Activities: In November, the Company announced results from the 2023 ELG Underground drilling program2 and the 2023 exploration drilling program at Media Luna West3. The ELG Underground exploration strategy is focused on expanding resources as well as extending and optimizing the life of ELG Underground beyond 2026. Initial drilling results from Media Luna West, in addition to infill and step-out drilling at EPO, support the Company's strategy to further prove up the potential of the Media Luna Cluster and unlock additional near-mine opportunities in order to enhance the future production profile of the Morelos Complex and extend the reserve life beyond 2033.FOURTH QUARTER 2023 HIGHLIGHTSSafety performance: The Company exited the fourth quarter with no lost-time injuries at ELG or the Media Luna Project for the second quarter in a row.Gold production: Delivered gold production of 137,993 oz for the quarter, the second-highest production quarter on record, driven by strong gold grades to the mill and achieving a mining rate at ELG Underground of 2,300 tpd. In the ELG Open Pits, average ore production of 19,404 tpd set a new record for daily ore tonnes mined in a quarter, and as anticipated, gold grades improved in the quarter with the period of heavy waste stripping concluded.

The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations with interest payable semi-annually. Lyft intends to use the proceeds for various purposes including repurchasing existing notes, capped call transactions, and stock repurchases. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A convertible note offering, such as the one announced by Lyft, can be indicative of several strategic financial maneuvers. Primarily, it suggests a capital raising exercise to strengthen the company's balance sheet, which could be used for a variety of purposes including debt refinancing, as is indicated by Lyft's intention to repurchase a portion of its existing 2025 notes. The offering may also signal an attempt to capitalize on favorable market conditions to secure funding on potentially advantageous terms.The impact on the stock market can be multifaceted. Convertible notes can be dilutive to existing shareholders if a significant number of notes are converted into equity. However, the capped call transactions that Lyft plans to enter into are designed to mitigate this potential dilution. From an investor's perspective, the initial reaction to such news could be cautious, as the market absorbs the implications of the future equity dilution and the terms of the conversion. The use of proceeds for potential acquisitions and strategic transactions could be perceived positively if investors believe in the company's growth strategy, but the lack of specific targets or agreements could also introduce uncertainty. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Lyft to issue convertible senior notes and engage in concurrent note repurchases, capped call transactions and potential stock repurchases represents a complex financial strategy that could have implications for the company's stock performance. The repurchase of the 2025 notes suggests that Lyft is proactively managing its debt profile. By repurchasing its near-term debt, the company could potentially improve its debt maturity profile and reduce interest expenses, which can be an attractive signal to investors.Market activity surrounding the repurchase and the related hedging and derivative transactions could lead to increased volatility in the price of Lyft's Class A common stock. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the pricing of the notes, the conversion rate and the terms of the capped call transactions to assess the potential impact on Lyft's financials and stock performance. The repurchase of Class A common stock could be interpreted as a sign of confidence by management in the company's valuation, potentially providing a short-term boost to the stock price. Legal Expert Lyft's issuance of convertible notes is subject to compliance with securities regulations, specifically Rule 144A, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering. This is a common strategy for raising capital while avoiding the regulatory complexities and public scrutiny of a public offering. It is important for investors to understand that these notes are unregistered securities and come with restrictions on their transferability.Furthermore, the legal structure of the capped call transactions is designed to provide a hedge against dilution, which can be a critical factor in protecting shareholder value. The legal intricacies of these transactions require careful structuring to ensure compliance with securities laws and to manage the company's risk exposure effectively. The terms of these transactions and their execution will be closely watched by regulatory bodies to ensure that they do not manipulate the market price of Lyft's securities. 02/21/2024 - 05:03 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”) (NASDAQ: LYFT) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $400 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Lyft also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date Lyft first issues the notes, up to an additional $60 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Lyft, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. Upon conversion, Lyft will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Lyft’s Class A common stock (“Class A common stock”) or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at Lyft’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. Lyft intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to (1) repurchase a portion of its 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) concurrently with the pricing of the offering in separate and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 2025 notes (the “concurrent note repurchases”) effected through one of the initial purchasers of the notes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent, (2) pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below, and (3) purchase up to approximately $50 million of the Class A common stock from institutional investors through one of the initial purchasers of the notes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent, at a price per share equal to the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the pricing of the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Lyft expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Lyft intends to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of additional 2025 notes, working capital, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. From time to time Lyft evaluates potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. However, Lyft has not designated any specific uses and has no current agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or strategic transactions. The terms of the concurrent note repurchases are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the 2025 notes participating in the concurrent note repurchases, and will depend on several factors, including the market price of Lyft’s Class A common stock and the trading price of the 2025 notes at the time of each such concurrent note repurchase. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the 2025 notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. Certain holders of any 2025 notes that Lyft agrees to repurchase may have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such 2025 notes and may, concurrently with the pricing of the notes, unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying Lyft’s Class A common stock and/or entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Lyft’s Class A common stock. Any repurchase of the 2025 notes, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2025 notes participating in the concurrent note repurchases, together with the repurchase by Lyft of any Class A common stock concurrently with the pricing of the notes, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Lyft’s Class A common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes at that time and the initial conversion price of the notes. Lyft cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes or our Class A common stock. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Lyft expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the notes sold in the offering. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Lyft elects to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. Lyft has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Class A common stock or other securities of Lyft in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion, repurchase or redemption of the notes, to the extent Lyft exercises the relevant election under the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following a conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The notes will only be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.

"Car Tech, LLC and AltEnergy Acquisition Corp Announce Definitive Business Combination Agreement to List Merged Company on the NASDAQ Capital Market",2024-02-21T22:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Car Tech, LLC, a U.S. auto-body parts manufacturer, and AltEnergy Acquisition Corp. have entered a definitive business combination agreement to go public on NASDAQ. The merger aims to expand Car Tech's EV battery-related body parts business and manufacturing capacity, capitalizing on the growing electric vehicle market.","Car Tech, LLC and AltEnergy Acquisition Corp Announce Definitive Business Combination Agreement to List Merged Company on the NASDAQ Capital Market Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Car Tech, LLC, a U.S. auto-body parts manufacturer, and AltEnergy Acquisition Corp. have entered a definitive business combination agreement to go public on NASDAQ. The merger aims to expand Car Tech's EV battery-related body parts business and manufacturing capacity, capitalizing on the growing electric vehicle market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announced merger between Car Tech and AltEnergy is a strategic move that capitalizes on the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market. The focus on expanding manufacturing operations for EV battery-related body parts is a direct response to the anticipated increase in demand for specialized components in the automotive sector. The partnership promises to leverage AltEnergy's experience in energy transition and battery investments, potentially creating a synergistic effect that could enhance Car Tech's market position.From a market research perspective, the deal aligns with the industry's shift towards electrification and the corresponding need for infrastructure expansion. The mention of Car Tech becoming a Tier-One vendor to BMW and its future collaboration with BlueOval indicates a strong competitive edge and forward momentum. Furthermore, the decision to expand in the Southeastern U.S. Auto Corridor reflects a strategic geographical advantage, tapping into an established automotive manufacturing hub with a growing focus on EV production. Financial Analyst The financial implications of this merger are significant, as it involves a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), AltEnergy, which allows Car Tech to go public with potentially less regulatory complexity and a quicker timeline than a traditional IPO. Investors should note the unanimous approval from both Boards of Directors, signaling confidence in the transaction's potential to deliver value. The merger is expected to enhance Car Tech's capital structure, enabling it to fulfill new orders and expand operations.It's important to consider the timing of the merger, expected to be completed in the first half of 2024, as it may influence Car Tech's financial performance and stock valuation. The involvement of specialized financial and legal advisors suggests a well-structured deal, although the terms and valuation of the merger have not been disclosed. Stakeholders should monitor the regulatory approval process and the reaction of AltEnergy's stockholders to gauge the market's sentiment towards this transaction. Legal Expert The legal aspects of this merger are crucial, as it requires regulatory approval and the consent of both AltEnergy's stockholders and Car Tech's members. The role of legal advisors is to ensure compliance with securities laws and to navigate the complexities of merging a U.S. company with a subsidiary of a foreign entity. The legal framework governing SPAC transactions is under heightened scrutiny, making the expertise of firms like Morrison Cohen LLP and Dorsey & Whitney LLP indispensable.Furthermore, the cross-border nature of the deal, involving a U.S. company and a Korean supplier, adds layers of legal considerations regarding international trade, tax implications and intellectual property rights. The successful navigation of these legal hurdles is essential for the merger to proceed without delays or additional costs, which could impact the anticipated benefits of the transaction. 02/21/2024 - 05:00 PM SEOUL, South Korea and OPELIKA, Ala. and NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Car Tech, LLC (""Car Tech""), a U.S. stamped auto-body parts manufacturer and subsidiary of leading Korean supplier, Shinyoung Co., Ltd., and AltEnergy Acquisition Corp.

""As the electric vehicle market is expected to grow dramatically, demand for high-quality special purpose car parts will increase accordingly.

Chairman Kang noted the global and dynamic nature of Car Tech's business: ""In a short time, Car Tech has become a trusted Tier-One vendor to BMW and is scheduled to supply battery-related parts to BlueOval, the Ford-SK On joint venture, starting in 2025.

Veris Residential also received recognition for sustainability and DEI efforts. Positive Strong Core FFO growth of 20% to $0.53 per share. 17.6% annual NOI growth exceeding guidance. Completion of transformation to a pure-play multifamily REIT. Reduction of Core G&A by 13% and reinstatement of dividends. Recognition for sustainability and DEI efforts. Available liquidity of $95 million with virtually all debt hedged or fixed. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Veris Residential, Inc. indicate a notable improvement in Core Funds From Operations (FFO) per share, with a 20% increase year-over-year. This metric is critical as it provides a clearer picture of the operating performance of a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) by excluding the effects of depreciation and other non-cash charges. The company's strategy of asset divestiture, focusing on multifamily properties, appears to be yielding positive financial results. The reduction in Core General & Administrative expenses by 13% demonstrates effective cost control measures. However, a slight decrease in physical occupancy rates could signal a need for closer monitoring of tenant retention strategies.Veris Residential's debt refinancing and the reduction of overall indebtedness by $50 million contribute to a healthier balance sheet. This financial maneuvering, combined with a conservative Net-Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio, suggests a strategic approach to managing leverage. The interest coverage ratio remaining stable at 1.5x is a positive sign of the company's ability to service its debt. Investors should note the company's proactive steps in liquidity management, including the establishment of an ATM program, which could provide flexibility in capital allocation. Market Research Analyst Veris Residential's strategic pivot to a pure-play multifamily REIT is significant in the context of the broader real estate market. As urbanization and housing demand patterns shift, specialization in Class A multifamily properties could position Veris advantageously. The reported Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI) growth of 17.6% surpasses the industry norm, reflecting strong operational efficiency and revenue growth. However, the Same Store Blended Rental Growth Rate's decline from the previous year's 11.7% to 5.0% may raise concerns about the sustainability of rental income growth rates in a potentially cooling market.The company's recognition in sustainability and Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) efforts aligns with increasing investor interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors, which could enhance its appeal to socially conscious investors. As ESG considerations become more integrated into investment decisions, Veris Residential's leadership in these areas could positively influence its market perception and stock valuation. Real Estate Industry Expert Veris Residential's transformation and focus on Class A multifamily properties reflect a strategic alignment with industry trends favoring quality assets in prime locations. The 10.8% increase in operating units year-over-year indicates expansion, which is critical in a competitive market. However, the slight dip in physical occupancy year-over-year, although minimal, warrants attention to ensure that growth in operating units translates into sustained revenue. The company's asset sales, including the divestiture of non-strategic assets such as hotel and office properties, are consistent with a trend among REITs to streamline operations and focus on core competencies.The addition of properties like Haus25 and The James to the Same Store pool and their contribution to NOI underscore the importance of strategic property acquisitions and development in driving growth. Veris Residential's forward-looking guidance suggests a cautious optimism, with projected Same Store NOI growth lower than the actual growth achieved in 2023, which may reflect a conservative approach in a potentially fluctuating real estate market. 02/21/2024 - 07:04 PM JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Veris Residential, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Definitions NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Included in this financial package are Funds from Operations, or FFO, Core Funds from Operations, or Core FFO, net operating income, or NOI and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, and EBIDAre or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent Costs, each a ""non-GAAP financial measure,"" measuring Veris Residential, Inc.'s historical or future financial performance that is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP""), within the meaning of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Veris Residential, Inc. believes these metrics can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted ""EBITDA"") The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Core FFO, plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus income (loss) in noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures, and plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of Adjusted EBITDA of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company's ability to incur and service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity. Blended Net Rental Growth Rate or Blended Lease Rate Weighted average of the net effective change in rent (inclusive of concessions) for a lease with a new resident or for a renewed lease compared to the rent for the prior lease of the identical apartment unit. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO (""AFFO"") Core FFO is defined as FFO, as adjusted for certain items to facilitate comparative measurement of the Company's performance over time. Adjusted FFO (""AFFO"") is defined as Core FFO less (i) recurring tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and capital expenditures, (ii) straight-line rents and amortization of acquired above/below market leases, net, and (iii) other non-cash income, plus (iv) other non-cash charges. Core FFO and Adjusted AFFO are presented solely as supplemental disclosure that the Company's management believes provides useful information to investors and analysts of its results, after adjusting for certain items to facilitate comparability of its performance from period to period. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are non-GAAP financial measures that are not intended to represent cash flow and are not indicative of cash flows provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. As there is not a generally accepted definition established for Core FFO and Adjusted FFO, the Company's measures of Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO and Adjusted FFO reported by other REITs. A reconciliation of net income per share to Core FFO and Adjusted FFO in dollars and per share are included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent Costs (""EBITDAre"") The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the Nareit definition, or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company presents EBITDAre, because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company's financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity. Funds From Operations (""FFO"") FFO is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions (including both acquisitions and dispositions), and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO per share is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO per share excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from property transactions and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO per share can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. FFO per share should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders per share as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO per share presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO per share presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company's FFO per share is comparable to the FFO per share of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""Nareit""). A reconciliation of net income per share to FFO per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release. NOI and Same Store NOI NOI represents total revenues less total operating expenses, as reconciled to net income above. The Company considers NOI to be a meaningful non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing unlevered performance of its property types and markets, as it relates to total return on assets, as opposed to levered return on equity. As properties are considered for sale and acquisition based on NOI estimates and projections, the Company utilizes this measure to make investment decisions, as well as compare the performance of its assets to those of its peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income, and the Company's use of NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company calculates NOI before any allocations to noncontrolling interests, as those interests do not affect the overall performance of the individual assets being measured and assessed. Same Store NOI is presented for the same store portfolio, which comprises all properties that were owned by the Company throughout both of the reporting periods.

Significant return of capital to shareholders in Q4 2023 and FY23. 2024 outlook includes ambitious E&P and CapEx plans, with a focus on maintaining oil volumes and generating high Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Chord Energy emphasizes sustainable free cash flow generation and high shareholder returns. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Chord Energy indicate a positive trajectory in operational efficiency and capital management. The exceeded guidance in both oil volumes and capital expenditures reflects a strategic acceleration of activity, which has been facilitated by favorable weather conditions and high-performing wells. Notably, the capital expenditures, while exceeding guidance, have been directed towards high working interest operated wells, suggesting a deliberate focus on assets with potential for higher returns. The company's net income and Adjusted EBITDA showcase robust profitability and operational cash flow, which are critical metrics for investors assessing the financial health of an energy company.From a capital allocation perspective, the substantial return of capital through dividends and share repurchases underscores Chord Energy's commitment to shareholder value. This is particularly significant given the volatility in the energy sector, where companies must balance growth with returns. The forward-looking statements regarding the 2024 outlook, with a focus on maintaining oil volumes and generating substantial free cash flow, suggest confidence in the company's ability to sustain its financial performance amidst market fluctuations. Market Research Analyst Chord Energy's strategic emphasis on three-mile wells is indicative of an industry trend towards extended reach drilling, which can offer better resource extraction with fewer environmental impacts. The increase from 50% to an anticipated two-thirds of the drilling program dedicated to these extended laterals demonstrates a successful proof of concept in 2023 that the company is looking to capitalize on. The mention of 'continuous improvement and better efficiency' suggests that Chord Energy is not only expanding its operational footprint but also refining its processes, which may further enhance its competitiveness in the market.The projected Adjusted Free Cash Flow for 2024, based on current commodity price assumptions, is a crucial indicator for investors. It reflects the company's ability to operate profitably even in a potentially lower price environment, which is a key concern for stakeholders considering the cyclical nature of commodity prices. This projection also provides insights into the company's hedging strategies and its resilience to price fluctuations. Energy Sector Analyst Chord Energy's performance and outlook must be contextualized within the broader energy market dynamics. The reported increase in volumes and capital expenditure align with a sector-wide recovery from previous market downturns and a strategic pivot towards optimizing production with cost-effective technologies. The company's focus on 'low reinvestment rates' is a testament to its strategic capital discipline, ensuring that the revenue generated leads to significant free cash flow rather than being tied up in sustaining capital expenditures.The mention of a 'strong balance sheet' is crucial, as it suggests that Chord Energy is well-positioned to navigate potential market volatility, including fluctuations in oil prices. This financial stability is a key differentiator in the energy sector, where companies often face significant leverage issues. The emphasis on a 'capital efficient development program' further highlights the company's strategic approach to growth, prioritizing projects with the highest return on investment while maintaining financial prudence. 02/21/2024 - 05:26 PM HOUSTON, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CHRD) (""Chord"", ""Chord Energy"" or the ""Company"") today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 and announced its 2024 outlook.

Chord's deep inventory generates compelling economics and allows for low reinvestment rates, robust free cash flow and attractive return of capital. In 2023, Chord returned $646MM to shareholders through a mix of base and variable dividends supplemented by opportunistic share repurchases."" Danny Brown continued, ""As we look to this year, given the progress made and success achieved on extended laterals in 2023, three-mile wells will approximate two-thirds of the 2024 program. The Chord team will remain focused on driving continuous improvement and better efficiency throughout the organization.

At Chord, we remain excited about the oil and gas industry, the benefits we bring to the world, and are focused on sustainable value creation through responsible operations."" 4Q23 Operational and Financial Update: The following table presents select 4Q23 operational and financial data compared to guidance released in November 2023: Metric 4Q23 Actual 4Q23 Guidance Oil volumes (MBopd) 106.2 102.0 – 105.0 NGL volumes (MBblpd) 38.1 35.5 – 36.5 Natural gas volumes (MMcfpd) 236.5 224.0 – 230.0 Total volumes (MBoepd) 183.8 174.8 – 179.8 Oil premium (discount) to WTI ($/Bbl) $(0.52) $(0.85) – $1.15 NGL realization (% of WTI) 17 % 13% – 23% Residue gas realization (% of Henry Hub) 37 % 50% – 60% LOE ($/Boe) $10.05 $10.00 – $10.80 Cash GPT ($/Boe)(1) $3.04 $2.75 – $3.35 Cash G&A ($MM)(1) $13.1 $14.9 – $17.9 Production Taxes (% of oil, NGL and gas sales) 8.3 % 8.4% – 8.8% E&P & Other CapEx ($MM)(2) $208.8 $147 – $177 Cash Interest ($MM)(1) $7.5 $7.0 – $8.0 Cash Tax (% of Adjusted EBITDA)(3) 3.6 % 0% – 10% (1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

(3) Chord paid $17.2MM in cash taxes in 4Q23. Guidance based on $70/Bbl – $90/Bbl WTI. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $543.3MM and net income was $301.6MM ($6.93/diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA was $480.9MM, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $247.4MM and Adjusted Net Income was $228.0MM ($5.25/diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP. Estimated Net Proved Reserves: During 2023, the Company added 78.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (""MMBoe"") of net proved reserves as a result of successful drilling in the Williston Basin and 18.8 MMBoe from the purchase of reserves in place associated with the XTO bolt-on acquisition in June 2023. Chord's estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2023 were 636.2 MMBoe and consisted of 368.4 million barrels (""MMBbl"") of crude oil, 138.2 MMBbl of NGLs and 777.9 billion cubic feet (""Bcf"") of natural gas. The Company's estimated net proved reserves and PV-10 do not include probable or possible reserves and were determined using the preceding 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month index prices for crude oil and natural gas, which were held constant throughout the life of the properties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months were $78.22 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.64 per MMBtu for natural gas. These prices were adjusted for quality, energy content, transportation fees and market differentials. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives. Future operating costs, production taxes, plugging and abandonment costs and capital costs were based on current costs as of year end. The Company's estimated net proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2023 were based on reports independently prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., the Company's independent reserve engineers. The table below summarizes the Company's estimated net proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2023: Crude Oil (MMBbl) NGLs (MMBbl) Natural Gas (Bcf) Net EstimatedReserves (MMBoe) PV-10(1) (in millions) Developed 241.4 105.7 640.2 453.8 $ 6,572.4 Undeveloped 127.0 32.5 137.8 182.4 1,956.1 Total Proved 368.4 138.2 777.9 636.2 $ 8,528.5 (1) PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effect of income taxes on discounted future net cash flows. We believe PV-10 is a useful measure for investors when evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and gas properties and as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to our peers without regard to income taxes, which can vary between individual companies for various and unique factors. The PV-10 does not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. 2024 Outlook: Chord constructed its 2024 program to focus on capital efficiency and maximizing cash flow generation with a low reinvestment rate. The 2024 reinvestment rate is expected to be approximately 50%. Chord expects to generate approximately $1.9B of Adjusted EBITDA and $875MM of Adjusted Free Cash Flow ($79/Bbl WTI and $2.50/MMBtu Henry Hub) in 2024. Highlights of the 2024 plan include: E&P and other CapEx is expected to total approximately $905MM – $945MM. Approximately 80% of E&P and other CapEx is expected to be invested in drilling and completions;Chord plans to TIL 103 – 113 gross operated wells (approximately two-thirds 3-mile laterals) in 2024 with an average working interest of approximately 75%. Chord plans to TIL 26 – 30 gross operated wells in 1Q24; and1Q24 volumes were impacted by downtime and deferred activity in January resulting from winter storms in North Dakota. Inclusive of downtime impacts from the January winter storms, 1Q24 oil volumes are expected to be 95 MBopd – 98 MBopd. FY24 oil volumes are expected to be 97 - 101 MBopd, with volumes highest in the second-half of 2024. Midpoint FY24 oil volumes of 99 MBopd are unchanged from the soft guidance announced during our 3Q23 earnings call, despite January winter storms.The following table presents select operational and financial guidance for 1Q24 and FY24: Metric 1Q24 Guidance FY24 Guidance Oil volumes (MBopd) 95.0 – 98.0 97.0 – 101.0 NGL volumes (MBblpd) 33.0 – 34.0 34.0 – 35.0 Natural gas volumes (MMcfpd) 217.0 – 223.0 217.5 – 223.5 Total volumes (MBoepd) 164.2 – 169.2 167.3 – 173.3 Oil premium (discount) to WTI ($/Bbl) $(2.30) – $(1.30) $(1.75) – $0.00 NGL realization (% of WTI) 15% – 25% 15% – 25% Residue gas realization (% of Henry Hub) 55% – 65% 45% – 55% LOE ($/Boe) $10.70 – $11.50 $10.60 – $11.40 Cash GPT ($/Boe)(1) $2.80 – $3.40 $2.30 – $2.90 Cash G&A ($MM)(1) $16.5 – $19.5 $63.0 – $73.0 Production Taxes (% of oil, NGL and gas sales) 8.4% – 8.8% 8.4% – 8.8% E&P & Other CapEx ($MM) $230 – $260 $905 – $945 Cash Interest ($MM)(1) $7.0 – $8.0 $28.0 – $32.0 Cash Tax (% of Adjusted EBITDA)(2) 0% – 5% 3% – 9% (1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company believes that the foregoing are useful supplemental measures that provide an indication of the results generated by the Company's principal business activities. However, these measures are not recognized by GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. From time to time, the Company provides forward-looking forecasts of these measures; however, the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because management cannot reliably quantify certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measures. The reconciling items in future periods could be significant. To see how the Company reconciles its historical presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please visit the Investors—Documents & Disclosures—Non-GAAP Reconciliation page on the Company's website at https://ir.chordenergy.com/non-gaap. Cash GPT The Company defines Cash GPT as total GPT expenses less non-cash valuation charges on pipeline imbalances and non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts accounted for as derivative instruments. Cash GPT is not a measure of GPT expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash GPT provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the cash costs incurred to market and transport the Company's commodities from the wellhead to delivery points for sale without regard to the change in value of its pipeline imbalances, which vary monthly based on commodity prices, and without regard to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts classified as derivative instruments. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of GPT expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash GPT for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) GPT $ 47,513 $ 41,885 $ 180,219 $ 141,644 Pipeline imbalances 135 (1,133) (7,768) (4,570) Gain on derivative transportation contracts 3,723 393 20,570 7,331 Cash GPT $ 51,371 $ 41,145 $ 193,021 $ 144,405 Cash G&A The Company defines Cash G&A as total G&A expenses less G&A expenses directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting, non-cash equity-based compensation expenses, G&A expenses attributable to shared service allocations and other non-cash charges. Cash G&A is not a measure of G&A expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash G&A provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the Company's operating costs in comparison to peers without regard to the aforementioned charges, which can vary substantially from company to company. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of G&A expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash G&A for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) General and administrative expenses $ 25,545 $ 58,084 $ 126,319 $ 209,299 Merger costs(1) — (13,360) (9,701) (97,739) Equity-based compensation expenses (8,849) (20,918) (46,108) (43,378) G&A expenses attributable to shared services — — — (1,624) Other non-cash adjustments (3,640) (1,446) (7,804) (3,330) Cash G&A $ 13,056 $ 22,360 $ 62,706 $ 63,228 (1) Includes costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash Interest The Company defines Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization and write-offs of deferred financing costs. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash Interest provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the interest charges incurred on the Company's debt to finance its operating activities and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants. The following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 6,344 $ 6,539 $ 28,630 $ 29,349 Capitalized interest 531 1,844 4,133 4,647 Amortization of deferred financing costs 610 (1,191) (3,023) (4,008) Cash Interest $ 7,485 $ 7,192 $ 29,740 $ 29,988 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (""DD&A""), merger costs, exploration expenses and impairment expenses and other similar non-cash or non-recurring charges. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations less Cash Interest and E&P and other capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest and acquisition capital). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not measures of net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the Company's results of operations, financial performance, ability to generate cash from its business operations without regard to its financing methods or capital structure and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants. The following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income including non-controlling interests and net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Net income including non-controlling interests $ 301,633 $ 377,568 $ 1,023,779 $ 1,858,470 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 6,344 6,539 28,630 33,034 Income tax expense (benefit) 88,049 (43,532) 315,249 54,196 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 167,432 141,803 598,562 369,659 Merger costs(1) — 13,360 9,701 97,739 Exploration and impairment expenses 2,073 506 35,330 2,204 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 6,502 (2,272) 2,764 (523,767) Net (gain) loss on derivative instruments (51,935) 79,361 (63,182) 208,128 Realized loss on derivative commodity price derivatives (50,463) (129,772) (256,692) (561,105) Net (gain) loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 91 4,612 (21,330) (34,366) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 2,307 3,266 10,806 43,873 Equity-based compensation expenses 8,849 20,918 46,108 43,426 Other non-cash adjustments 59 3,273 (1,753) 703 Adjusted EBITDA 480,941 475,630 1,727,972 1,592,194 Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations — — — (12,296) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 480,941 475,630 1,727,972 1,579,898 Cash Interest (7,485) (7,192) (29,739) (29,988) E&P and other capital expenditures (208,846) (164,074) (922,338) (503,071) Cash taxes paid (17,195) — (17,195) — Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 247,415 $ 304,364 $ 758,700 $ 1,046,839 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 543,334 $ 478,391 $ 1,819,851 $ 1,924,026 Changes in working capital 7,541 105,805 91,866 46,560 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 6,344 6,539 28,630 33,034 Current income tax (benefit) expense (30,820) (5,205) 19,701 25,855 Merger costs(1) — 13,360 9,701 79,894 Exploration expenses 2,073 1,923 6,367 2,548 Realized loss on commodity price derivatives (50,463) (129,772) (256,692) (561,105) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 2,307 3,266 10,806 43,873 Deferred financing costs amortization and other 566 (1,950) (505) (3,194) Other non-cash adjustments 59 3,273 (1,753) 703 Adjusted EBITDA 480,941 475,630 1,727,972 1,592,194 Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations — — — (12,296) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 480,941 475,630 1,727,972 1,579,898 Cash Interest (7,485) (7,192) (29,739) (29,988) E&P and other capital expenditures(2) (208,846) (164,074) (922,338) (503,071) Cash taxes paid (17,195) — (17,195) — Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 247,415 $ 304,364 $ 758,700 $ 1,046,839 (1) Includes costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. (2) The year ended December 31, 2023 includes $14.5MM of E&P and other CapEx related to divested non-operated assets that will be reimbursed. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Attributable to Chord Per Share Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Attributable to Chord Per Share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord as net income attributable to Chord after adjusting for (1) the impact of certain non-cash items, including non-cash changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, non-cash changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, impairment and other similar non-cash charges, (2) merger costs and (3) the impact of taxes based on the Company's effective tax rate applicable to those adjusting items in the same period. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. The Company calculates earnings per share under the two-class method in accordance with GAAP. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that computes earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Attributable to Chord Per Share is calculated as (i) Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord (ii) less distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (iii) divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the periods presented. The following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measure of net income attributable to Chord to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Chord and the GAAP financial measure of diluted earnings attributable to Chord per share to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Attributable to Chord Per Share for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Net income attributable to Chord $ 301,633 $ 377,568 $ 1,023,779 $ 1,856,159 Net (gain) loss on derivative instruments (51,935) 79,361 (63,182) 208,128 Realized loss on commodity price derivatives (50,463) (129,772) (256,692) (561,105) Net (gain) from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 91 4,612 (21,330) (34,366) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 2,307 3,266 10,806 43,873 Impairment — (1,417) 28,964 (344) Merger costs(1) — 13,360 9,701 97,739 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 6,502 (2,272) 2,764 (523,767) Amortization of deferred financing costs (610) 1,191 3,023 4,177 Other non-cash adjustments 59 3,273 (1,753) 703 Tax impact(2) 21,250 6,901 67,520 187,403 Other tax adjustments(3) — (125,465) — (400,823) Adjusted net income attributable to Chord 228,834 230,606 803,600 877,777 Adjusted net income attributable to Chord from discontinued operations — — — (6,142) Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (842) (74) (2,482) (96) Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders $ 227,992 $ 230,532 $ 801,118 $ 871,539 Diluted earnings attributable to Chord per share 6.95 $ 8.64 23.59 $ 57.55 Net (gain) loss on derivative instruments (1.20) 1.82 (1.46) 6.45 Realized loss on commodity price derivatives (1.16) (2.97) (5.91) (17.40) Net (gain) from investment in unconsolidated affiliate — 0.11 (0.49) (1.07) Distributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 0.05 0.07 0.25 1.36 Impairment — (0.03) 0.67 (0.01) Merger costs(1) — 0.31 0.22 3.03 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 0.15 (0.05) 0.06 (16.24) Amortization of deferred financing costs (0.01) 0.03 0.07 0.13 Other non-cash adjustments — 0.06 (0.04) 0.04 Tax impact(2) 0.49 0.16 1.56 5.81 Other tax adjustments(3) — (2.87) — (12.43) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Attributable to Chord Per Share 5.27 5.28 18.52 27.22 Less: Adjusted Diluted Earnings From Discontinued Operations Attributable to Chord Per Share — — — (0.19) Less: Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (0.02) — (0.06) — Adjusted Diluted Earnings From Continuing Operations Attributable to Chord Per Share $ 5.25 $ 5.28 $ 18.46 $ 27.03 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 43,378 43,667 43,398 32,251 Effective tax rate applicable to adjustment items(2) 22.6 % 24.3 % 23.5 % 24.4 % (1) Includes costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. announces a $300 million common stock offering to support its long-term strategy including investment in facilities, expansion of manufacturing capacity, and strengthening the balance sheet. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. of a $300 million underwritten offering of common stock, with a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase an additional $45 million, reflects a strategic move to bolster the company's financial position. This capital raise is a significant event, as it indicates the company's proactive approach to funding its long-term strategy, which includes expanding manufacturing capacity, investing in facilities and preparing for potential large contract opportunities.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes and debt reduction is a prudent measure, likely aimed at improving the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage. This could potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating and lower cost of capital in the future. Additionally, the timing and successful execution of the offering could be indicative of market confidence in Kratos's growth prospects and the defense sector's stability. Market Research Analyst The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-runners and passive book-runners suggests a positive market reception and a well-structured offering. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could also serve as a barometer for investor appetite, which, if exercised, would further validate market support for Kratos's strategic initiatives.It is important for stakeholders to assess the dilutive impact of the new shares on existing shareholdings. However, if the capital is deployed effectively, leading to growth in revenues and expansion of market share, the long-term benefits could outweigh the dilution. The defense sector's growth is often driven by geopolitical tensions and government defense spending, factors that may influence Kratos's performance and, by extension, the success of this offering. Economist The decision to expand manufacturing capacity and invest in facilities comes against the backdrop of an evolving global defense landscape, where technological advancement and modernization are critical. Kratos's focus on sole-source/single award programs indicates a competitive edge in specialized segments of the defense market. Such strategic investments can lead to increased efficiency and cost competitiveness, which are vital in winning government contracts.Moreover, strengthening the balance sheet in anticipation of large, new program and contract opportunities reflects a forward-looking approach to capital allocation. The defense industry is characterized by long procurement cycles and high entry barriers, making financial robustness crucial for companies like Kratos to capitalize on upcoming opportunities and navigate the procurement process successfully. 02/21/2024 - 05:18 PM SAN DIEGO, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.

(NTR) reported fourth quarter 2023 results with net earnings of $176 million and adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. The company expects higher fertilizer sales volumes and Retail earnings in 2024. Despite a decline in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, Nutrien aims for growth through strategic initiatives and increased crop input market stability. Positive Nutrien achieved net earnings of $1.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 billion in 2023. The company returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2023. Nutrien's Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. The company expects global potash demand to recover in 2024 with full-year shipments projected between 68 to 71 million tonnes. Nutrien anticipates lower potash imports from China in 2024 but expects demand to remain high. Global industrial nitrogen demand remains a risk in 2024 as industrial production has yet to rebound to historical levels. Negative Adjusted EBITDA declined in 2023 due to lower net realized selling prices and lower Retail earnings. Potash full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA declined to $2.4 billion due to lower net realized selling prices. Nitrogen full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1.9 billion due to lower net realized selling prices. A $76 million non-cash impairment was recognized in the Nitrogen segment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Global industrial nitrogen demand remains a risk in 2024. Market Research Analyst The fourth quarter results for Nutrien Ltd. indicating strong fertilizer market fundamentals, especially in North America, are suggestive of a robust demand environment for agricultural inputs. The increased sales volumes and growth in Retail earnings are indicative of a positive trend in the agricultural sector, which is likely to be buoyed by stable crop input prices and a strong fall application season. The implications of this for stakeholders are multifaceted. In the short term, investors may see improved company performance as a driver for potential stock appreciation. Long-term implications include the possibility of sustained growth if the company can maintain its low-cost position and capitalize on the projected increase in global potash demand.From a market research perspective, the mention of geopolitical issues and weather patterns affecting grain and oilseed production highlights the volatility inherent in the agricultural sector. This could potentially introduce risks to Nutrien's future performance, as external factors could disrupt market stability. Furthermore, the company's strategic initiatives to enhance grower service capabilities and asset reliability are critical in maintaining competitive advantage in a market where differentiation is often challenging. The planned expansion in soybean acreage in Brazil and the expected increase in potash demand in Southeast Asia are also significant, as they suggest regional market opportunities that Nutrien could leverage. Financial Analyst Regarding Nutrien's financial performance, the net earnings of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with the adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, reflect a decrease from 2022's record levels. This decline is primarily attributed to lower net realized selling prices across all segments and lower Retail earnings. The cash flow from operations, which represents 84 percent of adjusted EBITDA, indicates strong operational efficiency. However, the $76 million non-cash impairment in the Nitrogen segment is a concern as it may have implications for future profitability, especially given the outlook for higher expected natural gas costs and constrained near-term availability in Trinidad.The company's proactive shareholder return strategy, evidenced by the $2.1 billion returned through dividends and share repurchases and the increase in the quarterly dividend, is a strong signal of confidence in the company's financial health. The approval of the NCIB suggests that the company believes its shares are undervalued. This could be an attractive point for current and potential investors, as it indicates a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Agricultural Economist From an agricultural economics standpoint, the report's indication of historically low global grain stocks-to-use ratios going into the 2024 growing season has significant implications for the fertilizer market. Tightening supplies of wheat and rice, offset by increased corn supplies, could lead to increased volatility in crop prices, which in turn affects fertilizer demand. The expected range for US corn and soybean plantings in 2024 provides insights into potential domestic demand for fertilizers. Moreover, the potential impact of an El Niño weather pattern poses a risk to the 2024 growing season, which could disrupt production and affect market dynamics.The anticipated recovery of global potash demand towards trend levels and the expected nitrogen supply constraints are critical for understanding the supply-demand balance in the fertilizer market. The competitive natural gas prices in North America relative to Europe and Asia are also noteworthy, as they could influence the cost structure of nitrogen fertilizer production and, consequently, the pricing strategies of companies like Nutrien. 02/21/2024 - 05:26 PM Fourth quarter results reflect strong fertilizer market fundamentals in North America. Expect increased fertilizer sales volumes and growth in Retail earnings in 2024. All amounts are in US dollars except as otherwise noted SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nutrien Ltd. (TSX and NYSE: NTR) announced today its fourth quarter 2023 results, with net earnings of $176 million ($0.35 diluted net earnings per share). Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted net earnings per share1 was $0.37 and adjusted EBITDA1 was $1.1 billion. “We saw a continuation of strong fertilizer market fundamentals in North America during the fourth quarter driven by improved affordability, an extended fall application season and low channel inventories. Utilizing the strengths of our integrated business, we achieved record fourth-quarter potash deliveries, increased crop nutrient sales volumes across our global Retail network and generated strong cash flow from operations,” commented Ken Seitz, Nutrien’s President and CEO. “As we look ahead to 2024, we expect to deliver higher fertilizer sales volumes and Retail earnings, supported by increased crop input market stability and demand. We continue to prioritize strategic initiatives that enhance our capability to serve growers in our core markets, maintain the low-cost position and reliability of our assets, and position the Company for growth,” added Mr. Seitz. Highlights2: Generated net earnings of $1.3 billion ($2.53 diluted net earnings per share) and adjusted EBITDA1 of $6.1 billion ($4.44 adjusted net earnings per share1) in 2023, down from the record levels achieved in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA declined primarily due to lower net realized selling prices across all segments and lower Nutrien Ag Solutions (“Retail”) earnings. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.1 billion in 2023, representing 84 percent of adjusted EBITDA. Retail adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion in 2023 decreased primarily due to lower gross margin for both crop nutrients and crop protection products, as we sold through high-cost inventory. Crop nutrient sales volumes increased as growers returned to more normalized application rates to replenish nutrients in the soil. We continued to grow our proprietary nutritional and biostimulant sales and margins through differentiated product offerings and expanded manufacturing capacity. Potash full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA declined to $2.4 billion due to lower net realized selling prices. We delivered record fourth quarter potash sales volumes driven by strong demand in North America and increased offshore sales. Nitrogen full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1.9 billion due to lower net realized selling prices for all major nitrogen products, which more than offset lower natural gas costs and higher sales volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a $76 million non-cash impairment in our Nitrogen segment relating to our Trinidad property, plant and equipment due to a new natural gas contract and the resulting outlook for higher expected natural gas costs and constrained near-term availability. We expect improved natural gas availability in Trinidad as the development of additional gas fields is anticipated to add new supply starting in 2026. Returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Nutrien’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. Nutrien continues to target a stable and growing dividend with our dividend per share increasing by 35 percent since the beginning of 2018. Nutrien’s Board of Directors also approved the purchase of up to 5 percent of Nutrien’s outstanding common shares over a twelve-month period through a normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”). The NCIB is subject to acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange. 1. These are non-GAAP financial measures. See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further information. 2. Our discussion of highlights set out on this page is a comparison of the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 to the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise noted. Market Outlook and Guidance Agriculture and Retail Global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain historically low going into the 2024 growing season as tightening supplies of wheat and rice have offset increased corn supplies in the US and Brazil. We expect weather and geopolitical issues will continue to impact grain and oilseed production, exports and inventory levels. Crop prices have declined from historically high levels in 2022, but lower crop input prices have resulted in improved demand, evidenced by the strong North American fall application season in 2023. We expect US corn plantings to range from 91 to 92 million acres in 2024 and soybean plantings to range from 87 to 88 million acres. In Brazil, dry weather during the summer crop growing season and lower corn prices could result in lower corn area in 2024. Brazilian growers are expected to continue to expand soybean acreage, which we anticipate will support the need for strong fertilizer imports in the second and third quarters of 2024. In Australia, growers have benefited from multiple years of above-average yields and fundamentals remain supportive entering 2024. Timely precipitation led to higher-than-expected winter crop production, however if the El Niño weather pattern continues, it could pose a risk for the 2024 growing season. Crop Nutrient Markets Global potash demand was strong through the second half of 2023, and we estimate full-year shipments were between 67 to 68 million tonnes. The increase was supported by strong consumption and increased imports in key markets such as North America, China and Brazil. We expect global potash demand will continue to recover towards trend levels in 2024 with full-year shipments projected between 68 to 71 million tonnes. We anticipate a relatively balanced global market with incremental supply from producers in Canada, Russia, Belarus and Laos. We are seeing strong potash demand ahead of the North American spring application season as channel inventories were tight to start the year. Potash demand in Southeast Asia is expected to increase significantly in 2024 due to much lower inventory levels compared to the prior year and favorable economics for key crops such as oil palm and rice. We expect lower potash imports from China compared to the record levels in 2023 but for demand to remain at historically high levels driven by increased consumption. We expect nitrogen supply constraints to persist in 2024, including limited Russian ammonia exports, reduced European operating rates and Chinese urea export restrictions. North American natural gas prices remain highly competitive compared to Europe and Asia, and we expect Henry Hub natural gas prices to average approximately $2.50 per MMBtu for the year. The US nitrogen supply and demand balance is projected to be tight ahead of the spring application season, as nitrogen fertilizer net imports in the first half of the 2023/2024 fertilizer year were down an estimated 55 percent compared to the three-year average. Global industrial nitrogen demand remains a risk in 2024 as industrial production, most notably in Europe and Asia, has yet to rebound to historical levels. Phosphate fertilizer markets have remained relatively strong in the first quarter of 2024, particularly in North America where channel inventories were low entering the year. We expect Chinese phosphate exports to be similar to 2023 levels and tight stocks in India to support demand ahead of their key planting season. Financial Guidance We have revised our guidance practice in 2024 to provide forward looking estimates on those metrics that we believe are of value to our shareholders and are less impacted by fertilizer commodity prices. We continue to provide guidance for Retail adjusted EBITDA, fertilizer sales volumes and other key financial modeling metrics as well as fertilizer pricing sensitivities. Retail adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.65 to $1.85 billion assumes increased gross margins in all major product lines compared to 2023. We anticipate that crop nutrient gross margin will be supported by higher sales volumes and per-tonne margins, in particular compared to the compressed levels in the first half of the prior year. We expect a recovery in Brazilian crop protection margins in the second half of 2024. Potash sales volume guidance of 13.0 to 13.8 million tonnes assumes demand growth in offshore markets and a return to more normal Canpotex port operations in 2024. In North America, we expect increased first quarter sales volumes compared to the prior year due to strong customer engagement to refill depleted inventories. Nitrogen sales volume guidance of 10.6 to 11.2 million tonnes assumes higher operating rates at our US and Trinidad plants compared to 2023. Phosphate sales volume guidance of 2.6 to 2.8 million tonnes assumes improved operating rates compared to the prior year. Total capital expenditures of $2.2 to $2.3 billion are expected to be below the prior year. This total includes approximately $500 million in investing capital expenditures focused on proprietary products, network optimization and digital capabilities in Retail, mine automation projects in Potash, and low-cost brownfield expansions in Nitrogen. All guidance numbers, including those noted above are outlined in the table below.

See the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. 2 This is a supplementary financial measure. See the ""Other Financial Measures"" section. Net earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, mainly due to lower net realized selling prices across all segments and lower Retail earnings. This was partially offset by decreased cost of goods sold from lower natural gas and royalty costs, lower provincial mining taxes, higher sales volumes for Retail crop nutrients and increased Potash and Nitrogen sales volumes. For the full year of 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment of assets of $774 million in aggregate primarily related to Retail – South America goodwill and Nitrogen and Phosphate property, plant and equipment, resulting in lower net earnings. For the full year of 2022, we recorded a non-cash impairment reversal of an aggregate of $780 million related to our Phosphate assets. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was primarily due to lower earnings across all segments.

See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Retail adjusted EBITDA decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower gross margin for crop protection products and higher expenses. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was lower mostly due to lower gross margin for both crop nutrients and crop protection products. Included within expenses for the full year of 2023, we recognized a $465 million non-cash impairment primarily related to goodwill of our South American Retail assets. The impairment was mainly due to the impact of crop input price volatility, more moderate long-term growth assumptions and higher interest rates. Crop nutrients sales and gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to lower selling prices across all regions compared to the strong comparable periods in 2022. Sales volumes increased for both the fourth quarter and full year as growers returned to more normalized application rates to replenish nutrients in the soil. Full year sales and gross margin of our proprietary nutritional and biostimulant product lines increased compared to 2022 levels as we continued to expand our differentiated product offering and manufacturing capacity. Crop protection products sales and gross margin were lower in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 primarily due to decreased selling prices compared to the historically strong comparable periods in 2022. This was partially offset by higher fourth quarter sales in North America as growers returned to more normalized buying behaviors. Gross margin in 2023 was also impacted by the selling through of high-cost inventory, which in the fourth quarter was primarily related to South America. Seed sales and gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower soybean sales volumes and competitive market prices in South America. Full-year sales increased primarily due to increased corn sales in the US, while gross margin saw little change compared to the prior year. Nutrien Financial sales increased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to higher utilization of our financing offerings in the US and Australia compared to the same periods in 2022.

Potash adjusted EBITDA declined in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to lower net realized selling prices, which more than offset higher North American sales volumes and lower provincial mining taxes and royalties. We increased granular potash production in the fourth quarter to meet customer demand and reduced our controllable cash cost of product manufactured to $56 per tonne. Sales volumes in North America were higher in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to lower channel inventory and increased grower demand supported by an extended fall application window and improved affordability. Offshore sales volumes were higher in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the prior year driven by stronger demand in Brazil and China. Full-year offshore sales volumes were lower compared to the record levels in 2022 primarily due to logistical challenges at Canpotex’s West Coast port facilities and reduced shipments to customers in India and Southeast Asia. Net realized selling price decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to the historically strong periods in 2022, due to a decline in benchmark prices and higher costs related to logistical challenges at Canpotex’s West Coast port facilities. Cost of goods sold per tonne decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 mainly due to lower royalties. Fourth quarter costs were also lower due to the timing of turnaround activity.

See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Nitrogen adjusted EBITDA was lower in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to lower net realized selling prices for all major nitrogen products, which more than offset lower natural gas costs and higher sales volumes. Our fourth quarter ammonia operating rate increased to 91 percent1 compared to 83 percent in the same period in 2022 primarily due to improved reliability and the absence of major weather-related unplanned outages. We recognized a $76 million non-cash impairment of our Trinidad property, plant and equipment during the fourth quarter due to a new natural gas contract and the resulting outlook for higher expected natural gas costs and constrained near-term availability. We expect improved natural gas availability in Trinidad as the development of additional gas fields is anticipated to add new supply starting in 2026. Sales volumes were higher in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 primarily due to higher UAN production and sales, partially offset by lower ammonia availability mainly due to production outages at our plants in Trinidad. Net realized selling price was lower in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 for all major nitrogen products primarily due to weaker benchmark prices resulting from lower energy prices in key nitrogen producing regions. Cost of goods sold per tonne decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to lower natural gas costs. Ammonia controllable cash cost of product manufactured per tonne increased in 2023 mainly due to the impact of lower ammonia production. 1 Excludes Trinidad and Joffre.

See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Phosphate adjusted EBITDA increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower sulfur and ammonia input costs, partially offset by lower net realized selling prices. Full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was lower compared to the prior year mainly due to lower net realized selling prices for fertilizer products, partially offset by lower ammonia and sulfur input costs. Included in the expenses for the full year of 2023, we recognized a $233 million non-cash impairment of our White Springs property, plant and equipment, while we had non-cash impairment reversals of our Phosphate assets of $780 million for the full year of 2022. Sales volumes increased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 mostly due to higher phosphate fertilizer demand, with the full year being partially offset by lower first-half production impacting our industrial and feed sales. Production increased in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 largely due to improved reliability at our Aurora plant. Net realized selling price decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 primarily due to lower fertilizer net realized selling prices and lower industrial and feed net realized selling prices which reflect the typical lag in price realizations relative to spot fertilizer prices. Cost of goods sold per tonne decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 mainly due to lower ammonia and sulfur costs, partially offset by higher depreciation from reversal of non-cash impairment of assets in 2022.

General and administrative expenses were higher in the full year of 2023 primarily due to higher staffing costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Share-based compensation was a recovery in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 due to a decrease in the fair value of share-based awards outstanding relative to the comparable periods in 2022. The fair value takes into consideration several factors such as our share price movement, our performance relative to our peer group and return on our invested capital. Other expenses were higher in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to the following: Higher expense for asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs related to our non-operating sites due to changes in closure cost estimates. $92 million loss on Blue Chip Swaps through trade transactions to remit cash from Argentina in the second quarter of 2023. The loss is a result of the significant divergence between the Blue Chip Swap market exchange rate and the official Argentinian Central Bank rate. Higher foreign exchange losses primarily from our Retail – South America region. The above expenses were partially offset by an $80 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2023 from amendments due to design plan changes to our other post-retirement benefit plans. Eliminations Eliminations are not part of the Corporate and Others segment. The elimination of gross margin between operating segments was $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a recovery of $47 million in the same period of 2022. For the full year of 2023, there was a recovery of $69 million compared to an elimination of $28 million in the same period in 2022. These variances are due to the timing of release of intersegment inventories held by our Retail segment.

The full year of 2023 expense and effective tax rate reflect a $134 million income tax recovery due to changes to our tax declarations in Switzerland (“Swiss Tax Reform adjustment”) and a $101 million income tax expense due to a change in recognition of deferred tax assets in our Retail - South America region. The 2023 effective tax rates also include the impact of our losses in Retail – South America, wherein we did not recognize a corresponding deferred tax asset as it did not meet the accounting criteria for asset recognition. Other comprehensive income (loss) was primarily driven by changes in the currency translation of our Retail foreign operations primarily due to improvements of Canadian and Australian currencies relative to the US dollar for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. For the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, we recognized actuarial gains on our defined benefit plans compared to losses on the comparative periods driven by changes in our financial and demographic assumptions and performance of our plan assets.

Appendix B – Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use both International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) measures and certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures disclosed by the Company that (a) depict historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of the Company, (b) with respect to their composition, exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the primary financial statements of the Company, (c) are not disclosed in the financial statements of the Company and (d) are not a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation. Non-GAAP ratios are financial measures disclosed by the Company that are in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation that has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components, and that are not disclosed in the financial statements of the Company. These non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are not standardized financial measures under IFRS and, therefore, are unlikely to be comparable to similar financial measures presented by other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide transparent and useful supplemental information to help investors evaluate our financial performance, financial condition and liquidity using the same measures as management. These non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following section outlines our non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, their compositions, and why management uses each measure. It also includes reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Except as otherwise described herein, our non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, as applicable. As additional non-recurring or unusual items arise in the future, we generally exclude these items in our calculations. Adjusted EBITDA (Consolidated) Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Net earnings (loss). Definition: Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain foreign exchange gain/loss (net of related derivatives). We also adjust this measure for the following other income and expenses that are excluded when management evaluates the performance of our day-to-day operations: integration and restructuring related costs, impairment or reversal of impairment of assets, COVID-19 related expenses, gain or loss on disposal of certain businesses and investments, asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) and accrued environmental costs (“ERL”) related to our non-operating sites, and loss on remitting cash from certain foreign jurisdictions (e.g., Blue Chip Swaps). In 2023, we amended our calculation of adjusted EBITDA to adjust for the asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs related to our non-operating sites and the loss on remitting cash from certain foreign jurisdictions. We do not consider these to be part of our day-to-day operations. There were no similar income and expense in the comparative periods. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: It is not impacted by long-term investment and financing decisions, but rather focuses on the performance of our day-to-day operations. It provides a measure of our ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations and as a component of employee remuneration calculations. Three Months Ended December 31 Twelve Months Ended December 31 (millions of US dollars) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings 176 1,118 1,282 7,687 Finance costs 213 188 793 563 Income tax (recovery) expense (96 ) 353 670 2,559 Depreciation and amortization 565 520 2,169 2,012 EBITDA 1 858 2,179 4,914 12,821 Adjustments: Integration and restructuring related costs 20 11 49 46 Share-based compensation (recovery) expense (7 ) (59 ) (14 ) 63 Impairment (reversal of impairment) of assets 76 ‐ 774 (780 ) ARO/ERL expense for non-operating sites 142 ‐ 152 ‐ Foreign exchange (gain) loss, net of related derivatives (14 ) (36 ) 91 31 Loss on Blue Chip Swaps ‐ ‐ 92 ‐ Gain on disposal of investment ‐ ‐ ‐ (19 ) COVID-19 related expenses ² ‐ ‐ ‐ 8 Adjusted EBITDA 1,075 2,095 6,058 12,170 1 EBITDA is calculated as net earnings before finance costs, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. 2 COVID-19 related expenses primarily consist of increased cleaning and sanitization costs, the purchase of personal protective equipment, discretionary supplemental employee costs, and costs related to construction delays from access limitations and other government restrictions. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Net earnings (loss) and diluted net earnings (loss) per share. Definition: Adjusted net earnings and related per share information are calculated as net earnings (loss) before share-based compensation and certain foreign exchange gain/loss (net of related derivatives), net of tax. We also adjust this measure for the following other income and expenses (net of tax) that are excluded when management evaluates the performance of our day-to-day operations: certain integration and restructuring related costs, impairment or reversal of impairment of assets, COVID-19 related expenses (including those recorded under finance costs), gain or loss on disposal of certain businesses and investments, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt or on settlement of derivatives due to discontinuance of hedge accounting, asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs related to our non-operating sites, loss on remitting cash from certain foreign jurisdictions (e.g., Blue Chip Swaps), change in recognition of tax losses and deductible temporary differences related to impairments and certain changes to tax declarations in Switzerland (“Swiss Tax Reform adjustment"") resulting in an income tax recovery from the recognition of a deferred tax asset. In 2023, we amended our calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to adjust for the asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs related to our non-operating sites, the loss on remitting cash from certain foreign jurisdictions, the change in recognition of Retail – South America tax losses and deductible temporary differences and the Swiss Tax Reform adjustment. We do not consider these to be part of our day-to-day operations. There were no similar income and expense in the comparative periods. We generally apply the annual forecasted effective tax rate to our adjustments during the year, and at year-end, we apply the actual effective tax rate. Prior to December 31, 2023, we applied a specific tax rate for material adjustments. Effective December 31, 2023, we applied a tax rate specific to each adjustment. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: Focuses on the performance of our day-to-day operations and is used as a component of employee remuneration calculations.

Definition: Gross margin per tonne less depreciation and amortization per tonne for manufactured products. Reconciliations are provided in the “Segment Results” section. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: Focuses on the performance of our day-to-day operations, which excludes the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions. Potash Controllable Cash Cost of Product Manufactured (“COPM”) Per Tonne Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Cost of goods sold (“COGS”) for the Potash segment. Definition: Total Potash COGS excluding depreciation and amortization expense included in COPM, royalties, natural gas costs and carbon taxes, change in inventory, and other adjustments, divided by potash production tonnes. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: To assess operational performance. Potash controllable cash COPM excludes the effects of production from other periods and the impacts of our long-term investment decisions, supporting a focus on the performance of our day-to-day operations. Potash controllable cash COPM also excludes royalties and natural gas costs and carbon taxes, which management does not consider controllable, as they are primarily driven by regulatory and market conditions. Three Months Ended December 31 Twelve Months Ended December 31 (millions of US dollars, except as otherwise noted) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total COGS – Potash 349 310 1,396 1,400 Change in inventory 7 38 (40 ) 58 Other adjustments 1 (7 ) (12 ) (26 ) (41 ) COPM 349 336 1,330 1,417 Depreciation and amortization in COPM (124 ) (89 ) (427 ) (406 ) Royalties in COPM (23 ) (40 ) (100 ) (190 ) Natural gas costs and carbon taxes in COPM (12 ) (17 ) (46 ) (62 ) Controllable cash COPM 190 190 757 759 Production tonnes (tonnes – thousands) 3,386 2,941 12,998 13,007 Potash controllable cash COPM per tonne 56 65 58 58 1 Other adjustments include unallocated production overhead that is recognized as part of cost of goods sold but is not included in the measurement of inventory and changes in inventory balances. Ammonia Controllable Cash COPM Per Tonne Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Total manufactured COGS for the Nitrogen segment. Definition: Total Nitrogen COGS excluding depreciation and amortization expense included in COGS, cash COGS for products other than ammonia, other adjustments, and natural gas and steam costs, divided by net ammonia production tonnes. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: To assess operational performance. Ammonia controllable cash COPM excludes the effects of production from other periods, the costs of natural gas and steam, and long-term investment decisions, supporting a focus on the performance of our day-to-day operations. Three Months Ended December 31 Twelve Months Ended December 31 (millions of US dollars, except as otherwise noted) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total Manufactured COGS – Nitrogen 1 595 892 2,435 3,370 Total Other COGS – Nitrogen 1 76 201 393 882 Total COGS – Nitrogen 671 1,093 2,828 4,252 Depreciation and amortization in COGS (123 ) (131 ) (474 ) (465 ) Cash COGS for products other than ammonia (367 ) (648 ) (1,693 ) (2,560 ) Ammonia Total cash COGS before other adjustments 181 314 661 1,227 Other adjustments 2 (76 ) (65 ) (222 ) (210 ) Total cash COPM 105 249 439 1,017 Natural gas and steam costs in COPM (73 ) (212 ) (304 ) (855 ) Controllable cash COPM 32 37 135 162 Production tonnes (net tonnes 3 – thousands) 564 655 2,276 2,754 Ammonia controllable cash COPM per tonne 59 57 60 59 1 Certain immaterial 2022 figures have been reclassified. 2 Other adjustments include unallocated production overhead that is recognized as part of cost of goods sold but is not included in the measurement of inventory and changes in inventory balances. 3 Ammonia tonnes available for sale, as not upgraded to other nitrogen products. Retail Adjusted Average Working Capital to Sales and Retail Adjusted Average Working Capital to Sales Excluding Nutrien Financial Definition: Retail adjusted average working capital divided by Retail adjusted sales for the last four rolling quarters. We exclude in our calculations the sales and working capital of certain acquisitions during the first year following the acquisition. We also look at this metric excluding Nutrien Financial revenue and working capital. Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investors: To evaluate operational efficiency.

The following section provides an explanation of the composition of those supplementary financial measures if not previously provided. Retail adjusted EBITDA margin: Retail adjusted EBITDA divided by Retail sales for the last four rolling quarters. Sustaining capital expenditures: Represents capital expenditures that are required to sustain operations at existing levels and include major repairs and maintenance and plant turnarounds. Investing capital expenditures: Represents capital expenditures related to significant expansions of current operations or to create cost savings (synergies). Investing capital expenditures excludes capital outlays for business acquisitions and equity-accounted investees. Mine development and pre-stripping capital expenditures: Represents capital expenditures that are required for activities to open new areas underground and/or develop a mine or ore body to allow for future production mining and activities required to prepare and/or access the ore, i.e., removal of an overburden that allows access to the ore. Retail adjusted EBITDA per US selling location: Calculated as total Retail US adjusted EBITDA for the last four rolling quarters, representing the organic EBITDA component, which excludes acquisitions in those quarters, divided by the number of US locations that have generated sales in the last four rolling quarters, adjusted for acquired locations in those quarters. Cash used for dividends and share repurchases (shareholder returns): Calculated as dividends paid to Nutrien’s shareholders plus repurchase of common shares as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. This measure is useful as it represents return of capital to shareholders.

(collectively with its subsidiaries, “Nutrien”, “we”, “us”, “our” or “the Company”) is the world’s largest provider of crop inputs and services. Nutrien plays a critical role in helping growers around the globe increase food production in a sustainable manner. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (“interim financial statements”) are based on International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”. The accounting policies and methods of computation used in preparing these interim financial statements are materially consistent with those used in the preparation of our 2022 annual consolidated financial statements. These interim financial statements include the accounts of Nutrien and its subsidiaries; however, they do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our 2022 annual consolidated financial statements. Certain immaterial 2022 figures have been reclassified in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any other interim period or the fiscal year. In management’s opinion, the interim financial statements include all adjustments necessary to fairly present such information in all material respects. These interim financial statements were authorized by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for issue on February 21, 2024.

NOTE 3 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Nitrogen During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we identified an impairment trigger for our Trinidad cash generating unit (“CGU”), part of our Nitrogen segment, due to a new natural gas contract and the resulting outlook for higher expected natural gas costs and constrained near-term availability. We expect improved natural gas availability in Trinidad as the development of additional natural gas fields is anticipated to add new natural gas supply starting in 2026.

The recoverable amount estimate used the following key assumptions: our forecasted EBITDA, discount rate and long-term growth rate. We used key assumptions that were based on historical data and estimates of future results from internal sources, independent third-party price benchmarks, as well as industry and market information. The following table highlights sensitivities to the recoverable amount of our Trinidad CGU, which could result in additional impairment losses or reversals of the previously recorded losses. Key Assumptions Change in Assumption Change to Recoverable Amount ($) Long-term growth rate (%) + / - 1.0 percent + / - 55 Post-tax discount rate (%) + / - 1.0 percent - / + 95 Forecasted EBITDA over forecast period ($) + / - 5.0 percent + / - 100 Goodwill Impairment Testing Goodwill by CGU or Group of CGUs 2023 2022 Retail – North America 6,981 6,898 Retail – International 1 590 927 Potash 154 154 Nitrogen 4,389 4,389 12,114 12,368 1 Includes Retail – South America group of CGUs, which had goodwill of nil as at December 31, 2023 (2022 – $348). During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $422 and $43, respectively, relating to our Retail – South America group of CGUs. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing (excluding the Retail – South America group of CGUs, which was fully impaired during the three months ended June 30, 2023) and did not identify any further impairment; however, the recoverable amount for Retail – North America group of CGUs did not substantially exceed its carrying amount. In testing for impairment of goodwill, we calculate the recoverable amount for a CGU or groups of CGUs containing goodwill. We used the FVLCD methodology based on after-tax discounted cash flows (five-year projections plus a terminal value) and incorporated assumptions an independent market participant would apply, including considerations related to climate-change initiatives. We adjusted discount rates for each CGU or group of CGUs for the risk associated with achieving our forecasts and for the country risk premium in which we expect to generate cash flows. FVLCD is a Level 3 measurement. We use our market capitalization and comparative market multiples to ensure discounted cash flow results are reasonable. The key assumptions with the greatest influence on the calculation of the recoverable amounts are the discount rates, terminal growth rates and forecasted EBITDA. The key forecast assumptions were based on historical data and our estimates of future results from internal sources considering industry and market information. The Retail – North America group of CGUs recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by $570. Goodwill is more susceptible to impairment risk if there is an increase in the discount rate or a deterioration in business operating results or economic conditions and actual results do not meet our forecasts. A reduction in the terminal growth rate, an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecasted EBITDA could cause impairment in the future as shown in the table below. Key Assumption Change Required for Carrying Amount 2023 Annual Impairment Testing Used in Impairment Model to Equal Recoverable Amount Terminal growth rate (%) 2.5 0.4 percent decrease Discount rate 1 (%) 8.6 0.2 percent increase Forecasted EBITDA over forecast period ($) 8,040 3.0 percent decrease 1 The discount rate used in the previous measurement was 8.5 percent.

The terminal growth rate and discount rate ranges in 2022 included our Retail – South America group of CGUs, which are no longer included in 2023 as goodwill for this group of CGUs is nil.

Blue Chip Swaps are trade transactions that effectively allow companies to transfer US dollars out of Argentina. Through this mechanism, we incurred a loss of $92 from the purchase of securities denominated in Argentine peso and corresponding sale in US dollars during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The loss is a result of the significant divergence between the Blue Chip Swap market exchange rate and the official Argentinian Central Bank rate.

(NASDAQ: ZD) reported financial results for Q4 2023 and full year 2023, showing a decrease in revenues and net income. The company aims for growth in 2024 with an optimistic outlook. Positive Ziff Davis reported a 1.7% decrease in quarterly revenues to $389.9 million for Q4 2023 compared to $396.7 million for Q4 2022. Income from operations decreased by 13.6% to $80.7 million in Q4 2023 compared to $93.5 million in Q4 2022. Net income from continuing operations decreased by 8.3% to $63.4 million in Q4 2023 compared to $69.2 million in Q4 2022. Full year 2023 revenues decreased by 1.9% to $1.36 billion compared to $1.39 billion for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the year decreased by 4.9% to $482.3 million compared to $507.2 million for 2022. Ziff Davis ended Q4 2023 with approximately $905.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. The company deployed approximately $108.5 million related to share repurchases in 2023. Ziff Davis projects revenue growth of 3.4% to 7.8% for 2024, with adjusted diluted EPS expected to increase by 3.9% to 9.4%. The company's effective tax rates and non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the report. Negative Income from operations and net income showed significant decreases in Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income from continuing operations also declined for the year. The recognition of a goodwill impairment in 2023 impacted the financial results negatively. Ziff Davis did not deploy funds for current year acquisitions in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Ziff Davis, Inc. show a contraction in both quarterly and annual revenues, with a notable 1.9% year-over-year decline. This contraction is a significant indicator of the company's performance, especially when considering the 33.3% drop in income from operations for the full year. The recognition of a higher goodwill impairment in 2023 compared to 2022 suggests potential overvaluation of past acquisitions or a revised outlook on the company's market position. Moreover, the decrease in net income and earnings per share (EPS) further emphasizes the need for a strategic review of the company's operations and acquisition strategy.From a cash flow perspective, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in Q4 2023 is a positive signal, indicating improved operational efficiency or working capital management. However, the full-year figures show a decline, which could raise concerns about the sustainability of the company's cash generation capabilities. The lack of funds deployed for acquisitions in Q4 may also reflect a more cautious approach to growth through M&A, possibly due to the current market conditions or an internal strategic pivot. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the sector-specific performance, Ziff Davis's digital media segment experienced a minor revenue decline, while the cybersecurity and martech segment faced a more pronounced 6.8% decrease for the year. This differentiation suggests that the company's portfolio may be experiencing varying levels of market demand and competitive pressures. In particular, the cybersecurity and martech industry is rapidly evolving and Ziff Davis's performance in this area could be indicative of the company's ability to keep pace with technological advancements and customer needs.Despite the overall decline in financial metrics, the company's adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS saw an increase in Q4, which may be due to cost control measures or other non-operational factors. It is crucial to understand the drivers behind these adjustments to assess the underlying business health accurately. The provided guidance for 2024, projecting revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, suggests management's confidence in a turnaround strategy, potentially relying on market recovery or new initiatives to drive growth. Economist The reported results must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, including factors such as inflation, interest rates and consumer behavior. The decline in Ziff Davis's revenue and profitability metrics could be reflective of macroeconomic headwinds that have affected discretionary spending on digital media and marketing technologies. The company's performance is also a microcosm of the challenges faced by the tech sector, which has been under pressure due to various economic uncertainties. The forward guidance provided by the company, with estimated growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, offers a cautiously optimistic outlook, potentially factoring in economic recovery scenarios or market stabilization.Furthermore, the effective tax rates presented highlight the impact of fiscal policy on the company's net income. The reduction in the GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, could have provided some relief to the bottom line, although this was not enough to offset the decrease in net income. The anticipated adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 will also play a role in future profitability and should be monitored by stakeholders as part of their comprehensive financial analysis. 02/21/2024 - 06:09 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ziff Davis, Inc.

ZIFF DAVIS GUIDANCE The Company’s full year 2024 outlook is as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2023 Actual 2024 Range of Estimates Growth (unaudited) Low High Low High Revenue $ 1,364.0 $ 1,411.0 $ 1,471.0 3.4 % 7.8 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 482.3 $ 500.0 $ 521.0 3.7 % 8.0 % Adjusted diluted EPS* $ 6.19 $ 6.43 $ 6.77 3.9 % 9.4 % * Adjusted diluted EPS for 2024 excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and the impact of any currently unanticipated items, in each case net of tax. It is anticipated that the Adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 will be between 23.25% and 25.25%. A reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS to the corresponding GAAP guidance financial measures is not available without unreasonable effort due, primarily, to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of non-operating matters that may arise in the future.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results or, in certain cases, may be non-cash in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and our use of these terms may vary from that of other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the certain items listed below. We believe that excluding these items from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which exclude similar items. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures excluding these items provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency of certain line items in the Company’s financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) or Net income (loss) from continuing operations with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain items including: Interest expense, net. Interest expense is generated primarily from interest due on outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income generated from the interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments; (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment, net. This is a non-cash expense that relates to a non-cash debt-for-equity exchange effectuated to settle amounts of senior secured term loans of the Company under its Credit Agreement with common stock of Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”) owned by the Company. We believe this (gain) loss does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; (Gain) loss on sale of business. This gain or loss relates to the sales of businesses and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; Unrealized (gain) loss on short-term investments held at the reporting date, net. This is a non-cash item as it relates to the change in the carrying value of our investment in Consensus depending on the share price of Consensus common stock and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; (Gain) loss on investments, net. This item relates to the disposition of a portion of our investment in Consensus. The amount of gain or loss depends on the share price of Consensus common stock and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; Other (income) expense, net. This income or expense relates to other non-operating items and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; Income tax (benefit) expense. This benefit or expense depends on the pre-tax loss or income of the Company, statutory tax rates, tax regulations and different tax rates in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and which the Company does not have the control over; (Income) loss from equity method investments, net. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to our investment in OCV Fund I, LP (the “Fund”). We believe that gain or loss resulting from our equity method investment does not represent core business operating results of the Company; Depreciation and amortization. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to use and associated reduction in value of certain assets including equipment, fixtures, and certain capitalized internal-used software and website development costs, and identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired businesses. This also includes the reduction in value of certain acquired intangible assets that represent the cost incurred by the acquiree to build value prior to the acquisition and the amortization of this cost does not represent core business operating results of the Company; Share-based compensation. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to awards granted under the various share-based incentive plans of the Company. We view the economic cost of share-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; Acquisition, integration, and other costs, including adjustments to contingent consideration, lease terminations, retention bonuses, other acquisition-specific items, and other costs, such as severance and legal settlements. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; Disposal related costs associated with disposal of certain businesses. These are expenses associated with the disposal of certain businesses that do not represent core business operating results of the Company; Lease asset impairments and other charges. These expenses are incurred in connection with impaired right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of the Company. Associated expenses are comprised of insurance, utility, and other charges related to assets that are no longer in use, and partially offset by the sublease income earned. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; and Goodwill impairment on business. This is a non-cash expense that is recorded when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and does not represent core business operating results of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Total revenues. Adjusted net income (loss) or Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations is defined as Net income (loss) or Net income (loss) from continuing operations with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain statement of operations items including, but not limited to: Interest costs, net. This reflects the difference between the imputed and coupon interest expense associated with the 4.625% Senior Notes and a charge that the Company determined to be penalty interest associated with the 1.75% Convertible Notes in each period presented, offset in part by a certain interest income earned by the Company. These net expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment, net. This is a non-cash expense that relates to a non-cash debt-for-equity exchange effectuated to settle amounts of senior secured term loans of the Company under its Credit Agreement with common stock of Consensus owned by the Company. We believe this gain or loss does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; (Gain) loss on sale of business. This gain or loss relates to the sales of businesses and does not represent recurring core business operating results of the Company; Unrealized (gain) loss on short-term investments held at the reporting date, net. This is a non-cash item as it relates to the change in the carrying value of our investment in Consensus depending on the share price of Consensus common stock and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; (Gain) loss on investments, net. This item relates to the disposition of a portion of our investment in Consensus. The amount of gain or loss depends on the share price of Consensus common stock and does not represent core business operating results of the Company; (Income) loss from equity method investments, net. This is a non-cash income or expense as it relates to our investment in the OCV Fund. We believe that gains or losses resulting from our equity method investment do not represent core business operating results of the Company; Amortization of patents and intangible assets that we acquired. This is a non-cash expense as it primarily relates to identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired businesses. We believe that acquired intangible assets represent cost incurred by the acquiree to build value prior to the acquisition and the amortization of this cost does not represent core business operating results of the Company; Share-based compensation. This is a non-cash expense as it relates to awards granted under the various incentive plans of the Company. We view the economic cost of share-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; Acquisition, integration and other costs, including adjustments to contingent consideration, lease terminations, retention bonuses, other acquisition-specific items, and other costs, such as severance and legal settlements. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; Disposal related costs associated with disposal of certain businesses. These are expenses associated with the disposal of certain businesses that do not represent core business operating results of the Company; Lease asset impairments and other charges. These are expenses incurred in connection with impaired ROU assets of the Company. Associated expenses are comprised of insurance, utility, and other charges related to assets that are no longer in use, and partially offset by the sublease income earned. These expenses do not represent core business operating results of the Company; and Goodwill impairment on business. This is a non-cash expense that is recorded when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and does not represent core business operating results of the Company. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share or Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing Adjusted net income (loss) or Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations by the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding that excludes the effect of convertible debt dilution. Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment, plus changes in contingent consideration. ZIFF DAVIS, INC.

(“DIRTT” or the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us” or “ours”) (TSX: DRT; OTC: DRTTF), a leader in industrialized construction, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. All financial information in this news release is presented in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Revenue of $50.9 million, up 20% compared to the prior year period, representing the Company's highest revenue quarter since 2019.Gross Profit improvement to $19.2 million or 37.8% of revenue in the fourth of 2023 from $11.6 million or 27.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net income after tax and net income margin for the quarter of $1.0 million and 1.9%, respectively, compared to a net loss after tax of $(5.9) million and a net loss margin of (13.9)% in the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $4.3 million (8.5% of revenue), compared to $0.6 million (1.4% of revenue) from the fourth quarter of 2022.Liquidity, comprising of unrestricted cash and available borrowings, of $35.0 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $16.1 million at December 31, 2022.Reduced long term debt by early settling U.S. equipment leases of $7.8 million during the quarter related to the previously announced closure of our manufacturing facility in Rock Hill, South Carolina.On January 9, 2024, the Company successfully closed its rights offering for gross proceeds of C$30.0 million.On February 9, 2024, the Company extended its RBC facility for an additional year.On February 15, 2024, the Company announced a substantial issuer bid and tender offer (the “Substantial Issuer Bid”) for up to a total of C$15.0 million of a combination of the Company's issued and outstanding 6.00% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due January 31, 2026 and its issued and outstanding 6.25% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due December 31, 2026 (collectively, the “Debentures”). (1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” Management Commentary Benjamin Urban, chief executive officer remarked, “Our 2023 fourth quarter results show the impact of positive decisions made in the past 24 months. We believe the rights offering proceeds will give DIRTT the opportunity to further invest in the business and focus on sustainable revenue growth.” Fareeha Khan, chief financial officer, added, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and going into 2024, we will continue to focus on our strategies for increased commercial activity while maintaining our cost structure. The reduction of long term equipment lease debt, the rights offering and the Substantial Issuer Bid demonstrate our commitment to strengthen DIRTT’s balance sheet. We continue to monitor the markets to ensure we are prepared to weather adverse macroeconomic scenarios.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenues were $50.9 million, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 benefited from several large projects compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 gross profit and gross profit margin were $19.2 million and 37.8% respectively, an increase of $7.6 million from $11.6 million and 27.3%, for the same period of 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was a result of realization of our improved product mix, improved labor efficiency and better fixed cost leverage. Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) were $20.1 million and 39.5%, respectively, compared to $13.6 million and 32.0% in the prior year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $1.1 million to $6.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, from $5.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by higher commissions, higher variable compensation costs, and higher outside consulting services, offset by lower travel and entertainment costs and building expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million to $5.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, from $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to increased professional services costs of $1.0 million and higher costs of our facilities offset by decreases in communication and software costs. Operations support expenses increased by $0.1 million from $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, to $2.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in variable compensation offset by a $0.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits. Technology and development expenses decreased by $0.1 million to $1.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to decreased professional services costs during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2022. During the quarter, the Company incurred $0.2 million in reorganization costs, which related primarily to movement of inventory from the Rock Hill Facility. Net income after tax and net income margin for the quarter was $1.0 million and 1.9% compared to a net loss after tax of $(5.9) million and a net loss margin of (13.9)% for prior year’s fourth quarter. The improvement in net income is the result of the higher gross profit margin, a reduction in reorganization expenses, a gain on sale of software and patents, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, offset by a remeasurement in the fair value less costs to sell related to the Rock Hill Facility assets held for sale, which resulted in an additional impairment charge in the period. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) for the quarter was $4.3 million and 8.5%, respectively, an improvement of $3.7 million from $0.6 million and 1.4% for the prior year’s fourth quarter. Improvements in Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were due to the above noted reasons. Outlook We achieved an annual revenue of $181.9 million, a 6% increase over 2022 revenue of $172.2 million. We are pleased to report another consecutive year of revenue growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite the volatility in the tech and banking sectors in early 2023. Our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was the highest quarterly revenue since 2019. During 2023, we built on our successes in 2022 with further balance sheet improvement ($24.7 million vs. $10.8 million cash and cash equivalents at year end), expansion of our Gross Profit Margin (32.7% vs. 16.4%) and Adjusted Gross Profit Margins (35.8% vs. 22.6%), reductions of our net loss after tax from $(55.0) million to $(14.6) million and expansion of our Adjusted EBITDA Margins (4.4% vs. (15.2%)). In 2023, we saw macroeconomic factors stabilize our supply chains and input costs. Our focus on sales and operational planning as well as process efficiencies allowed us to achieve significant improvement in our adjusted gross margins. These actions also led to reductions in labor and inventory carrying costs during 2023. Further, we reduced expenses in our back office and general and administrative overhead to levels commensurate with our current and expected revenue levels. In the year ahead, we anticipate continued pipeline and revenue growth, but we also remain cautious about macroeconomic uncertainty and remain focused on preparing the Company for a variety of economic scenarios. The unprecedented pace of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes as well as geopolitical volatility in the Middle East and Asian Pacific have encouraged us to pay close attention to our fixed cost footprint and supply chain resiliency. The upcoming presidential election in the United States adds to this uncertainty and may impact the capital expenditure budgets of our clients. As noted in last quarter’s outlook, the first quarter of the year is typically our seasonally slowest quarter. As post-pandemic workplaces continue to evolve, the ability of DIRTT’s solutions to anticipate and respond to an uncertain future is at the core of our value proposition. Encouraging access to our full product offering unlocks workplace transformations with more flexible and adaptable environments. Our sustainable product offerings, featuring low carbon footprint, high recycled content, and minimal waste, also enable our Commercial, Government, Healthcare, and Education clients to make meaningful progress toward their environmental commitments and goals. On January 9, 2024 we successfully closed a C$30 million Rights Offering. As previously disclosed, we expect to use the proceeds of the Rights Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include investments in our business, funding potential future cash needs or operating losses, funding working capital and capital expenditure needs, or reductions to our outstanding indebtedness. We plan to use some of the funds to invest in our commercial business in all verticals, especially Healthcare, and are looking at additional opportunities and partnerships to support our revenue growth. In line with our objectives for the Rights Offering, on February 15, 2024, we announced a Substantial Issuer Bid for our convertible debentures of C$15 million, intended to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt.

These GAAP financial statements include non-cash charges and other charges and benefits that we believe are unusual or infrequent in nature or that we believe may make comparisons to our prior or future performance difficult. As a result, we also provide financial information in this news release that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its review and evaluation of the financial performance of the Company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional insight to investors and securities analysts as supplemental information to our GAAP results and as a basis to compare our financial performance period over period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period and to other companies by removing the effects of our capital structure (net interest income on cash deposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities, or foreign exchange movements), asset base (depreciation and amortization), the impact of under-utilized capacity on gross profit, tax consequences, reorganization expense, one-time non-recurring charges or gains (such as gain on sale of software and patents), and stock-based compensation. We remove the impact of all foreign exchange from Adjusted EBITDA. Foreign exchange gains and losses can vary significantly period-to-period due to the impact of changes in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary items on the balance sheet and are not reflective of the underlying operations of the Company. We remove the impact of under-utilized capacity from gross profit, and fixed production overheads are allocated to inventory on the basis of normal capacity of the production facilities. In periods where production levels are abnormally low, unallocated overheads are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In addition, management bases certain forward-looking estimates and budgets on non-GAAP financial measures, primarily Adjusted EBITDA. Government subsidies, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, reorganization expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment charges are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures because management considers them to be outside of the Company’s core operating results, even though some of those receipts and expenses may recur, and because management believes that each of these items can distort the trends associated with the Company’s ongoing performance. We believe that excluding these receipts and expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of the business operations, enhances consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not, or future periods that may not, include such items, and facilitates comparison with the results of other companies in our industry. The following non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this news release, and a description of the calculation for each measure is included. Adjusted Gross ProfitGross profit before deductions for costs of under-utilized capacity, depreciation, and amortizationAdjusted Gross Profit MarginAdjusted Gross Profit divided by revenueEBITDANet income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortizationAdjusted EBITDAEBITDA adjusted to remove foreign exchange gains or losses; impairment charges; reorganization expenses; stock-based compensation expense; government subsidies; one-time non-recurring charges and gains; and any other non-core gains or lossesAdjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA divided by revenue You should carefully evaluate these non-GAAP financial measures, the adjustments included in them, and the reasons we consider them appropriate for analysis supplemental to our GAAP information. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider any of these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should also be aware that we may recognize income or incur expenses in the future that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) after tax, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented, and of Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income (loss) margin: (Unaudited - Stated in thousands of U.S. dollars) For the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 ($ in thousands) ($ in thousands) Net income (loss) after tax for the period 955 (5,906) (14,584) (54,963)Add back (deduct): Interest expense 1,291 1,225 4,927 5,160 Interest income (219) (1) (490) (51)Income tax expense 332 37 332 21 Depreciation and amortization 1,718 2,917 8,934 15,119 EBITDA 4,077 (1,728) (881) (34,714)Foreign exchange (gain) loss 567 425 626 (1,445)Stock-based compensation (237) 731 2,306 4,277 Government subsidies - - (236) (7,765)Related party expense(2) - - 1,524 - Reorganization expense 152 1,180 3,009 13,461 Gain on sale of software and patents(3) (985) - (7,130) - Impairment charge on Rock Hill Facility(3) 764 - 8,716 - Adjusted EBITDA 4,338 608 7,934 (26,186)Net Income (Loss) Margin(1) 1.9% (13.9)% (8.0)% (31.9)%Adjusted EBITDA Margin 8.5% 1.4% 4.4% (15.2)% (1) Net income (loss) after tax divided by revenue.

It was a volatile year with WTI oil prices oscillating by almost US$30 per barrel, from the mid US$60's to the mid US$90's and then back down again. Heavy oil prices were also not immune to volatility, with the WCS differential ranging between a discount of approximately US$11 per barrel up to US$29 per barrel. Despite this volatility, Gear was able to deliver strong returns to shareholders, execute an efficient 2023 capital program, and maintain stable production and bank debt while adding Proved Developed Producing (""PDP"") reserves at a finding, development and acquisition (""FD&A"") cost of $17.36 per boe, yielding a competitive 2023 PDP recycle ratio of 2.0 times. Now as we move into 2024, the team are excited to continue working on delivering similar results. With the Strategic Repositioning Process behind us, we are ready to focus on continued success with core area drilling, water flood expansions, further de-risking and expansion of new drilling inventory and incremental returns to shareholders.2023 ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTSGenerated $67.8 million of funds from operations (""FFO"") or $32.03 per boe, the third highest ever achieved. The FFO was a 28 per cent decrease from 2022 as a result of weaker pricing with revenue averaging $70.23 per boe for the year and the WTI oil benchmark price averaging US$77.62 per barrel compared to US$94.23 per barrel in 2022.Delivered production of 5,801 boe per day for 2023, a one per cent increase from 2022 and unchanged on a per debt adjusted (""DA"") share basis.Distributed almost $24.9 Million in dividends to shareholders during 2023, representing $0.095 per share, or an annual yield of almost 15 per cent relative to the year-end market capitalization. Total dividends since inception are now $45.6 million, or $0.175 per share including the February 2024 declared amount.Invested $48.1 million to drill 14 gross (14 net) wells, installed and optimized multiple waterflood projects, completed various recompletion opportunities and funded other corporate capital.Dedicated $6.1 million to the reduction of decommissioning activities resulting in 79 gross (76.3 net) wells being abandoned and 34 gross (34 net) wells being reclaimed throughout the year. Gear's decommissioning liability fell seven per cent from $71.4 million at the end of 2022 to $66.1 million at the end of 2023.Maintained a strong balance sheet, with exit net debt of $14.1 million and annual net debt to FFO ratio of 0.2 times.FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTSProduction for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 6,000 boe per day, a nine per cent increase from the third quarter production of 5,511 boe per day. The increase is attributed to new production from Gear's second half 2023 successful drilling program. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Gear drilled two gross (two net) light oil multistage fractured wells in Tableland, Saskatchewan. In total, Gear incurred $10.8 million of capital expenditures for the quarter. Approximately $0.7 million of capital was incurred for pre-spending for Gear's 2024 capital program.FFO for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $16.7 million, a decrease of 20 per cent from the third quarter of 2023 as a result of lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher production. Fourth quarter realized prices decreased to $67.98 per boe from $81.67 per boe in the third quarter of 2023. Lower commodity prices were primarily driven by a decrease in the WTI benchmark oil price which averaged US$78.32 per barrel in the fourth quarter and wider WCS heavy oil differentials, which averaged US$21.86 per barrel in the fourth quarter. The outlook for WCS differentials has begun to improve through the first quarter and look to narrow further with the expectation that the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will be commissioned in 2024.2023 YEAR END RESERVES HIGHLIGHTSGear achieved the following reserves highlights through 2023 activity, compared to 2022 results including full corporate abandonment and reclamation obligation (""ARO"") costs. Proved Developed Producing (""PDP"")2.73 MMboe of additions. Reserves increased six per cent, four per cent per DA share.

Recycle ratio(1) of 1.8x. Total Proved plus Probable (""P+P"") 2.10 MMboe of additions.Reserves were unchanged and decreased two per cent per DA share. (1)Reserves value BT10 decreased six per cent and decreased eight per cent on a per DA share basis.(1)Replaced 99 per cent of 2023 annual production.F&D and FD&A cost (1) of $19.94/boe and $22.67/boe, respectively, including change in FDC. Recycle ratio(1) of 1.6x.The 2023 capital program was limited but very successful in delivering new wells that met or exceeded expectations. Reserves additions across all categories were achieved primarily through a combination of the following:Successful new drilling in Wildmere, Soda Lake, Celtic, Provost, Hoosier and Tableland.Base performance revisions in Paradise Hill, Wildmere and Wilson Creek.Recognition of waterflood implementation and/or response in Chigwell, Wildmere, Wilson Creek, Killam, Provost, and Maidstone.Economic factors as a percentage of annual reserves additions were two per cent, 12 per cent and 24 per cent for PDP, TP and P+P values, respectively.Management's annual estimate of future potential drilling locations increased 33 per cent from year-end 2022 to 447 un-risked net locations as a result of land purchases in Cold Lake and Soda Lake, drilling to derisk new inventory at Celtic and Soda Lake, and the continuous high grading of future inventory through increased use of multi-laterals. The Sproule (as defined below) evaluation currently recognizes 94 net locations in the TP category and 148 in the P+P category. These booked locations represent 21 and 33 per cent of management's estimates, respectively. The 148 net booked P+P locations include 25 multi-lateral horizontals, 108 single lateral horizontals and 15 vertical wells. Utilizing the evaluator average price forecast at January 1, 2024, Gear maintained 2023 Net Asset Values (""NAV"") (2) close to year end 2022 figures with the weaker future price outlook offset by higher reserves. The new NAV (2) amounts are $0.75/share PDP, $1.04/share TP and $1.66/share P+P, all above the current share price trading range. Additional NAV values at various flat price scenarios and discount rates are highlighted within.Significantly increased the amount of reserves supported by water flooding to 32 per cent of total PDP bookings, supporting a record high PDP Reserves Life Index (""RLI"") (3), now sitting comfortably at 5.3 years. TP RLI (3) is 8.0 years P+P RLI (3) is 11.0 years, both also record highs.Corporate liquids weighting increased to 87 per cent from 85 per cent for the P+P reserves case. Heavy oil increased by one per cent while gas decreased by one per cent. Corporate P+P reserves product mix remained relatively unchanged from the prior year with reserves consisting of 43 per cent heavy oil, 39 per cent light and medium oil, 5 per cent natural gas liquids (""NGLs"") and 13 per cent gas.(1) FD&A cost, F&D cost, reserves per DA share, reserves value BT10 per DA share, recycle ratio and operating netback are oil and gas metrics that do not have any standardized meanings under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP ratios and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. For additional information related to these measures see ""Efficiency Ratios"", ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" and ""Oil and Gas Metrics"" in this press release.(2) NAV is a supplementary financial measure. See ""Efficiency Ratios"", ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" and ""Oil and Gas Metrics"" in this press release for an explanation of the composition of this supplementary financial measure.(3) RLI is an oil and gas metric that does not have a standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. For additional information related to this measure see ""Oil and Gas Metrics"" in this press release.2024 OUTLOOKAfter several years of consultation, planning and construction, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is set to be operational in 2024. The pipeline will positively impact the Canadian energy industry, adding 590,000 barrels of oil per day or approximately 17 per cent additional export capacity and providing a new market for Canadian oil. The expected tangible benefit will be through both a lower discount for realized Canadian oil prices relative to world oil market prices, a reduction in historical punitive differentials for heavy crude, and the ability to export greater amounts of Canadian crude oil. Gear intends to take advantage of this forecasted price improvement by investing in further production growth opportunities throughout the year.GUIDANCE2024 Guidance2023 Guidance2023 ActualsAnnual production (boe/d)6,0005,700 - 5,9005,801Heavy oil weighting (%)514947Light oil, medium oil and NGLs weighting (%)373739Royalty rate (%)121313Operating and transportation costs ($/boe)24.7025.0025.94General and administrative expense ($/boe) 3.203.503.40Interest and other expense ($/boe)0.501.001.06Capital and abandonment expenditures ($ millions)(1)575054 (1) Capital and abandonment expenditures includes decommissioning liability expenditures made by Gear and excludes any expenditures made by the federal government's Site Rehabilitation Program.Capital and abandonment expenditures for 2023 were $54 million compared to the $50 million guidance for 2023. Spending in the fourth quarter of 2023 included additional spending in anticipation for the 2024 drill program as well as additional spending on abandonment and reclamation work.Using various WTI price forecasts for 2024 and assuming a WCS differential of US$16 per barrel, MSW differential of US$5 per barrel, LSB differential of US$6 per barrel, AECO gas price of C$2 per GJ, and a foreign exchange of US$0.74 per C$, Gear is forecasting 2024 FFO as follows:WTI US$708090FFO ($ millions)6084107 On an annualized basis, Gear forecasts its $0.005 per share per month dividend to total approximately $16.0 million. Gear estimates that WTI would have to average US$75 per barrel in order for FFO to equal the 2024 forecasted capital and abandonment expenditures of $57.0 million and the current annualized dividend. Any future increase in commodity prices beyond these base assumptions will provide incremental FFO less capital and abandonment expenditures and dividends which may be dedicated to potential future capital expansions, cash funded acquisitions, share buybacks and/or future dividend increases. Conversely, any future decrease in commodity prices may result in incremental debt, potential capital adjustments and/or future dividend reductions.NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID Gear is pleased to announce that the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") has granted approval for Gear to commence a normal course issuer bid (the ""NCIB""). Under the NCIB, Gear may purchase for cancellation up to 24,171,076 common shares (the ""Shares"") of Gear, representing approximately 10% of the ""public float"", which is equal to the issued and outstanding Shares of Gear as at the date hereof (262,249,821 Shares) less the Shares held by directors and officers of Gear. The total number of Shares that Gear is permitted to purchase is subject to a daily purchase limit of 162,537 Shares, representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of 650,149 Shares on the TSX calculated for the six-month period ended January 31, 2024; however, Gear may make one block purchase per calendar week which exceeds the daily repurchase restrictions. The NCIB is expected to commence on February 26, 2024 and will terminate on the earlier of: (i) the date on which the Company has acquired all Shares sought pursuant to the NCIB; or (ii) to February 25, 2025 unless earlier terminated at the option of the Company, upon prior notice being given to the TSX. The Shares will be purchased on behalf of Gear by a registered broker through the facilities of the TSX and through other alternative Canadian trading platforms at the prevailing market price at the time of such transaction. Pursuant to the terms of Gear's current credit facilities, Shares may only be purchased if Gear's senior debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ratio is less than 1.00:1.00, the credit facilities are less than 50% drawn, and the aggregate purchases (including any other distributions) for any fiscal year is no more than $32 million.The actual number of Shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases, and the price at which the Shares will be purchased, will depend on future market conditions. Gear believes that, from time to time, the market price of the Shares may not fully reflect the underlying value of the Shares and at such times the purchase of Shares would be in the best interests of Gear. As a result of such purchases, the number of issued Shares will be decreased and, consequently, the proportionate share interest of all remaining Shareholders will be increased on a pro rata basis.RESERVES SUMMARYYear-end 2023 reserves were evaluated by independent reserves evaluator Sproule Associates Ltd. (""Sproule"") in accordance with the definitions, standards and procedures contained in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGE Handbook"") and National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101""). A reserves committee, comprised of independent board members, reviews the qualifications and appointment of the independent reserves evaluator and reviews the procedures for providing information to the evaluators. The reserves evaluation was based on an average of price forecasts prepared by Sproule, GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. and McDaniel & Associates Consulting Ltd. effective at January 1, 2024. Reserves included herein are stated on a company gross basis (working interest before deduction of royalties without inclusion of any royalty interests) unless noted otherwise. Additional reserves information required under NI 51-101 will be included in Gear's Annual Information Form to be filed on SEDAR+ on or before March 31, 2024.The following tables outline Gear's reserves as at December 31, 2023. No provision for interest, risk management contracts, debt service charges and general and administrative expenses have been made and it should not be assumed that the net present values of the reserves estimated by Sproule represents the fair market value of the reserves.Reserves Summary at Dec 31, 2023 Using Forecast Costs and January 1, 2024 Evaluator Average Forecast PricesCompany GrossLight & Medium Oil(Mbbl) Heavy Oil(Mbbl)NGL's (Mbbl)Natural Gas (MMcf)Equivalent (Mboe)Liquids Ratio(%)Proved Developed Producing4,1833,6475629,87410,03884Proved Non-Producing & Undeveloped2,8162,8164194,9126,86988Total Proved6,9996,46398114,78616,90785Probable Developed Producing1,3661,2231702,9253,24685Probable Non-Producing & Undeveloped1,7373,6111933,2276,07991Total Probable3,1034,8343636,1529,32589Total Proved plus Probable10,10211,2971,34420,93826,23287 Net Present Value of Future Revenues Including Full ARO Before Income Taxes Under Forecast Prices and CostsCompany GrossUndiscountedDiscountedDiscountedDiscountedDiscounted($ thousands)@ 5%@ 10%@ 15%@ 20%Proved Developed Producing249,562 232,523206,307183,555165,216Proved Non-Producing & Undeveloped153,671106,93575,36553,45137,745Total Proved403,232 339,459281,672237,006202,961Probable Developed Producing134,14890,30565,72850,95741,361Probable Non-Producing & Undeveloped183,982130,71497,59075,47359,869Total Probable318,130221,019163,319126,430101,230Total Proved plus Probable721,362 560,478444,990363,436304,191 Net Future Development Capital (""FDC"") Under Forecast Prices and Costs($ thousands)ProvedProbableTotal202429,210 8,95738,167202554,25919,62473,883202654,95631,51886,474202723,47718,74042,2172028---Undiscounted Total161,902 78,840 240,741 EFFICIENCY RATIOSThe following table highlights annual capital efficiency through F&D and FD&A costs per boe metrics.20232022Reserves (mboes), Capital ($ thousands)PDPTPP+PPDPTPP+PDevelopment Reserves Additions2,8792,6272,6552,5862,1692,025Net Acquisition Reserves Additions(152)(334)(553)44(11)Total Reserves Additions2,7272,2932,1022,5902,1732,014 Development capital47,82847,82847,82850,46250,46250,462Development change in FDC(821)1,8295,129(2,717)12,64210,400Total development capital including FDC47,32149,65752,95747,74563,10460,862Net acquisition capital314314 314 8787 87 Net acquisition change in FDC-(4,226) (5,598) -- -

In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, this press release contains forward-looking information and statements pertaining to the following: the expectation that in 2024 Gear will deliver similar results to the prior year by focusing on core area drilling, water flood expansions, further de-risking and expansion of new drilling inventory and incremental returns to shareholders; Gear's expectation of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to be commissioned in 2024 and the resulting impacts and expected benefits thereof; Gear's intention to invest in further production growth opportunities in 2024; guidance including expected 2024 annual average production (including commodity weightings), expected royalty rate, expected operating and transportation costs, expected general and administrative costs, expected interest expense and expected capital and abandonment expenditures; Gear's forecasts and expectations of various factors on commodity prices and differentials; Gear's forecasting of 2024 funds from operations based on various commodity prices; Gear's forecasts relating to its monthly dividend and the effect of increasing or decreasing commodity prices on same; Gear's expectation that at a $75 WTI per barrel price FFO would equal the 2024 forecasted capital and abandonment expenditures of $57.0 million and the current annualized dividend; Gear's forecast of future drilling locations; Gear's expectation that any future increase in commodity prices beyond the base assumptions presented herein will provide incremental FFO less capital and abandonment expenditures and dividends which may be dedicated to potential future capital expansions, cash funded acquisitions, share buybacks and/or future dividend increases; Gear's expectation that any future decrease in commodity prices may result in incremental debt, potential capital adjustments and/or future dividend reductions; and Gear's expectations and beliefs relating to the NCIB including commencement and termination dates and reasons for the NCIB. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of Gear including, without limitation: that Gear will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with past operations; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the continuance of existing (and in certain circumstances, the implementation of proposed) tax, royalty and regulatory regimes; the accuracy of the estimates of Gear's reserves and resource volumes; certain commodity price and other cost assumptions; and the continued availability of adequate debt and equity financing and funds from operations to fund its planned expenditures. Gear believes the material factors, expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking information and statements are reasonable but no assurance can be given that these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. To the extent that any forward-looking information contained herein may be considered a financial outlook, such information has been included to provide readers with an understanding of management's assumptions used for budgeting and developing future plans and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The forward-looking information and statements included in this press release are not guarantees of future performance and should not be unduly relied upon. Such information and statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information or statements including, without limitation: changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand for or supply of Gear's products; unanticipated operating results or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, royalty rates or other regulatory matters; changes in development plans of Gear or by third party operators of Gear's properties, increased debt levels or debt service requirements; any inability to obtain debt or equity financing as necessary to fund operations, capital expenditures and any potential acquisitions; inaccurate estimation of Gear's oil and gas reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavorable or a lack of access to capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impacts of wars and conflicts (including the Russian Ukrainian war and the Israel-Palestine war), pandemics, political events, natural disasters and terrorism; and the impact of competitors. In addition, any future share buybacks or any other distributions to shareholders will depend on the Board of Directors of Gear determining that such actions are in the best interests of the Company. Gear's Board of Directors may determine that any available cash should be allocated for other purposes such as acquisitions or additional capital expenditures instead of making distributions to shareholders. In addition, forward-looking information and statements are subject to certain other risks detailed from time to time in Gear's public documents including in Gear's most current annual information form which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. The amount of future cash dividends paid by Gear, if any, will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors of Gear and may vary depending on a variety of factors and conditions existing from time to time, including, among other things, funds from operations, fluctuations in commodity prices, production levels, capital expenditure requirements, debt service requirements and debt levels, operating costs, royalty burdens, foreign exchange rates and the satisfaction of the liquidity and solvency tests imposed by applicable corporate law for the declaration and payment of dividends. Depending on these and various other factors, many of which will be beyond the control of the Company, the dividend policy of the Company from time to time and, as a result, future cash dividends may not be paid or if paid could at a later date be reduced or suspended entirely.The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release, and Gear does not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances, except as may be required pursuant to applicable laws.Non-GAAP and Other Financial MeasuresThis press release includes references to non-GAAP and other financial measures that Gear uses to analyze financial performance. These specified financial measures include non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures, and are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes that the non-GAAP and other financial measures used by the Company are key performance measures for Gear and provide investors with information that is commonly used by other oil and gas companies. These key performance indicators and benchmarks as presented do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. These non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than their most directly comparable financial measure presented in the financial statements, as an indication of the Company's performance. Descriptions of the non-GAAP and other financial measures used by the Company as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, where applicable, are provided below.Funds from OperationsFunds from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flows from operating activities before changes in non-cash operating working capital and decommissioning liabilities settled. Gear evaluates its financial performance primarily on funds from operations and considers it a key measure for management and investors as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the funds from operations necessary to fund its capital program, settle decommissioning liabilities, repay debt, finance dividends and/or repurchase common shares under the Company's NCIB, if the Company chooses to do so. The following is a reconciliation of funds from operations from cash flows from operating activities.Reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to funds from operations:Three months endedYear ended($ thousands)Dec 31, 2023Dec 31, 2022Sep 30, 2023Dec 31, 2023Dec 30, 2022Cash flows from operating activities17,81318,56517,53263,58989,769Decommissioning liabilities settled (1)2,5601,4172,2026,1156,288Change in non-cash working capital(3,656)(1,306)1,244(1,889)(2,285)Funds from operations16,71718,67620,97867,81593,772 (1) Decommissioning liabilities settled includes only expenditures made by Gear.Funds from Operations per BOEFunds from operations per boe is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as funds from operations, as defined and reconciled to cash flows from operating activities above, divided by sales production for the period. Gear considers this a useful non-GAAP ratio for management and investors as it evaluates financial performance on a per boe level, which enables better comparison to other oil and gas companies in demonstrating its ability to generate the funds from operations necessary to fund its capital program, settle decommissioning liabilities, repay debt, finance dividends and/or repurchase common shares under the Company's NCIB, if the Company chooses to do so.Funds from operations per weighted average basic shareFunds from operations per weighted average basic share is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as funds from operations, as defined and reconciled to cash flows from operating activities above, divided by the weighted average basic share amount. Gear considers this non-GAAP ratio a useful measure for management and investors as it demonstrates its ability to generate the funds from operations, on a per weighted average basic share basis, necessary to fund its capital program, settle decommissioning liabilities, repay debt, finance dividends and/or repurchase common shares under the Company's NCIB, if the Company chooses to do so. Net (debt) surplusNet (debt) surplus is a capital management measure defined as debt less current working capital items (excluding debt, risk management contracts and decommissioning liabilities). Gear believes net (debt) surplus provides management and investors with a measure that is a key indicator of its leverage and strength of its balance sheet. Changes in net (debt) surplus are primarily a result of funds from operations, capital and abandonment expenditures, equity issuances, dividends paid and equity repurchases pursuant to the NCIB, if the Company chooses to do so. Reconciliation of debt to net debt: Capital Structure and Liquidity($ thousands)Dec 31, 2023Dec 31, 2022Debt(21,155)(7,123)Working capital surplus (1)7,0564,903Net debt (14,099)(2,220) (1) Excludes risk management contracts and decommissioning liabilities.Net Debt to Funds from OperationsNet debt to funds from operations is a non-GAAP ratio and is defined as net debt, as defined and reconciled to debt above, divided by the funds from operations, as defined and reconciled to cash flows from operating activities above, for the year. Gear uses net debt to funds from operations to analyze financial and operating performance. Gear considers this a key measure for management and investors as it demonstrates the Company's ability to pay off its debt and take on new debt, if necessary, using the most recent annual results. When the Company is in a net surplus position, the Company's net debt to funds from operations is not applicable.Net Debt to Quarterly Annualized Funds from OperationsNet debt to quarterly annualized funds from operations is a non-GAAP ratio and is defined as net debt, as defined and reconciled to debt above, divided by the annualized funds from operations, as defined and reconciled to cash flows from operating activities above, for the most recently completed quarter. Gear uses net debt to quarterly annualized funds from operations to analyze financial and operating performance. Gear considers this a key measure for management and investors as it demonstrates the Company's ability to pay off its debt and take on new debt, if necessary, using the most recent quarter's results. When the Company is in a net surplus position, the Company's net debt to annualized funds from operations is not applicable.Debt Adjusted SharesDebt adjusted shares is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as the weighted average shares minus the share equivalent when Gear has an average net surplus position, or plus the share equivalent when Gear has an average net debt position, as defined and reconciled to debt above, over the period. This assumes that net surplus is used to repurchase shares or net debt is extinguished with an issuance based on a certain share price; however, it should be noted that Gear's bank debt is not convertible into shares. The calculation of debt adjusted shares assumes that Gear issues shares for cash proceeds and such proceeds are used to repay the amounts outstanding under the Company's bank debt, or Gear has the ability to repurchase shares when in a net surplus position. Gear has used the ten-day volume weighted average share price ending at the end of the period as this share price better captures the actual price that could be theoretically used in the event that shares are hypothetically issued to extinguish outstanding debt or the price that the Company repurchases shares at. Gear considers debt adjusted shares a useful measure for management and investors as it enables oil and gas companies to be put on an equal, enterprise value-based footing when calculating per share numbers.Reconciliation of weighted average basic shares to debt adjusted shares:Three months endedYear ended(thousands, except per share amounts)Dec 31, 2023Dec 31, 2022Sep 30, 2023Dec 31, 2023Dec 31, 2022Weighted average basic shares262,247259,908262,139261,725259,791Average share price (1)0.651.060.860.651.06Average net (debt) surplus (2)(13,698)2,370 (13,810)(8,160)(9,025)Share equivalent on average net (debt) surplus (3)21,074(2,236)16,05812,5548,514Debt adjusted shares283,321257,672278,197274,279268,305 (1) Average share price obtained by a ten-day volume weighted average price ending at the end of the period.(2) Average net (debt) surplus obtained by a simple average between opening and ending net (debt) surplus for the quarters and years ended.(3) Share equivalent on average net (debt) surplus obtained by average net (debt) surplus divided by average share price.Reserves per debt adjusted sharesReserves per debt adjusted shares is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as reserves, boe, divided by debt adjusted shares, as defined and reconciled to weighted average basic shares above. Gear considers reserves, boe, per debt adjusted shares a useful non-GAAP ratio for management and investors as it enables oil and gas companies to be put on an equal, enterprise value-based footing when calculating per share numbers to demonstrate the Company's ability to produce oil and gas.

Gear considers reserves value before tax 10 per cent per debt adjusted shares a useful non-GAAP ratio for management and investors as it enables oil and gas companies to be put on an equal, enterprise value-based footing when calculating per share numbers to demonstrate the Company's ability to produce oil and gas.

Management considers operating netback to be a key measure of operating performance and profitability on a per unit basis of production. Management believes that netback provides investors with information that is commonly used by other oil and gas companies. The measurement on a per boe basis assists management and investors with evaluating operating performance on a comparable basis. Finding and Development (""F&D"") Costs and Finding, Development and Acquisition (""FD&A"") CostsF&D costs and FD&A costs are non-GAAP ratios. The calculation for F&D includes all exploration, development capital for that period plus the change in FDC for that period. This total capital including the change in the FDC is then divided by the change in reserves for that period incorporating all revisions for that same period. The calculation for FD&A is calculated in the same manner except it also accounts for any acquisition costs incurred during the period. Gear considers F&D and FD&A as useful non-GAAP ratios for management and investors to measure the return of investment or capital efficiency of the Company's capital expenditures. Recycle RatioRecycle ratio is a non-GAAP ratio. Recycle ratio is calculated by dividing operating netback per barrel of oil equivalent by either F&D or FD&A costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent. Management uses recycle ratio to relate the cost of adding reserves to the expected cash flows to be generated. Net Asset Value (""NAV"")NAV is a supplementary financial measure the composition of which is set out under the heading ""Efficiency Ratios"" in this press release. Gear considers NAV a useful supplementary measure for management and investors as it enables oil and gas companies to measure the value of an outstanding share of the Company based on the independent reserves evaluation of the Company's reserves plus certain assumptions made by management as to the value of the other assets of the Company. For the purposes of calculating NAV as presented herein, undeveloped land has been based on internal estimates of the value of the Company's undeveloped land. Net debt is used as a component of the NAV calculation, which is a capital management measure the composition of which is explained above. For the purposes of the calculation of NAV the number of shares outstanding does not include any shares issuable on any securities of the Company that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into shares of the Company.Oil and Gas MetricsThis press release contains the term reserves life index, which is an oil and gas metric that does not have a standardized meaning or standard method of calculation and therefore such measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Reserves life index has been included herein to provide readers with an additional measure to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measure is not a reliable indicator of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods. Reserves life index is calculated by dividing the reserves in each category by the corresponding Sproule forecast of annual production. This press release also contains the terms NAV, FD&A cost, F&D cost, reserves per DA share, reserves value BT10 per DA share, recycle ratio and operating netback, which are oil and gas metrics that do not have any standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. For additional information related to these measures see ""Efficiency Ratios"" and ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" in this press release.Drilling LocationsThis press release discloses drilling locations in three categories: (i) proved locations; (ii) probable locations; and (iii) unbooked locations. Proved locations and probable locations are derived from Sproule reserves report as of December 31, 2023 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. All drilling locations identified herein that are not proved or probable locations are considered unbooked locations. Unbooked locations are internal estimates based on Gear's prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production, pricing assumptions and reserves information. There is no certainty that Gear will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which Gear actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors. While the majority of Gear's unbooked locations are extensions or infills of the drilling patterns already recognized by the independent evaluator, other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production.Barrels of Oil EquivalentDisclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1; utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:Ingram GillmorePresident & CEO403-538-8463David HwangVice President Finance & CFO403-538-8437Email: info@gearenergy.comWebsite: www.gearenergy.comTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/198799 What were Gear Energy Ltd.'s funds from operations in 2023?

Subsequent event of the merger closure subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Financial Analyst The announcement of a $0.03 net income per share and $0.26 Normalized FFO per share for the fourth quarter reflects both the company's profitability and its ability to generate cash flow from its operations. The reported increase in total revenue suggests a modest growth trajectory. However, the 40.1% decrease in net income compared to the prior year indicates potential challenges in cost management or possibly one-time expenses impacting profitability. Investors should assess the company's expense structure and the reasons behind the decline in profitability to understand its financial health better.The all-stock merger with Healthpeak Properties is a significant strategic move that could lead to operational synergies and an enhanced market presence. The market typically reacts to such mergers with a focus on the long-term value creation potential, though short-term volatility is common as investors digest the terms and implications of the deal. The merger's approval by shareholders indicates confidence in the strategic rationale, yet the closing conditions and integration process will be critical to realizing the anticipated benefits. Real Estate Market Analyst The Outpatient Medical Same-Store Cash Net Operating Income growth of 1.0% year-over-year is a modest indicator of the company's operational efficiency in a specific segment of its portfolio. This metric is important for understanding the underlying performance of the real estate assets, excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. The growth rate is relatively low, possibly reflecting market saturation or competitive pressures in the healthcare real estate sector.Furthermore, the weighted average leasing spread of 4.2% and a 74% retention rate provide insights into the company's leasing activities. A positive leasing spread indicates that new leases are being signed at higher rates than expiring ones, which is a healthy sign for revenue growth. However, investors should consider industry benchmarks for retention rates to evaluate whether the reported 74% is in line with, or deviating from, sector norms. The portfolio's 94.3% lease rate is a strong indicator of asset utilization and demand for the company's properties. Sustainability Analyst The achievements in sustainability, such as ENERGY STAR certifications and IREM Certified Sustainable Property designations, reflect a growing trend in the real estate industry towards environmental responsibility. These certifications can enhance the company's reputation and potentially lead to operational cost savings. However, the direct impact on financial performance is often long-term and may not be immediately reflected in the stock price. Investors with an interest in sustainable investing might view these certifications positively, as they align with broader ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investment criteria. 02/21/2024 - 05:00 PM Announces $0.03 Net Income per Share and $0.26 Normalized FFO per Share for the Fourth Quarter of 2023 Fourth Quarter Highlights: Announced an all-stock merger of equals with Healthpeak Properties, Inc.

This press release includes Funds From Operations (“FFO”), Normalized FFO, Normalized Funds Available For Distribution (“FAD”), Net Operating Income (“NOI”), Cash NOI, Outpatient Medical Same-Store Cash NOI, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“EBITDAre”) and Adjusted EBITDAre, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the SEC’s Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the Company, or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. As used in this press release, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We believe that information regarding FFO is helpful to shareholders and potential investors because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”). Nareit defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP units, excluding preferred distributions, gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment write-downs on depreciable assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs). Our FFO computation includes our share of required adjustments from our unconsolidated joint ventures and may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than we do. The GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, net income, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, impairments, and noncontrolling interests. In computing FFO, we eliminate these items because, in our view, they are not indicative of the results from the operations of our properties. To facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as presented in our financial statements. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered to be an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders. We use Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, acceleration of deferred financing costs, net change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain on extinguishment of debt, merger and transaction related expenses, and other normalizing items. Our Normalized FFO computation includes our share of required adjustments from our unconsolidated joint ventures and our use of the term Normalized FFO may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance or of cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), or as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. We define Normalized FAD, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes from Normalized FFO non-cash share compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above-market or below-market leases and assumed debt, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of deferred financing costs, and loan reserve adjustments, including our share of all required adjustments from unconsolidated joint ventures. We also adjust for recurring capital expenditures related to building, site, and tenant improvements, leasing commissions, cash payments from seller master leases, and rent abatement payments, including our share of all required adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating Normalized FAD, and accordingly, our computation may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although our computation of Normalized FAD may not be comparable to that of other REITs, we believe Normalized FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance due to its frequency of use by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a REIT. Normalized FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to controlling interest (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an indicator of our financial performance. Normalized FAD should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss, computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from our total portfolio of properties and other investments before general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, merger and transaction related expenses, interest expense, corporate high yield interest income, swap income, net change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment losses, including our share of all required adjustments from our unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above and below market leases, and other non-cash and normalizing items, including our share of all required adjustments from unconsolidated joint ventures. Other non-cash and normalizing items include items such as the amortization of lease inducements, loan reserve adjustments, payments received from seller master leases and rent abatements, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. We believe that Cash NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because it excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. Our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as such other companies may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Outpatient Medical Same-Store Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from Cash NOI assets not held for the entire preceding five quarters, non-outpatient medical facility assets, and other normalizing items not specifically related to the same-store property portfolio. Management considers Outpatient Medical Same-Store Cash NOI a supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts, and Company management to measure unlevered property-level operating results. Our use of the term Outpatient Medical Same-Store Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as such other companies may have different methodologies for computing this amount. We calculate EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by Nareit and define EBITDAre as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, corporate high yield interest income, swap income, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment loss, including our share of all required adjustments from unconsolidated joint ventures. We define Adjusted EBITDAre, which excludes from EBITDAre merger and transaction related expense, non-cash share compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value, pursuit costs, non-cash intangible amortization, corporate high yield interest income, the pro forma impact of investment activity, and other normalizing items. We consider EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre important measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors, and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt.

(PTGX) announced positive results from the REVIVE Phase 2 study evaluating rusfertide in polycythemia vera, a rare blood disorder. Rusfertide demonstrated efficacy in maintaining hematocrit levels below 45% without phlebotomy, reducing disease-related symptoms, and improving iron deficiency. The study met primary efficacy endpoints with high statistical significance. The Phase 3 VERIFY trial is ongoing, evaluating rusfertide's efficacy in uncontrolled hematocrit patients. Positive Positive results from the REVIVE Phase 2 study evaluating rusfertide in polycythemia vera (PV). Rusfertide maintained hematocrit levels below 45% without phlebotomy and reduced disease-related symptoms. High statistical significance in meeting primary efficacy endpoints in the REVIVE trial. Improvement in serum ferritin levels and disease-related symptoms with rusfertide treatment. Phase 3 VERIFY trial assessing rusfertide's efficacy in uncontrolled hematocrit patients nears completion of enrollment. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The publication of the Phase 2 REVIVE trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine is a significant milestone for Protagonist Therapeutics, indicating the potential of rusfertide as a novel treatment for polycythemia vera (PV). Rusfertide's ability to control erythrocytosis and maintain hematocrit levels below 45% without the need for phlebotomies addresses a critical unmet need in PV management. The reduction in disease-related symptoms is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests an improvement in the quality of life for patients. From a research perspective, the sustained durability of response observed in the open label extension is promising and could signify a long-term benefit for patients. However, the ongoing Phase 3 VERIFY trial will be essential to confirm these findings and determine the broader applicability of rusfertide in the PV patient population. Financial Analyst Protagonist Therapeutics' announcement regarding the successful Phase 2 trial results for rusfertide has potential implications for the company's financial performance. The partnership with Takeda, involving a 50:50 profit share in the U.S. and exclusive global commercialization rights for Takeda outside the U.S., could lead to significant revenue streams if rusfertide is approved and successfully commercialized. Furthermore, rusfertide's novel mechanism of action and the high unmet need in PV treatment could position it as a competitive product in the hematology market. Investors should monitor the progress of the Phase 3 VERIFY trial, as positive results could further increase Protagonist's market value and attractiveness to potential investors or acquirers. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the results of the REVIVE trial for rusfertide represent a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of polycythemia vera. Current treatment options are often insufficient in maintaining hematocrit levels and can lead to additional complications such as iron deficiency. Rusfertide's efficacy in reducing phlebotomy requirements and alleviating symptoms could significantly improve patient care. The safety profile is also encouraging, with no grade 4 or 5 adverse events reported. However, it is important to consider these results in the context of a Phase 2 trial and the larger VERIFY trial will be crucial in confirming rusfertide's safety and efficacy in a broader patient population. The medical community will be eagerly awaiting these results to better understand rusfertide's potential role in PV management. 02/21/2024 - 05:00 PM - Trial met the primary efficacy endpoint achieving a clinically and statistically significant response in maintaining hematocrit control below 45% without phlebotomy- Rusfertide was associated with lower disease-related symptoms in patients with moderate/severe scores at baseline as assessed by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form- REVIVE is one of two pivotal studies, including an ongoing Phase 3 study, VERIFY, which is nearing enrollment completionNEWARK, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTGX) (""Protagonist"" or the ""Company"") today announced publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) of the REVIVE Phase 2 study (NCT04057040) results evaluating the efficacy and safety of rusfertide in polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm affecting approximately 160,000 patients in the United States (US). Rusfertide, a peptide mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, represents a novel erythrocytosis-specific approach for the potential treatment of PV.The study demonstrated that rusfertide controlled erythrocytosis, maintained hematocrit levels <45% and eliminated the need for phlebotomies in PV patients, and was associated with decreased disease-related symptoms. Rusfertide was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar for patients treated with or without concurrent cytoreductive therapy. The most common adverse events were grade 1-2 injection site reactions and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were reported. No grade 4 or 5 adverse events were noted, and serious adverse events reported were consistent with the patients' PV and underlying co-morbidities.""Frequent phlebotomies due to poor hematocrit control can be a major burden for PV patients, prolonging physician visits, worsening iron deficiency, and leading to additional debilitating non-hematological symptoms,"" said Ronald Hoffman, M.D. the Albert A. and Vera G. List Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology) and Director of the Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute (New York, NY). ""The study results of the Phase 2 REVIVE clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine have clearly shown that rusfertide maintained hematocrit control, decreased phlebotomy requirements, and improved signs and symptoms of iron deficiency.""PV is characterized by erythrocytosis and variable increases in leukocytes and platelets. PV patients exhibit increased incidence of cardiovascular events and frequently experience systemic symptoms including itching, night sweats, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Current guidelines for treating PV focus on reducing morbidity and mortality by maintaining hematocrit levels <45%. Several ""real world"" studies indicate that currently available treatments are unable to consistently maintain hematocrit levels below 45%, leaving many patients at risk.""Standard of care treatments in PV are sometimes not well tolerated and can exacerbate fatigue and other symptoms. Phlebotomies are often burdensome and contribute to symptoms of iron deficiency. Rusfertide could be a potential novel treatment option for a broad range of PV patients based on these positive results from the Phase 2 REVIVE study,"" said Arturo Molina, M.D., M.S., Protagonist Chief Medical Officer. ""We continue to evaluate the long-term durability of response and safety of rusfertide in patients participating in the Phase 2 REVIVE study and are looking forward to the results from the Phase 3 VERIFY study in 2025.""Phase 2 REVIVE Trial ResultsThe NEJM manuscript presents results of the Phase 2 REVIVE trial, which consisted of three parts, with 70 patients enrolled in Part 1 and 59 patients randomized to placebo (29) or rusfertide (30) in Part 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the proportion of responders receiving rusfertide or placebo during the double-blind, randomized withdrawal portion of the study (Part 2). Patients were considered responders if they achieved hematocrit control, did not receive a phlebotomy, and completed 12 weeks of dosing in Part 2. Response was defined as not meeting any of the ""phlebotomy-eligibility"" criteria including: 1) hematocrit ≥45% that was ≥3% higher than their week 29 pre-randomization hematocrit value, or 2) hematocrit >48%, or 3) an increase of ≥5% in hematocrit compared to their week 29 pre-randomization value.The REVIVE trial met the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint in the Full Analysis Set with high statistical significance:69.2% (18/26) of subjects on rusfertide were responders vs. 18.5% (5/27) responders on placebo (p=0.0003) in the Full Analysis Set (n=53).In addition, the trial also met the efficacy endpoint in the Randomized Analysis Set with high statistical significance, as presented in the NEJM article:60.0% (18/30) of subjects on rusfertide responded vs. 17.2% (5/29) on placebo (p=0.002) in the Randomized Analysis Set (n=59), a sensitivity analysis, which includes 6 patients who had to discontinue treatment in Part 2 because of the brief clinical hold and were considered as non-responders.Part 3 is an open label extension (OLE) of up to 3 years. The durability of effect was sustained, with some patients remaining virtually free of phlebotomy on study for over 2.5 years. Encouraged by these durability of response findings, the long-term extension THRIVE study has been initiated wherein patients can continue with rusfertide treatment for an additional 2 years, up to a total of 5 years.Consistent with the mechanism of action, rusfertide treatment also resulted in improvement of serum ferritin levels, demonstrating redistribution of systemic iron stores. Rusfertide treatment was associated with lower severity of disease-related symptoms including fatigue, early satiety, night sweats, problems with concentration, inactivity, and itching in patients with moderate or severe individual symptom scores at baseline as assessed by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF).""We are extremely pleased with the performance of rusfertide to date, and publication of these positive findings in treatment of PV in the New England Journal of Medicine"", said Dinesh V. Patel, Ph.D., President and CEO of Protagonist. ""Currently available therapies leave a significant number of the roughly 160,000 PV patients in the U.S. requiring frequent phlebotomy because of suboptimal hematocrit control. Rusfertide, by virtue of being an erythrocytosis specific agent, has the potential to be a novel therapeutic option and we very much look forward to working closely with our new partners at Takeda to bring this important new medicine to PV patients around the world.""Under the terms of the recently announced agreement, Takeda will be Protagonist's co-development, U.S. co-commercialization partner with a 50:50 profit share, and with exclusive ex-U.S. global rights to commercialize rusfertide.Phase 3 VERIFY TrialThe Phase 3 VERIFY trial (NCT05210790) is a global Phase 3 randomized, 250-patient placebo-controlled trial, which is nearing completion of enrollment. The trial evaluates the efficacy, symptom burden and safety of once-weekly, subcutaneously self-administered rusfertide in patients with uncontrolled hematocrit who are phlebotomy dependent despite standard of care treatment.About ProtagonistProtagonist Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company with peptide-based new chemical entities (NCEs) rusfertide and JNJ-2113 (formerly PN-235) in advanced stages of clinical development, both derived from the Company's proprietary technology platform. Protagonist scientists jointly discovered PN-235 (now known as JNJ-2113) as part of Protagonist's Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) collaboration with Johnson & Johnson and followed it through IND-enabling pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies, with Johnson & Johnson assuming responsibility for further clinical development. Rusfertide, a mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, is the Company's lead drug candidate currently in a global Phase 3 development program. The randomized portion of the Phase 2 REVIVE study was unblinded, showing positive results. Patients who complete participation in the REVIVE study are eligible to participate in the ongoing open-label extension THRIVE study, which provides up to two additional years of rusfertide therapy. The global Phase 3 VERIFY study of rusfertide in polycythemia vera is ongoing. Rusfertide will be co-developed and co-commercialized with Takeda pursuant to a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Takeda entered into in January 2024. The agreement will be effective upon the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.More information on Protagonist, its pipeline drug candidates and clinical studies can be found on the Company's website at protagonist-inc.com.Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Chord Energy and Enerplus to Combine in $11 Billion Transaction Creating Premier Williston-Focused E&P Company with Top-Tier Shareholder Returns,2024-02-21T22:19:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) and Enerplus Corporation (ERF) have announced an $11 billion stock and cash transaction, creating a combined company with a premier Williston Basin position, 1.3 million net acres, and 287 MBoepd production.

The combined company aims to generate $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2024, with a strong balance sheet and low leverage.","Chord Energy and Enerplus to Combine in $11 Billion Transaction Creating Premier Williston-Focused E&P Company with Top-Tier Shareholder Returns Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Chord Energy Corporation (CHRD) and Enerplus Corporation (ERF) have announced an $11 billion stock and cash transaction, creating a combined company with a premier Williston Basin position, 1.3 million net acres, and 287 MBoepd production. The transaction is expected to drive value through commodity cycles, enhance financial metrics, deliver cost savings, and maintain ESG commitment. The combined company aims to generate $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2024, with a strong balance sheet and low leverage. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposed merger between Chord Energy Corporation and Enerplus Corporation is a significant event that could reshape the competitive landscape within the energy sector, specifically the Williston Basin. The transaction's estimated value of approximately $11 billion, inclusive of net debt, suggests a major strategic move to consolidate assets and streamline operations. The combined entity's projected free cash flow of $1.2 billion for 2024, based on specific commodity price assumptions, signals a robust financial position that could appeal to investors looking for stable returns in a volatile market.Moreover, the expected synergies of up to $150 million annually could lead to operational efficiencies and cost reductions, potentially enhancing the bottom line. However, it is crucial for investors to monitor the realization of these synergies post-merger, as such projections can be optimistic. The transaction's accretive nature to various financial metrics, including cash flow per share and net asset value, indicates a positive outlook for shareholder value creation. The commitment to a return of capital framework of 75%+ of free cash flow could be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. Market Research Analyst The merger between Chord and Enerplus highlights the trend of consolidation within the energy industry, aimed at achieving economies of scale and operational efficiencies. The combined company's enlarged acreage position totaling 1.3 million net acres and a production rate of 287,000 Boepd will likely enhance its bargaining power with service providers and may lead to improved market positioning. This scale is essential for maintaining competitiveness, especially in a sector where cost management is critical due to fluctuating commodity prices.The focus on maintaining a low leverage and a relatively unlevered balance sheet is indicative of a strategic approach to financial management that prioritizes financial flexibility and risk mitigation. This could be reassuring for stakeholders concerned about the financial risks associated with mergers and acquisitions. The emphasis on ESG and sustainability excellence also aligns with the increasing investor and regulatory demand for responsible corporate behavior, which could enhance the company's reputation and long-term viability. Energy Sector Analyst The Williston Basin is a mature oil-producing region and the merger's focus on this area suggests a strategy of leveraging existing infrastructure and expertise to maximize returns from known reserves. The mention of three-mile lateral development opportunities is significant, as longer laterals typically lead to more efficient resource extraction and reduced costs on a per-unit basis. This technical capability could set the combined entity apart from competitors and provide a pathway to sustained profitability, especially in a low-price environment.Given that the combined production is heavily weighted towards oil, with approximately 56%, the company's financial health will be closely tied to oil prices. The reference to a sub $60 WTI breakeven inventory indicates the combined company's resilience to price fluctuations, which is a critical factor for stability in the energy sector. Stakeholders should consider the potential impact of global oil price dynamics on the company's performance, especially in the context of geopolitical events and energy transition trends. 02/21/2024 - 05:19 PM Enhanced Operating Scale to Drive Returns and Free Cash Flow; Combined Acreage PositionTotaling 1.3 Million Net Acres and Combined 4Q23 Production of 287,000 Boepd Combined Company has Approximately 10 years of Low-Breakeven Inventory with Significant Opportunity to Enhance Returns through Efficiencies and Expanding Three-Mile Lateral Opportunities Transaction Accretive to Key Metrics While Preserving Low Leverage; Strong Balance Sheet and Significant Liquidity at Close Transaction Expected to Generate Administrative, Capital and Operational Cost Synergies of Up To $150 Million Annually with After-Tax Present Value up to $750 Million Post-Combination Return of Capital Expected to Remain at Chord's Pre-Combination Level of 75%+ of Free Cash Flow; Expected 2024 Pro forma Free Cash Flow of $1.2 Billion(2) Commitment to ESG and Sustainability Excellence and Capitalizing on Combined Best Practices Danny Brown to Serve as President and CEO; Ian Dundas to Serve as Advisor to the CEO and Director; Three Additional Enerplus Directors to Join Combined Company Board Companies to Host Conference Call Today at 6:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. CT and 4:00 p.m. MT) HOUSTON and CALGARY, AB, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CHRD) (""Chord"", ""Chord Energy"") and Enerplus Corporation (TSX: ERF) (NYSE: ERF) (""Enerplus"") today announced they have entered into a definitive arrangement agreement under which Chord will combine with Enerplus in an approximately $11 billion stock and cash transaction.

I want to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work over the years that has allowed us to build such a great organization and reach this exciting milestone."" Combined Company Positioned to Drive Value Through Commodity Cycles Enhances Williston Basin Position with Increased Scale. The combined company is expected to be a premier operator in the Williston Basin, with approximately 1.3 million net acres (98% Williston) and 4Q23 production of 287 MBoepd (over 90% Williston). Oil is expected to be approximately 56% of the combined company's production, supporting peer-leading EBITDA margins.Adds Significant High-Quality Inventory. The combined company is expected to benefit from an enhanced inventory position, increasing its sub $60 WTI breakeven inventory by over 60%, improved returns and resilient free cash flow through commodity cycles. The pro forma inventory supports approximately 10 years of development at the current pace and expands the company's opportunities for three-mile lateral development.Accretive to All Financial Metrics. The transaction is expected to be accretive to all metrics, including: i) cash flow per share, ii) free cash flow per share, iii) net asset value and iv) return of capital. Significant synergies allow for additional potential accretion in 2025 and beyond.Delivers Significant Cost Saving and Synergy Opportunities. The combined company expects to benefit from administrative, capital and operating synergies of up to $150 million per year. Administrative synergies are expected to begin immediately in 2024 and increase in 2025 up to $40 million. Capital synergies are expected to increase up to $55 million during 2025, and operating synergies initiate in 2025 and are expected to increase up to $55 million in 2026. The combined company will leverage best practices to further advance efficiencies across the business. The after-tax present value of synergies is expected to exceed $750 million.Supports Top-Tier Shareholder Returns. The combined company is expected to generate meaningful free cash flow from its low-cost asset base, improving efficiencies and disciplined capital spending through a wide range of commodity price scenarios. The combined company is expected to generate approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow with a reinvestment rate of approximately 51% in 2024 at $79/bbl WTI and $2.50/MMBtu NYMEX gas. Post-closing Chord is expected to maintain its peer-leading return of capital framework at 75%+ of free cash flow through base and variable dividends and share repurchases.Creates Stronger Financial Position and Relatively Unlevered Balance Sheet. The combined company is expected to have an improved credit profile and cost of capital, with a strong balance sheet with expected leverage of ~0.2x at close.Continued ESG Commitment. The combined company will maintain and build upon its commitment to ESG and sustainability excellence and capitalize on combined best practices.Transaction Details Under the terms of the agreement, Enerplus shareholders will receive 0.10125 shares of Chord common stock and $1.84 in cash for each common share of Enerplus owned at closing.

NOTICE REGARDING INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS NEWS RELEASE All amounts in this news release are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified. This news release contains references to ""BOE"" (barrels of oil equivalent) and ""MBOE"" (one thousand barrels of oil equivalent). The parties have adopted the standard of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) when converting natural gas to BOEs. BOE and MBOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. The foregoing conversion ratios are based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading. All production volumes presented in this news release are reported on a ""net"" basis (a company's working interest share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus the company's royalty interests), which differs from ""gross"" basis (a company's working interest before deduction of royalties) for reporting production under National Instrument 51-101 and industry practice in Canada.

Chromocell Therapeutics Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering for Gross Proceeds of $6.6 Million,2024-02-21T21:47:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Chromocell Therapeutics Corporation (CHRO) successfully closes its initial public offering, raising approximately $6.6 million.

The company offered 1,100,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as the book-running manager for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent initial public offering (IPO) of Chromocell Therapeutics Corporation is a significant event in the financial markets, particularly for investors interested in the biotech sector. With the company raising approximately $6.6 million before expenses, this capital infusion is critical for its continued research and development efforts in the non-opioid pain alleviation space. Analyzing the IPO price of $6.00 per share, it is essential to consider the company's valuation in relation to its clinical pipeline's potential and the market's appetite for biotech IPOs. The funds raised will likely be directed towards advancing clinical trials, which could, in turn, enhance investor confidence if positive outcomes are achieved. However, the inherent risks of clinical-stage biotech investing, such as regulatory hurdles and the possibility of unsuccessful trials, must be weighed against the potential for high returns. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the success of Chromocell's IPO is a testament to the growing interest in non-opioid pain management solutions. Given the opioid crisis and the subsequent demand for safer pain therapies, Chromocell's focus on developing new therapeutics could address a significant unmet medical need. The capital raised could accelerate the progress of their lead candidates through the clinical trial process. The outcome of these trials will be crucial in determining the company's future, as positive data could lead to partnerships, further investment and eventual product commercialization, while negative results could pose substantial setbacks. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the listing of Chromocell on the NYSE American LLC marks another addition to the list of publicly traded biotech firms. This move increases the visibility of the company and provides retail and institutional investors with an opportunity to participate in the company's growth. The role of A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as the sole book-running manager indicates a level of confidence in the offering, although the relatively small size of the IPO suggests a cautious approach to fundraising in the current market climate. Future stock performance will likely hinge on the company's ability to meet development milestones and manage cash burn, factors that are closely monitored by market analysts. 02/21/2024 - 04:47 PM FREEHOLD, N.J., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chromocell Therapeutics Corporation (NYSE American: CHRO) (“Chromocell”, “our”, “us” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotech company focused on developing and commercializing new, non-opioid therapeutics to alleviate pain, today announced the closing of its initial public offering of 1,100,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $6.00 per share.

Financial Analyst The announcement by Parsons Corporation of its intent to offer $700 million in convertible senior notes is a strategic financial move that warrants a closer look from a financial perspective. The use of convertible notes is a hybrid financing option that gives investors the right to convert their debt into equity, typically shares of the company's common stock, at a later date. This can be attractive to investors who are looking for the potential upside of equity with the protection of debt.From a financial analysis standpoint, the key factors to consider include the interest rate and conversion terms of the notes, which will determine their attractiveness to potential investors. The decision to use a portion of the proceeds to repurchase outstanding convertible notes due in 2025 suggests a strategic liability management approach, potentially aiming to manage the company's debt profile and interest expenses. Furthermore, the use of capped call transactions is indicative of Parsons' attempt to limit dilution to existing shareholders upon conversion of the notes, which is a common concern in such offerings.The impact of these transactions on the stock market can be multifaceted. On one hand, the repurchase of existing notes and the associated unwinding of hedge positions may create short-term upward pressure on Parsons' stock price. On the other hand, the potential dilution from the conversion of new notes could have a longer-term impact on the stock's value. Investors will need to weigh these factors against the company's growth prospects and use of the net proceeds for corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and working capital. Market Research Analyst Convertible note offerings are often a reflection of a company's market position and strategic outlook. In the case of Parsons Corporation, the offering size and terms will likely be influenced by current market conditions, investor sentiment and the company's creditworthiness. Market research analysts would assess the competitive landscape and the potential impact of Parsons' planned use of proceeds on its market position.Additionally, the repurchase of existing convertible notes and the entry into capped call transactions could be seen as a move to optimize capital structure and manage earnings-per-share dilution, which could be viewed positively by the market if executed effectively. However, these transactions can also be complex and may introduce volatility in the stock's trading price, as hedging activities by the option counterparties may affect the supply and demand dynamics of Parsons' common stock.Ultimately, the success of the offering and its impact on Parsons' business and stock will depend on how these funds are allocated towards growth initiatives and whether these lead to an improved competitive position and financial performance in the long run. Legal Expert The offering of convertible senior notes by Parsons Corporation is subject to market and other conditions and it is being conducted through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. This legal framework allows the company to raise capital more efficiently by bypassing the need for a public offering registration, which can be time-consuming and costly.However, it's important to note that such securities, unless registered, cannot be offered or sold to the general public in the United States. The legal implications of the offering, including the potential need for future registration of the securities or reliance on exemptions from registration, are critical considerations for the company and potential investors. The legal structuring of the offering, including the capped call transactions and the repurchase of existing notes, requires careful navigation of securities laws to ensure compliance and minimize legal risk.For investors, understanding the legal nuances of these instruments is essential, as they carry different rights and restrictions compared to publicly traded securities. The legal expert's perspective is crucial in evaluating the regulatory implications and ensuring that the offering adheres to the applicable securities laws. 02/21/2024 - 04:58 PM CHANTILLY, Va., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parsons Corporation (NYSE: PSN) announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement. Parsons also expects to grant the initial purchasers in the offering an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Parsons. The notes will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to October 1, 2028, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events, and thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, the notes will settle for cash and, if applicable, shares of Parsons’ common stock. Parsons may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at its option, on or after March 8, 2027 and before the 51st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Parsons’ common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. Parsons intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Additionally, Parsons expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a portion of its outstanding 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Existing Convertible Notes”) concurrently with and/or shortly after the pricing of the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. Parsons intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, potential acquisitions and working capital. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Parsons expects to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below. Any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, potential acquisitions and working capital. Parsons expects that some or all of the holders of the Existing Convertible Notes that are repurchased in the concurrent repurchases described above may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Parsons’ common stock or purchase shares of Parsons’ common stock in open market transactions to unwind hedge positions they may have with respect to their investment in the Existing Convertible Notes concurrently with and/or shortly after the pricing of the offering. These transactions may place upward pressure on the trading price of Parsons’ common stock, causing the common stock to trade at higher prices than would be the case in the absence of these transactions, which could increase the initial conversion price of the notes. In connection with issuing the Existing Convertible Notes, Parsons entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “existing convertible note hedge transactions”) and warrant transactions (the “existing warrant transactions,” and, together with the existing convertible note hedge transactions, the “existing call spread transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing option counterparties”). If Parsons repurchases any of its Existing Convertible Notes, then Parsons intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to terminate a portion of the existing convertible note hedge transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes repurchased. In addition, Parsons intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to terminate a portion of the existing warrant transactions with respect to a number of shares equal to the notional shares underlying such Existing Convertible Notes repurchased. In connection with such terminations and the related unwinding of the existing hedge position of the existing option counterparties with respect to such transactions, Parsons expects such existing option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may purchase or sell shares of Parsons’ common stock in the open market and/or enter into or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to Parsons’ common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could affect the market price of Parsons’ common stock and the initial conversion price of the notes. The repurchases of the Existing Convertible Notes and the unwind of the existing call spread transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the Existing Convertible Notes participating in the repurchases of the Existing Convertible Notes and the existing option counterparties, as applicable, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Parsons’ common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes offered hereby at that time and the initial conversion price of the notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Parsons expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected to initially cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Parsons’ common stock that will underlie the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Parsons expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Parsons’ common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or at its election (subject to certain conditions) offset any potential cash payments Parsons is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of Parsons’ common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price per share exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Parsons’ common stock and/or purchase shares of Parsons’ common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price per share of Parsons’ common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Parsons’ common stock and/or purchasing or selling Parsons’ common stock or other securities of Parsons in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes and (y) are likely to do so following any repurchase of notes by Parsons if Parsons elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price per share of Parsons’ common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of Parsons’ common stock and/or value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of Parsons’ common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and are not expected to be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Kaman Board of Directors Declares Dividend,2024-02-21T21:35:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Kaman Corporation (KAMN) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 20 cents per common share, payable on April 11, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 19, 2024.","Kaman Board of Directors Declares Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags management dividends Rhea-AI Summary Kaman Corporation (KAMN) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 20 cents per common share, payable on April 11, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 19, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly dividend by Kaman Corporation is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are typically distributed by companies that have reached a certain level of maturity and have steady cash flows, allowing them to share profits with investors.From a financial perspective, the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price, is a key metric for investors. It provides insight into the return they can expect on their investment, relative to the market price of the stock. In the case of Kaman Corporation, a dividend of 20 cents per common share can be attractive if the share price is relatively low, enhancing the yield.However, it's important to note that while dividends can be a sign of corporate stability, they also imply that the company may not have high-yield investment opportunities to reinvest its profits for higher growth. Investors typically balance the desire for immediate income through dividends with the potential for capital gains from reinvestment in the business. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a dividend may also reflect on the company's strategic position within its industry. In sectors where growth is slow, companies might opt to reward shareholders through dividends rather than reinvesting heavily in the business. For Kaman Corporation, which operates in the industrials sector, the regular dividend could indicate a stable market position with moderate growth prospects.It is also essential to consider the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio suggests that the company is able to maintain its dividend without compromising its financial stability or growth prospects. An unusually high payout ratio, on the other hand, could indicate potential cash flow issues or a lack of opportunities for reinvestment.Investors often look at dividend announcements as a signal of confidence from management in the company's ongoing profitability. A consistent dividend policy can thus have a positive impact on the company's stock price, as it may attract income-focused investors and contribute to the perception of the company as a reliable investment. 02/21/2024 - 04:35 PM BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NYSE:KAMN) The Kaman Corporation board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 20 cents per common share.

The company's ability to adjust for such external factors and still report growth is noteworthy. The 2% decline in Vacation Ownership contract sales year-over-year, when not accounting for the wildfires, could have been a point of concern, but the adjusted figures suggest underlying strength in consumer demand.Furthermore, the company's strategic share repurchase program, which saw 6% of shares outstanding being bought back, alongside the dividend payments totaling $106 million, reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This could be interpreted as a signal of confidence from management in the company's financial health and future prospects. Adjustments to contract terms and reserve methodology for vacation ownership notes receivable, referred to as the 'Alignment', may have accounting implications that merit closer examination to understand their impact on revenue recognition and the balance sheet. Market Research Analyst Marriott Vacations Worldwide's guidance for the full year 2024 and their focus on leveraging technology for revenue growth and efficiency gains suggest strategic planning aimed at enhancing competitiveness in the vacation ownership market. The unchanged Volume Per Guest (VPG) metric, after adjusting for the wildfires, is an important indicator of stable consumer spending power and product attractiveness. As the vacation ownership industry is closely tied to economic cycles and consumer discretionary spending, the consistent VPG points to MVW's ability to maintain its value proposition in a potentially volatile market.Another aspect to consider is the increased quarterly dividend, which may be attractive to income-focused investors and could have implications for the stock's yield. The company's performance in a post-pandemic environment, where travel and hospitality sectors are experiencing a resurgence, will be critical to monitor, as it may influence both short-term operational results and long-term strategic positioning within the industry. Economist The financial results of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation reflect broader economic trends, including the recovery of the travel and hospitality sector following the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's ability to grow contract sales amidst external adversities like natural disasters is indicative of a robust discretionary spending environment. However, it is essential to consider the potential impact of macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence on future performance.An economist might analyze the implications of the company's financial strategies, such as share repurchases and dividend increases, within the current economic climate. These actions could be seen as a utilization of capital toward shareholder returns rather than reinvestment into the business, which may have different effects on long-term growth versus short-term shareholder value. Additionally, the adjustments made to contract terms and reserve methodologies could be interpreted as a strategic response to changing economic conditions, which merits further analysis in terms of financial stability and risk management. 02/21/2024 - 04:34 PM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: VAC) (“MVW” or the “Company”) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and provided guidance for full year 2024. “After a challenging year, we ended the year on a very positive note, growing contract sales by 4% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis with VPG in-line with the prior year, after adjusting for the estimated impact of the Maui wildfires,” said John Geller, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The transition to Abound by Marriott Vacations is behind us. Moving forward, we continue to look for ways to leverage technology to grow our revenues while driving efficiencies and cost savings across the organization.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Consolidated Vacation Ownership contract sales declined 2% year-over-year to $447 million driven by 2% lower volume per guest (“VPG”). The Company estimates that excluding the impact of the Maui wildfires, contract sales would have grown 4%, tours would have increased 4% and VPG would have been unchanged compared to the prior year. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $35 million and fully diluted earnings per share was $0.93. Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders was $75 million and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share was $1.88. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million. The Company repurchased 431,000 shares of its common stock for $38 million during the quarter and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share, which was paid in January. For the year, the Company repurchased 6% of its shares outstanding for $286 million and paid $106 million in dividends. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results On August 8, 2023, a wildfire devastated the area of West Maui. While the Company operates four vacation ownership resorts and sales centers in the area, it did not sustain any physical damage to these resorts and sales centers. However, the Company estimates the Maui wildfires negatively impacted its fourth quarter contract sales by approximately $25 million, Net income attributable to common stockholders by $17 million and Adjusted EBITDA by $24 million. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company aligned its contract terms for the sale of its Marriott-, Westin-, and Sheraton-branded vacation ownership products, resulting in the acceleration of revenue from the sale of Marriott-branded vacation ownership interests. In addition, the Company aligned its reserve methodology for vacation ownership notes receivable for these brands, resulting in a decrease in the reserve for the acquired notes offset by an increase in the reserve for the originated notes. Together, these changes are referred to as the “Alignment.” The tables below illustrate the comparison of the reported results from the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as adjusted results that reflect the estimated impact of the Maui fires, to the results from the fourth quarter of 2022, including the impact of the Alignment on the Company’s reported results for that time period.

The decline was driven by a 2% year-over-year reduction in consolidated contract sales resulting from the Maui wildfires, as well as a $24 million prior year reportability benefit. Adjusted for the estimated $25 million impact of the Maui wildfires, consolidated contract sales would have increased 4% year-over-year. Segment financial results attributable to common stockholders declined $42 million to $199 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined $25 million to $236 million. Adjusting for the $25 million estimated impact from the Maui wildfires in the current year and $7 million Alignment benefit in the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 3% to $261 million.

Interval International ended the year with 1.6 million active members, in-line with the prior year, and Average revenue per member increased 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Segment financial results attributable to common stockholders were $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, Segment margin was 31% and Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $31 million. Adjusted for the estimated impact from the Maui wildfires, Segment Adjusted EBITDA would have decreased $1 million to $30 million. Corporate and Other General and administrative costs increased $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher IT spending to drive our digital and data initiatives. Balance Sheet and Liquidity The Company ended the year with $929 million in liquidity, including $248 million of cash and cash equivalents, $60 million of gross notes receivable that were eligible for securitization, and $621 million of available capacity under its revolving corporate credit facility.

A-16 MARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In our press release and schedules, and on the related conference call, we report certain financial measures that are not prescribed by GAAP. We discuss our reasons for reporting these non-GAAP financial measures below, and the financial schedules included herein reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure that we report (identified by an asterisk (“*”) on the preceding pages). Although we evaluate and present these non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income or loss attributable to common stockholders, earnings or loss per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Certain Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Financial Measures We evaluate non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified by an asterisk (“*”) on the preceding pages, that exclude certain items as further described in the financial schedules included herein, and believe these measures provide useful information to investors because these non-GAAP financial measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of these items. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results from our on-going core operations before these items with results from other companies. Adjusted Development Profit and Adjusted Development Profit Margin We evaluate Adjusted development profit (Adjusted sale of vacation ownership products, net of expenses) and Adjusted development profit margin as indicators of operating performance. Adjusted development profit margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted development profit by revenues from the Sale of vacation ownership products. Adjusted development profit and Adjusted development profit margin adjust Sale of vacation ownership products revenues for the impact of revenue reportability, include corresponding adjustments to Cost of vacation ownership products associated with the change in revenues from the Sale of vacation ownership products, and may include adjustments for certain items as necessary. We evaluate Adjusted development profit and Adjusted development profit margin and believe they provide useful information to investors because they allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of revenue reportability and certain items to our Development profit and Development profit margin. Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA, a financial measure that is not prescribed by GAAP, is defined as earnings, or net income or loss attributable to common stockholders, before interest expense, net (excluding consumer financing interest expense associated with term securitization transactions), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects additional adjustments for certain items and excludes share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. For purposes of our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations, we do not adjust for consumer financing interest expense associated with term securitization transactions because we consider it to be an operating expense of our business. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance, which we use to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, expand our business, and return cash to stockholders. We also use Adjusted EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, because this measure excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provisions for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as an indicator of operating performance because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of the excluded items. Adjusted EBITDA also facilitates comparison by us, analysts, investors, and others, of results from our on-going core operations before the impact of these items with results from other companies. Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin as indicators of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by the Company’s total revenues less cost reimbursement revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by the applicable segment’s total revenues less cost reimbursement revenues. We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin and believe it provides useful information to investors because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow We evaluate Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditures for property and equipment and the borrowing and repayment activity related to our term securitizations, which cash can be used for, among other purposes, strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which reflects additional adjustments to Free Cash Flow for the impact of transaction and integration charges, impact of borrowings available from the securitization of eligible vacation ownership notes receivable, and changes in restricted cash, allows for period-over-period comparisons of the cash generated by our business before the impact of these items. Analysis of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow also facilitates management’s comparison of our results with our competitors’ results. Results As Adjusted for the Estimated Impact of the Maui Fires In our press release and schedules we provide As Adjusted results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 for comparison purposes. The As Adjusted results reflect the estimated impact of the Maui fires on the Company’s reported results on a GAAP basis, as well as to the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures. We provide this As Adjusted information because we believe that it facilitates the comparison of results from our on-going core operations before the estimated impact of the Maui fires. We believe that the As Adjusted results provide useful information to assist with period-over-period comparisons of our on-going operations excluding any estimated impact from the Maui fires. Results As Adjusted for the Impact of the Alignment In our press release and schedules we provide As Adjusted results for the three- and twelve-months ended December 31, 2022 for comparison purposes. The As Adjusted results exclude any impacts to the Company’s reported results on a GAAP basis, as well as to the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, due to the Alignment. We provide this As Adjusted information because we believe that it facilitates the comparison of results from our on-going core operations before the impact of the Alignment.

Increased sales in foil balloons, commercial films, and balloon-inspired gifts drove the company's financial performance. Ongoing investments in robotic technology to enhance operational efficiencies and development of compostable material solutions. Management is optimistic about delivering solid performance in 2024, with a focus on marketing strategies for foil balloons and balloon-inspired gifts. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported double-digit revenue growth for Yunhong Green CTI Ltd. in the fourth quarter reflects a positive momentum in the company's operational performance. The 21.4% increase in quarterly revenue indicates that the company has effectively capitalized on market opportunities across its product lines. This is further substantiated by the growth in net income, which contrasts starkly with the net loss reported in the previous year. Such a turnaround is indicative of effective cost management and potentially increased demand for the company's products.From a market perspective, the improvement in gross margin from 19% to 24% suggests enhanced efficiency in operations or a favorable shift in the sales mix. Investors often scrutinize gross margin as a key indicator of a company's core profitability before administrative and other costs are taken into account. The shift from a net loss to net income and the improvement in diluted EPS, are likely to be well-received by the market, as these are critical measures of profitability and shareholder value. Financial Analyst Examining the full-year financials, the slight decline in revenue from $18 million to $17.8 million raises questions about the company's year-over-year growth trajectory. However, the significant improvement in net loss, from $1.5 million to $0.2 million, along with the positive shift in diluted EPS, suggests that the company is becoming more profitable and may be streamlining operations to reduce costs. The reduction in net loss is a positive signal to investors that the company is moving towards financial stability.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes items like interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, increased substantially from $0.1 million to $1.1 million. This non-GAAP measure provides investors with additional insight into the company's operational performance and cash flow generation capability, excluding non-operational or non-cash expenses. Sustainability Analyst Yunhong Green CTI's ongoing development of compostable material solutions and the acquisition of a facility in Hubei, China, for manufacturing these products represent a strategic investment in sustainability. As environmental concerns become more central to consumer choices and regulatory frameworks, the company's focus on compostable materials may provide a competitive advantage and open up new market segments. This focus on sustainability aligns with broader industry trends towards eco-friendly products and could enhance the company's brand reputation and long-term profitability.Furthermore, the investment in robotic technology to enhance operational efficiencies suggests a forward-looking approach to manufacturing. Such investments can lead to long-term cost savings and improved product quality, which are critical factors in maintaining competitiveness in the industry. 02/21/2024 - 04:30 PM Double digit fourth quarter revenue growth on broad-based strength across the company's product linesRevenue of $6.8 million for the fourth quarter, up 21.4% from the prior year periodNet income of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $0.1 million for the prior year periodRevenue for the full year ended December 31 of $17.8 million compared to $18 million in 2022Net loss improved to $0.2 million for 2023 as compared to a net loss of $1.5 million in 2022Diluted earnings per share improved to ($0.01) from ($0.22) for the same periodsLAKE BARRINGTON, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Yunhong Green CTI Ltd.

""Our accelerating revenue growth was broad-based, driven by increased sales in all three product areas - foil balloons, commercial films, and balloon-inspired gifts, were up from the prior year, yet we shipped that 20% increase in product flow more quickly. Our balance sheet is in better shape, our operations continue to improve, and we believe we are poised to deliver another solid performance in 2024.""Commenting further, Cesario stated, ""We continue to be encouraged by the progress our team is making as we move through the development phases required to advance our compostable material solutions toward a commercially viable solution. Last year our stockholders authorized more shares of stock to be available for opportunistic acquisitions, and I'm pleased that we have identified the first of what I hope to be many good options for our company. As you have seen, we are in the process of acquiring a facility in Hubei, China, from which we plan to manufacture compostable products in the future. This facility, serving as our headquarters in China, also allows us greater connectivity to the broader Yunhong organization, something that I believe will pay dividends in many areas moving forward.""Cesario concluded, ""We are committed to finding effective marketing strategies for our foil balloons and balloon-inspired gifts while at the same time developing potential new, complementary revenue sources.""2023 Results (unaudited)For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net sales by product category were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ $ (000) % of (000) % of Product Category Net Sales Net Sales Variance % change Foil Balloons $3,656 54% $2,740 49% $916 33% Film Products 182 3% 136 3% 46 34% Other $2,933 43% $2,694 48% $239 9% Total $6,771 100% $5,570 100% $1,201 22% Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ $ (000) % of (000) % of Product Category Net Sales Net Sales Variance % change Foil Balloons $11,769 66% $10,858 60% $911 8% Film Products 928 5% 2,036 11% (1,108) (54%) Other $5,107 29% $5,154 29% $(47) (1%) Total $17,804 100% $18,048 100% $(244) (1%)Non-GAAP ResultsTo provide additional information regarding the Company's results, we have disclosed in this press release a Non-GAAP measure that combines EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization) as well as results excluding deconsolidation charges and certain non-recurring charges and benefits. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has included EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure in this press release because it is a key measure used by management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate the core operating performance of the Company, to prepare budgets and operating plans, and because management believes such measure provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results. However, the use of EBITDA as an analytic tool has its limitations and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP statement of this non-GAAP measure is contained in the accompanying table. Similarly, management and the board of directors look at the results of the entity going forward, without the impact of deconsolidation costs related to the disposal of subsidiaries and related non-cash charges, which can be significant. Again, this pro forma result is not a replacement for the Company's financial results as reported under GAAP. It simply provides another viewpoint that may otherwise be obscured by a comprehensive presentation. A reconciliation between this pro forma result and our financial results as reported under GAAP is also presented.2023 Summary Results (Non-GAAP; unaudited) Twelve Months ended December 31, 2023 Q4 2022 Q4 2023 2022 Net Income 485,000 (78,000) (235,000) (1,467,000)Addback: Interest 207,000 125,000 628,000 450,000 Addback: Taxes Addback Lender fees 63,000 81,000 296,000 471,000 Addback: Equity comp 5,000 9,000 21,000 164,000 Addback: Depr/Amort 74,000 114,000 351,000 448,000 Adj EBITDA 834,000 251,000 1,061,000 66,000 2023 Results Conference Call / Webcast InformationYunhong CTI will host its conference call on Thursday, February 22, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time / 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.The live webcast will be available at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2863/49790.For those planning to participate in the call, please dial +1-877-545-0523 (domestic) or 973-528-0011 (international).

Adjusted EBITDA and net income per diluted share declined compared to 2022. Positive Net service revenue increased to $570.8 million for Q4 2023 compared to $562.0 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $56.7 million for Q4 2023, down from $59.9 million in 2022. Net loss attributable to Amedisys, Inc. was $9.7 million for full year 2023, compared to net income of $118.6 million in 2022. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.94 for Q4 2023, lower than $1.16 in 2022. Adjusted net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. was $140.6 million for full year 2023, a decrease from $163.4 million in 2022. Negative Net loss attributable to Amedisys, Inc. for full year 2023 was $9.7 million due to $142.7 million in merger costs. Adjusted EBITDA and net income per diluted share declined in 2023 compared to 2022. Amedisys will not hold a quarterly earnings call due to the pending merger with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated. Financial Analyst Reviewing Amedisys Inc.'s recent financial results reveals several key points that are critical to understanding the company's current fiscal health and future prospects. The reported increase in net service revenue, albeit modest, indicates resilience in core operations despite the divestiture of the personal care business. However, the net loss attributable to Amedisys Inc., primarily due to substantial costs associated with merger transactions, raises concerns about the impact of these one-time expenses on the company's short-term profitability.It is also noteworthy that the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income figures, which exclude certain items, are lower compared to the previous year. This suggests underlying pressures on operational efficiency or possible increases in costs not directly related to the core services provided. Additionally, the decline in adjusted net income per diluted share year over year could be a red flag for investors seeking consistent earnings growth.From a strategic standpoint, the pending merger with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated could significantly alter the company's trajectory, potentially unlocking synergies and expanding market reach. However, the absence of a quarterly earnings call due to the pending merger limits direct communication with investors, which might contribute to uncertainty in the short term. Market Research Analyst The healthcare at home sector, in which Amedisys operates, is experiencing a growing demand due to an aging population and a general trend towards outpatient care. Amedisys's expansion of its service offerings and its partnership with over 3,000 hospitals and 110,000 physicians nationwide positions it well to capitalize on these market trends. However, the financial results indicate that despite revenue growth, profitability challenges persist.Investors should monitor how Amedisys integrates its operations with UnitedHealth Group post-merger, as the success of this integration could be pivotal in realizing cost efficiencies and enhancing service capabilities. The competitive landscape of the healthcare at home industry is also a factor to consider, as consolidation within the industry could affect Amedisys's market share and bargaining power. Healthcare Industry Analyst The reported financials of Amedisys underscore the impact of strategic decisions such as the divestiture of the personal care business and the pending merger. The divestiture might reflect a strategic refocusing on more profitable or core segments of home healthcare, which is a common trend in the industry aiming for optimized service delivery. Meanwhile, the merger with UnitedHealth Group could potentially enhance Amedisys's capabilities in high acuity care services, which are increasingly in demand.However, the reported net loss and the decrease in adjusted net income raise questions about the company's cost management and the scalability of its business model in the face of industry headwinds such as regulatory changes and reimbursement challenges. These financial indicators are essential for stakeholders to assess the company's ability to maintain service quality and profitability amidst the evolving healthcare landscape. 02/21/2024 - 04:30 PM BATON ROUGE, La., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amedisys, Inc.

(CDE) reports strong fourth quarter performance with a 35% increase in revenue, reaching $262 million. Full-year 2024 guidance anticipates significant production growth. Key highlights include successful gold and silver production, progress in Rochester expansion, and record free cash flow at Wharf mine. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Coeur Mining, Inc. indicate a substantial increase in quarterly revenue, driven by operational improvements and increased production at key mines. The 35% revenue growth is a robust indicator of the company's operational efficiency and market demand for its products. However, the GAAP net loss from continuing operations, both quarterly and annually, suggests that there are underlying challenges that may affect the company's profitability. The adjusted EBITDA figures provide a clearer picture of the company's operational performance by excluding non-cash and one-time items, which shows a more-than doubling quarter-over-quarter, reflecting operational improvements and cost management.Investors should note the ramp-up of the Rochester expansion, which is anticipated to significantly contribute to production growth and cost reduction. The expected sharp declines in costs in the second half of the year could be a positive signal for improved margins. The all-time record annual free cash flow reported by the Wharf mine demonstrates the company's ability to generate cash efficiently, which is critical for sustaining operations and funding future growth. The hedging strategy described for the expected 2024 gold and silver production may provide some predictability in cash flows despite commodity price fluctuations.However, the increase in total debt and the LCM adjustment at Rochester could be areas of concern. The adjustment indicates that market prices have impacted the value of inventory, which could lead to volatility in earnings. Investors should also consider the capital expenditures and their alignment with the company's strategic objectives, as well as the liquidity position, which reflects the company's ability to meet short-term obligations and invest in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Coeur Mining's performance in the fourth quarter showcases the impact of strategic investments and operational efficiency on production output. The increase in gold and silver production, along with the achievement of full-year production guidance, is a positive indicator of the company's capability to meet market demands and leverage rising commodity prices. The average realized prices for gold and silver in 2023, which were higher than the previous year, suggest favorable market conditions that Coeur has capitalized on.The company's U.S. operations contributing a significant portion of the revenue underscores the importance of geographic diversification and the stability provided by domestic operations. The ongoing expansion and exploration projects, such as at Rochester and Silvertip, could further enhance the company's market position by increasing reserves and extending mine life, which are critical factors for long-term sustainability.Investors should monitor the developments in the Rochester expansion and the transition at Palmarejo following the expected transaction with Fresnillo, as these could have significant implications for production volumes and cost structures. Moreover, the market should assess the impact of inflationary pressures on consumable costs, which have contributed to higher costs applicable to sales, as this could affect profitability if not mitigated effectively. Mining Sector Analyst The mining sector is highly sensitive to operational efficiencies, cost control and commodity price fluctuations. Coeur Mining's report indicates a strategic focus on expanding and optimizing its key assets, which is a common approach in the industry to leverage economies of scale. The commissioning of Rochester's new crushing circuit and anticipated ramp-up activities are in line with industry trends of investing in technology and infrastructure to lower production costs and enhance output.The record free cash flow from Wharf and the cumulative free cash flow since acquisition show the company's ability to extract value from its investments, which is essential for funding ongoing operations and future expansions without solely relying on external financing. The Silvertip polymetallic exploration project's high-grade intercepts are indicative of the sector's ongoing pursuit of high-quality resources to replenish and expand reserves.It is important to note that the increase in costs applicable to sales and general and administrative expenses reflect broader industry challenges, such as inflationary pressures and increased regulatory compliance costs. The sector also faces environmental and social governance (ESG) considerations, which are not directly mentioned in the financial report but are increasingly important to investors and can influence the long-term viability of mining operations. 02/21/2024 - 04:30 PM Strong fourth quarter performances at Rochester and Wharf drove a 35% increase in quarterly revenue Full-year 2024 guidance highlights significant expected production growth CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CDE) today reported fourth quarter 2023 financial results, including revenue of $262 million and cash flow from operating activities of $65 million. The Company reported GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $26 million, or $0.07 per share. On an adjusted basis1, Coeur reported EBITDA of $64 million, cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital of $45 million and net loss from continuing operations of $6 million, or $0.02 per share. For the full year, Coeur reported revenue of $821 million, cash flow from operating activities of $67 million and GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $104 million, or $0.30 per share. On an adjusted basis1, the Company reported EBITDA of $142 million, cash flow from operating activities prior to changes in working capital of $59 million and net loss from continuing operations of $78 million, or $0.23 per share. Key Highlights Strong fourth quarter drove significant increases in revenue and adjusted EBITDA – Production increases at Rochester and strong finishes at Kensington and Wharf drove a 35% increase in revenue and a more-than doubling of adjusted EBITDA quarter-over-quarter Full-year 2023 gold and silver production guidance achieved – Gold and silver production increased 29% and 34% quarter-over-quarter, respectively, to 101,609 ounces and 3.1 million ounces. Full-year gold and silver production totaled 317,671 ounces and 10.3 million ounces, respectively, within the Company’s consolidated production guidance ranges Rochester expansion ramp-up progressing – Commissioning of Rochester’s new crushing circuit is progressing, with completion of ramp-up activities anticipated during the first half of 2024. Full-year 2024 silver and gold production guidance reflects strong anticipated year-over-year growth while second half cost guidance highlights sharp expected declines compared to recent years. Once operating at full capacity, throughput levels are expected to average 32 million tons per year, approximately 2.5 times higher than historical levels Wharf delivers all-time record annual free cash flow1 – The Wharf gold mine in South Dakota ended the fourth quarter with operating cash flow of $29 million and free cash flow1 of approximately $27 million. For the full year, operating cash flow totaled $84 million and free cash flow1 reached an all-time record $82 million. Since acquiring Wharf in February 2015, Coeur has generated cumulative free cash flow1 of more than four times its original $99.5 million investment while mine life has remained strong at six years compared to the estimated five-year mine life at the time of acquisition Silvertip drills one of its highest grade intercepts ever – Results have been received for almost half of 2023 drilling in the Southern Silver Zone at the high-grade Silvertip polymetallic exploration project in northern British Columbia, including the highest-grade intercept ever drilled at the Southern Silver Zone in this rapidly growing near area “The Company finished 2023 on a high note, highlighted by a significant step-up in production levels at the newly expanded Rochester mine in Nevada and a record cash flow year at the Wharf mine in South Dakota,” said Mitchell J. Krebs, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Kensington also delivered a solid fourth quarter to complete a strong second half. “Ramp-up and commissioning activities at Rochester are progressing toward completion in the first half of 2024, setting the stage for strong near-term production growth, lower costs, and sharp increases in cash flow. Rochester is expected to become the anchor of our base of North American silver and gold assets and is the key driver to strong expected increases in our overall silver and gold production levels this year. “While we remain focused on our ramp-up and optimization efforts at Rochester, we continue to advance several key initiatives at our other operations. At Kensington in Alaska, 2024 represents the last full year of elevated levels of development and drilling investment under our current multi-year plan that we expect will significantly extend its mine life and return the operation to being a generator of positive free cash flow for the Company. At Palmarejo in Mexico, expected completion of the transaction with Fresnillo will usher in a revitalized development phase focused on targeting resources to the north and east of existing operations. Finally, Silvertip’s ambitious and highly successful exploration program will continue in British Columbia, benefiting from a full year of drilling and geologic modeling aimed at further increasing the scale and our knowledge of this high-grade polymetallic carbon replacement deposit.” Financial and Operating Highlights (Unaudited) (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts, gold ounces produced & sold, and per-ounce metrics) 2023 4Q 2023 3Q 2023 2Q 2023 1Q 2023 2022 4Q 2022 Gold Sales $ 575.7 $ 187.7 $ 139.5 $ 121.4 $ 127.1 $ 572.9 $ 157.6 Silver Sales $ 245.5 $ 74.3 $ 55.1 $ 55.9 $ 60.2 $ 212.8 $ 52.5 Consolidated Revenue $ 821.2 $ 262.1 $ 194.6 $ 177.2 $ 187.3 $ 785.6 $ 210.1 Costs Applicable to Sales2 $ 632.9 $ 192.3 $ 147.9 $ 139.6 $ 153.1 $ 606.5 $ 159.3 General and Administrative Expenses $ 41.6 $ 10.2 $ 9.5 $ 9.8 $ 12.1 $ 39.5 $ 10.2 Net Income (Loss) $ (103.6 ) $ (25.5 ) $ (21.1 ) $ (32.4 ) $ (24.6 ) $ (78.1 ) $ 49.0 Net Income (Loss) Per Share $ (0.30 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.28 ) $ 0.17 Adjusted Net Income (Loss)1 $ (78.0 ) $ (6.2 ) $ (18.6 ) $ (20.2 ) $ (33.1 ) $ (89.1 ) $ (17.5 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss)1 Per Share $ (0.23 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.05 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.11 ) $ (0.32 ) $ (0.06 ) Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 343.1 380.5 356.7 333.1 301.0 275.2 284.5 EBITDA1 $ 60.5 $ 25.0 $ 15.3 $ 4.0 $ 16.2 $ 72.0 $ 84.9 Adjusted EBITDA1 $ 142.3 $ 64.3 $ 30.6 $ 22.2 $ 25.1 $ 139.0 $ 35.9 Cash Flow from Operating Activities $ 67.3 $ 65.3 $ (2.4 ) $ 39.4 $ (35.0 ) $ 25.6 $ 28.5 Capital Expenditures $ 364.6 $ 92.7 $ 112.3 $ 85.6 $ 74.0 $ 352.4 $ 113.1 Free Cash Flow1 $ (297.3 ) $ (27.4 ) $ (114.7 ) $ (46.2 ) $ (109.0 ) $ (326.7 ) $ (84.5 ) Cash, Equivalents & Short-Term Investments $ 61.6 $ 61.6 $ 53.2 $ 56.8 $ 67.0 $ 61.5 $ 61.5 Total Debt3 $ 545.3 $ 545.3 $ 512.2 $ 469.4 $ 494.1 $ 515.9 $ 515.9 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Gold $ 1,825 $ 1,886 $ 1,788 $ 1,809 $ 1,794 $ 1,736 $ 1,787 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Silver $ 24.21 $ 24.79 $ 24.88 $ 23.91 $ 23.25 $ 21.77 $ 21.14 Gold Ounces Produced 317,671 101,609 78,617 68,406 69,039 330,346 87,727 Silver Ounces Produced 10.3 $ 3.1 2.3 2.4 2.5 9.8 2.4 Gold Ounces Sold 315,511 99,540 78,015 67,090 70,866 329,968 88,189 Silver Ounces Sold 10.1 $ 3.0 2.2 2.3 2.6 9.8 2.5 Adjusted CAS per AuOz1 $ 1,355 $ 1,225 $ 1,273 $ 1,464 $ 1,381 $ 1,300 $ 1,270 Adjusted CAS per AgOz1 $ 18.10 $ 17.03 $ 17.85 $ 16.77 $ 15.83 $ 17.00 $ 15.57 Financial Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenue totaled $262 million compared to $195 million in the prior period and $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company produced 101,609 and 3.1 million ounces of gold and silver, respectively, during the quarter. Metal sales for the quarter totaled 99,540 ounces of gold and 3.0 million ounces of silver. Average realized gold and silver prices for the quarter were $1,886 and $24.79 per ounce, respectively, compared to $1,788 and $24.88 per ounce in the prior period and $1,787 and $21.14 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2022. Coeur generated $821 million in revenue during 2023, compared to $786 million in 2022. Full-year gold and silver production totaled 317,671 and 10.3 million ounces, respectively, compared to 330,346 ounces of gold and 9.8 million ounces of silver in 2022. Metal sales in 2023 included 315,511 and 10.1 million ounces of gold and silver, respectively. Average realized gold and silver prices for the year were $1,825 and $24.21 per ounce, respectively, compared to $1,736 and $21.77 per ounce in 2022. Gold and silver sales represented 72% and 28% of quarterly revenue, respectively. For the full year, gold and silver sales accounted for 70% and 30% of revenue, respectively. The Company’s U.S. operations accounted for approximately 65% and 62% in the fourth quarter and full-year revenue, respectively. Costs applicable to sales2 during the quarter and for the full year increased 30% and 4%, respectively, to $192 million and $633 million. Higher costs during the quarter and the year compared to prior periods were due primarily to higher gold and silver production levels as well as from higher consumable costs driven by overall inflationary pressures. General and administrative expenses remained consistent quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year at $10 million. Coeur invested approximately $14 million ($11 million expensed and $3 million capitalized) in exploration during the quarter, compared to roughly $16 million ($12 million expensed and $3 million capitalized) in the prior period. For the full year, the Company invested approximately $41 million ($31 million expensed and $10 million capitalized) compared to roughly $48 million ($27 million expensed and $22 million capitalized) in 2022. See the “Operations” and “Exploration” sections for additional detail on the Company’s exploration activities. The Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $10 million and $37 million during the fourth quarter and for the full year, respectively. Cash income and mining taxes paid during the period totaled approximately $8 million, bringing the full-year total to $35 million. Cash taxes paid in 2023 primarily reflect income and mining tax payments in Mexico. Coeur expects to pay approximately $8 - $10 million in cash taxes during the first quarter of 2024 primarily as a result of its annual tax filings in Mexico. As of December 31, 2023, Companywide U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $623 million. Quarterly operating cash flow totaled $65 million compared to $(2) million in the prior period, mainly driven by higher metal sales, increased profitability at Wharf, timing of prepayments and the semi-annual interest payments on the Company’s 2029 5.125% Senior Notes. For the full year, operating cash flow more than doubled to $67 million mainly driven by strong fourth quarter operational performance. Capital expenditures decreased 17% quarter-over-quarter to $93 million, bringing the full-year total to $365 million and below Coeur’s 2023 guidance range of $378 - $432 million due to timing of remaining payments related to the Rochester expansion. Expenditures related to the Rochester expansion totaled $52 million and $230 million during the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared to $76 million in the third quarter and $229 million in 2022. Sustaining and development capital expenditures accounted for approximately $38 million and $55 million, or 41% and 59%, respectively, of Coeur’s total capital investment during the quarter. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Update Coeur ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $247 million, including $62 million of cash and $185 million of available capacity under its $390 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”)4. Total debt increased to $545 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $512 million at the end of the third quarter and $516 million at year-end 2022. On February 21, 2024, the Company completed a new agreement to extend and enhance its RCF. Details include: Maturity of February 2027 Increased aggregate borrowing capacity from $390 million to $400 million Option to increase aggregate borrowing capacity by an additional $100 million Seven banks comprise the syndicate, including new additions National Bank of Canada and Fédération des Caisses Desjardins du Québec During the fourth quarter, Coeur satisfied $45 million associated with prepay agreements at Kensington, Rochester and Wharf. Additionally, the Company exercised options under amended agreements to receive an additional $25 million prepayment at Kensington, an approximately $18 million prepayment for deliveries of gold and silver doré from Rochester, and a roughly $13 million prepayment for deliveries of gold concentrate from Wharf. Hedging Update During the fourth quarter, the Company added to its hedge position by executing additional hedges on approximately 95,000 ounces of its expected 2024 gold production at an average price of roughly $2,076 per ounce and approximately 3.1 million ounces of its expected 2024 silver production at an average price of roughly $25.16 per ounce. An overview of the hedges in place is outlined below. 1Q 2024 2Q 2024 Gold Ounces Hedged 45,000 49,950 Avg. Forward Price ($/oz) $2,050 $2,100 Silver Ounces Hedged 1,299,999 1,800,000 Avg. Forward Price ($/oz) $24.00 $26.00 Rochester LCM Adjustment Coeur reports the carrying value of metal and leach pad inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method. Decreases in the market price of gold and silver can affect the value of metal inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as impact carrying value of long-lived assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, the cost of ore on leach pads at Rochester exceeded its net realizable value, which resulted in a lower of cost or market (“LCM”) adjustment of $20 million (approximately $17 million in costs applicable to sales2 and $3 million of amortization).

For the full year, gold and silver production totaled 100,605 and 6.6 million ounces, respectively, and were within 2023 guidance ranges of 100,000 - 112,500 ounces of gold and 6.5 - 7.5 million ounces of silver Production during the quarter benefited from higher average grades, offset by lower average gold and silver recoveries Financial Adjusted CAS1 for gold and silver on a co-product basis increased 10% and decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter to $1,010 and $15.26 per ounce, respectively, driven by lower gold sales, higher silver sales and a stronger Mexican Peso For the full year, adjusted CAS1 for gold and silver totaled $957 and $15.09 per ounce, respectively, compared to $883 and $13.05 per ounce in the prior period. Both cost metrics finished the year within their 2023 guidance ranges of $900 - $1,050 and $14.25 - $15.25 per ounces of gold and silver, respectively Capital expenditures decreased 18% quarter-over-quarter to $9 million, reflecting completion of the open pit tailings backfill project. For the full year, capital expenditures decreased 2% to $42 million Free cash flow1 in the fourth quarter and full year totaled $15 million and $35 million, respectively, compared to $12 million and $46 million in the prior periods Exploration Exploration investment for the fourth quarter increased by 23% to approximately $3 million (substantially all expensed), while full-year exploration investment decreased 30% year-over-year to roughly $8 million (substantially all expensed) Drilling during the quarter remained focused on the Hidalgo corridor, the Zapata - Guadalupe corridor and the Las Animas target with up to five rigs active during the period At Hidalgo, drilling included systematic step-outs along strike on the San Jaun, Libertad and Hidalgo veins along with larger steps to the northwest on the Morelos and sub-parallel La Finca structures. Geology intersected indicates that the Hidalgo corridor potentially continues to the northwest over an additional 570 meters and includes the Morelos and La Finca veins At the Zapata - Guadalupe target, drilling during the quarter intersected deformation, alteration and veining on both structures. The main goal of this program is to test for a higher shoot where these structures intersect. Drilling for this purpose is expected to continue in early 2024 At Las Animas, drilling during the quarter aimed at extending the zone down dip with good vein structures intersected. Results are pending but the geology visually indicates continuation of the zone Mapping and sampling are continuing to the east of the current operation and outside of the gold stream area of interest. New veins were identified during the quarter, which the Company plans to follow up on in 2024. Coeur expects at least four drill rigs to be active at Palmarejo in the first quarter and through the remainder of the year Other Approximately 32% and 35% of Palmarejo’s gold sales in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, were sold under its gold stream agreement at a price of $800 per ounce, totaling 8,047 ounces in the fourth quarter and 34,455 ounces for the full year. The Company anticipates approximately 30% - 40% of Palmarejo’s gold sales for 2024 will be sold under the gold stream agreement Guidance Full-year 2024 production is expected to be 95,000 - 103,000 ounces of gold and 5.9 - 6.7 million ounces of silver, relatively flat compared to 2023 production CAS1 in 2024 are expected to be $1,075 - $1,275 per gold ounce and $16.50 - $17.50 per silver ounce Capital expenditures are expected to be $32 - $42 million, consisting primarily of sustaining capital and underground development Rochester, Nevada (Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2023 4Q 2023 3Q 2023 2Q 2023 1Q 2023 2022 4Q 2022 Ore tons placed 11,388,657 2,754,058 3,487,173 2,690,840 2,456,586 14,919,803 2,754,118 Average silver grade (oz/t) 0.45 0.44 0.50 0.42 0.45 0.41 0.68 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 Silver ounces produced (000’s) 3,392 1,340 608 683 761 3,062 973 Gold ounces produced 38,775 19,847 4,459 6,314 8,155 34,735 11,589 Silver ounces sold (000’s) 3,340 1,269 606 695 770 3,029 975 Gold ounces sold 38,449 19,175 4,432 6,493 8,349 34,370 11,646 Average realized price per silver ounce $ 24.09 $ 24.59 $ 24.63 $ 23.70 $ 23.19 $ 21.53 $ 21.10 Average realized price per gold ounce $ 1,965 $ 1,991 $ 1,967 $ 1,946 $ 1,922 $ 1,875 $ 1,893 Metal sales $ 156.0 $ 69.4 $ 23.6 $ 29.1 $ 33.9 $ 129.7 $ 42.6 Costs applicable to sales2 $ 171.3 $ 71.8 $ 30.5 $ 26.1 $ 42.9 $ 165.2 $ 44.1 Adjusted CAS per AgOz1 $ 23.97 $ 19.33 $ 23.64 $ 20.39 $ 20.24 $ 25.74 $ 17.60 Adjusted CAS per AuOz1 $ 1,922 $ 1,564 $ 1,899 $ 1,646 $ 1,655 $ 2,268 $ 1,596 Prepayment, working capital cash flow $ 17.5 $ — $ 7.5 $ 10.0 $ — $ — $ — Exploration expense $ 1.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 $ 0.3 $ 0.4 $ 4.6 $ 0.6 Cash flow from operating activities $ (23.0 ) $ 11.6 $ (17.3 ) $ (3.8 ) $ (13.5 ) $ (48.0 ) $ (5.5 ) Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $ 30.9 $ 13.8 $ 7.7 $ 5.1 $ 4.3 $ 14.9 $ 3.0 Development capital expenditures $ 232.5 $ 51.7 $ 76.7 $ 56.4 $ 47.7 $ 231.5 $ 89.3 Total capital expenditures $ 263.4 $ 65.5 $ 84.4 $ 61.5 $ 52.0 $ 246.4 $ 92.3 Free cash flow1 $ (286.4 ) $ (53.9 ) $ (101.7 ) $ (65.3 ) $ (65.5 ) $ (294.4 ) $ (97.8 ) Operational Silver and gold production in the fourth quarter totaled 1.3 million and 19,847 ounces, respectively, compared to 607,735 and 4,459 ounces in the prior period and 973,000 and 11,589 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, silver production totaled 3.4 million ounces, which was just below 2023 guidance ranges of 3.5 - 4.5 million ounces, while gold production totaled 38,775 ounces and was within 2023 guidance ranges of 35,000 - 50,000 ounces Higher production during the quarter was primarily driven by the completion of the process plant in the third quarter and ounces recovered from the new leach pad from ore stacked throughout 2023 During the fourth quarter, initial commissioning activities occurred on the primary crusher as part of the completed Rochester expansion. First ore to the pad was achieved during the month of January from the primary and secondary crusher. Commissioning activities continue on the pre-screen and tertiary circuit with ramp-up continuing through the first half of 2024 Financial Fourth quarter adjusted CAS1 figures in the table above and highlighted below exclude the impact of an LCM adjustment totaling approximately $17 million related to the net realizable value of metal and leach pad inventory due to higher operating costs exceeding the lower market value of ounces under leach at Rochester Fourth quarter adjusted CAS1 for silver and gold on a co-product basis totaled $19.33 and $1,564 per ounce, respectively, with significant reductions compared to the prior period largely driven by increased metal sales as well as lower operating costs due to lower crushing associated with X-Pit dismantling Full-year adjusted CAS1 for silver and gold on a co-product basis totaled $23.97 and $1,922 per ounce, respectively, compared to $25.74 and $2,268 per ounce in the prior period Capital expenditures increased 22% quarter-over-quarter to $66 million, bringing the full year total to $263 million compared to $246 million in the prior period, reflecting increased spending related to the Rochester expansion project Free cash flow1 in the fourth quarter and full-year totaled $(54) million and $(286) million, respectively, compared to $(102) million and $(294) million in the prior periods Exploration Exploration investment increased 20% quarter-over-quarter to approximately $1 million ($0.2 million expensed and $0.4 million capitalized), while full-year investment decreased 68% year-over-year to roughly $2 million ($1 million expensed and $1 million capitalized) Exploration activities continued to focus on geologic logging, interpretation and geological modeling. A new geological model for East Rochester has been completed and re-logging campaigns have commenced at Lincoln Hill and Nevada Packard ahead of modeling Exploration drilling is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024 with a focus on testing higher-grade structures outlined by the new geological model at East Rochester. Once the new geological model for Nevada Packard has been completed, a similar drill program will be undertaken at the project Guidance Full-year 2024 production is expected to be 4.8 - 6.6 million ounces of silver and 37,000 - 50,000 ounces of gold. Production in 2024 is expected to increase after a slow first quarter due to commissioning and ramp-up in the first half of 2024 With the commissioning and ramp-up of the Rochester expansion taking place during the first half of 2024, the Company has provided CAS guidance for the second half of 2024, which are expected to be $14.00 - $16.00 per silver ounce and $1,200 - $1,400 per gold ounce Capital expenditures are expected to be $50 - $70 million, which reflects fleet enhancements as part of the ramp-up of the newly expanded Rochester as well as sustaining capital Kensington, Alaska (Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2023 4Q 2023 3Q 2023 2Q 2023 1Q 2023 2022 4Q 2022 Tons milled 651,576 177,382 167,950 152,907 153,337 700,346 183,410 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.14 0.16 0.16 0.09 0.15 0.17 0.18 Average recovery rate 91.9 % 92.3 % 92.6 % 90.9 % 91.2 % 92.5 % 92.4 % Gold ounces produced 84,789 26,686 24,614 13,193 20,296 109,061 30,335 Gold ounces sold 84,671 25,980 24,516 13,273 20,902 108,972 30,863 Average realized price per gold ounce, gross $ 1,987 $ 2,016 $ 1,956 $ 1,991 $ 1,983 $ 1,888 $ 1,942 Treatment and refining charges per gold ounce $ 74 $ 58 $ 60 $ 142 $ 63 $ 36 $ 38 Average realized price per gold ounce, net $ 1,913 $ 1,958 $ 1,896 $ 1,849 $ 1,920 $ 1,852 $ 1,904 Metal sales $ 162.5 $ 51.2 $ 46.5 $ 24.6 $ 40.2 $ 202.5 $ 58.8 Costs applicable to sales2 $ 152.7 $ 37.9 $ 38.3 $ 39.1 $ 37.4 $ 155.7 $ 39.2 Adjusted CAS per AuOz1 $ 1,786 $ 1,441 $ 1,543 $ 2,927 $ 1,775 $ 1,420 $ 1,265 Prepayment, working capital cash flow $ — $ 10.7 $ (10.7 ) $ 9.9 $ (9.9 ) $ 10.0 $ 9.6 Exploration expense $ 7.9 $ 1.7 $ 2.9 $ 2.3 $ 1.0 $ 6.6 $ 2.2 Cash flow from operating activities $ 4.0 $ 16.9 $ (4.4 ) $ (3.7 ) $ (4.8 ) $ 42.2 $ 20.8 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $ 53.3 $ 15.1 $ 15.8 $ 11.7 $ 10.7 $ 31.5 $ 7.7 Development capital expenditures $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Total capital expenditures $ 53.3 $ 15.1 $ 15.8 $ 11.7 $ 10.7 $ 31.5 $ 7.7 Free cash flow1 $ (49.3 ) $ 1.8 $ (20.2 ) $ (15.4 ) $ (15.5 ) $ 10.7 $ 13.1 Operational Gold production in the fourth quarter totaled 26,686 ounces compared to 24,614 ounces in the prior period and 30,335 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, gold production totaled 84,789 ounces and was on the high-end of 2023 guidance ranges of 81,000 - 85,000 ounces Higher production during the quarter was driven by increased tons milled due to improved performance in long-hole drilling, paste backfill and stope sequencing Financial Fourth quarter adjusted CAS1 totaled $1,441 per ounce compared to $1,543 per ounce in the prior period, reflecting increased metal sales. Full-year adjusted CAS1 totaled $1,786 per ounce compared to $1,420 per ounce in 2022, largely driven by lower metal sales Capital expenditures decreased 4% quarter-over-quarter to $15 million. For the full year, capital expenditures increased 69% to $53 million primarily driven by increased capital development to support the ongoing multi-year exploration program aimed at extending mine life Free cash flow1 in the fourth quarter and full-year totaled $2 million and $(49) million, respectively, compared to $(20) million and $11 million in the prior periods Exploration Exploration investment in the quarter totaled approximately $4 million ($2 million expensed and $2 million capitalized), compared to $6 million ($3 million expensed and $3 million capitalized) in the prior period. For the full year, exploration investment increased 57% to roughly $18 million ($8 million expensed and $10 million capitalized) Up to four underground drill rigs were focused on expansion and infill drilling at Elmira and Kensington during the quarter. Drilling on all targets is continuing to demonstrate the continuation of structures down dip and along strike Significant progress was made on structural modeling during the quarter with a district scale tectono-structural study undertaken. This new knowledge will be used for geological modeling and exploration targeting At Elmira, drilling indicates that mineralization continues through Elmira South (defined over 500 feet so far) with opportunity existing over a much longer strike length to the south. This concept will be tested in early 2024 In the first quarter, the Company expects to continue drilling with four underground rigs focused on Elmira and Kensington Guidance Full-year 2024 production is expected to be 92,000 - 106,000 gold ounces CAS1 in 2024 are expected to be $1,525 - $1,725 per gold ounce Capital expenditures are expected to be $44 - $56 million, of which approximately $23 - $29 million and $5 - $10 million is related to underground development and infill drilling, respectively, as part of the multi-year exploration program Wharf, South Dakota (Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2023 4Q 2023 3Q 2023 2Q 2023 1Q 2023 2022 4Q 2022 Ore tons placed 4,743,469 1,290,562 1,254,267 1,041,846 1,156,794 4,506,849 975,994 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.026 0.027 0.023 0.022 0.032 0.021 0.024 Gold ounces produced 93,502 29,675 22,674 25,683 15,470 79,768 19,868 Silver ounces produced (000’s) 268 90 69 88 21 46 9 Gold ounces sold 93,348 29,537 23,049 25,117 15,645 79,469 20,428 Silver ounces sold (000’s) 266 86 74 82 24 47 17 Average realized price per gold ounce $ 1,961 $ 1,982 $ 1,966 $ 1,946 $ 1,938 $ 1,874 $ 1,895 Metal sales $ 189.5 $ 60.7 $ 47.1 $ 50.8 $ 30.9 $ 150.0 $ 39.0 Costs applicable to sales2 $ 114.7 $ 32.4 $ 31.0 $ 27.8 $ 23.5 $ 103.1 $ 28.9 Adjusted CAS per AuOz1 $ 1,152 $ 997 $ 1,267 $ 1,035 $ 1,466 $ 1,281 $ 1,393 Prepayment, working capital cash flow $ 12.5 $ — $ 2.5 $ 10.0 $ — $ — $ — Exploration expense $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Cash flow from operating activities $ 84.1 $ 28.9 $ 19.5 $ 33.8 $ 1.9 $ 33.0 $ 10.3 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $ 2.0 $ 1.3 $ 0.6 $ 0.1 $ — $ 1.5 $ 0.7 Development capital expenditures $ 0.5 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 1.6 $ 0.1 Total capital expenditures $ 2.5 $ 1.5 $ 0.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 3.1 $ 0.7 Free cash flow1 $ 81.6 $ 27.4 $ 18.8 $ 33.6 $ 1.8 $ 29.9 $ 9.6 Operational Gold production in the fourth quarter increased 31% quarter-over-quarter to 29,675 ounces. For the full year, gold production totaled 93,502 ounces, toward the high-end of 2023 guidance of 88,000 - 95,000 ounces Higher production during the quarter was largely driven by the timing of ounces placed on the leach pad in the prior quarter and early in the fourth quarter. Ore tons placed increased 3% during the quarter Financial Adjusted CAS1 on a by-product basis decreased 21% quarter-over-quarter to $997 per ounce, largely driven by higher metal sales. Full-year adjusted CAS1 totaled $1,152 per ounce and was below the 2023 guidance range of $1,200 - $1,350 Capital expenditures increased slightly quarter-over-quarter to $2 million Free cash flow1 in the fourth quarter and full year totaled $27 million and $82 million, respectively, compared to $19 million and $30 million in the prior periods. Higher free cash flow1 in the fourth quarter and full year was largely driven by higher metal sales and is a record free cash flow1 year for the site. Coeur has now generated cumulative free cash flow1 from Wharf of more than four times its original investment of approximately $99.5 million in February 2015 Exploration Exploration investment remained flat quarter-over-quarter. For the full year, the Company invested less than $1 million on exploration at Wharf Guidance Full-year 2024 production is expected to be 86,000 - 96,000 gold ounces CAS1 in 2024 are expected to be $1,100 - $1,200 per gold ounce Capital expenditures are expected to be $5 - $7 million Exploration Coeur had 11 active rigs across all sites during the fourth quarter, for a total investment of approximately $14 million ($11 million expensed and $3 million capitalized), compared to roughly $16 million ($12 million expensed and $3 million capitalized) in the prior period. For the full year, the Company invested approximately $41 million ($31 million expensed and $10 million capitalized) compared to roughly $48 million ($27 million expensed and $22 million capitalized) in 2022. Coeur has invested nearly $245 million in exploration over the last five years, which has resulted in significant additions to reserves and resources across the portfolio. Exploration investment at the high-grade Silvertip polymetallic exploration project in British Columbia, Canada totaled approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year investment to roughly $11 million, compared to $7 million and $10 million, respectively, in prior periods. Drilling during the fourth quarter continued with two underground rigs focused on tracing the Southern Silver Zone chimney along strike to the southeast and down dip in addition to infill drilling at Saddle Zone. Visual results from the Southern Silver Zone drilling confirmed massive sulphide mineralization in all holes with results pending. Southern Silver Zone has been extended along strike by 150 meters and down dip by 160 meters. The Company expects to invest $11 - $14 million in exploration in 2024 at Silvertip, which excludes $15 - $20 million related to underground mine development and supporting costs. Across the Company, exploration investment in 2024 is expected to include $40 - $50 million of scout and expansion drilling (exploration expense) and $7 - $13 million on infill drilling (capitalized exploration). The key priorities this year are focused on building reserves and extending the life of mine at Kensington, testing higher grade structures at Rochester, commence building a significant pipeline of inferred resources at Palmarejo to potentially enable rapid reserve growth over the coming years, adding mineral reserves at Wharf, and continue increasing the mineral resource at Silvertip. 2024 Guidance Gold and silver production is expected to increase compared to 2023, driven by the commissioning and ramp-up of the Rochester expansion. Overall cost guidance has increased compared to 2023 primarily driven by expected continued inflationary pressures on operating costs. With the commissioning and ramp-up of the new Merrill-Crowe facility and three-stage crusher corridor at Rochester expected to be completed during the first half of 2024, the Company has elected to defer providing cost guidance at Rochester for that period. The below cost guidance for Rochester reflects the second half of 2024. Coeur expects to have an LCM adjustment at Rochester of roughly $10 - $15 million in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, the below exploration expense guidance excludes $15 - $20 million of underground mine development and support costs associated with Silvertip. 2024 Production Guidance Gold Silver (oz) (K oz) Palmarejo 95,000 - 103,000 5,900 - 6,700 Rochester 37,000 - 50,000 4,800 - 6,600 Kensington 92,000 - 106,000 — Wharf 86,000 - 96,000 — Total 310,000 - 355,000 10,700 - 13,300 2024 Costs Applicable to Sales Guidance Gold Silver ($/oz) ($/oz) Palmarejo (co-product) $1,075 - $1,275 $16.50 - $17.50 Second Half 2024 Rochester (co-product) $1,200 - $1,400 $14.00 - $16.00 Kensington $1,525 - $1,725 — Wharf (by-product) $1,100 - $1,200 — 2024 Capital, Exploration and G&A Guidance ($M) Capital Expenditures, Sustaining $116 - $158 Capital Expenditures, Development $19 - $26 Exploration, Expensed $40 - $50 Exploration, Capitalized $7 - $13 General & Administrative Expenses $36 - $40 Note: The Company’s guidance figures assume estimated prices of $2,000/oz gold and $23.75/oz silver as well as CAD of 1.25 and MXN of 17.00.
