The acquisition of TCS EMEA GmbH provides Tennant with an established sales force and direct access to key markets in Central and Eastern Europe, alongside an expanded network in other countries. The move aligns with Tennant's strategy of strategic acquisitions for growth and value creation in high-growth regions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of M&F Management and Financing GmbH by Tennant Company represents a strategic move to strengthen their market position in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. This expansion aligns with Tennant's growth-oriented enterprise strategy and is indicative of the company's focus on leveraging existing regional resources to enhance their direct sales channels. The EMEA market, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, is poised for higher growth rates compared to the more mature Western European market, offering Tennant the opportunity to tap into these emerging markets.From a market research perspective, the acquisition provides Tennant with an established network and a knowledgeable sales force, which can lead to increased market penetration and customer base expansion. The direct channel into key countries like Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, coupled with an expanded network in Austria, Switzerland and Poland, positions Tennant to potentially increase market share and drive revenue growth in the region.However, the success of this strategic acquisition will depend on the seamless integration of TCS's operations and the maintenance of high service standards. Tennant will need to ensure that the transition does not disrupt existing customer relationships and that the company can effectively leverage TCS's reputation to build its brand in the new markets. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the acquisition of M&F Management and Financing GmbH by Tennant Company is a capital allocation decision that could have significant implications for Tennant's revenue streams and profitability in the EMEA region. By acquiring its largest distributor in Central and Eastern Europe, Tennant is effectively eliminating a layer of distribution costs, which could result in improved margins and profitability for the company's operations in these markets.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the financial performance indicators post-acquisition, such as revenue growth in the EMEA region, cost synergies realized from the integration and any changes in operating margins. The company's ability to leverage the TCS team's expertise and market knowledge could translate into accelerated growth and an enhanced competitive position, which in turn might reflect positively on Tennant's stock performance and shareholder value.It is also important to consider the acquisition cost and how it will be financed, as it could affect Tennant's balance sheet and cash flows. The company's return on investment will be a critical measure of the acquisition's success in the long term. Economist Examining the acquisition within the broader economic context, Tennant's expansion into the EMEA region through the acquisition of its distributor is a response to the economic dynamics of the region. Central and Eastern Europe have been experiencing economic growth, which is expected to continue, offering a fertile ground for companies like Tennant to grow their operations.Furthermore, the EMEA region presents diverse economic environments, with varying levels of market maturity and consumer behavior. Tennant's approach to integrating TCS's operations will need to be cognizant of these regional economic nuances to effectively capitalize on the growth opportunities. The company's performance in the region will also be subject to macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations, trade regulations and political stability, which could influence its ability to execute on its growth strategy.Ultimately, the acquisition's impact on Tennant's business will be tied to how well the company adapts to the economic conditions in the EMEA region and leverages its new assets to generate growth amidst these factors. 03/01/2024 - 02:00 AM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tennant Company (NYSE: TNC), a world leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing solutions that help create a cleaner, safer, healthier world, today announced that it has acquired M&F Management and Financing GmbH (“M&F”), the parent company of TCS EMEA GmbH (“TCS”), as Tennant seeks to accelerate growth in the EMEA region.

Market Research Analyst The announcement by HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. of its number one ranking in the Technology Category on the 2024 TSX Venture 50 list signifies a notable achievement that could influence investor perception and potentially impact the company's stock performance. Such rankings often serve as a barometer of company performance and future potential, especially in technology and innovation-driven sectors.From a market research perspective, HIVE's focus on green energy and the expansion into AI infrastructure is particularly timely. The global push for sustainability and the exponential growth in AI applications provide a fertile environment for companies like HIVE that leverage renewable energy for high-performance computing and AI. The company's substantial growth in Bitcoin mining hashrate and the reported 5X growth in its GPU-powered AI business unit's annualized revenue run rate are indicative of operational scaling and diversification, which are critical factors in assessing a company's adaptability and long-term viability.Furthermore, the strategic rebranding from 'HIVE Blockchain Technologies' to 'HIVE Digital Technologies' reflects a broader vision that aligns with the current tech landscape's shift towards AI and machine learning. This could be a strategic move to attract a wider range of investors and partners interested in these burgeoning fields. Financial Analyst Examining HIVE's financial indicators, such as the reported annualized revenue run rate of over $5 million from its AI business unit and the doubling of its Bitcoin mining hashrate, suggests a robust financial performance and operational efficiency. The 100% increase in hashrate without specifying the associated capital expenditure raises questions about the investment required to achieve this growth and its return on investment. Such metrics are crucial in evaluating the financial health of a tech company, especially one that operates within the volatile cryptocurrency mining sector.Additionally, the company's ability to mine 3,260 Bitcoin in the calendar year 2023 is a significant operational milestone. However, the revenue potential from these assets is heavily dependent on the fluctuating price of Bitcoin, which introduces a layer of risk that investors need to consider. The diversification into AI and high-performance computing could mitigate some of this risk by creating alternative revenue streams. Sustainability Expert HIVE's commitment to using low-cost, renewable energy for mining digital assets presents a competitive advantage in the blockchain industry, which is increasingly scrutinized for its environmental impact. The company's data centers in Canada, Sweden and Iceland are strategically located to capitalize on renewable energy sources, which not only reduces operational costs but also aligns with global sustainability trends.The emphasis on green energy is a crucial differentiator in the blockchain technology market, as it responds to growing demands from stakeholders for environmentally responsible operations. This could enhance the company's reputation and investor appeal, particularly among ESG-focused funds and investors. As the industry evolves, HIVE's positioning as a leader in green energy-focused blockchain technology could prove to be a significant driver of its long-term success. 03/01/2024 - 01:00 AM This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 1, 2023.Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 1, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.

The Company intends to cancel the purchased shares, holding 164,649,268 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The share repurchase announced by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC represents a significant financial transaction that can influence the company's capital structure and potentially impact shareholder value. Share buybacks are often interpreted as a sign of management's confidence in the company's future prospects and financial health. They can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares, which may, in turn, lead to a higher stock price. However, the key factors to consider include the size of the buyback relative to the company's market capitalization, the price paid per share compared to the current market price and the company's future investment opportunities and cash flow generation capacity.Investors should assess the average price paid per share against recent trading ranges to determine if the company bought back shares at a perceived undervalued price. Additionally, the decision to cancel the purchased shares will permanently reduce the share count, potentially enhancing the value for existing shareholders. It is also important to analyze the impact on the company's balance sheet, particularly the cash position and debt levels, as excessive buybacks can strain financial resources, especially if funded through debt. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC's share repurchase activity can be indicative of broader market trends within the hospitality industry. The sector may be experiencing cash-rich positions due to recovery patterns post-pandemic, leading companies to allocate excess capital to buybacks. This can be a strategic move to optimize capital allocation, especially if the company perceives limited growth opportunities or aims to consolidate its market share through financial engineering rather than expansion.However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such buybacks. The funds used for share repurchases could alternatively be invested in new properties, renovations, technology upgrades, or strategic acquisitions. The balance between returning capital to shareholders and investing in long-term growth initiatives is crucial. Market research can provide insights into whether the company's buyback strategy aligns with industry norms and the competitive landscape and whether it reflects an optimal use of capital given the current market conditions. 03/01/2024 - 02:00 AM LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 1, 2024 / InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (the Company) The Company announces that on 29 February 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

The company has been at the forefront of innovative services and decarbonization efforts in the Bitcoin industry. Positive None. Negative None. 03/01/2024 - 01:34 AM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“DMG”), a vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, reiterates its technology leadership position for non-standard Bitcoin transactions, having been the first to perform the ordinal inscription of a large digital art collection with 535 DeGods ordinals on February 13, 2023 in Bitcoin block 776508, which was mined by Terra Pool, DMG’s carbon neutral pool. According to DeGods as posted on X, this was “the first time in history every transaction in a single Bitcoin block was constructed for an artistic purpose.” Recently, Marathon Digital Holdings issued a press release stating, “Marathon is the first Bitcoin mining company to offer a direct transaction submission service. Because it is the only publicly traded Bitcoin mining company that operates its own mining pool, Marathon is also the only known publicly traded Bitcoin miner currently capable of offering such services.” DMG, which is also a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, has been offering similar services for over a year, as it has its own pool, Terra Pool, which is powered by carbon neutral energy. DMG publicly announced on February 15, 2023 that it had utilized its Petra technology for performing several transactions. Subsequently, on March 2, 2023, DMG announced it was leading the Bitcoin industry having utilized its Petra technology to be among the first to place carbon neutral large ordinal transactions (i.e. > 400 kilobytes) onto the Bitcoin blockchain. The DeGods collection was only one of a number of large ordinals inscribed by DMG including: February 16, 2023 - Rare Scrilla Counterparty Dancing Frog (Block 776884, 3.60 megabytes)February 23, 2023 - Bitcoin War Bonds (Block 777945, 3.93 megabytes)March 22, 2023 - Bitcoin Magazine cover (Block 786501, 3.98 megabytes) DMG’s achievements extend well beyond inscriptions of large ordinals: DMG supported publishing of Bored Ape Yacht Club’s “TwelveFold” collection (Block 778772) as posted on X: “The satoshis that will be used to inscribe TwelveFold were sourced from a block mined by Terra Pool, a Bitcoin mining pool exclusively powered by green energy.” DMG also pioneered per ordinal rights transfer with its Multi-Breeze technology in Block 784173, in which it inscribed a large ordinal collection of 100 sequential art pieces. More recently, DMG has utilized its technology to inscribe parent-child ordinals ahead of the now de facto standard (Block 811775) as well as perform a novel method to incentivize validators of carbon neutral bitcoin transactions (Block 823323). DMG’s CEO Sheldon Bennett commented, “DMG has invested for years to create one of the most comprehensive Bitcoin network infrastructure and application software suites along with a robust portfolio of intellectual property. We are proud of what we have been able to accomplish, and with our continued investments, we have an opportunity to not only be one of the first to offer new innovative services but also accelerate decarbonization of the Bitcoin blockchain.” About DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.

The offering is led by joint book-running managers Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, BofA Securities, Guggenheim Securities, LLC, and Oppenheimer & Co. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of Tarsus Pharmaceuticals' common stock and pre-funded warrants is a strategic move to raise capital, with an expected gross proceeds of around $100 million. This influx of funds can be pivotal for the company's growth trajectory, especially in expanding its eye care product line and furthering research and development efforts. By analyzing the offering price of $32.00 per share and the slight discount for pre-funded warrants, it seems the company is leveraging current market conditions to optimize capital raise without significant dilution of existing shareholders' value.Furthermore, the involvement of prominent financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities as joint book-running managers indicates a strong underwriting process, potentially increasing investor confidence. The 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares adds a buffer to raise more capital if market demand is higher than anticipated. For investors, the key metrics to watch would be the post-offering share performance and the company's subsequent use of the raised capital in driving value creation. Market Research Analyst In the context of the pharmaceutical industry, Tarsus Pharmaceuticals' decision to conduct an underwritten public offering can be seen as a response to the competitive landscape that requires continuous investment in innovation. The offering's timing may be influenced by market receptiveness to biotech investments and the company's strategic positioning within the eye care niche, which is experiencing a growing demand due to an aging population and the prevalence of eye-related conditions.Market trends suggest that investors are keen on companies with a clear development pipeline and potential for breakthrough therapies. Tarsus' focus on unmet needs in eye care could resonate well with these investment trends, provided they effectively communicate their R&D progress and potential market impact. It is essential to evaluate how this capital raise aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and the anticipated return on investment for stakeholders. Legal Expert The legal aspects of Tarsus Pharmaceuticals' public offering, including the SEC registration statement and prospectus requirements, are crucial for compliance and transparency. The automatic effectiveness of the registration upon filing demonstrates a streamlined regulatory process, which is beneficial for the company's swift access to capital markets. Investors should review the final prospectus supplement for a detailed understanding of the offering's terms, risks and the company's financial health.It's important to note that the offering is restricted from states or jurisdictions where it would be unlawful without proper registration or qualification under local securities laws. This legal framework ensures that the offering adheres to stringent regulations, safeguarding investor interests. Potential investors must be aware of these legal stipulations to avoid any regulatory complications that could affect their investment decisions. 03/01/2024 - 12:07 AM IRVINE, Calif., March 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Note, mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources will be converted into Mineral Reserves.About Commerce Resources Corp.Commerce Resources Corp. is a junior mineral resource company focused on the development of the Ashram Rare Earth and Fluorspar Deposit located in Quebec, Canada. The Company is positioned to become one of the lowest cost rare earth producers globally, with a specific focus on being a long-term supplier of mixed rare earth carbonate and/or NdPr oxide to the global market.

The company demonstrated impressive growth with a 11% increase in total revenue and a significant improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin. Management highlighted cost management strategies and investments in technology for future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of PropertyGuru Group Limited indicate a substantial improvement in the company's profitability metrics, with an Adjusted EBITDA increase from S$3 million to S$19 million year-over-year. A key highlight is the significant expansion of the Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2% to 13%, suggesting effective cost management and operational efficiency. This margin expansion is particularly noteworthy given the macroeconomic challenges cited by the company, such as less favorable market conditions in Vietnam and Malaysia.Investors may view the increased revenue and EBITDA positively, as they reflect a stronger financial position and the potential for enhanced shareholder value. The company's future revenue projections between S$165 million and S$180 million and Adjusted EBITDA of S$22 million to S$26 million, suggest a continued growth trajectory. However, it is important for stakeholders to consider the broader economic context and competitive landscape within the PropTech industry in Southeast Asia when evaluating these projections. Market Research Analyst PropertyGuru's focus on technological innovation, particularly in Generative AI and automation, aligns with current trends in the PropTech sector, which is increasingly adopting digital solutions to enhance efficiency and customer experience. The company's investment in these areas could position it advantageously against competitors and drive long-term growth. Moreover, the appointment of a new Board Chair with extensive experience may provide strategic guidance that could further strengthen the company's market position.It is also essential to consider the potential risks associated with the strategic restructuring mentioned by the CEO. While this could lead to improved efficiencies, it may also result in short-term disruptions and costs. The impact on the company's culture and employee morale following the changes could influence productivity and innovation, factors integral to PropertyGuru's success in a technology-driven industry. Economist PropertyGuru's performance must be contextualized within the broader Southeast Asian economic environment. The company's ability to grow revenue and EBITDA despite challenging conditions in key markets demonstrates resilience and adaptability. The region's economic outlook, including factors such as property market trends, interest rates and consumer confidence, will be critical in determining the company's performance moving forward. Additionally, the strategic emphasis on cost optimization and productivity improvements may serve as a buffer against potential economic headwinds.Investors should monitor macroeconomic indicators in the company's primary markets, as these could significantly influence PropertyGuru's business operations and financial results. The company's proactive approach to navigating market challenges and its blueprint for innovation and talent development could be pivotal in sustaining its growth amidst economic fluctuations. 03/01/2024 - 01:37 AM Revenue of S$150 Million and Adjusted EBITDA of S$19 Million in 2023 Total revenue grew 11% to S$150 million in 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of S$19 million in 2023, up from S$3 million in 2022 Active cost management resulted in a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023, up from 2% in 2022 The Company anticipates full year 2024 revenue of between S$165 million and S$180 million and Adjusted EBITDA of between S$22 million and S$26 million SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PropertyGuru Group Limited (NYSE: PGRU) (“PropertyGuru” or the “Company”), Southeast Asia’s leading1, property technology (“PropTech”) company, today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Revenue of S$42 million in the fourth quarter 2023 increased 4% year over year. Net profit was S$1 million in the fourth quarter and Adjusted EBITDA2 was S$9 million. This compares to a net loss of S$5 million and Adjusted EBITDA2 of S$0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Management Commentary Hari V. Krishnan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said “Our 2023 results demonstrate our ability to navigate challenging macro-economic conditions and our commitment to profitability. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and a double-digit Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year. This is a clear testament to our ability to create value for our customers and help property-seekers achieve their home-ownership goals. Despite less than favorable market conditions in Vietnam and Malaysia, we were able to achieve these results by being laser-focused on optimising costs, adopting internal process automation, improving code quality and productivity. On the technology front, we continue to invest in the transformational use of Generative AI and automation to place us at the forefront of property technology and set us up for consistent improvement in productivity for years to come. We continue to make proactive changes to build a sustainable, future-proofed business. Following our principle to make focused investments in our identified priorities, we have undertaken a strategic step towards re-architecting our organisation. This will ensure we have set our investment levels commensurate to the opportunity presented, with the right efficiencies to deliver scalable profitable growth for years to come. We acknowledge that this change is not easy on everyone and extend our heartfelt gratitude to the impacted Gurus for their contributions to the Group and wish them the very best for the next chapter in their careers. Going forward, while we anticipate ongoing macro challenges, our blueprint for success remains clear – innovate and advance through talent and technology. In 2023, we added key executives to our leadership teams, and at the start of 2024, welcomed Ray Ferguson as PropertyGuru's new Board Chair. Ray brings a wealth of experience from a long and distinguished career of business building, corporate leadership, and market navigation.

Joe Dische, Chief Financial Officer, added “I am pleased with our results in 2023. We delivered 11% revenue growth and a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin despite significant macro challenges in two core markets, Vietnam and Malaysia. As we enter 2024 and get closer to positive inflection points in Vietnam and Malaysia, we are encouraged by how successful our internal cost-control, efficiency, and automation efforts were in 2023. We spent the year balancing product innovation and investment with careful cost management and reaped the benefit of these activities throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter when our Adjusted EBITDA margin jumped to 22% from 1% in the prior year quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was S$1 million, a distinct improvement over a loss of S$5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the second sequential quarter in a row of positive net income. For the full year 2023, all our marketplaces were Adjusted EBITDA positive. There was significant Adjusted EBITDA margin growth in Singapore, Malaysia, and Other Asia. Notably, corporate expenses as a percentage of overall revenue decreased from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2023. Looking to 2024, we will continue to focus on expanding internal operating leverage as we look to improve profitability. We are introducing a full year 2024 revenue outlook of S$165 million to S$180 million and a full year Adjusted EBITDA outlook of S$22 million to S$26 million.” Financial Highlights – Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Total revenue increased to S$42 million (+4%) in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous year and increased to S$150 million (+11%) year over year. Marketplaces revenue increased to S$40 million (+4%) in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous year and increased to S$144 million (+10%) year over year as continued strength in Singapore helped to offset ongoing challenges in Vietnam. Revenue by segment: Singapore Marketplaces revenue increased to S$23 million (+23%) in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous year and increased to S$86 million (+24%) year over year, as the number of agents and the Average Revenue Per Agent (“ARPA”) grew in the quarter and the year.

Malaysia Marketplaces revenue was flat in the quarter at S$8 million (-0.3%) compared to the prior year quarter and increased to S$28 million (+9%) for the full year. Revenue on a Singapore Dollar basis was adversely impacted by depreciation of the Malaysian Ringgit. On a local currency basis, revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5% and revenue in 2023 was up 16%. Vietnam Marketplaces revenue decreased to S$5 million (-22%) in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period and decreased to S$17 million (-29%) year over year, as a reduction in the number of listings was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per listing (“ARPL”). The number of listings was 1.2 million in the fourth quarter down 26% from the fourth quarter of 2022. ARPL was up 3% to S$3.34 in the fourth quarter and was up 14% to S$3.39 for the full year.

Longer-term, the Company remains bullish on its growth trajectory, prospects for improving profitability, and the fundamental opportunity that exists in our core markets.

Key Performance Metrics and Non-IFRS Financial Measures Our priority markets comprise Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. Our core markets comprise Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Engagement Market Share is the average monthly engagement for websites owned by PropertyGuru as compared to average monthly engagement for a basket of peers calculated over the relevant period. Engagement is calculated as the number of visits to a website during a period multiplied by the total amount of time spent on that website for the same period, in each case based on data from SimilarWeb. Engagement Market Share is based on the prevailing SimilarWeb algorithm on the date the Company first filed or furnished such information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Number of agents in all core markets except Vietnam is calculated for a period as the sum of the number of agents with a valid 12-month subscription package at the end of each month in a period divided by the number of months in such period. In Vietnam, number of agents is calculated as the average monthly number of agents who credit money into their account within the relevant period. When counting in aggregate across the PropertyGuru group, in markets where PropertyGuru operates more than one property portal, an agent with subscriptions to more than one portal is only counted once. Number of real estate listings is calculated as the average number of listings created monthly during the period for Vietnam and the average number of monthly listings available in the period for other markets. Average revenue per agent (“ARPA”) is calculated as agent revenue for a period divided by the average number of agents in that period, which is calculated as the sum of the number of total agents at the end of each month in a period divided by the number of months in such period. Number of listings in Vietnam is calculated as the sum of all listings created in each month over the relevant period (other than listings from promotional accounts). Number of listings is used to calculate average revenue per listing, which is described below. Average revenue per listing (""ARPL”) is calculated as revenue for a period divided by the number of listings in such period. Renewal rate is calculated as the number of agents that successfully renew their annual package during a period divided by the number of agents whose packages are up for renewal (at the end of their twelve-month subscription) during that period. This press release also includes references to non-IFRS financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and incremental Adjusted EBITDA over incremental revenue. PropertyGuru uses these measures, collectively, to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. PropertyGuru believes that non-IFRS information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and may assist in comparisons with other companies to the extent that such other companies use similar non-IFRS measures to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results. These non-IFRS measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. Accordingly, non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of other IFRS financial measures, such as net loss and loss before income tax. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure defined as net profit/loss for year/period adjusted for changes in fair value of preferred shares, warrant liability and embedded derivatives, finance costs, depreciation and amortization, tax expenses or credits, impairments when the impairment is the result of an isolated, non-recurring event, share grant and option expenses, loss on disposal of plant and equipment and intangible assets, currency translation profit or loss, fair value profit or loss on lease modifications and contingent consideration, business acquisition transaction and integration cost (including contingent consideration), and the cost of listing or IPO activities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Incremental Adjusted EBITDA over incremental revenue is calculated as the increase in Adjusted EBITDA over the period divided by the increase in revenue over the same period. A reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is provided as follows. It is noted that in 2023 the Company no longer removed the ongoing cost of being a listed entity when calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As such, the 2022 comparative have been retrospectively adjusted accordingly.

(KDP) announced a public offering of 86,956,522 shares at $29.10 per share, with an option for additional shares. KDP plans to repurchase 35 million shares in the offering and JAB will own about 21% of KDP's stock post-offering. Morgan Stanley is the underwriter. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (KDP) regarding the pricing of its secondary public offering and the concurrent share repurchase represents a strategic move that could influence investor sentiment and the company's capital structure. The pricing of shares at $29.10 indicates the company's valuation from the perspective of the underwriter and the market's current appetite for KDP's stock. The repurchase of 35 million shares is a significant buyback, signaling confidence from management in the company's intrinsic value and a potential effort to provide support to the share price following the dilutive effect of the secondary offering.From a financial perspective, the repurchase will reduce the number of outstanding shares, potentially leading to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio. However, investors should be mindful of the $1.8 billion remaining in the repurchase authorization, as this could indicate further buybacks, influencing future liquidity and leverage levels. The lock-up agreement for the remaining shares held by JAB is a standard measure to prevent market flooding and price destabilization post-offering.It is also noteworthy that following the offering and repurchase, JAB will own approximately 21% of KDP's common stock, which may affect control dynamics and corporate governance. The public float increasing to roughly 79% could enhance stock liquidity, potentially attracting more institutional investors. Market Research Analyst The secondary offering and share repurchase by KDP should be evaluated within the context of the broader beverage industry and market trends. The offering size and repurchase decision may reflect KDP's strategic initiatives such as investment in growth opportunities, debt reduction, or other corporate activities. The use of a secondary offering to facilitate a share repurchase is somewhat less common and could be interpreted as a way to balance the interests of existing shareholders with the need to raise capital or provide an exit for a significant shareholder like JAB.Considering the competitive landscape, KDP's actions could be a response to the need for increased financial flexibility to invest in innovation or marketing in a market where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving. The involvement of a prominent underwriter like Morgan Stanley could also be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects.Investors will likely monitor the impact of these transactions on KDP's market capitalization and how it compares to its peers. Additionally, the increase in public float could affect the stock's volatility and how it is traded, which is relevant information for stakeholders making decisions based on market dynamics. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the secondary offering and share repurchase is critical for ensuring regulatory compliance and investor protection. The use of a Form S-3 registration statement indicates that KDP is utilizing a shelf registration, which allows for the efficient sale of securities, providing the company with flexibility to act quickly in favorable market conditions. Investors should understand that the SEC requires comprehensive disclosure in the prospectus and registration statement to ensure transparency regarding the company's financial status and the risks involved in the offering.The 180-day lock-up agreement is a contractual obligation that prevents JAB from selling additional shares for a specified period, which is a common practice in secondary offerings to manage supply and demand dynamics effectively. The lock-up period helps mitigate the risk of share price depreciation due to potential oversupply. Legal considerations also extend to the underwriter's due diligence process, ensuring the accuracy of the disclosed information and protecting against potential securities fraud. 02/29/2024 - 11:23 PM BURLINGTON, Mass. and FRISCO, Texas, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.

February 2024 Delivery Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Li Auto Inc. announced delivering 20,251 vehicles in February 2024, up 21.8% YoY, with cumulative deliveries reaching 684,780. The company plans to launch new models to boost monthly deliveries to 50,000 in March. Positive Strong year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries. Upcoming launch of new models to drive sales growth. Expansion of retail stores and servicing centers across China. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 21.8% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries by Li Auto Inc. reflects a positive trend in the company's operational performance, which is a vital indicator of growth and market acceptance. The automotive industry, particularly the new energy vehicle (NEV) sector in China, is highly competitive and such growth rates are significant as they suggest that Li Auto is maintaining its market share and possibly outpacing some of its competitors. This performance may also be a reflection of the company's effective management of supply chain issues and consumer demand forecasting.Furthermore, the anticipation surrounding the launch of the new Li MEGA and 2024 Li L series models indicates the company's commitment to innovation and addressing consumer needs, such as range anxiety with battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This could potentially expand their customer base and strengthen brand loyalty. The target to increase monthly deliveries to 50,000 vehicles in March is an ambitious goal that, if achieved, could substantially impact revenue and profitability in the short term. Financial Analyst An increase in vehicle deliveries typically translates to higher revenue streams for automotive companies. For investors, the delivery numbers from Li Auto provide a positive signal, potentially leading to an optimistic outlook on the company's quarterly earnings. However, it's critical to evaluate the cost implications of rolling out new models such as the Li MEGA and the updated Li L series. Research and development expenses, marketing costs and potential discounts to clear out older inventory could offset some of the revenue gains in the short term.Long-term implications include the potential for increased market share and improved economies of scale, which can lead to better margins. Investors should also consider the company's retail and service network expansion, as this indicates a strategic investment in customer service and post-purchase support, which are crucial for customer retention and brand reputation in the automobile industry. Automotive Industry Analyst The launch of new models by Li Auto, particularly a model like Li MEGA designed for multi-generational households, suggests a strategic targeting of a specific market segment.

Market Research Analyst The expansion of ALLDATA Repair's database to include OEM repair information for Abarth, Chrysler and Tesla represents a significant enhancement in the automotive repair industry's informational resources. The inclusion of these vehicle manufacturers (VMs) increases the coverage to 96% of vehicles on the road, which is a substantial figure considering the diversity of the European car market. This move aligns with the growing demand for accurate and comprehensive repair data, particularly for hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs), which are becoming increasingly prevalent.From a market perspective, the improved 'component tree' search list for hybrid and EV repair data is a timely innovation. As the automotive industry shifts towards electrification, the ability to quickly locate specific repair information will become increasingly valuable for independent technicians. This could lead to a competitive advantage for ALLDATA Repair, potentially increasing market share and customer loyalty within the European market. Automotive Industry Expert The strategic addition of Abarth, Chrysler and Tesla to ALLDATA Repair's offerings is a reflection of the changing landscape of the automotive industry. Tesla's inclusion is particularly noteworthy, as it signals a recognition of the importance of servicing electric vehicles, which are typically associated with proprietary service information. By providing access to Tesla's OEM repair data, ALLDATA is positioning itself as a comprehensive source for EV repair, which may influence the aftermarket service industry and potentially impact dealership service departments that have traditionally held a monopoly on this information.Furthermore, the mention of Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs), diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and technical drawings indicates a depth of resources that can enhance repair accuracy and efficiency. For automotive manufacturers, this could translate into a reduction in warranty costs and an improvement in customer satisfaction, as independent technicians are better equipped to resolve issues in accordance with OEM standards. Financial Analyst ALLDATA's announcement could be seen as a positive indicator for investors, as it demonstrates the company's proactive approach to growth and adaptation in a rapidly evolving market. By expanding their repair database and enhancing their service offerings, ALLDATA is likely aiming to increase their subscriber base and, consequently, their revenue streams. The focus on hybrid and electric vehicle data is particularly strategic, considering the projected growth in this segment.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of ALLDATA's expanded services and the potential impact on the company's financial performance. Increased subscriptions and customer retention rates could signal successful market penetration and could be reflected in future financial statements. However, it's also important to consider the costs associated with acquiring and maintaining licensing agreements with vehicle manufacturers and how these costs are managed relative to the revenue generated from new subscribers. 02/29/2024 - 10:39 PM Europe’s technicians can now access ALLDATA repair data for Abarth, Chrysler and Tesla.COLOGNE, Germany, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALLDATA Repair subscribers across Europe can now access original OEM repair information from Abarth, Chrysler and Tesla.

Buenaventura received dividends from its stake in Cerro Verde and proposed a dividend payment per share/ADS. Financial highlights include increases in total revenues and EBITDA from direct operations, although net income saw a decline. Positive Significant increase in EBITDA from direct operations in 4Q23 compared to 4Q22. Improvement in cash position and decrease in net debt for Buenaventura.

Negative Net loss in 4Q23 compared to net income in 4Q22. Provision made in 4Q23 due to adverse court ruling affecting net income. Decrease in net income for FY23 compared to FY22. Negative impact on net income from provision despite no cash outflow. Financial Analyst The reported increase in EBITDA from direct operations by 51% in 4Q23 and 38% in FY23 compared to the previous year indicates operational efficiency and profitability growth for Compañia de Minas Buenaventura. The significant reduction in net income, particularly the 118% decline in 4Q23 and 97% for FY23, is a critical concern, reflecting the impact of the adverse tax ruling which required a large provision despite not causing immediate cash outflow. The company's divestment strategy, as seen in the sale of Contacto and the initiation of production at Yumpag's pilot stope, are strategic moves that could potentially enhance future revenue streams. However, the suspension of mineral processing at Yumpag until permits are obtained introduces an element of uncertainty regarding production continuity.The decrease in net debt and a healthy cash position are positive signs of financial stability, which can provide resilience against market volatility. The proposed dividend payment indicates confidence in the company's liquidity and commitment to shareholder returns. However, the overall decline in net income may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's future profitability, especially in the context of global market conditions and commodity prices fluctuations. Mining Sector Analyst The operational results from Compañia de Minas Buenaventura provide insights into the precious metals mining sector in Peru. The start of production at Yumpag and its subsequent suspension until permit acquisition is a reflection of the regulatory challenges faced by mining companies, which can affect production timelines and investor sentiment. The company's involvement in base metals through its stake in Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde diversifies its portfolio, which is beneficial for risk management. The receipt of US$146.9 million in dividends from this stake underscores the value of strategic partnerships in the mining industry.The provision made due to the Peruvian Supreme Court ruling highlights the legal and fiscal risks inherent in the mining sector. It is essential for investors to consider such geopolitical and regulatory factors when assessing the stability and future performance of mining stocks. Buenaventura's proactive management of these risks, as evidenced by their non-core asset divestment strategy, is a critical aspect for stakeholders to monitor. Market Research Analyst The reported financials of Compañia de Minas Buenaventura offer a mixed perspective on the company's market position. While the increase in EBITDA suggests operational growth, the stagnation in total revenues (0% variance in FY23) could be indicative of market saturation or pricing pressures in the precious metals domain. The variance in operating income from a negative figure in FY22 to a positive in FY23 is a significant turnaround, possibly reflecting cost optimization or increased operational efficiency.Investors may also be interested in the company's strategic decisions, such as the sale of non-core assets and the distribution of dividends, which could indicate a realignment of business focus towards more profitable or core areas. The market will likely watch the developments at Yumpag closely, as the expected resumption of mineral processing in 2Q24 could contribute to future revenue growth. 02/29/2024 - 11:10 PM LIMA, Peru--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (“Buenaventura” or “the Company”) (NYSE: BVN; Lima Stock Exchange: BUE.LM), Peru’s largest publicly-traded precious metals mining company, today announced results for the fourth quarter (4Q23) and full year (FY23) ended December 31, 2023. All figures have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) on a non-GAAP basis and are stated in U.S. dollars (US$). Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights: 4Q23 EBITDA from direct operations was US$ 116.4 million, compared to US$ 76.9 million reported in 4Q22. FY23 EBITDA from direct operations reached US$ 238.3 million, compared to US$ 173.1 million reported in FY22. 4Q23 net loss from continuing operations reached US$ 3.0 million, compared to a US$ 56.7 million net income for the same period in 2022. FY23 net income from continuing operations was US$ 39.5 million, compared to US$ 124.4 million net income for the FY22. Buenaventura's cash position reached US$ 219.8 million and net debt decreased to US$ 486.8 million with an average maturity of 2.5 years by quarter’s end, December 31, 2023. As planned within its non-core asset divestment strategy, BVN executed the sale of Contacto to Howden for US$33.7 million. Production from Yumpag's pilot stope began in November 2023 producing 2.3 million ounces of silver by quarter’s end. Yumpag continued processing pilot stope ore through January 2024, after which mineral processing was suspended until definitive operating permits have been obtained, expected by the end of 1Q24. Yumpag is therefore expected to initiate mineral processing in 2Q24. A US$ 113.2 million provision was made in 4Q23 due to an adverse ruling by the Peruvian Supreme Court regarding tax loss carryforwards from 2009 and 2010. This provision negatively affected Buenaventura’s 4Q23 net income. However, it does not imply a cash outflow as it has already been paid. On December 14, 2023, Buenaventura received US$49.0 million in dividends related to its stake in Cerro Verde. The Company received a total of US$146.9 million in dividends for FY23. Buenaventura’s Board of Directors has proposed a dividend payment of US$ 0.0726 per share/ADS, aligned with the Company’s commitment to shareholder value.

Announces Pricing of $40.2 Million Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Humacyte, Inc. (HUMA) announces the pricing of a public offering, with 13.4 million shares of common stock at $3.00 per share, aiming to raise $40.2 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of 13.4 million shares by Humacyte at $3.00 per share is a strategic move aimed at raising capital, with expected gross proceeds of $40.2 million. This influx of capital is crucial for the company's ongoing research and development efforts, particularly as a clinical-stage biotechnology firm where funding is vital for sustaining operations and advancing clinical trials. The pricing of the shares, however, reflects the market's current valuation of the company, which investors should scrutinize in relation to its pipeline potential, cash burn rate and the competitive landscape.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of this offering on existing shares. While it provides necessary capital, it also means that current shareholders will own a smaller percentage of the company post-offering. It's essential to evaluate the use of proceeds, as efficient allocation towards high-potential projects can enhance long-term value, whereas misallocation could lead to underperformance. Biotech Market Analyst Humacyte's focus on developing universally implantable bioengineered human tissue places it within a niche but rapidly growing segment of the biotechnology industry. The success of such an offering can serve as a bellwether for investor confidence in regenerative medicine. The capital raised could accelerate the company's path to potentially bringing innovative treatments to market, which would have significant implications for healthcare providers and patients alike.Market trends show increasing interest in personalized and regenerative medicine and Humacyte's proprietary technology could position it well within this space. However, the path to commercialization is fraught with regulatory hurdles and clinical trial risks. The market will watch closely for progress updates post-capital raise, as these will be critical indicators of the company's ability to execute on its business plan and deliver on its scientific promises. Legal Expert In transactions such as public offerings, legal compliance with securities regulations is paramount. The underwriting discounts and commissions, along with other offering expenses, will be scrutinized by legal professionals to ensure adherence to SEC guidelines. Furthermore, the timing and conditions of the closing will be subject to legal review to safeguard the interests of both the company and the investors.It is also important to note that the disclosure of offering details and the use of proceeds in public filings provides transparency, which is a cornerstone of investor protection. The legal framework governing such offerings aims to balance the company's need to raise capital with the protection of investors, ensuring that all material information is disclosed for informed decision-making. 02/29/2024 - 09:18 PM DURHAM, N.C., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Humacyte, Inc. (Nasdaq: HUMA), a clinical-stage biotechnology platform company developing universally implantable, bioengineered human tissue at commercial scale, today announced today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 13,400,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $3.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from this offering are expected to be $40.2 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by Humacyte. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about March 5, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. In addition, Humacyte has granted the underwriters an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 2,010,000 shares of Humacyte’s common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. All of the shares of common stock are being sold by Humacyte. TD Cowen and Cantor are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. BTIG is acting as lead manager. Humacyte intends to use the net proceeds that it will receive from the offering to continue the advancement of its pipeline in regenerative medicine, to support U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) review of its Biologics License Application (“BLA”) seeking approval of Humacyte’s bioengineered human acellular vessels (“HAVs”) in urgent arterial repair following extremity vascular trauma when synthetic graft is not indicated and when autologous vein use is not feasible, to establish its initial commercial infrastructure in anticipation of future potential commercial launches and for general corporate purposes. A shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-267225) was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on September 1, 2022 and declared effective by the SEC on September 9, 2022. The securities are being offered by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the offering that form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the offering was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The final prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the offering will be filed with the SEC and also will be available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

The Selling Stockholders received shares upon conversion of Series B Preferred Shares. APi will not receive proceeds from the offering. Positive None. Negative The offering may dilute existing shareholders' ownership as a significant number of shares are being sold by Selling Stockholders, not the company itself. Financial Analyst The announcement by APi Group Corporation regarding the upsizing and pricing of a significant public offering of shares by major stakeholders is a substantial event for current and potential investors. The sale of over 10 million shares at $34.25 each represents a considerable liquidity event for the Selling Stockholders. A critical factor here is the conversion of Series B Preferred Shares to common stock, which suggests a strategic move by the Selling Stockholders to capitalize on their investment. This can be seen as a positive signal that these investors deem the current market price as favorable for selling.However, it is important to note that APi Group Corporation itself is not issuing new shares nor receiving proceeds from this transaction, which indicates that the company's capital structure and cash reserves will remain unchanged. The market's reaction to such a large offering could be mixed, as it might lead to concerns about dilution of existing shareholders' equity or perceived as a lack of confidence by the Selling Stockholders in the company's future growth prospects.The underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional shares adds another layer of potential future dilution but also indicates underwriter confidence in being able to sell the stock. This option could stabilize the stock price post-offering if exercised strategically. Investors should monitor the stock's trading volume and price following the closing of the offering to assess market sentiment. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context of APi Group Corporation's industry and the company's position within it is essential for evaluating the impact of this offering. APi operates in the industrials sector, providing a range of services and solutions. The timing of the offering and the pricing strategy could be influenced by sector performance, overall market conditions and the company's recent financial health. If the industrials sector is experiencing growth, the Selling Stockholders may be leveraging this timing to maximize returns.Additionally, the decision by major investors like Blackstone and Viking Global to downsize their positions could be interpreted in various ways. It may indicate a strategic portfolio realignment or a shift towards different investment opportunities. The absence of insider selling is typically a reassuring sign to the market, suggesting that the company's leadership remains invested in its future. However, the market will be keen to observe whether this offering leads to increased volatility in APi's stock price or if it's absorbed without significant disruption.It's also important to consider the broader market implications of such a transaction. If successful, it could potentially encourage other companies with similar capital structures to consider similar liquidity events, especially if the offering is perceived to have been handled effectively and the stock price remains stable or appreciates post-offering. 02/29/2024 - 10:09 PM NEW BRIGHTON, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- APi Group Corporation (NYSE: APG) (“APi” or the “Company”) announced the upsize and pricing of the previously announced underwritten registered public offering of 10,569,106 shares of common stock of the Company commenced by certain funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc.

The company's Phoenix Feasibility Study shows a significant boost in project economics. Denison also signed a Shared Prosperity Agreement with English River First Nation and made progress in advancing the Phoenix ISR mine. The company raised $113 million through equity financings and completed successful field tests at Waterbury Lake and Midwest projects.

Equity financings raised $113 million to fund operations and project advancement. Successful completion of field tests at Waterbury Lake and Midwest projects. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported earnings per share (EPS) increase from Denison Mines Corp. is a significant financial metric that indicates a strong year-over-year performance. The 450% rise in EPS, primarily due to the gain on physical uranium holdings, suggests a strategic success in asset management. Investors may view this as a positive signal of management's ability to capitalize on market conditions, particularly as the uranium market has seen price increases.However, it's important to consider the sustainability of these gains. The reliance on volatile commodity prices means that future financial performance could be subject to market fluctuations. Investors should also pay attention to the 2024 Outlook, as the company's plans for project advancement, detailed design engineering and procurement will be critical for maintaining momentum and ensuring the operational readiness of projects like the Phoenix ISR mine. Market Research Analyst The uranium market's evolution in 2023, with prices rising to US$91/lb, has had a substantial impact on Denison's balance sheet. This is reflective of a broader market trend where higher uranium prices are required to incentivize new production to meet growing demand. The market dynamics suggest a shift towards a production cost-based environment, which could benefit companies like Denison that have positioned themselves with low-cost projects.Denison's focus on the Wheeler River Project and the Phoenix deposit's feasibility study, which shows robust economics and a significant increase in project economics, positions the company well within the industry. The Shared Prosperity Agreement with English River First Nation is also noteworthy, as it underscores the importance of social license to operate and could set a precedent for community engagement in the sector. Mining Sector Analyst Denison Mines Corp.'s advancement in the In-Situ Recovery (ISR) mining method for the Phoenix deposit represents a technical milestone. ISR is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of uranium extraction and Denison's focus on this technique could give it a competitive advantage in terms of production costs and environmental impact. The completion of the Phoenix Feasibility Study and the Gryphon Update further solidifies the company's commitment to advancing its flagship Wheeler River Project.The successful completion of the Feasibility Field Test and the Shared Prosperity Agreement with English River First Nation are critical developments. The latter not only advances the project but also enhances corporate social responsibility, potentially reducing project risks associated with community opposition. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) progression is another key factor, as obtaining regulatory approval is essential for project timelines and investor confidence. 02/29/2024 - 08:11 PM TORONTO, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Denison Mines Corp.

View PDF version The Company reported earnings per share ('EPS') from continuing operations of $0.11 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a 450% increase from the 2022 EPS of $0.02, driven by the recognition of a significantly larger gain on the Company's physical uranium holdings offset by operating expenses primarily related to the Company's advancement of its flagship Wheeler River Project. A description of the Company's plans and budget for 2024 ('2024 Outlook') is included in the MD&A. David Cates, President and CEO of Denison commented, ""The sheer magnitude of Denison's numerous operational accomplishments in 2023 reflects an extraordinarily productive time for our Company. With the completion of the Phoenix Feasibility Study in June, we have cemented Phoenix's position as a globally leading uranium development project, showcasing Denison's industry leadership in the de-risking and application of the In-Situ Recovery mining method in the Athabasca Basin. The results from an updated Pre-Feasibility Study for the Gryphon deposit, completed as part of a newly issued Technical Report for the Company's flagship Wheeler River property, also demonstrate the significant potential additional leverage that comes from Denison's diversified portfolio of projects. We achieved a notable milestone for the project in 2023 with the signing of a Shared Prosperity Agreement with English River First Nation supporting the development and operation of Wheeler River. The SPA reflects ERFN's consent to the advancement of the project and acknowledges that Wheeler River is located within ERFN's Ancestral Lands. The SPA further describes a mutual commitment to maintain an open, respectful, and cooperative relationship between Denison and ERFN to ensure mutual prosperity as the development and operation of the project progresses. Significant progress has also been made in support of permitting the planned Phoenix ISR mine, consistent with our plans and objective to achieve first production in 2027 or 2028. The Company has responded to multiple rounds of technical comments and information requests from both the Provincial and Federal regulators in respect of its draft Environmental Impact Statement and has successfully reduced the number of outstanding requests, including confirmation from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment that it is satisfied with our responses and that Denison may proceed to finalize the EIS for provincial approval. The evolution of the uranium market in 2023 has been quite interesting and has had a significant positive impact on Denison's balance sheet. With the uranium price rising from US$48/lb U3O8 at the start of the year to US$91/lb U3O8 at year end, Denison's strategic physical uranium holdings have appreciated considerably – driving the Company's highest earnings per share since 2007. It is apparent that the uranium market has entered a new phase and we are pleased to see the market recognize the growing scarcity of available future uranium production and that higher prices are required to incentivize sufficient new uranium production to meet current and growing demand. Importantly, the higher price environment follows an initial wave of long-term contracting that has already incentivized a series of mine restarts from the industry's incumbent producers. This transition to a production cost-based market environment is consistent with Denison's expectations and validates the Company's tireless work to advance Phoenix towards a final investment decision during several challenging years of negative uranium market conditions. Our hard work in past years has paved the way for an incredibly exciting time for our Company as we focus on delivery of our Phoenix ISR project. As outlined in our 2024 Outlook, the Company's expected priorities for Phoenix include advancement of detailed design engineering, long-lead procurement, permitting, and project financing. In parallel, we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to drive additional value from our diverse project portfolio – including preparations for the restart of uranium mining at McClean Lake, a robust exploration program, and advancement of both the Midwest and Waterbury Lake projects through the next stages of technical and economic evaluations."" Highlights Exceptional annual earnings from continuing operations driven by $134 million gain on physical uranium investmentsDuring 2023, the Company's earnings from continuing operations of $89.4 million ($0.11 per share) were driven by an impressive $134.2 million fair value gain on the Company's investments in physical uranium. The Company acquired 2.5 million pounds U3O8 in 2021 at an average price of $36.67 per pound U3O8 (US$29.66 per pound U3O8). In the fourth quarter, the Company sold 200,000 pounds U3O8 at an average selling price of $99.50 per pound U3O8 (US$73.38 per pound U3O8), representing a realized gain on sale of $12.6 million (US$8.8 million). As at December 31, 2023, the Company's remaining uranium portfolio has increased in value by 228% to $120.35 per pound U3O8 (US$91.00 per pound U3O8) for an aggregate value of approximately $276.8 million (US$209.3 million). Feasibility Study for Wheeler River Phoenix deposit yields significant increase in project economicsIn June 2023, Denison released the results of the Feasibility Study ('Phoenix FS') completed for In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining of the high-grade Phoenix uranium deposit ('Phoenix'), which is part of the Company's flagship Wheeler River Project ('Wheeler River' or the 'Project'). The Phoenix FS demonstrates robust economics including: Base case pre-tax Net Present Value ('NPV') (8%) of $2.34 billion (100% ownership-basis) representing a 150% increase in the base-case pre-tax NPV8% for Phoenix from the 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study ('2018 PFS').Very robust base-case pre-tax Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') of 105.9%.Adjusted base case after-tax NPV8% of $1.56 billion (100% basis) and IRR of 90.0% – with Denison's effective 95% interest in the project equating to an adjusted base case after-tax NPV8% of $1.48 billion.Base case pre-tax and after-tax (adjusted) payback period of 10 months – equating to a reduction of 11 months for the pre-tax payback period from the 2018 PFS.Optimized production profile, based on ISR mine planning efforts evaluating production potential for individual well patterns – resulting in an increase to the planned rate of production by approximately 43% during the first five years of operations.Estimated pre-production capital costs of under $420 million (100% basis), yielding an impressive base-case after-tax (adjusted) NPV to initial capital cost ratio in excess of 3.7 to 1.Robust economics that easily absorb cost-inflation and design changes impacting both operating and capital costs, confirming Phoenix's estimated cash operating and all-in costs to be amongst the lowest-cost uranium mining projects in the world.Phoenix FS plans aligned and costed to meet or exceed environmental criteria expected to be required by the ongoing regulatory approval process.Updated mineral resource estimate, reflecting the results of 70 drill holes completed in support of ISR de-risking and resource delineation activities, which has upgraded 30.9 million pounds U3O8 into measured mineral resources. The updated mineral resource also resulted in an increase to the average grade of the Zone A high-grade domain, which is now estimated to contain 56.3 million pounds U3O8 in Measured and Indicated mineral resources at an average grade of 46.0% U3O8.Upgraded 3.4 million pounds U3O8 into Proven mineral reserves, representing the equivalent of 85% of production planned during the first calendar year of operations.Phoenix ISR de-risking completed and focus transitions to engineering designThe Phoenix FS reflects independent third-party validation of the selection of the ISR mining method for Phoenix and builds on the findings from a comprehensive and rigorous multi-year technical de-risking process highlighted by the highly successful completion of the leaching and neutralization phases of the Phoenix Feasibility Field Test ('FFT') in late 2022. Through the technical de-risking process, Denison acquired extensive deposit-specific data and developed a robust ISR mine planning model that involved evaluation of the production potential for individual well patterns. With technical de-risking of the application of ISR at Phoenix substantially complete, Denison undertook front-end engineering design ('FEED') to support the advancement of the planned Phoenix operation and, with the results thereof substantially complete, is transitioning into detailed engineering design. Landmark Shared Prosperity Agreement signed with English River First NationIn September 2023, Denison announced the signing of a Shared Prosperity Agreement ('SPA') with English River First Nation ('ERFN') supporting the development and operation of Wheeler River. The SPA received support from a substantial majority of ERFN members who participated in a ratification vote on its key terms. The signing of the SPA follows years of active engagement, including a four-month-long ERFN-led community consultation process ahead of the ratification vote, and represents a significant milestone in the history of both Denison's relationship with ERFN and the Project. The SPA acknowledges that the Project is located within ERFN's Ancestral Lands and provides Denison with ERFN's consent to advance the Project. Additionally, the SPA outlines a shared recognition that ERFN is the Knowledge Keeper of the culture, ways, customs, and values of ERFN in relation to the environment and its Members and reflects ERFN's desire to prioritize sustainability. Amongst other key commitments, the SPA provides ERFN and its Members with (i) an important role in environmental monitoring and management, and (ii) benefits from community investment, business opportunities, employment and training opportunities, and financial compensation. Overall, the SPA describes a mutual commitment to maintain an open, respectful, and cooperative relationship between Denison and ERFN to ensure mutual prosperity as the development and operation of the Project progresses. Phoenix Environmental Impact Statement ('EIS') advanced through regulatory reviewDenison's draft EIS for Phoenix was submitted to the Saskatchewan Minister of Environment ('SKMOE') and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ('CNSC') in late 2022. The EIS submission outlines the Company's assessment of the potential effects, including applicable mitigation measures, of the proposed ISR uranium mine and processing plant planned for Phoenix, and reflects several years of baseline environmental data collection, technical assessments, plus extensive engagement and consultation with Indigenous and non-Indigenous interested parties. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company received technical comments and information requests from both regulatory agencies and the Company has provided technical responses to both the Provincial and Federal regulators. In August 2023, reflective of the extensive efforts undertaken by and for the Company, the CNSC deemed complete the Company's responses to the approximately 250 Federal comments from the CNSC. In November 2023, a second round of information requests was received from the CNSC. Following the successful resolution of the outstanding comments from the Federal Indigenous Review Team, the Company expects to then be in position to submit a final version of EIS for consideration at a future hearing of the CNSC. In October 2023 the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment confirmed its satisfaction with Denison's comment responses and proposed EIS updates. The confirmation would allow Denison to finalize the EIS for the purpose of obtaining a Provincial Environmental Assessment ('EA') approval, however this would delink the currently coordinated Provincial – Federal EA process, which is not expected to provide a meaningful schedule advantage for the Phoenix project. Denison plans to submit one version of the final EIS to both authorities once the Federal information requests have been resolved. Phoenix ISR Feasibility Field Test Recovered Solution Management phase completedIn November 2023, the Company announced the successful completion of the recovered solution management phase of the FFT. The FFT was designed to use the existing commercial-scale ISR test pattern to perform a combined assessment of the Phoenix deposit's hydraulic flow properties along with the leaching characteristics that had been assessed through the metallurgical core-leach testing program. The prior phases of the FFT, completed in 2022, were highlighted by the recovery of 14,400 pounds of U3O8 dissolved in solutions generated during the leaching and neutralization phases of the test. The solution recovered during the FFT was stored on site and this final phase of the FFT involved the treatment of the recovered solution via an on-site purpose-built treatment system. Following treatment, a uranium precipitate product and a treated effluent were produced. The mineralized precipitates have been recovered from the process with over 99.99% efficiency. The treated effluent was tested to ensure compliance with permit conditions before being injected into a designated subsurface area. Cost update to the 2018 PFS for Wheeler River Gryphon deposit ('Gryphon') confirms the project's position amongst the lowest-cost uranium mining projects in the worldDuring 2023, the Company also completed a cost update ('Gryphon Update') to the 2018 PFS for conventional underground mining of the basement-hosted Gryphon deposit. The scope of the Gryphon Update was targeted at the review and update of capital and operating costs. Mining and processing plans remain largely unchanged from the 2018 PFS aside from minor scheduling and construction sequencing optimizations. The key points include: Base case pre-tax NPV (8%) of $1.43 billion (100% basis) is a 148% increase in the base-case pre-tax NPV8% for Gryphon from the 2018 PFS.Strong base-case pre-tax IRR of 41.4%.Base case after-tax NPV8% of $864.2 million (100% basis) and IRR of 37.6% – with Denison's effective 95% interest in the project equating to a base case after-tax NPV8% of $821.0 million.Base case pre-tax payback period of 20 months, and base case after-tax payback period of 22 months – equating to a reduction of 17 months for the pre-tax payback period from the 2018 PFS.Importantly, Gryphon remains a highly valuable project that provides Denison with an additional source of low-cost potential production to deploy significant free cash flows expected from Phoenix. $113 million raised through equity financings to fund operations and the advancement of PhoenixIn October 2023, Denison completed a bought deal public offering resulting in the issuance of 37,000,000 shares at a price of $2.03 (US$1.49) per share for total gross proceeds of $75.1 million (US$55.1 million). Throughout 2023, Denison also issued 19,786,160 shares under its At-The-Market ('ATM') equity program at an average price of $1.91 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $37.9 million. Waterbury Lake inaugural ISR field test program completed In November 2023, the Company announced the completion of an inaugural ISR field test program at the Tthe Heldeth Túé uranium deposit ('THT') on the Waterbury Lake property. The program included (i) the installation of an eight well ISR test pattern designed to collect an initial database of hydrogeological data, (ii) testing of a permeability enhancement technique, (iii) the completion of hydrogeologic test work, highlighted by the achievement of hydraulic conductivity values consistent with those from the 2020 Preliminary Economic Assessment ('PEA'), and (iv) the execution of an ion tracer test which established a 10 hour breakthrough time between the injection and extraction wells, while also demonstrating hydraulic control of the injected solution. Overall, the program successfully achieved each of its planned objectives. Midwest internal concept study completed to examine potential application of ISR mining methodThe Company completed an internal conceptual mining study examining the potential application of ISR at the Company's 25.17% owned Midwest Project ('Midwest'). The concept study was prepared by Denison during 2022 and formally issued to the Midwest Joint Venture ('MWJV') in early 2023. Based on the positive results of the concept study, the MWJV provided Denison with approval to complete additional ISR-related work, to be undertaken for Midwest in 2023 and 2024. Moon Lake South discovery of high-grade uranium mineralizationIn April 2023, Denison reported the discovery of high-grade sandstone hosted uranium mineralization approximately 30 metres above the unconformity in drill hole MS 23-10A, which was completed as part of the 2023 winter exploration program at the Moon Lake South property. The intersection in MS 23-10A returned 2.46% U3O8 over 8.0 metres, including a sub-interval grading 3.71% U3O8 over 4.5 metres. This result represents the best drill hole completed on the Moon Lake South property to date and is a high priority for follow-up exploration. $15 million strategic investment in F3 Uranium Corp. In October 2023, the Company completed a $15 million strategic investment in F3 Uranium Corp. ('F3') in the form of unsecured convertible debentures (the 'Debentures'), which carry a 9% coupon and will be convertible at Denison's option into common shares of F3 at a conversion price of $0.56 per share. F3 has the right to pay up to one third of the quarterly interest payable by issuing common shares. F3 will also have certain redemption rights on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the Debentures and/or in the event of an F3 change of control. Executive team changes undertaken in 2023 In December 2023, Denison announced the promotion of Ms. Elizabeth Sidle to the position of Chief Financial Officer, in addition to her position as the Company's Vice President Finance. Ms. Sidle joined Denison in 2016, advancing to the position of Vice President Finance in 2021. Ms. Sidle had been serving as Denison's Interim Chief Financial Officer since September 1, 2023, during a temporary medical leave of absence of the Company's previous Chief Financial Officer and since his departure from Denison in late October 2023. Denison also announced the addition of Mr. Geoff Smith to the position of Vice President Corporate Development & Commercial. Mr. Smith will be focused on supporting Denison's investor and customer engagement, the evaluation and execution of growth opportunities and financing arrangements, and the development and oversight of the Company's uranium sales and contracting strategies.

The initiative aims to create synergies and offer a revenue-sharing business model. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The relaunch of WaveMAX's SharedFi mobile app represents a strategic move to capitalize on the growing trend of shared economy and WiFi monetization. The partnership with Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) and the integration of IDT's Zendit prepaid-as-a-service platform is indicative of a broader shift in telecommunications towards more flexible and user-centric service models. The ability for users to share their private WiFi and receive compensation in the form of mobile top-ups and eSIM services from Zendit expands the revenue streams for WaveMAX and its partners.For MVNOs like PagaPhone, this collaboration could enhance customer loyalty by offering additional value through the SharedFi app. From a telecommunications perspective, the shared network of WiFi access points and small cells could alleviate network congestion and improve coverage, which is particularly beneficial in densely populated areas. Moreover, the location-based advertising model presents a lucrative opportunity, although it raises potential privacy concerns that must be managed carefully. Financial Analyst WaveMAX's initiative with Zendit and PagaPhone has the potential to impact the financial metrics of the involved companies positively. By diversifying and increasing revenue sources, WaveMAX could see improved profitability, especially if the model is adopted widely by other MVNOs. The revenue share model also provides a cost-effective way for MVNOs to offer additional services without significant infrastructure investment.For IDT Corporation, the partnership expands the reach of its Zendit platform, potentially leading to increased transaction volumes and greater visibility in the digital payments space. Investors should monitor user adoption rates and the scalability of the SharedFi model, as these will be critical indicators of long-term financial success. The model's success could also prompt competitors to explore similar partnerships, potentially leading to market consolidation or increased competition within the MVNO space. Market Research Analyst The relaunch of WaveMAX's SharedFi app aligns with current market trends favoring shared services and digital financial solutions. The collaboration with PagaPhone taps into the fintech revolution, where financial services are becoming more integrated with daily technology use.

CCC Intelligent Solutions Announces Pricing of Upsized Secondary Offering of 43 Million Shares of Common Stock,2024-03-01T02:35:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: CCCS) announces pricing of secondary offering of common stock at $11.42 per share, consisting of 43 million shares with an upsized option of 6.45 million shares.

(NASDAQ: CCCS) announces pricing of secondary offering of common stock at $11.42 per share, consisting of 43 million shares with an upsized option of 6.45 million shares. Selling Stockholders include affiliates of Advent International, L.P. and Oak Hill Capital Partners. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst With CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. announcing the pricing of its secondary offering, the immediate effect on the stock market is the potential dilution of existing shares. The upsizing of the offering from 40 million to 43 million shares, at a price of $11.42 per share, suggests a strong demand for the stock or a need for increased capital. The additional option for underwriters to purchase up to 6.45 million shares could further dilute the stock but also indicates a safeguard for additional capital if investor demand exceeds expectations.Investors should consider the reasons behind the secondary offering, such as whether the company is seeking to raise capital for expansion, debt reduction, or other strategic initiatives. The influx of capital could strengthen the company's balance sheet, potentially leading to long-term growth. However, shareholders should be mindful of the short-term impact on share price and earnings per share due to the increase in the number of shares outstanding. Market Research Analyst The secondary offering by CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. reflects broader market trends where companies capitalize on favorable market conditions to raise funds. The pricing of the offering at $11.42 per share provides a benchmark for the company's valuation in the eyes of institutional investors. It is crucial to assess the market's reception of the offering, as a successful closing at the upsized amount could signal investor confidence in the company's future prospects.Additionally, the involvement of affiliates of Advent International, L.P. and Oak Hill Capital Partners as the Selling Stockholders indicates a potential shift in the company's ownership structure. Market participants should monitor the post-offering trading activity for insights into the stock's liquidity and volatility, which could be affected by the change in the shareholder base. Legal Expert The legal implications of a secondary offering involve a thorough examination of the disclosure requirements and regulatory compliance. The company must ensure accurate and transparent communication with investors regarding the use of proceeds from the offering. Any misrepresentation or omission could lead to legal challenges or regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, the granting of an option to underwriters to purchase additional shares is a common practice that provides flexibility in the capital raising process but also requires careful legal structuring to avoid potential conflicts of interest between existing and new shareholders.It is also important to consider the legal obligations that the Selling Stockholders may have post-transaction, such as lock-up agreements that restrict the sale of additional shares for a certain period. These agreements can stabilize the stock price post-offering by preventing a sudden influx of shares into the market. 02/29/2024 - 09:35 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc.

The company plans to focus on integrating its business operations, identifying profitable customers, and realizing operational efficiencies.","EchoStar Announces Financial Results for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary EchoStar Corporation (SATS) reported a decrease in total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to subscriber declines in its Pay-TV segment. The company experienced a net loss in 2023, mainly attributed to a noncash impairment to goodwill and an adjustment to the carrying value of the 800 MHz purchase option. Despite these challenges, EchoStar completed a merger with DISH Network, aiming to enhance its offerings in satellite technology, streaming services, and 5G network. The company plans to focus on integrating its business operations, identifying profitable customers, and realizing operational efficiencies. Positive EchoStar reported a total revenue of $17.02 billion for 2023, down from $18.63 billion in 2022. Net loss attributable to EchoStar in 2023 was $1.70 billion compared to net income of $2.48 billion in 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to subscriber declines in the Pay-TV segment. EchoStar completed a merger with DISH Network, combining their respective strengths in satellite technology and wireless connectivity. The company aims to focus on integrating its business operations, identifying profitable customers, and realizing operational efficiencies post-merger. Negative Consolidated OIBDA decreased to $1.32 billion in 2023 from $3.41 billion in 2022. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.03 billion compared to net income of $984 million in the year-ago quarter. Subscriber declines were observed in various segments, impacting the company's financial performance. Broadband net subscribers decreased by approximately 59,000 in the fourth quarter, reflecting challenges in the segment. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of EchoStar Corporation for the full year and final quarter of 2023 reveal a significant net loss, contrasting sharply with the net income reported in the previous year. This downturn is primarily due to a noncash impairment to goodwill and an adjustment in the carrying value of the 800 MHz purchase option. These impairments are substantial and indicate a reevaluation of the company's assets and future income potential. The decline in subscriber numbers across Pay-TV, Retail Wireless and Broadband segments further exacerbates the financial strain, signaling potential challenges in customer retention and market competition.From an investment perspective, the shift from a profitable year to a loss-making one could impact investor confidence and stock valuation. The merger with DISH Network, however, may offer strategic benefits that could mitigate some concerns by promising operational efficiencies and cost savings. The emphasis on acquiring 'higher-quality subscribers' suggests a pivot towards more sustainable, long-term customer relationships, which can be favorable for revenue stability. Nevertheless, the immediate financial health of EchoStar appears to be under pressure and the effectiveness of the merger in reversing the downward trend will be closely monitored by stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Examining EchoStar's performance within the context of the broader telecommunications market reveals several industry challenges. Subscriber declines in Pay-TV are consistent with a global trend of cord-cutting as consumers shift towards streaming platforms. EchoStar's increased net losses in Pay-TV subscribers highlight the need for the company to innovate and possibly diversify its service offerings to retain and grow its customer base in a highly competitive environment.The decrease in Retail Wireless and Broadband subscribers suggests that EchoStar is facing stiff competition from other technologies and service providers. The launch of the EchoStar XXIV satellite, aimed at expanding broadband capacity, indicates an attempt to address capacity limitations and competitive pressures. The success of this satellite in attracting and maintaining broadband customers will be a critical factor in the company's ability to stabilize and grow this segment. Industry observers will be interested in the impact of this new asset on EchoStar's market position and whether it can effectively compete with emerging satellite-based and terrestrial broadband providers. Telecommunications Industry Expert The financial results highlight EchoStar's operational challenges, particularly in the Pay-TV and Retail Wireless segments. The telecommunications industry is undergoing rapid transformation with the advent of 5G technology and increasing competition from non-traditional service providers. EchoStar's investment in 5G Network Deployment, as indicated by the capital expenditure figures, suggests a strategic move to position itself within this next-generation technology landscape.The completion of the merger with DISH Network is a strategic consolidation that could offer EchoStar a competitive edge in terms of technology and market reach. The combined entity's focus on a nationwide 5G network and satellite communications solutions positions it to capitalize on the increasing demand for high-speed connectivity and could potentially lead to new revenue streams. However, the integration of the two companies will need to be executed effectively to realize the anticipated synergies and operational efficiencies. Stakeholders will benefit from monitoring the progress of this integration and the company's ability to leverage these assets to improve financial performance. 02/29/2024 - 09:32 PM ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EchoStar Corporation (NASDAQ: SATS) announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023: EchoStar reported 2023 total revenue of $17.02 billion, compared to $18.63 billion in 2022.

The net loss in 2023 was primarily attributable to a noncash impairment to goodwill totaling approximately $758 million, and an adjustment to the carrying value of the 800 MHz purchase option totaling approximately $1.8 billion. Diluted loss per share was $6.28 in 2023, compared to earnings per share of $8.05 in 2022. Excluding the tax affected impact of the goodwill impairment and the 800 MHz adjustment, 2023 net income attributable to EchoStar would have been approximately $361 million.Consolidated OIBDA totaled $1.32 billion, compared to $3.41 billion in 2022. (See OBIDA definition and non-GAAP reconciliation below.)

The transaction combined DISH Network's satellite technology, streaming services, engineering expertise, retail wireless business, and nationwide 5G network with EchoStar's premier satellite communications solutions, enterprise go-to-market capabilities, and U.S.-based manufacturing.

The company closed the quarter with 8.53 million Pay-TV subscribers including 6.47 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.06 million SLING TV subscribers. This increase in net Pay-TV losses resulted from the increase in net DISH TV subscriber losses due to lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher DISH TV churn rate, offset by the decrease in net SLING TV subscriber losses due to lower subscriber disconnects in 2023 as a result of our emphasis on acquiring higher-quality subscribers.Retail Wireless net subscribers decreased by approximately 123,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to a net decrease of 25,000 in the year-ago quarter. The company closed the quarter with 7.38 million Retail Wireless subscribers.

The company closed the quarter with 1.00 million Broadband subscribers. This increase in net Broadband subscriber losses primarily resulted from our capacity limitations, competitive pressure from satellite-based competitors and other technologies, and a more selective customer screening. The EchoStar XXIV satellite, also known as Jupiter 3, began service in December 2023, bringing additional broadband capacity and is expected to be an integral part of the Broadband and Satellite Services segment business.Set forth below is a table highlighting certain of EchoStar's segment results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (all U.S. GAAP amounts reference results from operations): For the three months ended December 31, For the years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Revenue Pay-TV $ 2,816,787 $ 3,106,149 $ 11,571,159 $ 12,505,392 Retail Wireless 898,284 928,095 3,692,372 4,135,129 5G Network Deployment 24,027 17,406 91,928 65,768 Broadband and Satellite Services 449,779 499,857 1,755,559 1,998,093 All Other & Eliminations (26,281) (18,490) (95,420) (70,136) Total $ 4,162,596 $ 4,533,017 $ 17,015,598 $ 18,634,246 Net Income (loss) attributable to EchoStar $ (2,029,882) $ 984,264 $ (1,702,057) $ 2,477,720 Purchases of property and equipment, net of refunds and other receipts (including capitalized interest related to regulatory authorizations) Pay-TV $ 75,212 $ 39,835 $ 242,736 $ 131,093 Retail Wireless $ - - $ - $ - 5G Network Deployment $ 841,522 1,084,441 $ 3,748,624 $ 3,580,518 Broadband and Satellite Services $ 61,172 76,517 $ 233,423 $ 325,891 All Other & Eliminations $ - (560) $ - $ (2,721) Total $ 977,906 $ 1,200,233 $ 4,224,783 $ 4,034,781 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measurement: For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Pay-TV Retail Wireless 5G Network Deployment Broadband and Satellite Services Eliminations Consolidated (In thousands) Segment operating income (loss) $ 2,699,810 $ (643,184) $ (1,881,369) $ (458,609) $ 5,443 $ (277,909) Depreciation and amortization 381,292 221,968 620,685 419,262 (45,284) 1,597,923 OIBDA $ 3,081,102 $ (421,216) $ (1,260,684) $ (39,347) $ (39,841) $ 1,320,014 For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Pay-TV Retail Wireless 5G Network Deployment Broadband and Satellite Services Eliminations Consolidated (In thousands) Segment operating income (loss) $ 2,933,898 $ (77,264) $ (810,968) $ 181,615 $ 5,557 $ 2,232,838 Depreciation and amortization 428,471 177,914 131,566 462,748 (25,804) 1,174,895 OIBDA $ 3,362,369 $ 100,650 $ (679,402) $ 644,363 $ (20,247) $ 3,407,733 For the three months Ended December 31, 2023 Pay-TV Retail Wireless 5G Network Deployment Broadband and Satellite Services Eliminations Consolidated (In thousands) Segment operating income (loss) $ 714,319 (344,312) (682,701) (540,152) 720 (852,127) Depreciation and amortization 95,145 53,371 235,615 107,466 (9,273) 482,325 OIBDA $ 809,464 $ (290,941) $ (447,087) $ (432,686) $ (8,553) $ (369,803) For the three months Ended December 31, 2022 Pay-TV Retail Wireless 5G Network Deployment Broadband and Satellite Services Eliminations Consolidated (In thousands) Segment operating income (loss) $ 748,729 (118,424) (254,963) 50,418 1,753 427,513 Depreciation and amortization 100,398 50,534 53,914 111,115 (8,093) 307,869 OIBDA $ 849,127 $ (67,891) $ (201,048) $ 161,533 $ (6,339) $ 735,382 Note on Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures OIBDA is defined as ""Operating income (loss)"" plus ""Depreciation and amortization.""

Despite challenges in gold production at some mines, the company is focused on growth plans for 2024, particularly with its subsidiary McEwen Copper. Financially, the company deconsolidated McEwen Copper resulting in a gain of $224 million and recognized a total investment value of $384 million. Positive Net income for 2023 was $54.7 million or $1.15 per share, a substantial improvement from a net loss of $81.1 million in 2022. Gold production at the Fox Complex and Gold Bar mine slightly exceeded guidance, while San José fell below expectations. Cash costs and AISC per ounce remained 12-18% higher than guided, requiring attention. McEwen Copper, the company's key asset, aims to increase share value with a bankable Feasibility Study in Q1 2025. Los Azules, a sustainable copper mine, shows promising environmental benefits and growth potential. Exploration activities at the Canadian and Mexican mines aim to extend mine lives by over 9 years. In Q4 2023, McEwen Copper secured financing with global giants Rio Tinto and Stellantis, raising significant funds. Despite challenges in gold production, operational improvements and cost savings are evident at various mines. Financially, the company recognized a gain of $224 million from the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper. The company's liquidity and capital resources reflect a consolidated cash balance of $23.0 million and working capital of $22.7 million. Exploration activities yielded positive results, particularly at the Stock deposits and Los Azules copper project. Management will discuss Q4 financial results and project developments in a conference call on March 1, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported shift from a net loss in 2022 to a net income in 2023 for McEwen Mining Inc. is a significant turnaround, indicating a positive trajectory in the company's profitability. The increase in net income to $54.7 million, or $1.15 per share, from a net loss of $81.1 million, or $1.71 per share, is a robust indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. This turnaround is especially noteworthy for investors as it reflects the company's ability to navigate operational challenges and market conditions.Moreover, the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper and the recognition of a $224 million gain contribute to a one-time boost in reported net income. This accounting gain, while beneficial to the reported figures, should be considered separately from ongoing operational performance when evaluating the company's financial stability. The gain from deconsolidation suggests a strategic shift in the company's investment portfolio, which could have implications for future revenue streams and investment focus.From a liquidity perspective, the decrease in total debt by 38% enhances the company's financial flexibility. However, the decline in consolidated cash and cash equivalents from $39.8 million to $23.0 million raises questions about the company's cash flow management and capital allocation strategies. Shareholders and potential investors should closely monitor subsequent financial disclosures to gauge the sustainability of the company's financial position. Market Research Analyst The reported operational results, including record mill throughput at the Fox Complex and the achievement of production guidance despite weather challenges at the Gold Bar mine, demonstrate McEwen Mining's ability to optimize operations and adapt to unforeseen events. This operational resilience is a positive signal to the market as it indicates the company's capability to maintain production targets even under adverse conditions.However, the higher-than-guided cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce across the company's operations may be of concern to stakeholders. These increased costs could pressure the company's margins and profitability if not addressed. The commitment to focus on cost control and the implementation of operational improvements will be critical to maintaining investor confidence and ensuring competitive unit costs in the future.Additionally, the growth plans for 2024, including the development of the Stock West deposit and the Fenix project, suggest a strategic investment in long-term production sustainability. The extension of mine lives by over 9 years at these projects could provide a stable production outlook, which is likely to be well-received by the market. The progress on these development projects will be a key area of focus for stakeholders as they evaluate the company's growth potential and ability to deliver on its strategic objectives. Mining Industry Analyst The environmental design of the Los Azules project, with its reduced CO2-e emissions and water usage, aligns with the growing emphasis on sustainable mining practices within the industry. This approach not only mitigates environmental impact but also aligns with investor preferences towards environmentally responsible mining operations. The move towards net-zero carbon by 2038 and the use of 100% renewable electricity could provide McEwen Mining with a competitive advantage as regulations and investor expectations around sustainability continue to tighten.The exploration successes at the Fox Complex and Los Azules, indicated by the increase in the resource base and high-grade intersections, are promising for the company's long-term growth prospects. Exploration is a critical component of value creation in the mining sector and these results could lead to increased reserves and extended mine life, enhancing the company's asset portfolio.It is important to note that while the company's 47.7% ownership in McEwen Copper Inc. represents a significant investment, the valuation of this stake is based on recent financings and may not reflect market conditions or liquidity constraints. As such, the implied market value of $800 million for McEwen Copper and by extension, the $384 million value for McEwen Mining's ownership, should be considered with caution by investors. 02/29/2024 - 09:29 PM 2023 Net income $1.15/share vs. 2022 net loss $1.71/shareTORONTO, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) today reported its fourth quarter (“Q4”) and full year 2023 financial and operational results. Net income for the year was $54.7 million or $1.15 per share versus a 2022 net loss of $81.1 million or $1.71 per share! Gold production at the Fox Complex and Gold Bar mine came in just above the low end of guidance and San José just below guidance. However, cash costs(1) and AISC(1) per ounce remain 12-18% higher than guided and need more attention. Growth Plans for 2024 “Our biggest single asset with the greatest near-term potential to increase our share value is our 48% owned subsidiary McEwen Copper. Its 2nd and 3rd largest shareholders are global giants, Rio Tinto and Stellantis, the world’s 2nd largest mining company and the world’s 4th largest automaker, owning 14.5% and 19.4% of McEwen Copper, respectively. McEwen Copper is driving hard, with 22 drills operating on site, to complete the necessary work to deliver a bankable Feasibility Study in Q1 2025. “Compared to conventional copper mines, Los Azules is designed with a much lighter impact on the environment, initially emitting one third (1/3) of the CO2-e emissions and progressing to net-zero carbon by 2038, utilizing one quarter (1/4) the water, powered by 100% renewable electricity, and producing sustainable copper cathode. “At our Canadian and Mexican mines we are advancing two important development projects. At the Fox Complex, the construction of the underground ramp access to the Stock orebodies will start in Q1. The Stock West deposit will become the primary source of production following the completion of mining at the Froome deposit in 2026. At the Fenix project, construction is expected to start in H2. Both of these projects are designed to extend the mine lives by over 9 years,” said Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner. Individual Mine Performance and Growth (see Table 1 and 2) Fox Complex, Timmins, Canada Fox performed well in 2023, achieving its annual production guidance. Mill throughput achieved a record average of 1,300 tonnes per day in Q4, the highest since our acquisition in 2017. As a result, mill throughput in Q4 was 36% higher than in Q4 2022. This is an important achievement by our team in Canada, as we aim to continue to increase mining productivity and mill throughput capacity during 2024 in preparation for production from our Stock West project. While we work to develop our ramp access to Stock West in 2024, with completion expected by the end of 2025, we also intend to conduct exploration activities at Stock East and Stock Main. We see operational improvements and cost savings at Stock as compared to Froome due to the close proximity of the Stock Mill (expected savings of $7 per tonne), softer material enabling higher mill throughput, and deposits which are not encumbered by a meaningful royalty or a stream (Froome’s 2023 stream cost estimated at $108 per ounce produced). Exploration activities are also underway with our Grey Fox project where we see significant long-term growth potential. In 2023, cash costs(1) of $1,157 per GEO sold were higher than our annual guidance of $1,020 per GEO sold due to moving to contractor crushing in early 2023, however AISC(1) of $1,351 per GEO sold came in below guidance of $1,465 per GEO sold, as a result of reduced sustaining capital expenditure requirements enabled by the productivity improvements achieved by contractor crushing. Gold Bar, Nevada, USA Despite weather conditions in early 2023 that led to flooding and a slowdown of production at Gold Bar, our team ramped up gold production significantly through Q4, as planned, and achieved its annual production guidance. Cash costs(1) of $1,565 per GEO sold and AISC(1) of $1,891 per GEO sold were 12% and 13% higher than annual guidance of $1,400 and $1,680 per GEO sold, respectively, but improved compared to 2022 as a result of mine contractor and crushing crew productivity, as well as the expansion of our heap leach pad, which was completed on time and on budget. Our Q4 unit costs were significantly below annual guidance at cash costs(1) of $1,253 and AISC(1) of $1,467, and we expect similar trends during H1 2024. San José, Santa Cruz, Argentina(4) San José had a difficult start to 2023 as seen in our Q1 results. The team at San José was quick to respond by implementing operational changes that resulted in consistent quarterly improvements to production and unit costs. This was achieved through mining and processing more tonnes containing higher average gold and silver grades compared to Q1. As a result, San José achieved annual production of 65,800 GEOs(2) in 2023, slightly under the production guidance range of 66,000 to 74,000 GEOs(2). Annual cash costs(1) of $1,413 per GEO sold and AISC(1) of $1,840 per GEO sold remained 12% and 18% higher than guidance of $1,250 and $1,550 per GEO sold, respectively, as a result of lower than expected metal grades. By Q4, cash costs(1) of $1,228 per GEO sold and AISC(1) of $1,573 per GEO sold were achieved, which was in line with annual guidance. With the investment in improving the mine plan in mid-2023 and recent exploration results indicating better than expected grades on portions of 2024 production targets, we expect operations to continue to improve. Early 2024 production and financial results have exceeded expectations to date.

Concurrently with these transactions, McEwen Mining sold 232,000 common shares of McEwen Copper in return for $6.0 million. After the closing of these transactions, Stellantis and Nuton own 19.4% and 14.5%, respectively, of McEwen Copper, while the Company’s ownership decreased to 47.7%.Safety at all of our operations was excellent with no lost-time incidents.Gold Bar: During Q4, we achieved new daily, monthly, and quarterly production records as a result of the improvements in mining productivity, the addition of crushing crews and the completion of the heap leach pad expansion.Fox Complex: We achieved the highest average daily mill throughput on record since acquisition in 2017, reaching 1,300 tonnes per day during Q4, and are currently reviewing improvements in 2024 to mining productivity and processing flowsheets to continue to increase throughput levels.In December, the Company completed a private placement offering of 1,903,000 flow-through common shares for gross proceeds of $16.1 million (CAD $22.0 million) to be used exclusively to support exploration and development work at the Fox Complex, which includes the development of the Stock ramp.We continue to invest heavily in exploration and the results have been most encouraging, particularly at Los Azules, where the resource base increased by 27%, and at the Fox Complex, where the results allow us to see the potential for significant increase in mine life at Stock and Grey Fox. Financial Results McEwen Mining ceased being the majority owner of McEwen Copper after the October 2023 financing (moving from 51.9% to 47.7% ownership), therefore for the fourth quarter and moving forward the Company’s financial statements no longer consolidates McEwen Copper on a 100% basis, and instead accounts for McEwen Copper as an equity investment. As a result of the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper, we recognized a gain of $224 million and an investment value of $384 million based on the value per share achieved in our October financing. Notice to reader: Under US GAAP, McEwen Mining consolidates 100% of the accounts of its fully owned and majority owned subsidiaries in its reported financial results. Entities over which we exert significant influence but do not control (such as Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”), the operator of the San José mine, and McEwen Copper, the owner of the Los Azules copper project) are presented as equity investments on our balance sheet. Net income for full year 2023 was $54.7 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to net loss of $81.1 million, or $1.71 per share for full year 2022. Our net income for full year 2023 improved primarily as a result of the $224.0 million accounting gain recognized on the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper. Net income for Q4 was $137.9 million, or $2.88 per share, compared with a net loss of $37.4 million, or $0.79 per share for Q4 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources We reported consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $23.0 million and consolidated working capital of $22.7 million as at December 31, 2023, compared to the respective numbers at December 31, 2022, of $39.8 million and negative $2.5 million. The reported consolidated cash balance at December 31, 2023 does not include cash balances held by McEwen Copper given the deconsolidation recognized in Q4 2023; while our cash and cash equivalents balance of $39.8 million included $38.1 million attributable to McEwen Copper. During 2023, we decreased our total debt by $25 million or 38% to $40 million and entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement effective May 23, 2023. The Company also holds a portfolio of royalties including a 1.25% net smelter royalty at both our Los Azules and Elder Creek properties, together with other royalties on properties in Nevada, Yukon, Canada and in Santa Cruz, Argentina. Exploration Exploration results from the Stock deposits at the Fox Complex were published in a separate press release on February 28th. Highlights include a 31% increase in gold resources compared to 2022. Drilling in the Stock East deposit area returned high grade intersections up to 121.5 grams per tonne (3.91 oz/t) in an orientation that suggests that earlier drilling may have missed other possible high-grade occurrences. Gold Bar exploration activities are currently focused on discovering near mine resources. Additional drilling targets have been identified at our Pick and Cabin pits to expand upon results from our 2023 drilling. McEwen Copper New metallurgical and exploration results from Los Azules were published in news releases dated February 22nd and 26th. Metallurgical highlights include a 76% expected average copper recovery (3.2% higher compared to the 2023 NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”)) during the 27-year life of mine and 8.3% lower acid consumption, resulting in a potential increase in the project after-tax NPV(8%) of $262 million(3). Exploration highlights included 446 m of 0.76% including 76 m of 0.92% (hole AZ23228MET). Our 2023-2024 drilling season began in October 2023; during Q4 we completed over 74,000 feet (22,627 meters) of drilling out of a full season target of 203,000 feet (62,000 meters). A full complement of 22 drill rigs is operating on site to reach this target. Confirmatory metallurgical testing and a large drilling campaign to upgrade resources, as well as geotechnical, hydrological, and geohydrological works are well underway to support the delivery of the feasibility study by early 2025. We own a 47.7% interest in McEwen Copper Inc., which holds a 100% interest in the Los Azules copper project in San Juan, Argentina, and the Elder Creek exploration project in Nevada, USA. The last financings completed by McEwen Copper with Stellantis and Nuton (Rio Tinto) gave the Company a market value of $800 million. This translates to $384 million for McEwen Mining shareholders’ 47.7% ownership. Management Conference Call Management will discuss our Q4 financial results and project developments and follow with a question-and-answer session.

In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning and are considered non-GAAP measures. We use these measures to evaluate our business on an ongoing basis and believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use such non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. We also report these measures to provide investors and analysts with useful information about our underlying costs of operations and clarity over our ability to finance operations. Accordingly, they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with the use of such non-GAAP measures. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using the non-GAAP measures supplementally. The non-GAAP measures are presented for our wholly owned mines and our interest in the San José mine. The amounts in the reconciliation tables labeled “49% basis” were derived by applying to each financial statement line item the ownership percentage interest used to arrive at our share of net income or loss during the period when applying the equity method of accounting. We do not control the interest in or operations of MSC and the presentations of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses of MSC do not represent our legal claim to such items. The amount of cash we receive is based upon specific provisions of the Option and Joint Venture Agreement (“OJVA”) and varies depending on factors including the profitability of the operations. The presentation of these measures, including the minority interest in the San José, has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations include: The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; andOther companies in our industry may calculate their cash cost per ounce and all-in sustaining costs differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs The terms cash costs, cash cost per ounce, all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”), and all-in sustaining cost per ounce used in this report are non-GAAP financial measures. We report these measures to provide additional information regarding operational efficiencies on an individual mine basis, and believe these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about our underlying costs of operations. Cash costs consist of mining, processing, on-site general and administrative expenses, community and permitting costs related to current operations, royalty costs, refining and treatment charges (for both doré and concentrate products), sales costs, export taxes and operational stripping costs, but exclude depreciation and amortization (non-cash items). The sum of these costs is divided by the corresponding gold equivalent ounces sold to determine a per ounce amount. All-in sustaining costs consist of cash costs (as described above), plus accretion of retirement obligations and amortization of the asset retirement costs related to operating sites, environmental rehabilitation costs for mines with no reserves, sustaining exploration and development costs, sustaining capital expenditures and sustaining lease payments. Our all-in sustaining costs exclude the allocation of corporate general and administrative costs. The following is additional information regarding our all-in sustaining costs: Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current annual production at the mine site and include mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities. Sustaining capital costs do not include costs of expanding the project that would result in improved productivity of the existing asset, increased existing capacity or extended useful life.Sustaining exploration and development costs include expenditures incurred to sustain current operations and to replace reserves and/or resources extracted as part of the ongoing production. Exploration activity performed near-mine (brownfield) or new exploration projects (greenfield) are classified as non-sustaining. The sum of all-in sustaining costs is divided by the corresponding gold equivalent ounces sold to determine a per ounce amount. Costs excluded from cash costs and all-in sustaining costs, in addition to depreciation and depletion, are income and mining tax expenses, all corporate financing charges, costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions and asset disposal, and any items that are deducted for the purpose of normalizing items. The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, production costs applicable to sales. The El Gallo mine results are excluded from this reconciliation for 2023, 2022 and 2021 as the economics of residual leaching operations are measured by incremental revenue exceeding incremental costs. Residual leaching costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $nil million compared to $0.7 million in 2022 and $9.3 million in 2021. As a result, we have ceased using cash cost and all-in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce to evaluate the El Gallo mine on an ongoing basis and have therefore ceased disclosure of such metric: Three months ended December 31, 2023 Year ended December 31, 2023 Gold Bar Fox Complex Total Gold Bar Fox Complex Total (in thousands, except per ounce) (in thousands, except per ounce)Production costs applicable to sales - Cash costs (100% owned) $25,889 $13,298 $ 39,187 $67,335 $51,895 $ 119,230In‑mine exploration 1,705 — 1,705 4,759 — 4,759Capitalized underground mine development (sustaining) — 2,119 2,119 — 8,046 8,046Capital expenditures on plant and equipment (sustaining) 1,374 — 1,374 9,028 — 9,028Sustaining leases 11 153 164 248 676 924All‑in sustaining costs $28,979 $15,570 $ 44,549 $81,370 $60,617 $ 141,987Ounces sold, including stream (GEO) 19.2 10.6 29.9 43.0 44.9 87.9Cash cost per ounce sold ($/GEO) $1,345 $1,253 $ 1,313 $1,565 $1,157 $ 1,356AISC per ounce sold ($/GEO) $1,506 $1,467 $ 1,492 $1,891 $1,351 $ 1,615 Three months ended December 31, 2022 Year ended December 31, 2022 Gold Bar Fox Complex Total Gold Bar Fox Complex Total (in thousands, except per ounce) (in thousands, except per ounce)Production costs applicable to sales - Cash costs (100% owned) $8,666 $10,742 $19,408 $43,500 $36,845 $80,345Mine site reclamation, accretion and amortization 218 — 218 1,654 — 1,654In‑mine exploration 505 — 505 3,335 — 3,335Capitalized underground mine development (sustaining) — 4,317 4,317 — 15,448 15,448Capital expenditures on plant and equipment (sustaining) 1,576 — 1,576 3,084 — 3,084Sustaining leases 191 110 301 1,754 619 2,373All‑in sustaining costs $11,156 $15,169 $26,325 $53,327 $52,912 $106,239Ounces sold, including stream (GEO)(1) 8.0 9.4 17.4 26.8 36.1 62.9Cash cost per ounce sold ($/GEO) $1,083 $1,137 $1,112 $1,622 $1,020 $1,276AISC per ounce sold ($/GEO) $1,395 $1,606 $1,509 $1,989 $1,465 $1,688 Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 San José mine cash costs (100% basis) (4) (in thousands, except per ounce) Production costs applicable to sales - Cash costs $48,680 $51,963 $ 180,115 $182,195 $196,032 Mine site reclamation, accretion and amortization 93 111 535 400 451 Site exploration expenses 1,831 2,158 9,167 8,946 11,207 Capitalized underground mine development (sustaining) 10,407 10,201 38,346 37,959 27,548 Less: Depreciation (768) (499) (2,930) (1,990) (1,971)Capital expenditures (sustaining) 2,106 3,006 9,224 11,636 15,751 All‑in sustaining costs $ 62,349 $66,940 $ 234,457 $239,146 $249,018 Ounces sold (GEO) 39.6 39.3 127.5 139.5 155.3 Cash cost per ounce sold ($/GEO) $ 1,228 $1,321 $1,413 $1,306 1,262 AISC per ounce sold ($/GEO) $ 1,573 $1,701 $ 1,840 $1,714 1,603 Technical Information The technical content of this news release related to financial results, mining and development projects has been reviewed and approved by William (Bill) Shaver, P.Eng., COO of McEwen Mining and a Qualified Person as defined by SEC S-K 1300 and the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 ""Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.""

(FIVN) announced the exercise of a $97.5 million option to purchase additional convertible senior notes due 2029, resulting in a total offering size of $747.5 million. The notes are expected to settle on March 1, 2024, with approximately $95.3 million in additional net proceeds. Five9 plans to use the proceeds for capped call transactions and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The exercise of the option to purchase additional convertible senior notes by Five9, Inc. represents a significant capital raise, increasing the total offering size to $747.5 million. This financial maneuver is indicative of the company's strategy to bolster its balance sheet, potentially to fund growth initiatives or to strengthen its cash reserves. Convertible notes are hybrid securities offering potential upside through conversion to equity while providing downside protection as fixed-income instruments. The decision to enter into additional capped call transactions suggests an attempt to manage potential dilution from the conversion of these notes, which is a common practice to reassure existing shareholders.From a financial perspective, the additional $95.3 million in net proceeds could provide Five9 with the liquidity to navigate the competitive landscape of the CX (Customer Experience) platform market. The use of funds for general corporate purposes and working capital indicates a focus on operational flexibility. However, investors should be mindful of the impact such debt instruments may have on the company's long-term financial health, particularly in terms of interest obligations and the potential for dilution of existing shares. Market Research Analyst The private placement of convertible notes to qualified institutional buyers demonstrates market confidence in Five9's business model and growth prospects within the Intelligent CX Platform sector. Nevertheless, it is crucial to monitor the company's subsequent financial statements to assess how these funds are allocated and whether they translate into revenue growth or improved operational efficiencies. Comparing Five9's financial leverage and capital expenditure to industry benchmarks will be essential in evaluating the effectiveness of this capital raise.Moreover, the timing of the settlement, expected in 2024, may coincide with strategic initiatives or market expansions that could reshape Five9's competitive position. The tech industry, particularly the SaaS (Software as a Service) sector, is rapidly evolving and Five9's ability to innovate and adapt will be critical. Analysis of the company's investment in research and development, as well as any shifts in market share post-funding, will provide further insights into the potential impact of this capital raise on the company's market positioning. Legal Expert The offering of convertible notes under Rule 144A is a strategic approach to raise capital while bypassing the more stringent public offering regulations. It is targeted exclusively at qualified institutional buyers, which typically include entities such as pension funds, investment firms and insurance companies capable of absorbing larger and more complex financial instruments. The legal stipulation that neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have been registered under the Act highlights the private nature of this transaction and the restrictions on the resale of the securities.Investors should be aware of the regulatory framework governing such private placements and the implications it may have on the liquidity and marketability of these securities. The absence of public registration means less transparency for the general market, which can be a double-edged sword—limiting information for potential investors while allowing the company to operate with greater discretion. 02/29/2024 - 07:47 PM SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVN), the Intelligent CX Platform provider, today announced the exercise of the entire $97.5 million aggregate principal amount option to purchase additional 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”), resulting in a total offering size of $747.5 million. The notes to be sold in connection with the exercise of the option to purchase additional notes have the same terms in all respects as the other notes to be sold in the offering. The total offering of $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes is expected to settle on March 1, 2024. The net proceeds from the sale of notes in connection with the exercise of the option to purchase additional notes is expected to result in approximately $95.3 million of additional net proceeds. Five9 expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers in the offering and other financial institutions. The remainder of the additional net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes is expected to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The notes were and will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

ISS acknowledges progress with Workers United but insists on independent oversight for Starbucks Board. SOC proposes three qualified nominees for director positions. Positive None. Negative None. 02/29/2024 - 07:45 PM WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Strategic Organizing Center (the “SOC”), a shareholder of Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) (“Starbucks” or the “Company”), today commented on the recent report published by Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) in relation to Starbucks’ upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). The Annual Meeting is scheduled for March 13, 2024. The SOC stated: “While ISS acknowledged the validity of a number of our arguments in its report, we disagree with the view that board change is not currently needed at Starbucks. As ISS points out, Starbucks ‘mishandled’ its response to its employees’ campaign for unionization and, as a result, has materially damaged the reputation the Company previously enjoyed as a progressive employer. ISS also concurs that shareholders should be concerned by Starbucks’ share price performance since unionization efforts began. However, in our view, ISS’ analysis of the link between this underperformance and the Company’s reliance upon illegal tactics in its human capital management strategy ignores what is plainly evident: Starbucks’ Board should be held accountable for endorsing a response to unionization that destroyed shareholder value. Further, we agree with ISS that the recent announcement of Starbucks and Workers United committing to a path forward is meaningful progress. That said, the fact remains that the actions the Company has taken are reactive. For this reason, we feel it is still important to add independent oversight to the Starbucks Board in order to ensure the Company follows through on its commitments. Our three exceptionally qualified nominees – Maria Echaveste, Hon. Joshua Gotbaum and Hon. Wilma Liebman – bring diverse leadership experience from within the business, government and non-profit sectors and can provide the perspectives and expertise Starbucks needs now. We encourage shareholders to help send the message that it is time to Brew a Better Starbucks by voting for our director candidates today. We look forward to continuing to engage with our fellow shareholders in advance of the Annual Meeting.” In its report, ISS noted the following:1 “Although SBUX has weathered controversies about unionization in the past, its image as an employer has faced greater scrutiny than ever since the unionization movement began.” “By its own admission, the board was caught off-guard and mishandled the initial response. This translated into negative media attention, which led to SBUX being recast from a progressive employer into an embodiment of the frustrations faced by many retail workers.” “…the initial response by SBUX to unionization efforts translated into reputational damage…” “The key in this proxy contest is uncovering the role that unionization matters have played in the divergence [between long-term and short-term performance].” “A business like SBUX cannot function without employees, so there is necessarily a link between labor and performance.” “Perhaps most importantly, SBUX and Workers United recently committed to start discussions on a foundational framework designed to achieve collective bargaining agreements, and SBUX will provide union-represented partners with previously-announced benefits that they have not been able to take advantage of to date. This appears to be a major step forward for all involved.” Shareholders can be part of ensuring Starbucks returns to the right path for the future by using the BLUE proxy card – to vote “FOR” each of the SOC Nominees today. Shareholders can also vote for the SOC Nominees on the Company’s White proxy card.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Sidus Space, Inc. regarding its public offering of Class A common stock is a strategic move aimed at raising capital for the company. The pricing at $6.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $7.9 million, is indicative of the company's valuation and market demand for its shares. For stakeholders, the critical factor to consider is the intended use of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. This is a common practice for companies seeking to bolster their financial position and invest in future growth.It is essential to scrutinize the terms of the offering, such as underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which will impact the net proceeds and thus the actual infusion of capital into the company. Investors should also note the role of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager, which suggests a level of confidence in their ability to manage the offering effectively. The reliance on a shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing for a more expedited process. The closing condition, scheduled for March 5, 2024, provides a clear timeline for the completion of the offering. Market Research Analyst When evaluating the impact of Sidus Space's public offering on the market, one must consider the broader context of the space and data-as-a-service industry. This sector has seen increased investor interest due to the growing commercialization of space and the expansion of data-related services. The offering's success will hinge on market perception of Sidus Space's growth potential and its ability to capitalize on industry trends.Investors will likely assess the historical performance of Sidus Space's stock, the company's financial health and its strategic plans for utilizing the raised funds. The market's response to the offering can serve as a barometer for the company's reputation and the appetite for space-related investments. Furthermore, the pricing of the stock at $6.00 per share will be compared against industry peers, which can influence investor sentiment and the stock's performance post-offering. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering's compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations is paramount. The use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 facilitates a quicker response to market conditions by allowing the company to sell securities to the public without the need for a separate SEC review for each offering. However, it's important for investors to understand that the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory scrutiny.The availability of a preliminary prospectus supplement provides transparency about the offering's terms, which is crucial for informed investment decisions. It is also noteworthy that the company has taken care to clarify that the securities will not be sold in any jurisdiction where such an offer would be unlawful without proper registration or qualification under the relevant securities laws, thus adhering to legal and regulatory standards. 02/29/2024 - 08:00 PM CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sidus Space, Inc.

Prices Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (TSLX) announced a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, generating $83.4 million in gross proceeds. The underwriters have an option for an additional 600,000 shares. The offering is pending closing conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering of shares by Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. is a significant event that requires a financial analyst's perspective. The offering of 4,000,000 shares at a gross proceed of approximately $83.4 million indicates a substantial capital inflow for the company. This move suggests a strategic initiative to leverage market conditions to raise funds, possibly for expansion, debt reduction, or other corporate activities.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of such an offering on existing shares. While it provides capital, it also spreads the company's earnings over a larger number of shares, which could potentially lower earnings per share (EPS). Additionally, the underwriters' option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 shares could lead to further dilution if exercised. It's important to monitor the stock's performance post-announcement to gauge market sentiment.Another angle to consider is the use of proceeds. If the company allocates the funds to high-return projects or debt reduction, it could enhance shareholder value in the long-term, despite short-term dilution. The market will also look at how this aligns with the company's strategic goals and industry trends. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, the pricing and success of the public offering by Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. can serve as an indicator of investor confidence in the specialty lending sector. The sector's performance is often tied to the broader economic environment, including interest rate trends, which affect borrowing costs and profit margins for lending institutions.It's crucial to analyze the offering in the context of the company's market position and the competitive landscape. If TSLX is raising funds to capitalize on unique growth opportunities or to strengthen its balance sheet, it could signal a positive outlook for the company amidst its peers. Conversely, if the offering is a response to liquidity concerns or regulatory capital requirements, it may raise questions about underlying financial health.The terms of the offering, such as the pricing of shares relative to current market value, also merit attention. A discount to the current trading price could indicate a need to incentivize investors, while a price at or above market value could demonstrate strong demand for the company's stock. Economist An economist's view on such a capital-raising event would involve assessing the broader economic implications and the timing of the offering. The capital markets are influenced by macroeconomic factors, including monetary policy and economic cycles. If the offering comes at a time of low interest rates, it could imply that TSLX is taking advantage of cheaper borrowing costs to raise funds.Furthermore, the amount raised through the offering can have implications for the company's investment in growth or operational efficiency. Economists would evaluate whether this capital infusion is likely to contribute to economic growth by enabling the company to increase lending activities or by investing in job-creating ventures.The response of the stock market to the offering can also provide insights into investor sentiment regarding the financial sector and risk appetite. A successful offering might suggest that investors are optimistic about the economic outlook and the company's prospects, while a lackluster response could reflect broader economic concerns or sector-specific issues. 02/29/2024 - 07:57 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc.

Shareholders can exchange shares between the two stock exchanges. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of 2,006,120 new A ordinary shares by Noble Corporation plc represents a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The capital raised through the exercise of warrants, amounting to USD 1,568.80, is relatively modest. However, the issuance of shares at no cost to employees as a result of the vesting of restricted stock units could be indicative of the company's use of equity-based compensation to retain talent. This practice aligns with the broader industry trend where companies incentivize employees with stock options or restricted shares, which can enhance long-term commitment to the company's success.It is also noteworthy that the new shares carry the same rights as the existing shares, maintaining equitable treatment among shareholders. The listing of new shares on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Copenhagen provides liquidity and access to a broader investor base, potentially increasing Noble's visibility and trading volume. Investors should monitor the dilutive effect of the new share issuance on earnings per share, as well as the impact on the company's market capitalization. Market Research Analyst The dual listing of Noble's shares, allowing for exchange between Nasdaq Copenhagen and the New York Stock Exchange, offers strategic advantages. It caters to investors in different regions and currencies, which may lead to a more diversified and stable shareholder base. For investors, the ability to receive dividends in either USD or DKK, depending on the exchange they choose, provides flexibility in managing currency exposure.However, the process of transferring shares between markets requires shareholders to navigate additional steps, which could be a barrier for some. The complexity of managing shares across different exchanges should be weighed against the benefits of broader market access. Investors may also consider the implications of currency fluctuations on dividend payments when shares are traded on different exchanges. Legal Expert The compliance with the Danish Capital Markets Act, as indicated by the announcement of the total nominal value of issued share capital and the total number of voting rights, is an essential aspect of corporate governance. Noble's adherence to these regulations reflects its commitment to transparency and legal conformity. Shareholders should be reassured by the company's clear communication regarding share capital changes, as it provides a basis for understanding their rights and the value of their investment.For those interested in the transfer procedure between Nasdaq Copenhagen and the New York Stock Exchange, the legal requirements and steps involved are crucial to ensure a smooth transaction. Noble's provision of detailed instructions and resources on its website demonstrates its effort to facilitate shareholder actions and maintain compliance with cross-border trading regulations. 02/29/2024 - 06:30 PM SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (""Noble"") (CSE: NOBLE, NYSE: NE) today announces changes to its share capital.

Aerospace Industry Analyst The recent success of Intuitive Machines in landing its Nova-C class lunar lander, Odysseus, on the Moon represents a significant milestone in the aerospace industry, particularly for lunar exploration. This achievement not only marks the first U.S. lunar landing in over 50 years but also positions Intuitive Machines as a pioneer in commercial lunar services. The utilization of a proprietary liquid methane and liquid oxygen propulsion system, which successfully performed deep space ignitions and restarts, demonstrates a technological advancement that could influence future spacecraft design and mission planning.From an industry perspective, the successful transmission of over 350 megabytes of data from the lunar surface is a testament to the company's capabilities in managing complex space missions. The strategic significance of landing near the south pole, a region of interest for NASA's Artemis Campaign, cannot be overstated. It aligns with broader national objectives and may provide Intuitive Machines with a competitive edge in securing future contracts. The fixed-price performance contract model adopted by the company could set a precedent for cost-efficiency, potentially reshaping procurement strategies for space missions. Market Research Analyst The accomplishment by Intuitive Machines in the lunar landing space has broader implications for the stock market, particularly for investors in aerospace and defense sectors. The company's success in exceeding mission objectives and entering standby mode for potential revival indicates a level of mission reliability that could attract interest from both governmental and commercial entities. As a NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services provider, Intuitive Machines is now at the forefront of the cislunar market, which may lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up the company's stock value.Furthermore, the disruption in lunar landing economics through a fixed-price contract suggests a scalable business model that could appeal to a range of customers looking for cost-effective space solutions. The emphasis on international collaboration and the strength of the domestic supply chain underscore the company's strategic positioning in a global market. As the lunar economy develops, Intuitive Machines' early successes could serve as a catalyst for growth within the sector, potentially benefiting associated industries and supply chains. Economist The successful lunar landing by Intuitive Machines signifies a substantial development in the burgeoning cislunar economy. The company's ability to integrate on a global scale, leveraging international hardware providers and radio astronomy resources, exemplifies the growing interconnectedness of space exploration and the global economy. The potential for the lunar south pole region to become a hub for human missions aligns with the objectives of NASA's Artemis Campaign and suggests a long-term economic strategy that could stimulate investments in space infrastructure and technologies.The economic impact of such a mission extends beyond immediate financial returns. It has the potential to spur innovation, create new markets and catalyze public-private partnerships. The success of Intuitive Machines may encourage other companies to enter the space exploration market, fostering competition and driving technological advancements. As the cislunar market matures, the economic benefits could permeate through various sectors, including mining, telecommunications and tourism, contributing to a new frontier of economic activity. 02/29/2024 - 06:21 PM HOUSTON, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intuitive Machines, Inc. (Nasdaq: LUNR, LUNRW) (“Intuitive Machines”) (“Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, today announced the completion of science and data transmission for all NASA and commercial payloads onboard Odysseus, the Nova-C class lunar lander, after the successful February 22 soft landing on the south pole region of the Moon. Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, “Spaceflight’s unique challenges are conquered on Earth but mastered in space. Our now proven robust lunar program, a national asset, feeds directly into our second and third missions. This success drives our relentless pursuit of performance excellence to benefit the entire industry.” Intuitive Machines achieved these marquee accomplishments in the Company’s first attempt to land on the Moon: Successfully soft-landed the Company’s Nova-C class lunar lander, Odysseus, on the Moon, marking the United States’ first lunar landing in over 50 years since Apollo 17Validated the performance of the Company’s proprietary liquid methane and liquid oxygen propulsion system through the first-ever deep space ignition, followed by multiple restarts, repeatedly providing successful spacecraft maneuversBecame the first commercial-sector company and NASA CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) provider to successfully land and transmit scientific data to and from the Moon Landed Odysseus, farther south than any vehicle in the world has ever soft-landed on the Moon, which we believe is significant given NASA’s $93B Artemis Campaign is targeting the region for human missionsTraveled over 600,000 miles and softly landed less than one mile from its intended Malapert A landing regionTransmitted over 350 megabytes of science and engineering data, which was collected across all payloads; NASA confirms mission success Exceeded one of the mission objectives to operate 144 hours on the lunar surface and entered standby mode on February 29, 2024, as we await two to three weeks for the next lunar day and a potential for Odysseus’ revival Fundamentally disrupted the economics of landing on the Moon through a fixed-price performance contract, demonstrating unprecedented economics and efficiency to commercial customers and NASA Accomplishing the IM-1 mission required Intuitive Machines to integrate on a global scale. Radio astronomy dishes spread across a dozen countries, international hardware providers, and the strength of the United States domestic supply chain across more than 50 congressional districts were paramount in the IM-1 mission success. Mr. Altemus continued, “Before this mission, we had an absolute sense of humility and relied on our technical excellence and years of experience to triumph and persevere throughout all the challenges we faced during the mission. Following our unequivocal success, I am emboldened for the future of the U.S. and international lunar economy and Intuitive Machines' future as we believe we can win, execute, and pioneer the future of the cislunar market.” About Intuitive Machines Intuitive Machines is a diversified space company focused on space exploration.

Belpointe OZ Announces Fourth Quarter Net Asset Value Per Class A Unit,2024-02-29T23:48:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Belpointe PREP, LLC (NYSE American: OZ) announces unaudited quarterly net asset value of $365.43 million as of December 31, 2023, despite challenges in the commercial real estate market.","Belpointe OZ Announces Fourth Quarter Net Asset Value Per Class A Unit Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Belpointe PREP, LLC (NYSE American: OZ) announces unaudited quarterly net asset value of $365.43 million as of December 31, 2023, despite challenges in the commercial real estate market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Belpointe PREP, LLC's unaudited quarterly net asset value (NAV) provides critical information for investors evaluating the company's current financial health. A NAV of $365.43 million or $100.88 per Class A unit, especially in the volatile commercial real estate market, suggests a stable asset base amid economic headwinds such as higher interest rates and increased construction costs. This stability is particularly noteworthy given the broader market conditions, which have been characterized by tightening lending conditions that can affect liquidity and valuations in the real estate sector.Investors should note, however, that NAV is not calculated according to U.S. GAAP, which may lead to differences in asset and liability valuations. The exclusions in the NAV calculation, like transaction costs and equity premium adjustments and the non-adjustment for gains or distributions to the manager, could potentially affect the accuracy and comparability of the NAV. This discrepancy is important to consider when comparing Belpointe OZ's financial position to other entities that report under U.S. GAAP. In the long-term, the methods of valuation and the adjustments made can have significant implications for the perceived performance of the fund. Real Estate Market Analyst Belpointe OZ's announcement highlights the resilience of their asset valuations despite ongoing challenges in the commercial real estate sector. The mention of higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and increased construction costs are factors that typically depress real estate valuations. In this context, maintaining a stable NAV is an indicator of robust asset management and potentially strategic asset allocation.However, investors should be cautious about the forward-looking implications of the fund's valuation. The statement that the fair value of Belpointe OZ’s real estate assets may have been impacted by post-reporting date events is a reminder of the inherent unpredictability of real estate markets. Factors such as changes in market demand, regulatory shifts and broader economic trends can dramatically alter the landscape. The fund's past performance not being indicative of future results is a standard disclaimer, yet it underscores the need for investors to continually reassess the fund's performance in light of changing market conditions. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, the report from Belpointe OZ carries important signals. The stability of the NAV amidst market uncertainties is a positive sign, but the acknowledgment of the potential impact of unknown events on the fair value of real estate assets post-December 31, 2023, highlights the importance of ongoing risk assessment. It is critical for investors to understand that all investments carry the risk of loss of principal and real estate investments are no exception. The dynamic nature of the commercial real estate market requires continuous monitoring of factors that can affect asset values, such as economic cycles, demographic shifts and interest rate movements.Moreover, the non-GAAP measure of NAV requires investors to exercise due diligence in understanding the unique adjustments made by the fund, as these can influence the perceived risk and return profiles. The fund's approach to calculating NAV, including the non-adjustment for gains or distributions to the manager, may also have implications for the alignment of interests between the fund managers and investors. 02/29/2024 - 06:48 PM Greenwich, CT, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Belpointe PREP, LLC (NYSE American: OZ) (“Belpointe OZ”), a publicly traded qualified opportunity fund, today announced its unaudited quarterly net asset value (“NAV”) as of December 31, 2023 of $365.43 million or $100.88 per Class A unit. “Despite current challenges and uncertainties in the commercial real estate market, including higher interest rates, tighter lending conditions and increased construction costs, we are pleased to announce that our NAV remains relatively stable” said Brandon Lacoff, CEO of Belpointe OZ. NAV is not a measure used under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and the valuations of and certain adjustments made to our assets and liabilities used in the determination of NAV will differ from U.S. GAAP. You should not consider NAV to be equivalent to members’ capital or any other U.S. GAAP measure. For information on how Belpointe OZ calculates NAV, see the “Net Asset Value Calculation and Valuation Policies” section of our prospectus In calculating its NAV, Belpointe OZ adjusted for the transaction costs and equity premium associated with its acquisition of Belpointe REIT, Inc., however, did not adjust for gains or distributions distributable to the manager pursuant to the manager’s Class B units based on the conclusion that such amounts would be immaterial. The fair value of Belpointe OZ’s real estate assets may have been impacted after December 31, 2023 by circumstances and events that are as of yet unknown. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

The estimated allocation for the distribution paid on February 29, 2024, is $0.029 per share, with 100% return of capital. For the fiscal year-to-date as of January 31, 2024, the distribution is $0.1557 per share, with 75.98% net investment income and 24.02% return of capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the distribution notice from Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II, it is essential to highlight the significant proportion of the distribution classified as a return of capital. The 100% return of capital for the February 2024 distribution indicates that none of the payout is derived from net investment income or realized capital gains. This can often signal that the fund is not generating enough income from its investments to cover the distributions and is instead returning investors' principal. This could impact the fund's net asset value over time if it continues.For the fiscal year-to-date, the mix shifts, with approximately 76% coming from net investment income and the remaining 24% from return of capital. This mix is more typical for a healthy fund, as it suggests the majority of distributions are covered by the income the fund's assets generate. However, the absence of any capital gains—either short-term or long-term—could be a point of concern for investors looking for growth as well as income. Tax Specialist The composition of a fund's distribution has tax implications for investors. In this case, the portion of the distribution classified as a return of capital is generally not taxable upon receipt; instead, it reduces the investor's cost basis in the investment, potentially leading to higher capital gains when the shares are sold. On the other hand, net investment income would be taxable in the year it is received. Investors should be aware of these nuances to manage their tax liabilities effectively.Moreover, the absence of capital gains distributions suggests that the fund is not realizing gains from selling investments at a profit. While this could mean a more stable net asset value, it also implies that there may be fewer opportunities for tax-loss harvesting, which can be a useful strategy for investors to offset gains with losses and minimize taxes. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the distribution characteristics of Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II may reflect broader market conditions. For instance, a lack of realized capital gains could indicate a conservative investment approach or a response to a less favorable market environment for capital appreciation. The reliance on return of capital for distributions could be seen as a red flag by market analysts, suggesting a need for the fund to adjust its investment strategy to ensure sustainable income generation.The fund's strategy and performance relative to its peers would be critical in assessing its competitive position in the market. A prolonged period of distributions predominantly from return of capital could lead to a reassessment of the fund's attractiveness to income-focused investors, potentially affecting its market price and demand for shares. 02/29/2024 - 07:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II (NYSE: SABA) (the “Fund”), a registered closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is notifying shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties of the sources of distributions pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION Distribution Notice. Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act, the Fund is providing its shareholders with an estimate of the source of the Fund's monthly distribution as required by current securities laws. The Fund’s estimated sources of the distribution paid on February 29, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows: Estimated Allocations for the distribution paid on February 29, 2024 (estimated as of February 21, 2024): Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.02900 $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.02900 (100.00%) Cumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of January 31, 2024, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.15570 $0.11830 (75.98%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.03740 (24.02%) Shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes. The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2024 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2025. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.

Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.029 per share. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made. Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund’s most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=828803&owner=exclude. Certain Risk Factors: The Fund’s investment objective is to provide investors with high current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPAC”), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including but not limited to index options) and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk. In addition, on an opportunistic basis, the Fund may also invest up to 15% of its total assets in private funds that focus on debt, equity or other investments consistent with the Fund’s investment objective. The value of equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure provided by Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund regarding the sources of its monthly distribution is a crucial piece of information for investors and market analysts. The distribution mix, heavily weighted towards net investment income for the February payout, suggests a strong income-generating capability in the short term. This is a positive signal for the Fund's operational health and may indicate a stable or improving interest income scenario, possibly from fixed-income securities or dividend-paying stocks.However, the fiscal year-to-date figures show a significant portion of the distribution as return of capital, which can have different implications. While this might provide immediate liquidity to shareholders, it often signals that the income generated by the fund's investments was insufficient to cover the distributions, which could be a concern if this trend continues. It's essential to monitor whether this is a strategic choice or a sign of underlying performance issues. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the Fund's distribution components are indicative of its investment strategy and performance in the current economic environment. The lack of net realized capital gains, both short-term and long-term, could suggest a conservative investment approach or a market environment that has not been conducive to realizing gains. This information can be vital for investors seeking growth versus income, as the Fund's current distributions are not sourced from capital gains.Additionally, understanding the proportion of distribution coming from return of capital is important for assessing the sustainability of the Fund's distributions. A high return of capital percentage could potentially impact the Fund's net asset value over time and investors may seek to understand the reasons behind this allocation, whether it is due to strategic tax considerations or a reflection of the current investment landscape. Tax Advisor The tax implications of the Fund's distributions are an important consideration for shareholders. Distributions derived from net investment income are typically taxed at ordinary income rates, while distributions from net realized capital gains may qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates. A distribution classified as a return of capital is not immediately taxed but reduces the shareholder's cost basis in the investment, potentially leading to higher capital gains upon sale of the shares.Given the high percentage of return of capital in the year-to-date distribution, shareholders should be aware of the potential tax consequences and adjust their investment strategies accordingly. It is advisable for investors to consult with tax professionals to understand the specific impacts on their tax situation, especially if the trend of return of capital distributions persists. 02/29/2024 - 07:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (NYSE: BRW) (the “Fund”), a registered closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is notifying shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties of the sources of distributions pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION Distribution Notice. Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act, the Fund is providing its shareholders with an estimate of the source of the Fund's monthly distribution as required by current securities laws. The Fund’s estimated sources of the distribution paid on February 29, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows: Estimated Allocations for the distribution paid on February 29, 2024 (estimated as of February 21, 2024): Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.08500 $0.07615 (89.59%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00885 (10.41%) Cumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of January 31, 2024, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.36900 $0.04722 (12.80%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.32178 (87.20%) Shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes. The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2024 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2025. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.

Financial Analyst Analyzing MasTec, Inc.'s financial results, the company’s record revenue growth in Q4 and FY 2023 is notable, indicating robust demand for its infrastructure services. However, the GAAP net loss for the full year juxtaposed with a significant increase in adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA suggests a discrepancy that warrants a deeper look into non-operational factors affecting profitability. The substantial improvement in cash flow and reduction in net debt is a positive signal for financial health and operational efficiency. The initial guidance for 2024, projecting further revenue growth and a turnaround to net income profitability, suggests optimism about the company's future performance. Investors should consider the company's ability to manage costs and improve margins, as well as the potential for continued strong demand in its market segments. Market Research Analyst The 18-month backlog growth in segments other than Oil & Gas is indicative of sustainable demand for MasTec's services, which is critical for future revenue streams. However, the decline in the Oil & Gas backlog, attributed to the nearing completion of a major project, raises questions about the segment's future contribution to the company's revenue mix. The market should also note the company's focus on capital allocation and operational tools to optimize performance, which may lead to enhanced competitiveness and shareholder value. The guidance for 2024, with a modest revenue increase, reflects cautious optimism in a competitive infrastructure market where MasTec is positioning itself for long-term growth. Debt Analyst The reduction in the net debt leverage ratio from 3.4 to 2.9 times is a strong indicator of MasTec's commitment to financial stability and may be viewed favorably by creditors and investors alike. The company’s ability to generate significant cash flow in Q4 2023 to facilitate this debt reduction is impressive, particularly given the challenging economic environment. The improvement in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) to the lowest level since mid-2017 reflects efficient receivables management. Stakeholders should monitor how the company manages its debt profile against the backdrop of its 2024 guidance and the potential impact of interest rate changes on its cost of capital. 02/29/2024 - 04:41 PM Record Fourth Quarter and Annual Revenue of $3.3 Billion and $12.0 Billion, RespectivelyFull Year 2023 Cash Flow from Operations of $687 Million, a 95% Increase Over Full Year 2022Fourth Quarter Reduction in Net Debt of $455 Million 2023 Results Include GAAP Net Loss of $47.3 Million, Adjusted Net Income of $156.7 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $860.3 Million, Diluted Loss Per Share of $0.64 and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.97Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share was $0.22 Above the Prior Guidance EstimateIssuing Initial Annual 2024 Guidance Including Revenue of $12.5 Billion, a 4% Increase Over 2023, GAAP Net Income of $105 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $955 Million, with Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.04, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $2.69CORAL GABLES, Fla., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MasTec, Inc.

Fourth quarter Cash Flow from Operations was very strong at almost $500 million, enabling significant net debt reduction. Net debt leverage ratio improved significantly from 3.4 times at the end of the third quarter to 2.9 times at yearend. For the Full Year: For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue was up 23% to $12.0 billion, compared to $9.8 billion for the prior year. GAAP net loss was $47.3 million, or a loss of $0.64 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33.9 million, or earnings of $0.42 per diluted share in 2022. Full year 2023 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both non-GAAP measures, were $156.7 million and $1.97, respectively, compared to $234.8 million and $3.05, respectively, during 2022. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was up 10% to $860.3 million, compared to $780.6 million in 2022. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin rate was 7.2% compared to 8.0% last year. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and net debt, which are all non-GAAP measures, exclude certain items that are detailed and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP-reported measures in the attached Supplemental Disclosures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures. Jose Mas, MasTec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations after a challenging 2023. We look forward to the opportunities we have this year and expect to deliver record levels of revenue and adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Demand is very strong for our services, and I expect 2024 will position us to deliver double digit revenue and earnings growth in 2025 and beyond."" Mr. Mas continued, ""I'd once again like to thank the 34,000 men and women of MasTec who work every day to build, maintain, and improve the nation's communications, transportation, energy, and industrial infrastructure. It is hard work, and it's because of them that we have great long-term opportunities."" Paul DiMarco, MasTec's Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer, noted, ""I'm pleased that we were able to finish 2023 with strong cash flow generation of almost $500 million in Q4, significantly exceeding our prior expectations. DSO, at 74 days was at its lowest level since mid-2017. We are keenly focused on capital allocation to ensure we are generating appropriate returns on the capital we deploy. We will continue to focus on improving the tools and processes we utilize to measure and optimize our performance, and to capitalize on the robust demand environment provided by our end markets."" Based on the information available today, the Company is providing both first quarter and full year 2024 guidance. The Company currently expects full year 2024 revenue will approximate $12.5 billion, a record level. 2024 full year GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are expected to approximate $105 million and $1.04, respectively. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to approximate $955 million, representing 7.6% of revenue, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to approximate $2.69. For the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects revenue of approximately $2.6 billion. First quarter 2024 GAAP net loss is expected to approximate $61 million, with GAAP diluted loss per share expected to approximate $0.88. First quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to approximate $130 million or 5.0% of revenue, with adjusted diluted loss per share expected to approximate $0.48. The projected loss in the first quarter is the result of a normal seasonally slow quarter, project delays and project start-up costs. Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, March 1, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The call-in number for the conference call is (856) 344-9221 or (888) 256-1007 with a pass code of 4316181. Additionally, the call will be broadcast live over the Internet and can be accessed and replayed through the Investors section of the Company's website at www.mastec.com.

Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.

MasTec uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and net debt, to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with its peers, because these measures exclude certain items that may not be indicative of its core operating results, as well as items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. MasTec believes that these adjusted measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in its underlying business. MasTec believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information and help investors understand its financial results and assess its prospects for future performance. Because non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-U.S. GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/29/2024 - 07:00 PM ROCKVILLE, Md. and SUZHOU, China, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, announces that the first participant has been dosed in Australia in a first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 clinical trial of IBI3002, a global first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting Interleukin 4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This FIH study (NCT06213844) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (only in participants with asthma) of IBI3002 in healthy participants and participants with mild to moderate asthma, and to support further global clinical development of IBI3002. IBI3002 is a humanized bispecific antibody targeting cell surface IL-4Rα and the alarmin cytokine TSLP, discovered and developed by Innovent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including asthma. IL-4 receptors mediate the IL-4 signaling (both type 1 and type 2) and the IL-13 signaling (type 2). Both cytokine signaling pathways play key roles in the pathophysiology of type 2 (T2) inflammatory disorders1. TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived alarmin cytokine and triggers both T2 and non-T2 inflammation in asthma2. IBI3002 has high-efficient dual-blocking function on both IL-4Rα and TSLP. In-vitro assays have shown superiority over the marketed monoclonal antibodies to respective target. By targeting both IL-4Rα and TSLP, IBI3002 is hypothesized to have potential effect in suppressing T2 and non-T2 inflammation. The potential synergistic effect in suppressing T2 inflammation is believed to be the basis of its superior efficacy in the treatment of T2 inflammatory disorders. Dr. Lei Qian, Vice President of Clinical Development at Innovent, stated, ""In the last few decades, knowledge about both pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical phenotypes and therapeutic options for asthma have significantly increased. In particular, the introduction of biologics for severe asthma paved the way to a true revolution in the field of asthma management, by potentially allowing a precision medicine approach. Targeting specific steps of the immune-inflammatory cascade through highly selective drugs represents a true revolution in the field of severe asthma management, and brings with it the potential of achieving optimal disease control in different severe asthma inflammatory phenotypes. We are looking forward to the development of this molecule in asthma and other inflammatory diseases."" About Asthma Asthma is a heterogeneous disease driven by multiple immune cells, cytokines and inflammatory mediators, affecting all age groups. Characterized by variable symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, asthma is associated with chronic airway inflammation, reversible airflow limitation, and airway hyperresponsiveness3. According to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, about 358 million people are suffering from asthma4. Asthma can be broadly classified as eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic on the basis of airway or peripheral blood cellular profiles. Eosinophilic inflammation is driven predominantly by T2 inflammation, including T-helper cells type 2 and group 2 innate lymphoid cells5. Compared with eosinophilic asthma, non-eosinophilic asthma is poorly understood6. Up to 10% of adults and 2.5% of children with asthma have severe asthma7. Patients with severe asthma have persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations that require repetitive systemic glucocorticoid bursts or maintenance, despite adequate treatment with high-dose inhaled treatments8. In these patients, add-on treatment, which may include biologic therapies, is needed to reduce the disease burden2,3. About IBI3002 IBI3002 is a global first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting cell surface IL-4Rα and the alarmin cytokine TSLP. It has high-efficient dual-blocking function on both IL-4Rα and TSLP. In-vitro assays have shown superiority over the marketed monoclonal antibodies to respective targets. By simultaneously targeting IL-4Rα and TSLP, IBI3002 has the potential of treating several inflammatory disorders, including asthma. IL-4 is a central mediator of type 2 lymphocyte cell differentiation; it induces the production of type 2 associated cytokines such as IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, and/or type 2 related chemokines as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and eotaxins-3. IL-4 involved in B cells regulated isotype class switching to produce serum IgE, and the eosinophils recruitment through IL-5 releasement. Although IL-13 displays some redundancies in these pro-inflammatory processes, it has additional roles in mediating goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus production, smooth muscle contractility, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Together, IL-4 and IL-13 play critical roles in T2 inflammation1. TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived alarmin cytokine that occupies an upstream position in the T2 inflammation induction and Th2 cells differentiation and maturation via IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 production. TSLP is also believed to be a trigger of non-T2 inflammation in asthma 2.

The debentures will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'ATHS'. Proceeds will support general corporate purposes and capital contributions to insurance subsidiaries for organic growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $500 million in junior subordinated debentures by Athene Holding Ltd. is a noteworthy event for investors, as it reflects the company's capital raising activities and has implications for its capital structure. The fixed-rate reset feature indicates that while the initial interest rate is set at 7.250%, it may be subject to change based on predefined terms at specified intervals. This could affect the desirability of the debentures in different interest rate environments.Furthermore, the option for underwriters to purchase an additional $75 million to cover over-allotments provides flexibility and could indicate strong market demand. The intended use of proceeds for general corporate purposes and capital contributions to insurance subsidiaries suggests Athene is positioning itself for expansion and bolstering its financial health, which could be favorable for long-term growth.Listing the debentures on the NYSE enhances their liquidity, potentially making them more attractive to a broader range of investors. However, the long maturity date of 2064 introduces significant duration risk, as investors are exposed to changes in interest rates and the company's creditworthiness over a long period. Market Research Analyst The involvement of prominent financial institutions such as Wells Fargo Securities and J.P. Morgan as joint book-running managers, along with other notable firms as joint lead managers, suggests a robust underwriting process and could signal confidence in Athene's creditworthiness and market reputation.The debenture's high fixed interest rate of 7.250% may reflect current market conditions and investor expectations for higher yields amidst a potentially rising interest rate environment. This rate must be evaluated against the backdrop of the insurance industry's financial performance and the broader economic climate, which can influence investor sentiment and the success of the offering.Investors will also assess the impact of the capital infusion on Athene's leverage ratios and regulatory capital requirements, which are critical for insurance companies. The additional capital could enhance Athene's ability to underwrite new insurance policies, which is a positive indicator of organic growth potential. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering is conducted under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, which enables Athene to offer and sell securities to the public without a lengthy registration process for each issuance. This demonstrates regulatory compliance and efficient capital market access.It is important to note that the press release clearly states that the offering is not an invitation to buy and is subject to regulatory constraints, emphasizing the legal requirements surrounding securities offerings. Investors must rely on the prospectus and related prospectus supplement for detailed information, which are key documents for due diligence.The long-term nature of the debentures and the legal stipulations that govern them, such as the fixed-rate reset mechanism, will be detailed in these documents. This mechanism can affect the investment's return profile over time, which is a crucial consideration for stakeholders. 02/29/2024 - 07:13 PM WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athene Holding Ltd.

Negative None. 02/29/2024 - 06:00 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 29, 2024) - Defence Therapeutics Inc. (CSE: DTC) (OTCQB: DTCFF) (FSE: DTC) (""Defence"" or the ""Company""), one of the leading Canadian biotechnology companies working in the field of immune-oncology, is pleased to announce the publication of a peer-reviewed study on the anticancer properties of its dual Accum®-E7 vaccine, one of Defence's experimental product designed to treat established cervical cancer. The study, which was published in the prestigious journal of Cancer Science, is entitled, ""An engineered Accum®-E7 protein-based vaccine with dual anti-cervical cancer activity"", and can be directly accessed at the following address https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.16096.The human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause genital warts subsequently leading to cervical, anal, or head and neck cancers. Prophylactic HPV vaccines were therefore developed to prevent these infections and their associated complications. The most widely used of all four commercially available HPV vaccines is Gardasil-9®. However, this vaccine has challenges: it requires three doses and the vaccine manufacturing remains costly, which may be prohibitive to low-income countries. In addition, the vaccine cannot provide complete protection against all 14 high-risk HPV subtypes as it only targets 9 of them. Furthermore, the vaccine should be administered before HPV exposure implying that it cannot treat existing infections or established cervical cancer. The peer-reviewed study on Defence's Accum®-E7 anti-cancer vaccine presents an engineered Accum®-E7 protein-based vaccine capable of providing a durable memory response when used prophylactically. In addition, the selection of E7 as a target ""non-self"" antigen widened the vaccine scope of application as it can also control the growth of pre-established cervical tumors through the generation of potent cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). ""Overall, this engineered Accum®-E7 vaccine is safe, simple to engineer and manufacture making it an elixir candidate capable of providing both prophylactic and therapeutic activity against cervical cancer,"" says Dr. Rafei, the Chief Scientific Officer of Defence Therapeutics. The key highlights of the Accum®-E7 study are:Prophylactic vaccination using the Accum®-E7 vaccine confers complete protection despite multiple challenges. Accum®-E7 elicits antibodies capable of interfering with cancer cell proliferation in vitro.Therapeutic vaccination using Accum®-E7 synergises with multiple immune-checkpoint inhibitors.The therapeutic effect of Accum®-E7 relies on cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 T cells.Vaccination using Accum®-E7 is safe and immunogenic as shown in the conducted GLP study. ""This prestigious peer-reviewed publication provides an additional example of how the Accum® technology can be exploited in the development of vaccines. It also opens up a new line of investigations where Defence's more potent Accum® variants could be tested as bioconjugates to protein antigens,"" said Mr. Plouffe, Chief Executive Officer of Defence Therapeutics. In summary, our study shows that Accum®-E7: i) provides potent protection (prophylactic vaccination) and durable memory responses, ii) triggers antibodies exhibiting a non-negligible role in fighting cervical tumors, iii), controls established tumors when delivered in combination with several immune-checkpoint inhibitors (therapeutic vaccination), and iv) is relatively safe, well tolerated and immunogenic by animals even when used at higher doses (GLP study).Financing UpdateThe Company also provides an update to its previously announced non-brokered private placement of up to 1,500,000 units of the Company (each a ""Unit"") at a price of $1.50 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to $2,250,000 (the ""Offering""). Following the first tranche closing of 567,000 Units for aggregate proceeds of $850,500 on January 30th, 2024, the Company has received a 45-day extension from the Canadian Securities Exchange to complete the Offering.About Defence:Defence Therapeutics is a publicly-traded biotechnology company working on engineering the next generation vaccines and ADC products using its proprietary platform.

(TSXV: MAE) (OTC Pink: MRTMF) (""Maritime"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the Department of Industry, Energy and Technology (""IET"") of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador has approved the Closure and Development plans for the Hammerdown Gold Project (""Hammerdown"" or the ""Project""). The Project is located near the towns of King's Point and Springdale in the Baie Verte mining district. Garett Macdonald, President and CEO of Maritime, commented, ""Receiving approval of the Closure and Development plans for Hammerdown is a significant milestone for the Company and a testament to the Project's strong environmental attributes. Hammerdown is one of North America's highest grade open pit gold projects which when paired with our existing fully permitted Pine Cove mill and tailings storage facility, creates a unique opportunity in the market for strong near-term cash flow and attractive returns for our shareholders. We are very appreciative of the support we have received from the local communities, vendors, shareholders and the Province."" (1)Based on the 2022 Technical Report (as defined below) for the Project, Hammerdown contains Proven and Probable mineral reserves of 272,000 oz gold at 4.46 grams per tonne (""gpt"") including Proven reserves of 106,000 oz gold grading 5.96 gpt and Probable reserves of 166,000 oz gold grading 3.95 gpt.(2) The 2022 Technical Report showed after-tax economics of $103 million NPV (5%), an internal rate of return of 48% and All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) of US$912 per ounce at a gold price of US$1,750 per ounce.(2) Initial capital costs estimated at $75 million utilizing the Company's Nugget Pond gold plant for mineral processing.(2) With the acquisition of the Pine Cove mill facility in August 2023 the Company believes that lower capital and operating costs can be realized due to its proximity to Hammerdown and the complete gold circuit.(1)Perry Blanchard, Vice President of Environment and Sustainability of the Company adds, ""These approvals represent a positive step on our path to first production, and our regulators have been extremely collaborative in helping us get to this point. Having the process plant and tailings storage assets at Pine Cove are great additions to an already exciting story, and certainly elevates the excitement we feel about being able to move forward with the development of Hammerdown. These approvals also bring Maritime closer to providing employment and business opportunities within the region, and we are eager to engage with our local service providers in the coming months. Our team is looking forward to creating a project that minimizes the impacts on our surrounding environment and provides economic prosperity for our communities.""

Reserve Replacement Ratio of 48% and 7.6 years average reserve life. 89% of reserves located in Colombia, 11% in the United States. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The reported increase in organic incorporation of reserves by Ecopetrol is a significant indicator of the company's resource management and future production potential. A 43% increase in organic reserve incorporation suggests effective exploration and enhanced recovery efforts, which are crucial for maintaining production levels and ensuring long-term sustainability. The focus on execution capacity and improved recovery projects, as evidenced by a 4% growth in proven developed reserves, highlights Ecopetrol's strategic investments in its core areas of operation.However, the Reserve-Replacement Ratio (RRR) of 48% is notably below the industry's general benchmark of at least 100%, which indicates that the company is replacing less than half of the reserves it extracts. This could raise concerns about the company's ability to sustain production levels in the long term without additional significant discoveries or technological advancements in recovery methods. Financial Analyst The valuation of Ecopetrol's reserves at a Brent reference price of 82.80 USD/Bl, down 15.5% from the previous year, reflects sensitivity to oil price volatility. This decrease in oil prices has a direct impact on the company's financials, as it affects the economic viability of extracting certain reserves. Investors should be aware of the potential for asset write-downs if prices remain depressed or fall further. The positive net incorporation of reserves, despite a decrease in the Brent price, demonstrates the company's resilience to price fluctuations and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.It's also important to note that the majority of the reserves are located in Colombia, which may expose the company to geopolitical and regulatory risks specific to the region. Diversification in the United States could serve as a strategic hedge against these risks. Market Research Analyst The data regarding the location of Ecopetrol's reserves, with 89% in Colombia and 11% in the United States, provides insight into the company's geographic concentration and market strategy. The company's dominant position in Colombia, where it is responsible for a significant portion of hydrocarbon production, suggests a strong local market influence. However, this concentration also implies potential vulnerability to local market disruptions or regulatory changes.The extension of the company's activities into strategic basins in the American continent, including the United States, Brazil and Mexico, as well as its involvement in the power transmission business and other sectors, indicates a diversification strategy that could mitigate risks associated with the oil and gas segment and provide alternative revenue streams. 02/29/2024 - 06:36 PM An organic incorporation of +307 MBPE was achieved, that is, 43% more compared to 2022 due to management in the development fields, new projects and better prospects in enhance recovery projects.Net incorporation was positive at 119 MBPE.The Reserve-Replacement Ratio (RRR) was 48% in 2023 and remains at an average of 117% for the last 3 years.The ratio of reserves to production or average reserve life of the Ecopetrol Group is 7.6 years.89% of the reserves are located in Colombia and 11% in the United States.BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ecopetrol (BVC: ECOPETROL; NYSE: EC) reported today its proven crude oil, condensate and natural gas (1P reserves, according to the standard international denomination), which include the results of Ecopetrol S.A., its affiliates and subsidiaries, as of December 31 2023. Reserves were estimated based on the United States and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and methodology. 99% of the reserves were audited by three recognized independent specialized firms (Ryder Scott Company, DeGolyer and MacNaughton and Gaffney, Cline & Associates). At year-end 2023, the net proven reserves of the Ecopetrol Group amounted to 1,883 million barrels of oil equivalent, maintaining the average levels of the last 9 years. The 2023 reserves were valued based on a Brent reference price of 82.80 USD/Bl, a 15.5% decrease in price, as compared to a Brent of 97.95 USD/Bl in 2022. An organic incorporation of 307 MBPE was achieved in 2023, which represented a 43% increase as compared to the organic incorporation in 2022, mainly as a result of new projects, better forecasts of production fields, increased prospects for enhanced recovery, extensions and discoveries. However, the incorporation of reserves decreased by 188 MBPE, as a result of economic factors such as the fall in the Brent crude oil price and inflationary effects, as well as changes in technical conditions, mainly, water intrusion, in fields such as Ballena, Cupiagua and Recetor. The above resulted in a positive net incorporation of 119 MBPE. Additionally, during 2023, production discounted 247 MBPE. The Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR) was 48%, which includes the increase in production for the period 2023. The average reserve life was equivalent to 7.6 years. Of the 119 MBPE incorporated in 2023, 93 MBPE were the result of the better capacity for execution and implementation of improved recovery expansion projects in fields such as Chichimene, Castilla and Akacias, among others. In addition, fields such as Cano Sur and Rubiales presented positive reserve revisions due to good production performance and new drilling projects to implement in the future. In 2023, proven developed reserves grew around 4% compared to 2022, evidencing an improvement in the Company's execution capacity.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Douglas Emmett, Inc. is a significant signal to the market, indicating the company's current liquidity and profitability status. Dividends are often viewed as a reflection of a company's confidence in its ongoing cash flows and future prospects. The specified dividend of $0.19 per share equates to an annualized payout of $0.76, which investors use to calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price. This yield becomes a critical factor in the investment decision-making process, particularly for income-focused investors.It's important to analyze the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends. The industry norm for REITs is generally higher than other sectors due to their requirement to distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders. However, maintaining a balance is crucial, as excessively high payout ratios may not be sustainable in the long run and could signal that the company is not reinvesting enough in its business to foster future growth. Real Estate Market Analyst As a REIT, Douglas Emmett, Inc.'s dividend policy is closely tied to its operational performance in the real estate market. The health of the real estate market, particularly in the commercial sector where Douglas Emmett operates, directly impacts the company's rental income and, by extension, its ability to pay dividends. Factors such as occupancy rates, average lease length and the credit quality of tenants are all pivotal in assessing the sustainability of dividends.Given that Douglas Emmett operates in the competitive and high-value markets of Southern California and Honolulu, the real estate dynamics in these areas, including supply and demand, economic growth and employment rates, will influence the REIT's performance. Analysts would also consider the impact of interest rate changes on real estate investment trusts, as higher rates can increase borrowing costs and affect property values, potentially leading to a reevaluation of dividend policies if profit margins are squeezed. 02/29/2024 - 05:49 PM SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Douglas Emmett, Inc.

This can be interpreted as a strategic reserve to hedge against potential downturns or to fund future growth initiatives. The impact on the stock market will likely be positive as investors often view generous dividend payouts and financial prudence as indicators of a company's health and management's confidence in its future prospects. Market Research Analyst Ecopetrol's position as the largest company in Colombia and a key player in the American continent's energy sector is critical to understanding the broader implications of their earnings distribution. The company's diverse portfolio, including hydrocarbon production, energy transmission and international operations, provides a level of stability and potential for growth. The substantial dividend may attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for Ecopetrol's shares. Additionally, the strategic allocation to sustainability reserves underscores the company's commitment to long-term financial health and operational resilience, which can be appealing to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investors.It is important to monitor how this earnings distribution aligns with industry norms, particularly in the energy sector, where companies balance shareholder returns with reinvestment in exploration and development. Ecopetrol's strategy appears to strike this balance, which could set a precedent for similar companies in the region. The staggered payment of dividends could also provide a steady income stream for minority shareholders throughout the year, potentially increasing the attractiveness of the stock. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is highly cyclical and sensitive to global market dynamics, such as oil prices and geopolitical events. Ecopetrol's distribution of earnings, particularly the allocation to an occasional reserve for sustainability, demonstrates foresight in managing the inherent volatility of the energy market. This reserve can serve as a buffer during periods of low oil prices or unexpected operational challenges. Such strategic financial management is essential in the energy sector, where companies must balance short-term returns with the long-term capital investments necessary for exploration and infrastructure maintenance.Investors will be interested in how Ecopetrol's financial decisions, influenced by its performance in strategic basins and international ventures, reflect on the company's ability to navigate the energy transition and maintain profitability. The company's investments in transmission and telecommunications through ISA also diversify its revenue streams, which could mitigate risks associated with the core hydrocarbon business. This diversified approach may provide a competitive edge and influence investor confidence in the company's ability to sustain dividends and growth over time. 02/29/2024 - 06:06 PM BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ecopetrol S.A.

Financial Analyst The financial performance of Ecopetrol in 2023, as indicated by the reported net profit of COP 19.1 trillion and an EBITDA of COP 60.7 trillion, is noteworthy, particularly given the context of declining Brent crude oil prices and inflationary pressures. The company's ability to exceed its main financial goals amidst these challenges is indicative of effective commercial strategies and operational efficiencies. The EBITDA margin of 42% and the gross debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.7 times are critical indicators of the company's profitability and leverage, respectively. Investors will likely scrutinize these metrics to assess the company's financial health and sustainability of its debt levels. Additionally, the ROACE of 11.5% provides insight into the efficiency with which the company is using its capital to generate earnings. Energy Market Analyst The operational achievements of Ecopetrol, particularly in the hydrocarbons sector, with the highest annual production in eight years and a significant increase in volumes transported, reflect a robust response to market dynamics, such as OPEC+ production cuts. The company's strategic positioning to capitalize on increased demand and strong differentials for refined products has likely contributed to the resilience in its financial performance. The establishment of the Ecopetrol US Trading subsidiary is a strategic move to enhance the company's commercial footprint, which has already shown positive EBITDA results. The emphasis on diversification and the transition to low-emission solutions, including natural gas and renewables, aligns with global energy trends and may improve the company's long-term sustainability and investor appeal. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst Ecopetrol's commitment to environmental and social initiatives, as evidenced by its water reuse, CO2 reduction achievements and the notable decrease in environmental incidents, aligns with the growing emphasis on ESG criteria among investors. These achievements, coupled with the company's reiteration of ambitious climate goals at the COP 28 Climate Change Conference, may enhance its reputation and potentially attract ESG-focused investments. Additionally, the socio-environmental investments and the successful integration of circular economy initiatives demonstrate the company's proactive approach to sustainability. These factors could contribute to Ecopetrol's risk mitigation and long-term value creation, aspects that are increasingly relevant in investment decision-making processes. 02/29/2024 - 06:14 PM BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- We ended 2023 with strong operational results that drove achievements across the entire company. We have achieved the second-best financial results in history by following our financial planning, enhancing our traditional business, and managing the steps toward the energy transition. Throughout 2023, it's worth noting that Brent crude oil prices experienced a decline in 2023 compared to 2022, dropping from USD 99 per barrel to USD 82 per barrel. This decline can be attributed primarily to the slow economic recovery in China and an increase in non-OPEC crude oil supply. Moreover, geopolitical challenges and inflationary pressures further impacted our operational costs during this period. Nevertheless, Ecopetrol's commercial strategy capitalized on increased demand for our crude oils due to OPEC+ production cuts and limitations in Canadian crude supply. Simultaneously, differentials for our refined products remained strong compared to historical levels, allowing us to leverage the growth in our refinery capacity. In addition to this, in 2023, we achieved significant milestones: In hydrocarbons, we achieved the highest annual production figure in the last eight years (737 mboed), the highest annual volumes transported (1,113 kbd), including the highest movement through multipurpose pipeline (306 mboed) in the history of the Company, and a historical record for consolidated refining throughputs (420 mboed).In exploration, we achieved an exploratory success rate reached 50%, with Glaucus-1 standing out, confirming the offshore potential of the Colombian Caribbean in Gorgon. Additionally, the commencing drilling of the Orca Norte-1 well, 100% by Ecopetrol. In investments, we achieved a 97% execution rate for the year, the highest level in the last 8 years (COP 27.2 trillion).We closed the year with a balance of COP 20.5 trillion in the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC) and an accumulation rate lower by ~44% compared to 2022.In January 2024, we successfully issued bonds in the international market as part of the company's refinancing strategy, demonstrating strong investor appetite for our debt securities.We transferred COP 58 trillion to the Nation, marking a historical annual record.Financial results were aligned with operational dynamics and exceeded the main goals outlined in our Financial Plan. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded revenues of COP 34.8 trillion, a net profit of COP 4.2 trillion, an EBITDA of COP 12.3 trillion, and an EBITDA margin of 35%. For the full year, we achieved consolidated revenues of COP 143.1 trillion, a net profit of COP 19.1 trillion, an EBITDA of COP 60.7 trillion, and an EBITDA margin of 42%. The gross debt/EBITDA indicator stood at 1.7 times, the return on capital employed (ROACE) was 11.5%, and the cash balance was COP 14.3 trillion. The hydrocarbons business line recorded notable achievements in 2023, including declaring 11 successful wells, with three exploratory successes in the fourth quarter: Zorzal Este-1, Magnus-1, and Bisbita Centro-1. The Orca Norte-1 well, drilled in 2023 and appraised in January 2024, confirmed the presence of two gas accumulations in reservoirs other than the Orca-1 discovery, triggering a re-evaluation of the original project while expanding the gas potential of La Guajira Offshore. In terms of production, we achieved an average of 737 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboed) in 2023, reflecting a 27 mboed increase compared to 2022. Significant contributions came from the Rubiales and Caño Sur Fields in Colombia and the Permian in the United States. Notably, secondary and tertiary recovery methods accounted for approximately 41% of daily production, primarily through air and water injection in Chichimene and Castilla. In the midstream segment, total transported volumes for 2023 amounted to 1,113 thousand barrels per day (mbd), marking a 42 mbd increase compared to 2022, leveraging a historic EBITDA of the segment in 2023 of COP 11.8 trillion. This increase was primarily attributed to more significant crude oil volumes transported due to increased production in the Llanos region, enhanced refinery production, and operational optimizations in transportation systems. The downstream segment achieved a record annual throughput of 420 thousand barrels per day (kbd), alongside a gross integrated margin of 17.6 USD per barrel. This success was driven by the continuous operation of the Cartagena Crude Plants Interconnection (IPCC) and an average operational availability of 95%, the highest in the last 5 years. On the commercial front, establishing the commercial subsidiary Ecopetrol US Trading (EUST) during 4Q23 marked a significant milestone. EUST achieved an EBITDA of USD 19.5 million and sold 9.3 million barrels of crude oil and products in its inaugural quarter of operation. Additionally, our subsidiary Ecopetrol Trading Asia continued to strengthen its presence in the Asian market, with approximately 53% of our exports directed to the continent. In the low-emission solutions business line, natural gas and liquified petroleum gas (""LPG"") contributed 22% of the Group's total production during 4Q23. In renewables, we avoided emitting approximately 26,294 tons of CO2 equivalent, which were reduced through the operation of our Brisas, Castilla, and San Fernando solar parks, CENIT solar parks, and the Cantayús Small Hydroelectric Plant. As part of our commitment to incorporating non-conventional sources of renewable energy into our energy matrix, we have integrated 472 MW (under construction, operation, and execution). Additionally, in the field of energy efficiency, optimization of 3.89 PJ (thermal energy 3.37 PJ and electrical energy 0.52 PJ) was achieved, resulting in a reduction of emissions by 274 thousand tons of CO2 equivalents in the Group operations, thanks to the adoption of energy optimization technologies. In the transmission and toll roads business line, notable operational and financial achievements were recorded in 2023, contributing close to 15% (COP 9.1 trillion) to the Group's EBITDA. Several projects were awarded and commenced operations in Latin America during this period. In Chile, ISA Intervial was awarded the Orbital Sur Santiago concession with a reference CAPEX of USD 500 million (~ COP 1.9 trillion). In Peru, in consortium with Grupo Energía de Bogotá, construction projects totaling USD 833 million (~ COP 3.2 trillion) were awarded. Regarding TESG results: Concerning our commitment to the environment, around 39 million cubic meters of water were reused in operations during 4Q23, helping to alleviate pressure on water resources. Additionally, 581,532 tons of CO2 equivalent was reduced throughout the year, surpassing the established target by 40%. Moreover, there was an impressive 76% decrease in events associated with operations affecting the environment, marking the best performance in this area in the last five years. At the COP 28 Climate Change Conference in Dubai, the company reiterated its commitment to ambitious goals, such as achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (scopes 1 and 2), eliminating routine gas flaring by 2030, and striving for zero net methane emissions by 2030. Furthermore, the company was recognized by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for its advancements in measuring, reporting, and reducing methane emissions. By the end of 2023, nearly 300 initiatives were registered for the circular economy. These initiatives included 14 projects of asphalt modified with recycled plastic for use in road sections (845 tons of asphalt, equivalent to 6 million plastic bags). Likewise, a successful test of chemical recycling was implemented at the Barrancabermeja Refinery, for processing pyrolytic oil from difficult-to-recycle plastic waste to produce circular polypropylene for food packaging, among other applications. In the social dimension, in 2023, we reported the lowest occupational injury rate in our history, making us one of the top five oil companies in the world1. However, we express regret for the two fatalities in the Tesoro 29 well accident in April 2023. I appreciate the hard work and dedication of all our Ecopetrol Group subsidiaries, especially each employee who daily spares no effort to maintain safety standards and protect the integrity and lives of our employees. In terms of socio-environmental investment, approximately COP 587.4 billion was allocated to the Territorial Development Portfolio. This portfolio encompasses strategic and obligatory investments in social, environmental, and community relations, fostering economic and social progress in the country and reducing social disparities. Projects were implemented in various areas, including education, inclusive rural development, entrepreneurship, business development, and public and community infrastructure. Additionally, through the works in lieu of taxes mechanism, Ecopetrol spearheaded the execution of 46 projects totaling COP 416.8 billion in 2023. In terms of innovation and technology, the Econova Innovation network, consisting of 5 innovation centers across different regions, achieved significant milestones in 2023. These include mobilizing approximately 110 stakeholders, creating 120 job opportunities, and accelerating the development of 30 ventures focused on ICT's2, education, health and welfare, among other accomplishments. Looking ahead to 2024, we remain committed to prioritizing capital discipline, meticulously managing costs, and enhancing efficiencies to generate value for all stakeholders. Our objective is to safeguard the integrity and value of our traditional business while advancing towards portfolio diversification and a just energy transition.

About Talisker Resources Ltd. Talisker (taliskerresources.com) is a junior resource company involved in the exploration and development of gold projects in British Columbia, Canada. Talisker’s flagship asset is the high-grade, fully permitted Bralorne Gold Project where the Company is currently transitioning into underground production at the Mustang Mine. Talisker projects also include the Ladner Gold Project, an advanced stage project with significant exploration potential from an historical high-grade producing gold mine and the Spences Bridge Project where the Company holds ~85% of the emerging Spences Bridge Gold Belt, and several other early-stage Greenfields projects. Sample Preparation and QAQC Drill core at the Bralorne Gold Project is drilled in HQ to NQ size ranges (63.5mm and 47.6mm, respectively). Drill core samples are a minimum of 50 cm and a maximum of 160 cm long along the core axis. Samples are focused on an interval of interest, such as a vein or zone of mineralization. Shoulder samples bracket the interval of interest such that a total sampled core length of not less than 3m both above and below the interval of interest must be assigned. Sample QAQC measures of unmarked certified reference materials (CRMs), blanks, and duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and makeup 9% of the samples submitted to the lab for holes reported in this release. ALS Global performs sample preparation and analyses in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and SGS Canada in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes drying in an oven at a maximum temperature of 60°C, fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250 g split to at least 85% passing 75 microns (ALS code PREP-31 / SGS code PRP89). Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) of a 50g sample (ALS code Au-AA26 / SGS code GO_FAA50V10), while multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4- Acid digestion of a 0.25 g sample split with detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for 48 elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr). Gold assay technique (ALS code Au-AA26 / SGS code FAA50V10) has an upper detection limit of 100 ppm. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the gold assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish (ALS method Au-GRA22 / SGS method GO_FAG50V) which has an upper detection limit of 1,000 ppm Au. Samples where visible gold was observed are sent directly to screen metallics analysis and all samples that fire assay above 1 ppm Au are re-analysed with method (ALS code Au-SCR24 / SGS code - 6 - GO_FAS50M) which employs a 1kg pulp screened to 100 microns with assay of the entire oversize fraction and duplicate 50g assays on the undersize fraction. Where possible all samples initially sent to screen metallics processing will also be re-run through the fire assay with gravimetric finish provided there is enough material left for further processing Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking information.

The Board of Directors approved the dividend for shareholders of record on April 11, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a quarterly cash dividend by Johnson Outdoors Inc. represents a direct financial return to shareholders and is a clear indicator of the company's current financial health and management's confidence in its ability to generate cash flow. Dividends are often seen as a signal of a company's stability and maturity and they can influence investor perception and stock valuation. The specific amounts of $0.33 per Class A share and $0.30 per Class B share suggest a tiered structure, possibly reflecting different voting rights or ownership benefits associated with these share classes.Analyzing the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share, provides insight into the return on investment for shareholders. It is essential to compare this yield to industry benchmarks and historical performance to evaluate its attractiveness. Furthermore, the consistency of dividend payments and any changes in the dividend amount over time are critical factors in assessing the company's long-term financial strategy and commitment to returning value to shareholders. Market Research Analyst The outdoor recreation market has seen fluctuating demand patterns, particularly influenced by economic conditions, consumer trends and seasonal factors. Johnson Outdoors Inc.'s decision to issue dividends could be interpreted as a positive signal within the industry, potentially reflecting strong market positioning and the ability to maintain profitability amidst these variables. It's important to consider how this announcement aligns with current consumer spending behavior and competitive dynamics within the outdoor equipment and technology sector.Furthermore, the impact of such financial decisions on the company's stock market performance can be significant. Dividend announcements often lead to increased investor interest, which may result in a more active trading volume around the ex-dividend date. However, the long-term stock performance will largely depend on the company's ability to sustain and grow its dividend payouts in line with its financial performance and market conditions. 02/29/2024 - 06:00 PM RACINE, Wisc., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Johnson Outdoors Inc.

Financial Analyst The pricing of Safehold Inc.'s $300 million senior notes offering with a 6.100% interest rate, maturing in 2034, represents a significant capital market transaction for the company. The effective yield to maturity of 6.240%, discounted from the public offering price, is a critical figure for investors as it indicates the true return expected from the investment, accounting for the price discount. The guarantee by Safehold further underscores the company's commitment to the debt, potentially reducing the risk perceived by investors.It is noteworthy that the company has recently realized a cash settlement gain from terminated hedges, which it expects will lower the effective yield to maturity to approximately 5.32%. This gain could be seen as a strategic financial management move, which might positively influence investor sentiment by demonstrating the company's ability to manage its financial instruments effectively. However, investors should consider the impact of this gain on the company's overall risk profile, as hedging often serves as a protection against market volatility. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Safehold Inc. regarding the use of proceeds to repay borrowings under its 2021 unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including investment in ground leases, indicates a strategic deployment of capital aimed at strengthening the company's balance sheet and investing in growth. This move could be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, suggesting a proactive approach to debt management and an investment strategy focused on core business operations.Furthermore, the involvement of prominent financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as joint book-running managers adds credibility to the offering and could potentially attract a broad base of institutional investors.

The Company projects corporate administration costs to decrease further in 2024 now that it is exclusively focused on the Goldboro Project. The depreciation charge of $275,977 during 2023 reflects the amortization of the Company's corporate office space.Finance expense in 2023 was $4,856,364, a significant increase compared to 2022 primarily due to interest and deferred financing fees relating to the senior secured credit facility with Nebari Resources, whereby the Company drew down US$16.0 million in February of 2023 (the ""Nebari Credit Facility""), and costs associated with the subsequent amendment to the Nebari Credit Facility.The Company recognized a loss on the revaluation of investments of $1,090,167 relating to its investment in Novamera, compared to a gain of $326,973 in the prior year, based on valuations from recent Novamera funding initiatives. The Company recognized a loss on its equity investment in Magna Terra Minerals Inc. of $56,113 in 2023, compared to $1,078,900 in the prior year when it took an impairment of $984,442 on its investment.Other income during 2023 was $1,201,327 compared to $261,939 in the prior year, primarily driven by a foreign exchange gain of $569,780, and a recovery of $538,808 as a deferred premium on flow through common shares.The net loss from discontinued operations during the year was $875,858, driven primarily by the transition of Point Rousse into care and maintenance and the resulting impairment charge of $2,075,072 and care and maintenance costs of $1,009,056, which were partially offset by revenue from final metal sales. The comparative loss of $3,115,957 in 2022 was primarily driven by severance charges and significantly higher depletion and depreciation related to the wind down of operations at Point Rousse.Net comprehensive loss for 2023, was $15,880,379, or $0.07 per share, compared to $11,677,264, or $0.06 per share, for 2022. The increase in net loss was predominantly related to higher finance expenses related to the Credit Facility and the extinguished Auramet promissory note and an increased deferred tax expense relating to ongoing exploration activity at the Goldboro Project, partially offset by the increase in other income and the lower net loss from discontinued operations at Point Rousse.Financial Position and Cash Flow AnalysisAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of $8,293,302, which includes a cash balance of $9,851,672.(In $) December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 9,851,672 Other current assets 432,111 Current assets 10,283,783 Trade and other payables 1,314,544 Current portion of loans and other current liabilities 675,937 Current liabilities 1,990,481 Working capital (deficit)* 8,293,302 *Refer to Non-IFRS Measures section below.The cash balance throughout 2023 reflected the drawdown of the Credit Facility with Nebari and private placements completed in June 2023 and December 2023 for gross proceeds of $6,688,800 and $5,020,070 respectively, offset by ongoing development and exploration costs for the Goldboro Project and the repayment of the US$8,000,000 Promissory Note with Auramet (which accounts for the reduction in the current portion of loans). The reduction of inventory reflects the disposition of Point Rousse, which also accounts for the reduction in trade and other payables from December 31, 2022.Signal Gold's cash flow used in operating activities from continuing operations was $3,654,541 during the year ended December 31, 2023, relating predominantly to corporate administration costs and changes to working capital.

(NYSE: EGP) reports strong occupancy and leasing trends in 2024. The portfolio is 97.9% leased and 97.6% occupied. Rental rates have increased significantly, with forward equity sale agreements in place for additional proceeds. Positive High occupancy and leasing rates in 2024 Significant increase in rental rates on new and renewal leases Forward equity sale agreements for additional proceeds Negative None. Market Research Analyst EastGroup Properties' announcement of a high occupancy rate, at 97.9% leased and 97.6% occupied, is a strong indicator of demand for their commercial real estate assets. The substantial increase in rental rates, 57.0% on a straight-line basis and 38.4% on a cash basis, suggests the company has significant pricing power in the current market. This could imply that EastGroup is operating in a favorable leasing environment where tenants are willing to pay a premium for space, which may be due to a combination of limited supply and high demand for commercial properties in the regions they operate.The forward equity sale agreements for approximately $59.6 million at an average price of $182.28 per share provide the company with a mechanism to raise capital without immediate dilution of current shareholders. This forward sale is an innovative financial tool that allows EastGroup to lock in capital at a fixed price, hedging against potential stock price volatility. It also indicates management's confidence in the company's value and their strategic approach to capital financing. Financial Analyst The reported increase in rental rates and high occupancy levels are likely to have a positive impact on EastGroup's revenue and earnings in the short to medium term. Investors will be interested in how these rates compare to industry averages and whether they are sustainable in the long term. The forward equity sale agreements are a proactive approach to capital management, ensuring that EastGroup has the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities or strengthen its balance sheet as necessary. The timing of these agreements, with settlement periods extending into early 2025, provides insight into management's expectations for the company's cash flow needs and market conditions.It's important to note the potential impact on the stock's liquidity and future earnings per share, as the settlement of the forward sale agreements will eventually lead to the issuance of new shares. However, the current high occupancy and leasing rates could mitigate any potential dilutive effect if they translate into proportionately higher earnings. Real Estate Industry Analyst The details provided by EastGroup Properties reflect a robust commercial real estate market, particularly within their portfolio. The significant increases in rental rates on new and renewal leases signal a competitive edge and could be indicative of the quality and location of their properties. For stakeholders, the focus will be on whether EastGroup can maintain these occupancy and leasing trends, as they are critical for stable and growing dividend payouts, a key consideration for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors.Moreover, the presentation at the Citi 2024 Global Property CEO Conference could provide further insights into the company's strategic direction and how it plans to navigate the real estate market amid economic uncertainties. Any forward-looking statements made during this conference will be closely analyzed for their potential impact on investor sentiment and the company's valuation. 02/29/2024 - 05:46 PM JACKSON, Miss., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EastGroup Properties, Inc.

Middlesex Water Announces 2023 Year End Results,2024-02-29T22:45:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Middlesex Water Company (MSEX) reported financial results for 2023, with operating revenues increasing to $166.3 million.

Factors affecting revenues included rate increases and additional revenues. Operating expenses also rose, impacting net income which decreased to $31.5 million. The company's CEO highlighted investments in infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and dividend increases. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Middlesex Water Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, reveal a mixed financial performance. The increase in consolidated operating revenues, primarily due to the base rate case increase and additional revenues through the Purchase Water Adjustment Clause rate, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to adjust pricing in response to cost pressures. However, this is tempered by a decrease in the Tidewater System revenues and only marginal increases in other areas.Significantly, the increase in operation and maintenance expenses, driven by higher production costs and labor, has outpaced revenue growth, compressing margins. The $5.2 million gain from the sale of a subsidiary in the previous year skews the year-over-year net income comparison, resulting in a stark decrease in net income for 2023. This could potentially concern investors about the company's profitability trajectory, despite the one-time nature of the previous year's gain.From a shareholder perspective, the decline in earnings per share (EPS) from $2.39 to $1.76 is notable. As EPS is a key metric for evaluating a company's profitability on a per-share basis, this decline could influence investor sentiment and impact the stock's performance. However, the company's long history of paying dividends, including the recent 4.0% increase, may provide some reassurance about its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Market Research Analyst Examining Middlesex Water Company's performance within the utilities sector, the business's focus on infrastructure investment aligns with broader industry trends prioritizing water quality, reliability and regulatory compliance. This strategic emphasis is crucial for long-term sustainability and competitive positioning, particularly as environmental standards become more stringent and consumer awareness around water quality increases.Furthermore, the settlement of litigation and the recovery of costs associated with treatment upgrades is a positive development, as it reduces legal uncertainty and potentially improves financial stability. However, the utility industry is capital-intensive and Middlesex's increased expenditures on tangible property repairs, though beneficial for tax purposes, reflect ongoing challenges in managing aging infrastructure and the associated costs.The announcement of a new President and CEO could signal a strategic shift or continuity in corporate direction. Leadership transitions are closely monitored by the market for indications of potential changes in business strategy, operational efficiency and shareholder value creation. Economist The financial results of Middlesex Water Company must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The utility sector is generally less sensitive to economic cycles due to the essential nature of its services. However, cost pressures from higher chemical prices and labor costs reflect inflationary trends that can affect operational efficiency and profitability.The company's ability to implement rate increases, such as those seen in the Middlesex and Pinelands Systems, is indicative of a regulatory environment that allows for the pass-through of certain costs to consumers. This is critical for utilities to maintain capital for infrastructure investments without compromising financial health. Nevertheless, the rate reduction ordered by the Delaware Public Service Commission highlights the regulatory risks that can impact revenue.While the company's dividend increase is a sign of confidence in its financial health, it must be balanced against the backdrop of declining net income. The sustainability of such dividend policies will depend on the company's ability to manage expenses and continue generating sufficient cash flow in a potentially tightening economic climate. 02/29/2024 - 05:45 PM ISELIN, N.J., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlesex Water Company (“Middlesex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MSEX) today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 OPERATING RESULTS Consolidated operating revenues increased to $166.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, up $3.8 million from 2022. Factors affecting operating revenues were: A net $4.2 million increase in our Middlesex System revenues due to the implementation of the final phase of the 2021 base rate case increase on January 1, 2023 and additional revenues through the Purchase Water Adjustment Clause rate;A net decrease of $0.9 million in our Tidewater System revenues related to lower customer connection fees and lower weather driven customer demand along with a Delaware Public Service Commission ordered rate reduction in September 2022;A $0.2 million increase in the Pinelands System in New Jersey due to the implementation of a base rate increase effective April 15, 2023; andA $0.3 increase in non-regulated operations revenues due to higher supplemental contract services. Operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased to $83.1 million, up $4.0 million from the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher variable production costs due to weather-driven changes in water quality, higher chemical prices and increased labor costs. Lower weather-related main break activity in our Middlesex System offset some of these increased expenses. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $2.2 million from the same period in 2022 due to a higher level of utility plant in service. Middlesex recognized a $5.2 million gain on the sale of its regulated Delaware wastewater subsidiary in January 2022. Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $2.2 million from the same period in 2022 due to greater income tax benefits associated with the increased repair expenditures on tangible property in the Middlesex system. As a result, net income for the year decreased $10.9 million to $31.5 million, compared to $42.4 million in 2022. Earnings applicable to common stock for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $31.4 million, or $1.76 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $42.3 million or $2.39 per diluted share for the same period in 2022. “Throughout 2023, we continued to invest in our infrastructure to ensure drinking water quality, enhance reliability and resiliency, secure our facilities, and protect consumers from lead in their service lines. We also maintained compliance with regulatory requirements with the completion of new treatment capability at our New Jersey wellfield facility,” said Middlesex Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis W. Doll. “In addition, we settled litigation to recover costs associated with these treatment upgrades which has been reflected in the recent settlement of the Middlesex base rate case, originally filed in May 2023. Your Board of Directors increased the dividend by 4.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases. Management executed numerous financings and further enhanced our emergency management and cybersecurity processes. As we welcomed the new year, we also welcome the Company’s previously announced new President and CEO, Nadine Leslie, who takes the helm March 1st and who will further build upon our Company’s commitment of engaging our employees with meaningful work, providing quality service to our customers and delivering value to shareholders,” added Doll. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND DECLARED As previously announced in January 2024, the Board of Directors of Middlesex Water Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.325 per common share payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share by Virginia National Bankshares Corporation offers a tangible return to shareholders and the stated annual yield of 4.42% is a critical figure for income-focused investors. This yield is particularly attractive if it exceeds the average dividend yield of the banking sector and the broader market. It's important to compare this yield to the risk-free rate, such as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities, to assess the risk premium offered by the bank's shares.Investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A sustainable payout ratio suggests the dividend is well-covered by earnings, reducing the risk of a cut in the future. However, a high payout ratio could indicate limited room for future dividend growth or reinvestment in the company's operations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, dividend announcements can influence investor sentiment and stock price. The consistency of dividend payments and any changes in the dividend amount can signal the company's financial health and management's confidence in future cash flows. A stable or increasing dividend may attract income investors and could lead to a more favorable view of the stock, potentially supporting its price.However, it is also essential to consider the broader economic context, including interest rate trends and economic growth prospects, which can impact the attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, for example, high-dividend stocks can become more sought after, as they offer better yields than many fixed-income investments. 02/29/2024 - 05:50 PM CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Virginia National Bankshares Corporation (the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: VABK) announced today that on February 28, 2024 its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share to be paid on March 28, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 14, 2024.

The distribution sources include 97% from net investment income, 3% from net realized short-term capital gains, and 0% from net realized long-term capital gains or return of capital.

The distribution sources include 97% from net investment income, 3% from net realized short-term capital gains, and 0% from net realized long-term capital gains or return of capital. The fund's average annual total return for the past 5 years was 4.15%, with an annualized current distribution rate of 7.98% of NAV as of January 31, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by John Hancock Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (HTD) regarding its monthly distribution is a key piece of information for investors and stakeholders. The distribution of $0.1380 per share, primarily derived from net investment income (97% of the current distribution), suggests a stable source of earnings. It is noteworthy that the bulk of the distribution is not coming from capital gains or return of capital, which can be seen as a positive indicator of the Fund's operational performance.Furthermore, the Fund's average annual total return of 4.15% over the past five years, juxtaposed with the annualized current distribution rate of 7.98% of NAV, could raise questions about the sustainability of the distribution rate. Investors should be mindful of the fact that a distribution rate higher than the total return could potentially lead to a depletion of assets over time unless the Fund can increase its earnings or realize additional capital gains. Tax Expert From a tax perspective, the structure of the distributions is crucial. The fact that the Fund is tax-advantaged means that the dividends it pays may be subject to more favorable tax treatment compared to ordinary income. This is particularly appealing to income-focused investors, especially those in higher tax brackets. The Fund's strategy to maximize tax-advantaged income by avoiding returns of capital also helps preserve the Fund's capital base, which is a significant consideration for long-term growth and sustainability. Investment Strategist Examining the Fund's cumulative total return of 11.54% for the fiscal year relative to NAV and the distribution rate of 2.66% for the same period, provides a broader context for the Fund's performance. It's important to compare these figures with broader market indices and similar investment vehicles to gauge performance. While the cumulative fiscal year-to-date distribution rate is in line with what might be expected, the annualized distribution rate is notably high, which could attract income-seeking investors but also warrants a closer look at the Fund's ability to maintain such payouts without eroding the principal over time. 02/29/2024 - 05:28 PM BOSTON, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - John Hancock Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (NYSE: HTD) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund managed by John Hancock Investment Management LLC and subadvised by Manulife Investment Management (US) LLC, announced today sources of its monthly distribution of $0.1380 per share paid to all shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan.

Spectral AI highlights first quarter momentum and key milestones in commercialization of AI-powered wound care technology. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The appointment of Peter M. Carlson as CEO of Spectral AI represents a strategic move for the company as it transitions from R&D to the commercialization phase of its AI-powered DeepView device. Carlson's proven track record in operating and financial leadership, especially his experience with premier wound care management companies, is expected to drive growth and enhance shareholder value. The announcement of preliminary R&D revenue of $18 million for 2023 and the reaffirmation of the $28 million revenue guidance for 2024 signal confidence in the company's financial trajectory. The market will likely react to this news by scrutinizing the company's ability to meet these projections, especially considering the potential revenue streams from the recent BARDA award and regulatory progress in the UK and the US. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the transition of Wensheng Fan to Chief Innovation Strategist and Senior Advisor is noteworthy as it suggests a continued commitment to innovation within Spectral AI. The preliminary revenue and the company's focus on commercializing AI-driven technology for wound care, specifically for burns and diabetic foot ulcers, highlight the potential impact of Spectral AI's technology on the medical diagnostics industry. The validation of DeepView AI® for burn size and healing assessment and its FDA marketing authorization targeted for late 2025, will be critical milestones to watch. These developments could significantly advance the standard of care in wound management and provide non-dilutive funding to further fuel research and development efforts. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market implications, Spectral AI's advancements in predictive clinical insight technology could disrupt the wound care market. The company's milestones, such as the UKCA authorization and the enrollment of the first patient in a pivotal study, indicate a strong first-quarter momentum with potential for substantial market penetration. The strategic realignment of executive roles, with a focus on operational and financial stability, suggests a calculated approach to scaling up and capturing market share. Investors and competitors alike will be interested in how Spectral AI's technology will compete with existing wound care solutions and how quickly it can secure a significant portion of the market, especially in the burn and diabetic foot ulcer segments. 02/29/2024 - 05:30 PM Appointment Paves the Way for Company’s Next Chapter in Commercialization Phase of AI-Powered DeepView Device for Predictive Wound Care Carlson Brings Proven Track Record of Operating and Financial Leadership, Including with Premier Wound Care Management Companies Wensheng Fan Transitions to Chief Innovation Strategist and Senior Advisor to the CEO Company Announces Preliminary 2023 R&D Revenue; Reaffirms Full Year Revenue Guidance for 2024 and Highlights First Quarter Momentum DALLAS, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spectral AI, Inc.

Veris Residential Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-02-29T22:26:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Veris Residential, Inc. (NYSE: VRE) declares a cash dividend of $0.0525 per share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on April 16, 2024. The dividend is subject to approval by the Board of Directors based on various financial factors.","Veris Residential Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Veris Residential, Inc. (NYSE: VRE) declares a cash dividend of $0.0525 per share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on April 16, 2024. The dividend is subject to approval by the Board of Directors based on various financial factors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Veris Residential, Inc. of a cash dividend of $0.0525 per share is a tangible return to shareholders and indicates the company's current liquidity and profit distribution policy. It's essential to assess the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. This metric provides insight into the attractiveness of the stock to income-focused investors relative to other investment opportunities.Additionally, the sustainability of dividends is critical. The reference to Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) suggests that the company is focused on a metric often used in the real estate industry to measure the cash flow generated. AFFO is a superior indicator of the REIT's financial performance compared to simple net income, as it adjusts for depreciation and other non-cash items, providing a clearer picture of the cash available to be distributed as dividends.The Board's consideration of factors such as AFFO, cash flows, taxable income and capital requirements indicates a balanced approach to dividend policy, which is crucial for maintaining financial flexibility while rewarding shareholders. Real Estate Market Analyst Veris Residential's focus on Class A multifamily properties is significant. Class A properties represent the highest quality buildings in their market and area. They are generally newer properties with top amenities and command the highest rents. The demand for Class A multifamily units can be a bellwether for the health of the broader real estate market and the economy, as they cater to higher-income tenants whose financial well-being is often correlated with economic conditions.The declaration of a dividend also reflects the company's operational success and the health of the multifamily real estate sector, especially in the context of environmental and social governance (ESG) factors. As a REIT with a forward-thinking, environmentally and socially conscious mandate, Veris Residential may appeal to an increasing segment of investors who prioritize ESG factors in their investment decisions. This could potentially enhance the company's stock market performance and investor base diversification. Tax Expert For shareholders, the dividend's tax implications are an important consideration. Dividends from REITs are often taxed at the ordinary income rate rather than the lower qualified dividend rate, which applies to dividends from many other types of corporations. However, part of the dividends may be classified as a return of capital or capital gains, which can have different tax consequences.Investors must also consider the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) options, if available, which allow shareholders to reinvest their dividends into additional shares of the company, potentially compounding their investment over time. The company's estimation of taxable income and related distribution requirements are essential for maintaining its status as a REIT, which requires the distribution of at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. 02/29/2024 - 05:26 PM JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Veris Residential, Inc. (NYSE: VRE) (""Veris Residential"" or the ""Company""), a forward-thinking, environmentally and socially conscious REIT that primarily owns, operates, acquires and develops Class A multifamily properties, today announced that the Company`s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend on its common stock for the first quarter 2024 in the amount of $0.0525 for the period ending March 31, 2024. The dividend will be paid on April 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of April 3, 2024. The timing and amount of future dividends is subject to approval by the Board of Directors taking into consideration multiple factors including but not limited to the Company`s AFFO and actual cash flows from operations, its estimate of taxable income and related distribution requirements as well as any capital requirements. About Veris Residential, Inc. Veris Residential, Inc. is a forward-thinking, environmentally and socially conscious real estate investment trust (REIT) that primarily owns, operates, acquires, and develops holistically inspired, Class A multifamily properties that meet the sustainability-conscious lifestyle needs of today's residents while seeking to positively impact the communities it serves and the planet at large. The company is guided by an experienced management team and Board of Directors and is underpinned by leading corporate governance principles, a best-in-class and sustainable approach to operations, and an inclusive culture based on equality and meritocratic empowerment.

(TSXV: ENA) (""Enablence"" or the ""Company""), a supplier of optical components and subsystems, has filed its unaudited financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (""Q2 2024"") and related management's discussion and analysis and certifications (collectively, the ""Financial Statements""). Electronic copies of the Financial Statements are available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) under Enablence's issuer profile. ""As the industry exits a cyclical downturn, we are seeing our strategic efforts to diversify gain traction,"" commented Todd Haugen, CEO of Enablence Technologies. ""53% of Q2 revenues were attributed to advanced vision and AI products and services. Given this increased diversification, visibility of customer contracts, and a growing sales pipeline we will be able to give guidance on key financial metrics starting in fiscal 2025.""""This fiscal year, several new products were released in LiDAR and Datacoms, including the latest generation 400G products,"" noted Haugen.

""Lastly, our new AI products are in customer verification and on track for Q4 volume production,"" added Haugen. ""With this slate of products on the horizon, we anticipate a strong fiscal year 2025 powered by new AI and advanced vision product lines. In March, at the industry's annual OFC Conference in San Diego, I will join other industry panelists to talk about AI revenue growth opportunities for the industry as interest in AI accelerates."" For the three months ending December 31, 2023, revenue decreased 19% to $340 versus $422 during the corresponding quarter in 2022 due primarily to the cyclical nature of the optical semiconductor market. NRE revenues declined to $154 or 43% from $272 during the corresponding quarter in 2022. This year saw a drop in NRE revenue for the quarter as some key customer NRE projects in the previous year had been completed. Gross margin for the quarter was ($534) as compared to ($338) for the same period in the prior year, a decline of ($196), or (58%). The decline is due primarily to increased investment in wafer fabrication in support of a ramp-up in wafer production as well as work-in-progress inventory. Early investment was necessary to counter any risks to capacity constraints for the pipeline opportunities.As the Company ramped up its staff, R&D, and production capacity, the Company recognized a net loss of $4,231 during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to a net loss of $2,066 for the same period in the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to the cyclical drop in revenues matched with increased operating expenses, interest costs, and foreign currency translation loss. ""With the investments in R&D, sales specialists, and overall sales and marketing, the higher operating costs for this quarter are translating into increased sales pipeline development and better alignment to target customer requirements, which ultimately is positioning Enablence for growth,"" said Stan Besko, CFO of Enablence Technologies.

The distribution breakdown includes net investment income, short and long-term capital gains, and return of capital. The Fund's average annual total return for the past 5 years is 4.14%.","JOHN HANCOCK PREMIUM DIVIDEND FUND NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS - SOURCES OF DISTRIBUTION UNDER SECTION 19(a) Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary John Hancock Premium Dividend Fund (PDT) announces monthly distribution of $0.0825 per share for February 2024. The distribution breakdown includes net investment income, short and long-term capital gains, and return of capital. The Fund's average annual total return for the past 5 years is 4.14%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of the John Hancock Premium Dividend Fund's monthly distribution provides insight into the fund's current income-generating capabilities. With 94% of the distribution derived from net investment income and the remaining 6% from return of capital, the fund is primarily relying on the income it earns from its investments, rather than capital gains or returning investor's principal. This can be indicative of a conservative investment strategy focused on income-generating assets such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks.The annualized current distribution rate of 8.43% relative to the Net Asset Value (NAV) as of January 31, 2024, appears attractive, but it's essential to consider the sustainability of such payouts. A high distribution rate can sometimes signal that the fund is paying out more than it earns, which can lead to a reduction in NAV over time. Investors should analyze the fund's underlying assets and performance to assess the long-term viability of the distributions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the average annual total return of 4.14% over the past five years, in conjunction with the 13.60% cumulative total return for the fiscal year to date, suggests that the fund has been performing reasonably well in the current market environment. This performance may attract income-focused investors who are looking for steady distributions in a potentially volatile market.However, it's important to note that a significant portion of the distribution is classified as a return of capital. This could indicate that some of the payouts are not solely from the fund's earnings. While this isn't inherently negative, it's crucial for investors to understand that a return of capital decreases the fund's NAV and can potentially reduce the fund's ability to generate similar yields in the future. Tax Advisor For shareholders, understanding the composition of the fund's distribution is crucial for tax planning. The distinction between net investment income and return of capital has significant tax implications. Investment income is typically taxed at ordinary income rates, whereas return of capital is not taxed immediately but reduces the shareholder's cost basis in the investment. This can lead to a larger capital gain or a smaller capital loss when the shares are eventually sold. Shareholders should consult with tax professionals to understand the impact of these distributions on their individual tax situations. 02/29/2024 - 05:30 PM BOSTON, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - John Hancock Premium Dividend Fund (NYSE: PDT) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund managed by John Hancock Investment Management LLC and subadvised by Manulife Investment Management (US) LLC, announced today sources of its monthly distribution of $0.0825 per share paid to all shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan.

LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- inTEST Corporation (NYSE American: INTT), a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets which include automotive/EV, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security, and semiconductor (“semi”), announced today that it will reschedule its fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release and investor conference call, which was previously scheduled for March 1, 2024. The Company requires additional time to complete the year-end audit and review process. The Company expects to report its results coincident with, or prior to, the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Preliminary, Unaudited Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenue was approximately $28.4 million with net earnings of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Cash generated from operations in the fourth quarter was $4.7 million. Orders in the fourth quarter were $27.5 million. First Quarter and Full Year 2024 Guidance Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $30 million with gross margin of approximately 46%. First quarter 2024 earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.13. Revenue for full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million. The foregoing guidance is based on management’s current views with respect to operating and market conditions and customers’ forecasts. It also assumes macroeconomic conditions remain unchanged through the end of the year and does not consider any extraordinary non-operating expenses that may occur from time to time. Actual results may differ materially from what is provided here today because of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. About inTEST Corporation inTEST Corporation is a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets including automotive/EV, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, and security, as well as both the front-end and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing industry.

Key Performance Indicators Management uses orders as a key performance metric to analyze and measure the Company’s financial performance and results of operations. Management uses orders as a measure of current and future business and financial performance, and these may not be comparable with measures provided by other companies. Orders represent written communications received from customers requesting the Company to provide products and/or services. Management believes tracking orders is useful as it often is a leading indicator of future performance. In accordance with industry practice, contracts may include provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer. Given that orders is an operational measure and that the Company's methodology for calculating orders does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a quantitative reconciliation for it is not required or provided.

The company aims to drive sustainable growth through near- and mid-term catalysts, focusing on core scientific modalities and key cancer types. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The strategic vision presented by Pfizer post-acquisition of Seagen underscores the potential impact on patient care within oncology. The focus on three core scientific modalities—small molecules, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and bispecific antibodies—highlights the commitment to advancing treatment options. ADCs, for instance, are a rapidly evolving class of therapeutics that combine the specificity of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs, potentially offering more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients. The mention of a next-generation ADC platform suggests significant advancements in targeting and payload delivery, which could revolutionize treatment protocols and outcomes for cancers such as urothelial cancer and multiple myeloma. Market Research Analyst Pfizer's announcement regarding its oncology pipeline's potential to deliver 8+ blockbuster medicines by 2030 is a strong indicator of its growth trajectory in the biopharmaceutical sector. Blockbusters, typically defined as drugs generating annual sales of over $1 billion, can significantly influence a company's market share and investor confidence. The projected increase in biologics' contribution to oncology revenues from 6% to approximately 65% reflects a strategic shift towards more advanced, biologically-derived treatments, which are often associated with higher pricing power and margins. Investors should monitor the progression of the seven anticipated Phase 3 readouts and the six anticipated Phase 3 study starts, as these are pivotal in determining the clinical and commercial viability of the pipeline. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the integration of Seagen's portfolio and the outlined strategic vision are poised to be significant drivers of Pfizer's long-term growth. The focus on near- and mid-term catalysts, such as recent priority indication launches and anticipated Phase 3 readouts, suggests a robust strategy to maintain momentum in revenue generation. The long-term outlook, with a projected 8 or more potential blockbusters, indicates an expectation of sustained sales growth. However, it is important to consider the substantial R&D and marketing investments required to bring these products to market and the risks inherent in clinical trials and regulatory approvals. 02/29/2024 - 05:40 PM Company unveils new innovative Oncology organization, strategic vision and approach, following the Seagen acquisition in late 2023 Robust portfolio and R&D engine with 8+ potential blockbuster medicines by 2030 Multiple near- and mid-term catalysts expected to help drive long-term sustainable growth NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- At a meeting with the investment community today, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) outlined its strategic priorities for the newly formed Oncology organization — and how its deep and diverse pipeline, industry-leading Oncology expertise, and anticipated near- and mid-term catalysts are expected to position the company to deliver strong growth and shareholder value. A replay of the webcast and related materials, including the presentations and a summary and transcript, will be made available on the Pfizer investor relations website at www.pfizer.com/investors. “With the completion of the Seagen acquisition in 2023, Pfizer has significantly expanded its Oncology organization to amplify its efforts to advance new standards of care and improve outcomes for patients,” said Chris Boshoff, Chief Oncology Officer and Executive Vice President, Pfizer. “With the energy of our highly talented colleagues, the tremendous potential of our pipeline and scientific engine, and scale of the Pfizer enterprise, we believe we are poised to deliver on our vision of accelerating breakthroughs that help people with cancer globally live better and longer lives.” Boshoff continued, “We have a clear strategy focused on three core scientific modalities and four main types of cancer, where we have the deep expertise and knowledge to advance our leadership. With many significant catalysts expected through the first half of 2025 and beyond, our Oncology organization is well-positioned to be a critical driver of potential long-term sustainable sales and profit growth for Pfizer through the end of the decade.” During the event, Chris Boshoff and members of the Pfizer Oncology leadership team highlighted the company’s expanded capabilities and portfolio following the completion of the acquisition of Seagen in December 2023. Pfizer Oncology is focused on expanding its leadership in four main cancer types: breast cancer, including three main hormonal subtypes; genitourinary cancer, including prostate and urothelial cancers; hematology-oncology, including multiple myeloma and lymphomas, such as Hodgkin’s disease; and thoracic cancers, which includes lung and head and neck cancers. Pfizer’s Oncology portfolio is focused on three core scientific modalities: small molecules, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific antibodies, including other immuno-oncology biologics. The company is progressing a next-generation ADC platform aimed at novel targets and improved, differentiated payloads, as well as investigational advanced biologics and novel combinations of medicines. The company outlined potential significant catalysts anticipated through the first half of 2025, including: Continued focus on four recent priority indication launches, including PADCEV® (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) in combination with pembrolizumab in locally advanced / metastatic urothelial cancer; XTANDI® (enzalutamide) in nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high-risk for metastasis; TALZENNA® (talazoparib) in combination with XTANDI in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); and ELREXFIO™ (elranatamab-bcmm) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy. Seven anticipated Phase 3 readouts, including results for vepdegestrant in second-line estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer (ER+ mBC) (VERITAC-2), BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) in first-line BRAF+ metastatic colorectal cancer (BREAKWATER), sasanlimab in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (CREST), and ELREXFIO in double-class exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MagnetisMM-5). Six anticipated Phase 3 study starts, which includes three new trials recently initiated for key pipeline assets: atirmociclib (CDK4i) in second-line hormone receptor positive (HR+) mBC, sigvotatug vedotin (B6A; integrin beta-6 (IB6)-directed ADC) in second/third-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ELREXFIO in patients with multiple myeloma after their cancer progresses on anti-CD38 treatment (MagnetisMM-32 trial). Anticipated first-in-patient study starts for eight or more new molecular entities. During the meeting, Pfizer also shared new or updated clinical data from various pipeline programs, including atirmociclib, ELREXFIO, felmetatug vedotin (B7H4 ADC), mevrometostat (EZH2i), PD-L1 ADC (PF-08046054), and sigvatutag vedotin. Through its strategy, by 2030, the company anticipates 8 or more potential blockbusters and expects biologics to contribute approximately 65% of Oncology revenues, compared to approximately 6% in 2023.

Inc., is developing a 5-megawatt hydrogen production project in California's Central Valley. The project aims to create lower carbon energy using solar power and non-potable produced water. The facility will produce two tons of low carbon intensity (LCI) hydrogen per day, supporting an expanding hydrogen refueling network. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The development of a 5-megawatt hydrogen production project by Chevron New Energies signifies a strategic move within the energy sector. This initiative aligns with the broader industry trend of traditional oil and gas companies diversifying their energy portfolios to include renewable and lower carbon sources. By utilizing low carbon intensity electrolytic hydrogen, Chevron is positioning itself within the emerging hydrogen economy, which is anticipated to play a crucial role in the energy transition.From a financial perspective, the investment in hydrogen production could offer Chevron a competitive advantage as demand for cleaner energy solutions rises. Hydrogen, particularly when produced through electrolysis powered by renewable sources like solar, holds promise for significant emission reductions in sectors that are hard to electrify, such as heavy industry and transportation. The market for hydrogen as a transport fuel is nascent but growing and Chevron's entry could stimulate further development of the infrastructure needed for a hydrogen refueling network. Environmental Impact Analyst The environmental implications of Chevron's project are substantial, particularly in the context of California's stringent climate policies and goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Producing hydrogen using non-potable produced water from Chevron’s oil fields is an innovative approach to resource utilization that minimizes the project's environmental footprint. By using land and resources Chevron already possesses, the project mitigates the need for additional land use and water consumption, which are common environmental concerns associated with new energy projects.However, it is important to scrutinize the actual carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced. The term 'low carbon intensity' suggests a significant reduction in emissions compared to traditional hydrogen production methods, such as steam methane reforming, but the exact figures and lifecycle analysis would be crucial for stakeholders to assess the project's true environmental benefits. Renewable Energy Expert Electrolysis is a process that has garnered attention in the renewable energy space because of its potential to produce green hydrogen when powered by renewable electricity. Chevron's use of solar power to fuel the electrolysis process is a clear commitment to sustainable energy practices. The scale of the project, at 5 megawatts, is relatively modest compared to some of the larger-scale hydrogen projects globally, which suggests a strategic, incremental approach to scaling up hydrogen production capabilities.It is also worth noting that while the production of two tons of hydrogen per day may contribute to the local hydrogen economy, the impact on Chevron's overall business and the global hydrogen market will depend on the pace of expansion and the adoption of hydrogen technologies. The expertise in managing large energy projects that Chevron brings could accelerate the maturation of the hydrogen market, potentially leading to cost reductions and technological advancements. 02/29/2024 - 05:00 PM SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chevron New Energies, a division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., announced it is developing a 5-megawatt hydrogen production project in California’s Central Valley. The project aims to create lower carbon energy by utilizing solar power, land, and non-potable produced water from Chevron’s existing assets at the Lost Hills Oil Field in Kern County. This low carbon intensity (LCI) electrolytic hydrogen will be produced through electrolysis, which is the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Chevron’s strategy is to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. Chevron believes in the value of delivering large-scale hydrogen solutions that support a lower carbon world. The facility is designed to produce two tons of LCI hydrogen per day, with the goal of supporting an expanding hydrogen refueling network. “Hydrogen can play a vital role in our journey toward a lower carbon future,” said Austin Knight, vice president for hydrogen at Chevron New Energies. “Chevron already offers lower carbon fuels like sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and others, and this project is expected to expand the portfolio of solutions Chevron could supply to the region. “I’m excited about the scalability of this solution,” Knight continued. “However, our ability to meet growing hydrogen demand and help build hydrogen fueling infrastructure in California to a commercial scale with more widespread adoption will be strongly led by state and federal energy policies that promote new lower carbon energy solutions.” The development of the project is expected to span multiple years, and the start of commercial operations will depend on several factors including flexible and supportive legislative and regulatory energy policies, final engineering design, timely permitting, and obtaining the necessary materials. “This project will help develop key technical and commercial proof points as Chevron New Energies assesses concepts for future scale-up and new lower carbon intensity hydrogen production opportunities,” said Richard Chapman, President and CEO, Kern Economic Development Corporation. “By locating expected production in the Central Valley, we believe the project will be well positioned to meet the demand of customers along an important transportation corridor, as well as having proximity to key California urban markets.” About Chevron Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one of the world’s leading integrated energy companies. We believe affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to enabling human progress. Chevron produces crude oil and natural gas; manufactures transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals and additives; and develops technologies that enhance our business and the industry. We aim to grow our oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen and other emerging technologies.

The study sheds light on the impact on human immunity and potential noncanonical pathways for T cell development. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The findings from CENTOGENE's research on pre-T cell receptor alpha (pre-TCRα) deficiency provide significant insights into the pathophysiology of immune disorders. The rarity of complete pre-TCRα deficiency suggests that the occurrence of related severe clinical manifestations may be lower than previously assumed, which could influence the direction and funding of future medical research. The discovery of a noncanonical pathway that can rescue αβ T cell development in the absence of a functional pre-TCRα chain is particularly noteworthy. This could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting noncanonical pathways to treat or manage immune disorders.In the context of drug development and personalized medicine, these findings could impact companies involved in immunotherapy and precision medicine. Biotech firms may need to reassess the prevalence of pre-TCRα deficiencies in their target populations and consider the implications for clinical trial designs. Additionally, the identification of a more common partial pre-TCRα deficiency highlights a potential patient subgroup that may benefit from targeted interventions, thus opening new market opportunities for diagnostics and therapeutics. Geneticist The study's revelation that a partial form of pre-TCRα deficiency is more common than previously thought could have significant implications for genetic screening and counseling. As a geneticist, understanding the prevalence and implications of such deficiencies is crucial for accurately assessing risks in individuals and populations. The research underscores the importance of including pre-TCRα deficiency in genetic screening panels, especially for individuals with a family history of immune disorders or those presenting with related symptoms.Moreover, the research's implications extend to the broader field of genetics, where it contributes to our understanding of the genetic determinants of immune system function. This knowledge is essential for the development of precision medicine approaches, as it allows for the identification of individuals who may be at risk for certain conditions or who may respond differently to treatments based on their genetic makeup. Healthcare Industry Analyst From a healthcare industry perspective, the findings reported by CENTOGENE have the potential to reshape certain aspects of the market for immunological diagnostics and treatments. The identification of a more prevalent partial pre-TCRα deficiency could lead to an increased demand for diagnostic tests that can accurately detect these deficiencies. This, in turn, could stimulate growth in the diagnostic sector and potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic assays.Furthermore, the long-term implications of these findings could result in a shift in healthcare strategies, such as the need for earlier and more frequent screening in populations at risk, as well as the potential for preemptive therapeutic interventions. This could affect healthcare policies and insurance coverage decisions, as well as the allocation of research funds toward conditions associated with pre-TCRα deficiencies. 02/29/2024 - 05:00 PM Complete Pre-TCRα Deficiency Found to be Very Rare, Partial Form More Common Than ExpectedCAMBRIDGE, Mass. and ROSTOCK, Germany and BERLIN, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CENTOGENE N.V. (Nasdaq: CNTG) (the “Company”), the essential life science partner for data-driven answers in rare and neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the publication in Science of research on human pre-T cell receptor alpha (pre-TCRα) deficiency, a condition that often results in infection, lymphoproliferation, and autoimmune conditions, and its effect on human immunity. The research, conducted in collaboration with the Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases at Institut Imagine and researchers around the world, analyzed the function of αβ and γδ T lymphocytes, two lineages of adaptive immunity in vertebrates, in particular the essential role of the pre-TCRα chain in αβ T cell development. The study revealed that complete pre-TCRα deficiency is rare in humans and less severe than anticipated. Clinical manifestations, when present, often do not appear until adulthood, suggesting a noncanonical pathway that can rescue αβ T cell development. Researchers also found that a partial form of pre-TCRα deficiency is less rare than anticipated, affecting about 1 in 4,000 individuals in South Asia and the Middle East, and can lead to autoimmunity with incomplete penetrance. Prof. Peter Bauer, Chief Medical and Genomic Officer at CENTOGENE, said, ""This research advances our understanding of pre-TCRα deficiency significantly. The paper in Science, which just so happens to come out on Rare Disease Day, underlines that while a variant or a condition may be considered rare, in totality, the number of patients affected can be surprisingly high. Our study shows that such deficiencies and patients are somehow linked, and with each insight, we are closer to further understanding human health and ultimately the path to life-changing answers for patients.” CENTOGENE played a pivotal role in the investigation by conducting an in-depth analysis of the CENTOGENE Biodatabank, the world’s largest real-world integrated multiomic data repository in rare and neurodegenerative diseases. In analyzing genomic and phenomic data, CENTOGENE researchers helped establish the association between partial pre-TCRα deficiency and autoimmunity, with a higher prevalence than initially expected. Christian Beetz, Senior Director Genomic Innovation at CENTOGENE, added, “Until now, the impact of pre-TCRα deficiency has been largely unknown. By leveraging our rich data through genomic and phenotypic analyses, we have been able to understand variants and the effects they have at a whole new level, which will help us diagnose and treat patients better in the future. This is what we are striving for every day.” “The study results highlight what cross-institutional collaboration can achieve,” added Christian Ganoza, Senior Scientist Genomic Innovation at CENTOGENE. “By partnering with Dr. Vivien Béziat and Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova of the Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases and working together with leading institutions around the world, we have been able to combine our insights to establish a deeper understanding of pre-TCRα deficiency, which wouldn’t have been possible otherwise. Critically, the depth and breadth of the CENTOGENE Biodatabank provided the power to confirm the genotype-phenotype association in an independent real-world cohort, and our CENTOGENE team is proud to have been a part of this.” To read the full study, visit: https://bit.ly/centogene-science-publication About CENTOGENE CENTOGENE’s mission is to provide data-driven, life-changing answers to patients, physicians, and pharma companies for rare and neurodegenerative diseases.

The net proceeds will be used for working capital and product development. The offering is subject to market conditions and aims to raise funds for corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst REE Automotive's announcement of a public offering to sell Class A ordinary shares is a strategic move to raise capital. The decision to grant the underwriter a 20-day option for an additional 15% to cover over-allotments indicates a safeguard against potential excess demand, which is a common practice in public offerings. This offering could dilute existing shareholders but also provides the company with necessary funds for working capital and general corporate purposes.Investors should note that the involvement of M&G Investment Management Limited signals institutional interest, which can be a positive indicator of market confidence. However, their non-binding intent to purchase shares adds an element of uncertainty to the final outcome. The role of Roth Capital Partners as the sole book-running manager suggests a targeted approach to the offering, which might appeal to specific investors.The use of net proceeds for continued product development and commercialization is crucial as it underlines the company's focus on growth and expansion in the automotive industry. This could potentially increase the company's long-term value, but investors should be mindful of the risks associated with the development phase of any technology company. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) sector is experiencing significant growth and REE Automotive's offering is indicative of the capital-intensive nature of the industry. The company’s focus on product development and commercialization is aligned with the need to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. However, investors should consider the market conditions, as they can greatly affect the success of the offering. The timing of the offering, market sentiment and investor appetite for EV stocks are crucial factors.Additionally, the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement is a regulatory step that provides transparency and detailed information to potential investors. The effectiveness of the shelf registration statement on Form F-3 indicates that the company had planned this move well in advance, which can be seen as a sign of strategic foresight. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows for a more expedited process of selling securities over a given period. This flexibility is beneficial for the company as it can time the market to its advantage. The SEC's role in declaring the registration effective ensures that the company has met all necessary regulatory requirements, providing a layer of investor protection.It's important for potential investors to review the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, along with any incorporated documents, to understand the risks and specifics of the offering. The legal framework surrounding public offerings is designed to maintain market integrity and protect investors, but it also imposes certain obligations on the company to report accurate and comprehensive information. 02/29/2024 - 05:21 PM TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- REE Automotive Ltd.

CY23 operating cash flow of $7.5 million was offset by $2.2 million used in investing activities and $25.0 million used in financing activities.CY23 cash provided by operating activities of $7.5 million saw a differential to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.6 million due to timing of receipts, manufacturing payments, and Q1 restructuring costs.Earnings Guidance8 For CY24 Life360 expects to deliver the following metrics which include both the early revenue, and set-up costs, for the new advertising business: Consolidated revenue of $365 million - $375 million, with core Life360 subscription revenue growth of at least 20% YoY;Positive Adjusted EBITDA9 of $30 million - $35 million;EBITDA7 loss of $(8) million to $(13) million;Positive Operating Cash Flow for each quarter of CY24, with the usual seasonal low point in Q1;Year-end cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $80 million - $90 million.The company expects to continue to be Adjusted EBITDA positive on a quarterly basis going forward, and to achieve positive EBITDA in the first half of CY25. 8 With respect to forward looking non-GAAP guidance, we are not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items, which are fluid and unpredictable in nature. In addition, the Company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that may be confusing or misleading to investors. These items include, but are not limited to, litigation costs, convertible notes and derivative liability fair value adjustments, and gains/losses on revaluation of contingent consideration. These items may be material to our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. 9 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

37,984 Non-GAAP Financial Measures We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA In addition to total revenue, net loss and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA""). EBITDA is defined as net loss, excluding (i) convertible notes and derivative liability fair value adjustments, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) other income, net. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss, excluding (i) convertible notes and derivative liability fair value adjustments, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) other expense, net, (v) stock-based compensation, (vi) Form 10 transaction costs, (vii) acquisition and integration costs, (viii) workplace restructuring costs, (ix) inventory write-offs, (x) adjustment in connection with membership benefit, (xi) warehouse relocation costs and (xii) gain on revaluation of contingent consideration. The above items are excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this media release because they are key measurements used by our management team internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

Financial Analyst Repayment of debt, especially one as substantial as $465 million in convertible debt, is a critical financial event for a company. Aurora Cannabis Inc.'s final payment of $7.2 million on its Notes indicates a strategic move to strengthen its balance sheet. By eliminating this debt, the company not only reduces its interest obligations, which were likely substantial given the original debt size, but also improves its debt-to-equity ratio. This action may positively influence the company's credit rating and investor confidence, potentially leading to a more favorable borrowing environment in the future.Moreover, Aurora's commitment to achieving positive free cash flow within the calendar year is a strong signal to the market. Positive free cash flow is a key indicator of a company's ability to generate more cash than it spends, which is essential for funding operations, paying dividends, or investing in growth without relying on external financing. Investors often scrutinize this metric as it provides insight into the financial health and operational efficiency of a company. Market Research Analyst The cannabis industry has been characterized by high growth potential but also by volatility and financial stress, with many companies taking on significant debt to finance expansion. Aurora's repayment of its convertible debt could be seen as an indicator of operational maturity within the sector. As companies transition from aggressive growth to more sustainable financial practices, they may gain stability. This move by Aurora might prompt a reassessment of risk profiles for cannabis companies, potentially leading to revaluation by investors.Additionally, the repayment of convertible debt removes the possibility of dilution from conversion, which is positive news for current shareholders. Convertible notes can be exchanged for a pre-determined number of shares and their conversion typically dilutes existing shareholders' equity. By paying off these Notes, Aurora prevents such dilution and possibly supports a more stable stock price. Economist On a macroeconomic level, Aurora's actions reflect broader economic conditions. In an environment where interest rates may be rising, managing and reducing debt becomes increasingly important for companies to control costs. Aurora's focus on financial discipline, as evidenced by debt repayment and the pursuit of positive free cash flow, suggests a strategic adaptation to such economic conditions. This approach can serve as a buffer against potential economic downturns and provide the company with more agility to navigate market uncertainties.The ripple effects of this repayment may extend beyond Aurora, influencing the financial strategies of other players in the cannabis industry. As firms observe peers prioritizing balance sheet strength, they may follow suit, leading to a collective improvement in the financial stability of the sector. 02/29/2024 - 05:00 PM NASDAQ | TSX: ACB EDMONTON, AB, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Aurora Cannabis Inc.

The offering is set to close on March 5, 2024, with joint book-running managers including BofA Securities, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a registered public offering of $600 million in senior notes by TPG Operating Group II, L.P., a subsidiary of TPG Inc., is a significant event for the company and its investors. The 5.875% interest rate is indicative of the current cost of borrowing for the firm, which can be compared to the industry average to assess competitiveness. The use of proceeds to repay existing debt under the company's revolving credit facility and term loan suggests a strategic move to restructure the company's debt profile, potentially leading to a more favorable interest expense and improved cash flow management. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the impact of this debt issuance on the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, as well as the potential effects on the company's credit rating. The involvement of a robust syndicate of book-running managers and co-managers, including major investment banks, could indicate strong market confidence in the offering and TPG's creditworthiness. Market Research Analyst TPG's decision to issue senior notes may reflect broader market conditions and investor appetite for corporate debt. The fixed interest payments until 2034 provide investors with a predictable income stream, which may be particularly attractive in a volatile market environment. The semi-annual interest payments are a common feature of such financial instruments, providing a regular return to bondholders. It's also important to consider the timing of the offering and its alignment with the company's strategic financial planning. The firm's ability to secure a relatively moderate interest rate amidst potentially fluctuating market interest rates could be advantageous. The diversification of funding sources, with both senior notes and a concurrent offering of junior subordinated notes, suggests a comprehensive approach to capital management. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under TPG's existing shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows for a streamlined process and quicker access to the capital markets when needed. The shelf registration is a regulatory filing that permits an issuer to offer and sell securities to the public without a separate registration for each act of offering. It is crucial for compliance with securities laws and regulations. The legal structure of the offering, with the notes being fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TPG and certain direct subsidiaries, is designed to provide assurance to investors regarding the repayment of the notes. This guarantee structure is a key legal aspect that underpins the creditworthiness of the debt issuance. 02/29/2024 - 05:25 PM SAN FRANCISCO & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TPG Inc.

Operating losses at Stadco have narrowed, but due diligence costs for a potential acquisition led to a $1.0 million impact on the bottom line. The company's financial position shows negative working capital and increased debt levels. Positive Backlog increased to $50.8 million with high customer confidence. Third-quarter net sales were lower at $7.6 million, resulting in a 23% decrease in gross profit. Operating losses at Stadco have narrowed, but due diligence costs for a potential acquisition impacted the bottom line. Negative working capital and increased debt levels were reported. Negative Consolidated net sales were 8% lower at $7.6 million compared to the previous year. Gross profit decreased by 23% to $1.2 million. Operating losses were $1.0 million, contrasting with operating income in the previous year. Increased debt levels and negative working capital were reported. Financial Analyst The reported increase in TechPrecision Corporation's backlog to $50.8 million signifies a robust demand for the company's services, which can be interpreted as a positive indicator of future revenue streams. However, the decrease in net sales by 8% compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year suggests a potential concern regarding the company's current revenue generation capabilities. This contraction in sales, attributed to fewer labor hours during the holiday season, may also reflect a lack of operational flexibility or resilience to seasonal fluctuations.Furthermore, the operating loss and the increase in SG&A expenses due to due diligence for a potential acquisition indicate that the company is actively seeking growth opportunities. The costs associated with these efforts, however, are impacting the short-term profitability. The increased interest expense due to higher borrowing and interest rates exacerbates the financial pressure on the company, which is also evident in the reclassification of long-term debt to current liabilities following a debt covenant violation.Investors should consider the implications of the company's working capital moving into negative territory, which raises concerns about liquidity and the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. The increase in total debt year-over-year further adds to the financial risk profile of the company. Market Research Analyst The backlog growth reported by TechPrecision Corporation serves as a proxy for customer confidence and future business potential, particularly in the defense and precision industrial sectors. This could indicate that despite the current dip in sales, the company has a healthy pipeline that may lead to future revenue growth. However, the market demand for large-scale fabricated and machined metal components is often tied to broader economic trends and defense spending, which can be cyclical and influenced by geopolitical events.It is also important to highlight the company's strategic move towards a potential acquisition, which could potentially diversify its product offerings or expand its market reach. The success of such a strategy would depend on the synergies realized and the integration of the new acquisition. Analysts would be keen on understanding how this acquisition aligns with the company's core competencies and long-term strategy. Legal Expert The reclassification of long-term debt to current liabilities due to a debt covenant violation is a critical legal and financial issue that requires careful scrutiny. Such a violation can often lead to renegotiations of loan terms or trigger more stringent covenants, potentially increasing the cost of capital for the company.

The common stock dividend is $0.4125 per share, payable on March 29, 2024. The preferred stock dividend is $664.0625 per share, payable on April 1, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on Wesco International's common stock represents a distribution of profits to shareholders, signaling the company's current financial health and stability. The specified dividend of $0.4125 per share is a direct indicator of the company's ability to generate cash flow, which is a critical aspect for evaluating a company's performance. Shareholders often view regular dividends as a sign of a company's reliability and may see this as a positive sign for steady or improving future earnings.Moreover, the announcement of dividends on the 10.625% Series A Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock is noteworthy. Preferred stock dividends are often higher than those of common stock and are typically paid out before any dividends are given to common stockholders, reflecting their preferential treatment in the capital structure. The substantial dividend of $664.0625 per preferred share underscores the commitment to preferred shareholders and suggests a strong capital position to maintain such payments.Investors should consider the dividend yield and the payout ratio in their analysis. A high payout ratio may signal limited room for future growth or investment, while a low ratio may suggest the company is reinvesting more of its profits back into the business. The impact of these dividends on the company's cash reserves and the sustainability of such payments in the long term are also critical factors for consideration. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader market, Wesco International's dividend declaration can be compared against industry benchmarks. The amount and frequency of dividends can be influenced by industry standards and deviations can indicate a strategic positioning by the company. If the dividend amount is in line with or exceeds the industry average, it might reflect a competitive advantage or a particularly strong earnings period.The timing of the dividend payments also coincides with the fiscal quarter, which is a common practice that aligns with investor expectations and financial planning. This regularity in payments can contribute to a positive perception of the company's stock, potentially affecting its stock market performance. Investors and analysts often look at dividend announcements as a component of total return, which includes both the dividend income and capital gains from stock price increases.It is also important to monitor the market reaction to such announcements. A positive response could lead to an uptick in the stock price as the market adjusts to the new information, reflecting the perceived value of the dividend in the context of the company's stock price. Conversely, if the market expected a higher dividend and the announcement underdelivers, there could be a negative impact on the stock price. Economist From an economic perspective, dividend declarations must be analyzed in the context of the prevailing economic conditions. Interest rates, inflation and economic growth can all affect investor sentiment towards dividend-paying stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, for example, stocks with attractive dividend yields can become more appealing to investors seeking income, potentially increasing demand for the company's shares.Furthermore, the company's decision to pay dividends must be weighed against other uses of capital, such as reinvestment in the business or debt repayment. The opportunity cost of paying out dividends can be significant, especially if the company has high-growth potential or if the economy is in a downturn and retaining capital could help weather adverse conditions.Additionally, the declaration of dividends may reflect the company's confidence in its future cash flows. A consistent dividend policy can signal to the market that the company expects to maintain or increase its profitability, which can be a positive indicator during economic uncertainty. 02/29/2024 - 04:45 PM PITTSBURGH, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Wesco International (NYSE: WCC) today declared a quarterly cash dividend on all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, in an amount equal to $0.4125 per share.

BellRing Brands Announces New Share Repurchase Authorization of $300 Million,2024-02-29T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"BellRing Brands, Inc. (BRBR) announces a $300 million share repurchase authorization over two years, with $79 million already repurchased under the previous authorization. Repurchases may vary in method and timing, subject to market conditions.","BellRing Brands Announces New Share Repurchase Authorization of $300 Million Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary BellRing Brands, Inc. (BRBR) announces a $300 million share repurchase authorization over two years, with $79 million already repurchased under the previous authorization. Repurchases may vary in method and timing, subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The $300 million share repurchase program announced by BellRing Brands represents a significant capital allocation decision that could be indicative of the company's confidence in its financial stability and future prospects. The repurchase plan suggests that the management believes the shares are undervalued and that this is an opportune moment to return value to shareholders. From a financial perspective, such buybacks could potentially lead to earnings per share (EPS) accretion, as the reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase EPS if net income remains stable or grows.However, it's crucial to consider the opportunity cost of this capital deployment. The funds used for share repurchases are not being invested back into the company's growth or used to pay down debt, which could be a concern if the company faces liquidity needs in the future. Additionally, while the repurchase authorization does not obligate BellRing to acquire any specific number of shares, the announcement alone can influence investor sentiment and the stock's market price.Investors should monitor the execution of this plan closely, as the actual impact on the market value will depend on the timing and price of the repurchases. It's also important to note that share buybacks are sometimes viewed critically if they are used primarily to boost short-term stock performance rather than being part of a well-thought-out long-term strategy. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase authorizations often signal to the market that a company's leadership believes its stock is undervalued. BellRing Brands' decision to initiate a $300 million buyback program could be interpreted as a strong positive signal by the market, potentially leading to a bullish sentiment among investors. Analyzing historical repurchase patterns, BellRing has nearly completed its previous $80 million authorization, which could indicate a consistent policy towards shareholder value maximization.It is important to contextualize this announcement within the broader industry and market trends. If BellRing's competitors are also engaging in similar capital return activities, it could suggest an industry-wide trend of strong cash flows and mature investment opportunities. Conversely, if BellRing is an outlier, it might suggest a unique position or strategy within its market segment.Stakeholders should consider the repurchase strategy in light of the company's overall financial health, including its revenue growth, profit margins and debt levels. A robust repurchase program in the presence of strong financial metrics could be a reaffirmation of the company's growth trajectory and operational efficiency. Legal Expert The announcement of a share repurchase program must be carefully scrutinized from a legal and regulatory standpoint. BellRing Brands' statement includes language that repurchases may be made through various means, including open market transactions and private purchases, which are subject to regulatory requirements and corporate governance standards. The company's cautionary note on forward-looking language is a standard disclaimer to manage investor expectations and mitigate legal risk, acknowledging that such plans are subject to changes based on market conditions, liquidity and legal requirements.It is imperative for BellRing to adhere to SEC regulations, particularly Rule 10b-18, which provides a safe harbor for companies engaging in share repurchases. Compliance with this rule is essential to protect the company and its management from potential allegations of market manipulation. Additionally, the timing and structure of the repurchase transactions must be managed to avoid any insider trading implications, particularly during blackout periods or when in possession of material non-public information.Investors should be aware that the board's authorization of the repurchase plan is a preliminary step and that the actual execution will be contingent on a dynamic legal landscape. Any material changes to the repurchase plan or deviations from expected practices could have legal implications and should be communicated transparently to the market. 02/29/2024 - 05:00 PM ST. LOUIS, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BellRing Brands, Inc. (NYSE:BRBR) today announced its Board of Directors approved a $300 million share repurchase authorization over the next two years, with share repurchases under the new authorization beginning on March 11, 2024. Subsequent to December 31, 2023 and as of February 29, 2024, BellRing repurchased 0.2 million shares of its common stock for $12.3 million at an average price of $53.58 per share. As of February 29, 2024, BellRing had repurchased approximately $79 million under its previous $80 million share repurchase authorization, which became effective on May 3, 2023 and will be cancelled effective March 11, 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, alternative, accelerated repurchase or automatic purchase transactions, or otherwise. The authorization does not, however, obligate BellRing to acquire any particular amount of shares, and repurchases may be suspended or terminated at any time at BellRing’s discretion. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, share price, market conditions and legal requirements.

The Notes are expected to be rated BBB+ (Stable) by S&P, Baa1 (Stable) by Moody's, and BBB (Stable) by Fitch. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt under the Issuer's term loan facility and for general corporate purposes. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of Cdn$650 million in 5.10% Senior Notes by Ventas Canada Finance Limited represents a significant financial maneuver within Ventas Inc.'s broader capital management strategy. The decision to utilize these funds primarily for the repayment of existing indebtedness, such as the Cdn$500 million unsecured term loan facility, indicates a strategic approach to debt refinancing aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure.From a credit perspective, the expected ratings of BBB+ by S&P, Baa1 by Moody's and BBB by Fitch suggest a stable investment-grade status, reflecting a moderate degree of risk and a relatively strong ability to meet financial commitments. Investors and analysts might interpret these ratings as an indicator of the company's creditworthiness and the relative safety of investing in these notes.The interest payment terms, with semi-annual payments, are standard for such instruments and the 5.10% interest rate should be compared against the current interest rate environment and the company's cost of capital to evaluate its attractiveness. This rate also reflects the credit risk premium associated with Ventas and the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry's market conditions. Market Research Analyst As a REIT, Ventas Inc. operates within a sector that is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The issuance of senior notes in the Canadian market, particularly to accredited investors, highlights a targeted fundraising approach that might be designed to diversify the investor base and capitalize on different market conditions. It is worth noting that the choice of Canada for the private offering could be influenced by market-specific factors such as investor demand, regulatory environment and currency considerations.The use of proceeds for general corporate purposes alongside debt repayment suggests an anticipation of future growth opportunities or potential acquisitions, consistent with the company's focus on senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers and healthcare facilities. The demographic trend towards an aging population may underpin the company's growth strategy and could be a point of interest for stakeholders considering the long-term demand for healthcare-related real estate. Legal Expert The legal nuances of this transaction are noteworthy. The Notes are being issued on a prospectus-exempt basis, which implies a streamlined process but is restricted to a certain investor class like 'accredited investors' and 'permitted clients' as per Canadian securities laws. This exemption indicates a private placement approach, which can be faster and less costly compared to a public offering, albeit with a more limited potential investor pool.Furthermore, the Notes not being registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor qualified by way of prospectus in Canada, means that they are subject to specific sale and resale restrictions. This could impact their liquidity and the ease with which they can be transferred, factors that potential investors need to carefully consider.Finally, the Guarantee by Ventas Inc. ensures that the obligations under the Notes are backed by the parent company, providing an additional layer of security for investors and reflecting the integrated financial structure of the Ventas corporate family. 02/29/2024 - 04:43 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) said today that it has priced a private offering in Canada of Cdn$650 million of 5.10% Senior Notes, Series J due 2029 (the “Notes”).

The Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the “Guarantee”). The Notes will mature on March 5, 2029. The Notes will constitute senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally with all other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer. The Guarantee will constitute a senior unsecured obligation of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.

Financial Analyst The completion of the business combination between Finfront Holding Company and Arisz Acquisition Corp., resulting in the listing of BitFuFu Inc. on the Nasdaq Stock Market, represents a significant event for investors and the market at large. A key point of interest is the remarkable revenue growth BitFuFu has experienced, increasing from a modest $100,000 in 2020 to $198.2 million in 2022 and maintaining a strong performance with $134.2 million in the first half of 2023. This rapid growth trajectory is indicative of the company's effective scaling and operational efficiency in the digital asset mining industry.Furthermore, the strategic balance between self-owned and leased miners for cloud services and self-mining can be seen as a prudent approach to business risk management. The $74 million in PIPE financing secured from existing shareholders and strategic partners, including industry heavyweights Bitmain and AntPool, provides additional capital to support continued expansion and could be a strong vote of confidence in BitFuFu's future prospects. From a financial perspective, the increased transparency and governance standards that come with being a public entity could potentially attract more institutional investors, adding to the company's financial robustness. Market Research Analyst BitFuFu's successful listing on the Nasdaq marks a significant milestone for the company, reflecting its status as a world-leading cloud-mining service provider. The digital asset mining industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving; thus, BitFuFu's robust infrastructure, with approximately 131,000 miners and a total mining capacity of 15.2 EH/s, positions it favorably against competitors. The company's offerings, which include cloud-mining, self-mining and miner hosting services, cater to a diverse customer base, ranging from institutional clients to digital asset enthusiasts.The strategic expansion fueled by the proceeds from the business combination could enable BitFuFu to capitalize on emerging opportunities within the digital asset space. The diversification of mining services and the expansion of global operations are likely to strengthen BitFuFu's market share and enhance its competitive edge. Additionally, the company's commitment to corporate governance and transparency as a public company may further solidify its reputation and brand equity in the eyes of potential customers and partners. Cryptocurrency Expert BitFuFu's entry into the public markets is a notable development within the cryptocurrency sector. The company's focus on cloud-mining services addresses a growing demand for more accessible and efficient ways to participate in digital asset mining, which is traditionally capital and resource-intensive. The use of self-owned and leased miners allows for flexible scaling of operations and can mitigate the risks associated with the high volatility and regulatory uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market.It is also important to consider the implications of the business model in light of the environmental concerns surrounding digital asset mining. As a public company, BitFuFu may face increased scrutiny regarding its energy consumption and carbon footprint. Thus, ongoing investments in sustainable mining practices and green technologies could become a critical factor in the company's long-term success and social license to operate. The industry partnerships and strategic alliances, as mentioned by Echo Hindle-Yang, are crucial for navigating the regulatory landscape and fostering innovation in this sector. 02/29/2024 - 04:59 PM NEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Finfront Holding Company, a fast-growing digital asset mining service and world-leading cloud-mining service provider (""BitFuFu"" or the ""Company""), and Arisz Acquisition Corp.(“ARIZ”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have completed their previously announced business combination (the “Business Combination”).

The transition from K-12 testing to a more recurring business model in the Biosecurity segment has impacted revenues substantially. Investors should consider the company's cash balance of nearly $950 million, which provides a cushion for strategic maneuvers. However, the anticipated growth in Cell Engineering services revenue and the expected addition of 100-120 new Cell Programs in 2024 indicate a potential for recovery and growth, particularly in the biopharma sector. Biotechnology Market Analyst The growth in Cell Engineering services by 31% suggests a robust demand for Ginkgo's services in the biopharma industry. The partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies and the expansion into new markets like biosecurity signal a strategic positioning that could capitalize on emerging opportunities in the sector. The creation of the Center for Unified Biosecurity Excellence in Doha and the collaboration with Illumina are moves that could enhance Ginkgo's global footprint and service capabilities. The Technology Network launch could also create synergies and drive innovation, potentially leading to new revenue streams. Biotech Legal & IP Expert The mention of downstream value share revenue, which includes royalties, milestone payments and equity interests, is a critical component of Ginkgo's financial model. This indicates a reliance on the future success of its partners' programs, which carries inherent risks but also offers significant upside. The $2.4 billion in aggregate revenue potential from downstream milestone payments alone is a substantial figure that could impact future earnings. However, the absence of such revenue in Q4 2023 compared to 2022 could raise questions about the volatility and predictability of this income stream. 02/29/2024 - 05:01 PM $251 million of Total revenue in 2023 $139 million in Cell Engineering services revenue, representing 31% growth over 2022 78 new Cell Programs added in 2023, representing 32% growth over 2022 and continued penetration in biopharma Year-end cash balance of nearly $950 million provides meaningful multi-year runway as we drive towards profitability and begin recognizing benefits from improved platform efficiency BOSTON, Feb. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc.

I'm particularly pleased with our growth in biopharma, which represents our largest untapped market - we added several new programs across modalities with large enterprises including Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer and are seeing strong momentum in pharma going into 2024. I am also thrilled to see a real ecosystem building around Ginkgo - we're honored by the trust placed in us by the terrific founders of Patch Biosciences, Reverie Labs, and Proof Diagnostics to bring their technologies to customers and by the over 25 inaugural partners in our newly announced Technology Network.

As of December 31, 2023 Ginkgo has approximately $2.4 billion in aggregate revenue potential from downstream milestone payments alone in addition to royalties.Ginkgo recently announced the launch of its Technology Network of over 25 companies, creating a more integrated approach to biotech R&D. Ginkgo has a long history of integrating diverse technologies to deliver on customers' complex program goals and believes that customers should not have to choose a technical approach prematurely but should be able to test many approaches in an unbiased way. Ginkgo customers will be able to benefit from the integration of technologies from network partners in their programs, and Ginkgo expects to expand the network based on customer needs and feedback.Ginkgo also announced several acquisitions including Patch Biosciences, Proof Diagnostics and Reverie Labs. These acquisitions are expected to expand Ginkgo's capabilities in AI and biopharma.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Fourth quarter 2023 Total revenue of $35 million, down from $98 million in the comparable prior year period, a decrease of 65% primarily driven by the expected ramp down of K-12 testing in Ginkgo's Biosecurity segment and the impact of Cell Engineering downstream value share from equity milestones in 2022 that did not recur in 2023Fourth quarter 2023 Cell Engineering services revenue, which does not include downstream value share revenue, of $27 million, down 26% from $36 million in the comparable prior year period.

FET expects an adjusted EBITDA of $100 to $120 million in 2024. The Variperm acquisition is projected to drive long-term growth for FET. Negative Net loss of $19 million in 2023. Decrease in orders for the Completions segment in the fourth quarter. Lower sales volume in the Downhole Technologies product line. A 40% decrease in orders for the Production segment in the fourth quarter. Financial Analyst The report highlights a 6% increase in annual revenue to $739 million for Forum Energy Technologies, which signals a modest yet positive trajectory in the company's financial performance. The book-to-bill ratio slightly below 100% suggests a balance between orders received and revenue billed, indicating stable demand for the company's products and services. However, the reported net loss of $19 million contrasts with the previous year's net income, underscoring challenges that may have affected profitability.Of particular interest to stakeholders is the 14% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $67 million, which reflects improved operational efficiency or cost management, especially when considering the net loss context. The provided 2024 EBITDA guidance between $100 to $120 million, coupled with an anticipated free cash flow of $40 to $60 million, projects a confident outlook and suggests that the company expects to capitalize on synergies from the Variperm acquisition and other strategic initiatives.Investors should note the impact of special items, including foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses, which have significantly affected the net figures. The Variperm acquisition is expected to enhance the company's product portfolio and potentially increase market share, but the true value will depend on the successful integration and realization of projected synergies. Market Research Analyst The company's performance in international markets, with a 23% revenue increase and significant growth in the Middle East, indicates a strategic expansion that outpaces the international rig count growth. This suggests that FET's products are gaining traction overseas, which could be a result of successful market penetration strategies or increased demand for energy production solutions.The Subsea Technologies product line's 129% book-to-bill ratio and doubled backlog signify strong market demand and future revenue potential in this segment. The commercialization of new products, such as the FASTConnect and the next-generation iron roughneck, highlight the company's commitment to innovation and could be a key driver for future growth.While the industry outlook remains positive due to the global demand for energy, the company's long-term success will likely hinge on its ability to maintain technological leadership and adapt to market fluctuations. Investors should monitor FET's progress in commercializing its new technologies and the impact of these innovations on its financial performance. Energy Sector Analyst The emphasis on FET's role as an equipment manufacturer for safer, cleaner and more efficient energy production aligns with the broader industry trend towards sustainability and environmental responsibility. The company's focus on differentiated products and patent-protected technologies could provide a competitive edge as the energy sector evolves.The reduction of long-term debt by 48% is a significant financial move that improves the company's balance sheet and may reduce interest expenses, potentially freeing up capital for investment in growth opportunities. The strategic acquisition of Variperm, which is highlighted as highly accretive, suggests that FET is actively seeking to enhance its market position through mergers and acquisitions.It is crucial to assess the potential risks associated with the integration of Variperm, such as cultural alignment and the harmonization of operations. Successful integration is key to realizing the forecasted financial returns and should be closely monitored by investors and industry stakeholders. 02/29/2024 - 04:42 PM Full Year 2023 Highlights and 2024 Guidance Revenue: $739 million, a 6% year-over-year increase Orders: $724 million and book-to-bill ratio of 98% Net loss: $19 million, or diluted EPS of $1.85 Adjusted EBITDA: $67 million, a 14% increase from 2022 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance: $100 - $120 million HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FET) today announced fourth quarter 2023 revenue of $185 million, a $6 million increase from the third quarter. The fourth quarter net loss was $17 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to third quarter net income of $8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share. Excluding $9 million of foreign exchange losses and $4 million of transaction and other nonrecurring items, cumulatively $1.25 per share, adjusted net loss was $0.39 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $15 million, compared to $17 million for the third quarter. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $9 million compared to $24 million for the third quarter. 2023 revenue was $739 million, a $39 million increase from 2022. Net loss for 2023 was $19 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for 2022. Adjusted net loss was $2 million, a $18 million improvement from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $67 million, compared to $59 million for 2022. Free cash flow for 2023 was $2 million compared to $11 million for 2022.

See Tables 1-6 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. Neal Lux, President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, “2023 was a transformative year for FET. In addition to executing our strategy, we accomplished two significant milestones that accelerate FET’s long-term growth trajectory. We began the year by reducing our long-term debt by 48%, and we ended the year with the Variperm acquisition announcement. “This highly accretive acquisition demonstrates strong industrial logic. Variperm’s differentiated products and patent-protected technologies complement our artificial lift product portfolio, expanding the total addressable market for FET. “Together, we are a formidable manufacturer of highly engineered products and solutions that we expect will generate significant financial returns for our shareholders. In 2024, we are forecasting EBITDA of $100 to $120 million and free cash flow between $40 to $60 million. “We executed our strategy, adapted to volatile market conditions, and benefited from our strong global footprint, delivering revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 14%, respectively. Our full year 2023 book-to-bill ratio was just under 100%. The Subsea Technologies product line led the way with a book-to-bill ratio of 129% and doubled its backlog from the beginning of the year. Revenue grew in all our international regions, led by a 72% increase in the Middle East. In the aggregate, international revenue increased 23%, twice the pace of international rig count growth. “FET also benefited from increasing customer adoption of its differentiated technology portfolio. We commercialized several new products that we believe will drive revenue growth, including our frac automated switch technology system, FASTConnect, and the next generation iron roughneck. In addition, our Coiled Tubing product line set new world records for length and weight of two different strings, both for the Middle East. “Our long-term outlook for the industry has not changed. The world needs more energy. FET will be a leading equipment manufacturer, delivering solutions that allow for safer, cleaner, and more efficient energy production.” Segment Results (unless otherwise noted, comparisons are fourth quarter 2023 versus third quarter 2023) Drilling & Downhole segment revenue was $91 million, a 12% increase, mainly due to higher project revenue recognized from ROVs and cable management systems in our Subsea Technologies product line. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volume in our Downhole Technologies product line. Orders were $79 million, a 17% decrease, following strong third quarter bookings for new remotely operated vehicles in our Subsea Technologies product line. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, flat sequentially. Drilling & Downhole operations focus primarily on capital equipment and consumable products for global well construction, artificial lift, and subsea markets. Completions segment revenue was $57 million, a 8% decrease, primarily related to lower shipments for coiled tubing products. Orders were $58 million, a 11% decrease, primarily due to a softer completions activity market in the U.S. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $7 million, comparable to third quarter 2023 due to favorable product mix. The Completions segment designs and manufactures products for the coiled tubing, wireline and well stimulation markets. Production segment revenue was $37 million, comparable to third quarter 2023, due to higher demand for our processing equipment and technologies. The benefit of this higher demand was offset by lower valve product sales. Orders were $23 million, a 40% decrease, due to the timing of lumpy Production Equipment orders. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $2 million, comparable to the third quarter 2023. The Production segment manufactures land well site production equipment, desalination processing equipment, and a wide range of valves for upstream, midstream and process industry customers. FET (Forum Energy Technologies) is a global manufacturing company, serving the oil, natural gas, industrial and renewable energy industries. With headquarters located in Houston, Texas, FET provides value added solutions aimed at improving the safety, efficiency, and environmental impact of our customers' operations.

The Company believes that this ratio is useful to investors because it provides an indication of whether the demand for our products is strengthening or declining. A ratio of greater than one is indicative of improving market demand, while a ratio of less than one would suggest weakening demand. In addition, the Company believes the book-to-bill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future revenues for our business than other measures, such as order backlog, because the majority of the Company's products are activity based consumable items or shorter cycle capital equipment, neither of which are typically ordered by customers far in advance.
