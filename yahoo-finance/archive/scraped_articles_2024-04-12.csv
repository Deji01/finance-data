Oil rallied.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Bracing for Unprecedented Direct Iran Attack in DaysApple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 ChipsRussian Attacks on Ukraine Stoke Fears Army Near Breaking PointUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, ProxiesVietnam Tycoon Lan Sentenced to Death Over $12 Billion FraudEquities fell at the end of a wild week on a news report that Israel is bracing for an unprecedented attack by Iran on government targets as soon as Saturday. Treasuries climbed across the US curve as the greenback hit the highest in 2024. And Friday’s economic data did little to alter the reduced risk appetite — with consumer sentiment down as inflation expectations rose.To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, investors have been much too complacent about about geopolitical issues.“Since gold and oil markets have been pricing in a meaningful impact on the marketplace from this crisis, it’s not out of the question that the stock market will follow,” Maley noted. “In other words, investors will want to remain nimble in the coming days and weeks.”The S&P 500 fell 1%, while the Nasdaq 100 underperformed, led by losses in chipmakers. Treasury 10-year yields declined seven basis points to 4.51%. Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities also cited “massive short covering” for the rebound in bonds and rate locking amid the expected flurry of debt issuance by banks after earnings.The dollar headed toward its best week since September 2022. Brent crude jumped to its highest since October. Gold topped $2,400 — hitting another record. Haven currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc outperformed.As Iran Threatens Attack, These Are Israel’s Defenses: QuickTakeA direct confrontation between Israel and Iran would mean a significant escalation of the Middle East conflict and would lead to a significant rise in oil prices, according to Commerzbank analysts including Carsten Fritsch.Story continues“Gold prices are up again this morning, as more investors view it as a better hedge against geopolitical risk than government bonds due to US inflation concerns,” Mohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote in a post on X.Meantime, big banks’ results offered the latest window into how the US economy is faring amid an interest-rate trajectory muddied by persistent inflation.Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. missed estimates for net interest income. Citigroup Inc.’s profit topped estimates as corporations tapped markets for financing and consumers leaned on credit cards — signs that a prolonged period of elevated interest rates will benefit big banks.“Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” JPMorgan’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. He cited the wars, growing geopolitical tensions, persistent inflationary pressures and the effects of quantitative tightening.Escalating geopolitical tensions — most recently in the Middle East but also including attacks on Russian energy infrastructure by Ukraine — have spurred bullish activity in the oil options market. There’s been elevated buying of call options — which profit when prices rise — in recent days, as implied volatility climbs. The options on Brent are still trading at a premium over bearish puts.Treasuries rallied sharply Friday, pulling yields from near year-to-date highs. That comes on the heels of the market’s worst two days since February, a selloff driven by inflation readings that savaged expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year.BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he expects the Fed to cut rates twice at the most this year, and that it will be difficult for the central bank to curb inflation.Fink told CNBC “call it a day and a win” if the inflation rate gets to between 2.8% and 3%, which is above the Fed’s 2% target after the asset manager reported first-quarter results. “I think 2% is a hard number” to achieve, said Fink.Meantime, Pacific Investment Management Co. warned that the Fed could pivot back toward interest rate hikes if US inflation moves higher — with the asset manager preferring to buy bonds in other markets.“If inflation starts to re-emerge then there’s a possibility that the Fed hikes instead of delivering any cuts,” Mohit Mittal, chief investment officer for core strategies at Pimco, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.Fed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins reiterated she sees no urgency to cut interest rates in the near term, given elevated inflation and the resilience of the labor market.Inflation figures this week were on the “high end” of what was expected, Collins said. She anticipates inflation will continue to ease, but it will likely take longer than previously thought.While shifting expectations around the timing and pace of the first cuts are likely to create further yield volatility in the near term, UBS’s Chief Investment Office thinks the more important point is that the US central bank remains set to start easing this year.With a low probability of the Fed needing to hike rates further, CIO maintains their positive outlook on quality bonds.“We continue to favor quality bonds in our global portfolios and recommend investors lock in attractive yields before rates fall this year,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We like those with 1–10-year duration, as well as sustainable bonds. We also think investors should consider an active exposure to fixed income to improve diversification.”Equity markets have remained resilient in recent weeks despite a hawkish turn from Fed officials. Bond markets are now pricing two rate cuts by the end of the year, compared with six just three months ago, yet both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 are still hovering near record highs.A rare rally in both tech stocks and commodities, combined with a jump in bond yields, has echoes of periods when bubbles are forming, according to strategists at Bank of America Corp. led by Michael Hartnett.“If tech stocks lose their ‘flight to safety’ status, we’re going to see a big pickup in volatility,” said Maley at Miller Tabak.To David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management, crowth is starting to broaden out with non-Magnificent Seven stocks poised to generate positive, albeit modest, growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022. This trend should accelerate over the balance of the year, he noted.“Overall, this leaves us at a neutral stance on US equities, which means that investors should have a full allocation, in line with their long term ‘normal’ allocation to US stocks,” he added. “Our S&P 500 price targets for June and December are 5,100 and 5,200, respectively.”“In our upside scenario, we think the S&P 500 could reach 5,500 by the end of the year. That outcome would likely be achieved if inflation pressures ease more quickly or corporate profit growth is stronger than expectations,” he concluded.Corporate Highlights:United States Steel Corp. and Nippon Steel Corp. are deliberating a decision to formally push back the time frame they expect to close their contentious $14.1 billion deal.BlackRock Inc.’s long-term investment funds took in $76 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, helping to push the world’s largest money manager to a record $10.5 trillion of client assets.State Street Corp. reported adjusted earnings per share and net interest income for the first quarter that beat the average analyst estimate.Global Life Inc. issued a statement on a short-seller report, saying it “reviewed the report and found it to be wildly misleading.”Arista Networks Inc. was cut to sell at Rosenblatt Securities on ethernet risks.Exxon Mobil Corp. formally approved its sixth Guyanese oil development that will make the Latin American nation a bigger crude producer than OPEC member Venezuela.Beijing has ordered telecom carriers like China Mobile Ltd. to replace foreign chips in their core networks by 2027, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% as of 11:32 a.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.8%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%The euro fell 0.8% to $1.0641The British pound fell 0.8% to $1.2449The Japanese yen rose 0.1% to 153.08 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 1.3% to $69,591.34Ether fell 2.1% to $3,450.59BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.51%Germany’s 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to 2.36%Britain’s 10-year yield declined seven basis points to 4.14%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.1% to $86.80 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.7% to $2,389.80 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Alex Longley, Jack Wittels, Jack Ryan, Sybilla Gross, Michael Mackenzie and Michael Msika.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and HyundaiRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data CentersCocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the BeanEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Motley Fool,Is Teladoc Stock a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teladoc-stock-buy-175100112.html,Has the telehealth provider entered value territory?,"Investor sentiment surrounding Teladoc (NYSE: TDOC) has been bad for a while now. The telemedicine specialist's stock is down 95% from its all-time high in 2021.Teladoc's business boomed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting enormously by providing at-home virtual care to patients. But like so many of the other ""stay-at-home"" stocks, Teladoc has struggled mightily since life returned to normal. The company is not currently profitable, and with demand for virtual care waning, investors have mostly thrown in the towel.To cap off the misery of the past three years, Teladoc's CEO abruptly left the at the beginning of April, catching investors off-guard, with the company giving no reason for the change in leadership. The company named CFO Mala Murthy as acting chief executive officer while it searches for a replacement leader. Murthy remains CFO as well. Teladoc's earnings have never lived up to Wall Street's hypeDespite great promise and a successful, wide-ranging deployment of virtual medical care technology, Teladoc has struggled to earn positive net income. The slowing demand for virtual care combined with continued losses stemming partially from the acquisition of Livongo Health led the company to record an impairment of non-cash goodwill of over $13 billion in 2022.For 2023, Teladoc lost $220 million, or $1.34 per share. This was a huge improvement over the impairment-impacted results of 2022, but still left the market cold on the stock.Teladoc generates free cash flow and trades at less than 1 times salesTeladoc is losing money and revenue expectations have fallen accordingly, but it's not all bad news at the company. Unlike many formerly high-flying tech stocks, Teladoc generates positive free cash flow. In 2023, it generated more than $190 million in free cash flow. Its current price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is 12. In fact, the company is reporting accounting losses primarily due to stock-based compensation (a non-cash charge) rather than a deficit of operating cash. In 2023, Teladoc disclosed $201 million in non-cash stock-based compensation charges.Story continuesPerhaps even more appealing to fundamentals-focused investors, Teladoc is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of less than 1 (0.92), an indicator of relative value.For context, consider competitor Doximity, which trades at a P/S ratio around 12. Doximity's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is an inflated 29. While it should be noted that Doximity is turning a profit, Teladoc's stock is significantly undervalued in comparison.Teladoc could be a buyThings may have been ugly the past three years, but Teladoc has done a great job of ""taking a big bath"" by disclosing reams of bad news in a short time period. Investors can't reasonably expect a surge in net earnings or a return to the frothy valuations of 2021, but Teladoc stock is trading at a very attractive P/S ratio of less than 1. Furthermore, the company has a proven track record of generating positive free cash flow.Management is also taking steps to improve results while revenue growth remains weak. Its cost-saving efficiency program is projected to boost gross margin by as much as 1 percentage point in the next three years. Executives also expect adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to increase by nearly $100 million by the end of 2025. The recovery may be slow, but it seems that the company has at least hit bottom.With the stock down so sharply from its peak, and more than 52% off its 52-week high, Teladoc merits a serious look. Patient investors looking to invest in a turnaround story with the safety of positive free cash flow and substantial value compared to direct competitors should look no further.Should you invest $1,000 in Teladoc Health right now?Before you buy stock in Teladoc Health, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Teladoc Health wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Think Nvidia's Stock Price Is Too High? Maybe Not, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-nvidias-stock-price-too-174738288.html,Fast sales and earnings growth make this stock price look cheap.,"At its current share price of $888, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock costs more than 3 times what it did a year ago. It's up 238%, to be precise, and now sells for a seemingly outrageous 37 times trailing sales.And yet, if you ask the bankers at Raymond James, $888 isn't an unreasonable valuation for Nvidia stock at all. And Nvidia stock could hit $1,100 within a year.Is Nvidia stock a buy at $888?Nvidia shares may cost 3x what they did a year ago, but the stock is actually down 7% from highs hit three weeks ago, when the stock was approaching $1,000. Why? Nvidia may be a victim of its own success, as investors worry artificial intelligence customers will hold off on buying Nvidia's current H100 chips in hopes of buying the company's next generation of Blackwell chips, which are expected to be 4 times as powerful.Not to worry, says Raymond James. Keeping its strong buy rating on the stock, RJ argues there's still more demand than supply for AI chips, and buyers will count themselves lucky if they can get even H100s today -- and are unlikely to postpone buying in hopes of getting Blackwells tomorrow. Basically, the thinking is that whether it's H100s, H200s, or B100s/200s -- any AI chips Nvidia is able to build, it will also be able to sell.And until its competitors catch up, this may remain the case. Far from predicting a slowdown, most analysts agree Nvidia sales are likely to more than double to $60.9 billion this year -- then more than triple over the next four years, hitting $196.3 billion in 2028. That works out to an annualized sales growth rate of 49%. Projections for long-term earnings growth are even more stunning: 92% annualized through 2028.As silly as it sounds, Nvidia stock at 37 times sales, and 76 times earnings today, may actually be cheap.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Coupang Stock Was Climbing Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coupang-stock-climbing-today-173507183.html,Shares of the South Korean e-commerce company jumped on a price hike.,"Shares of Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) were on the move today as the South Korean e-commerce company jumped on reports that it was raising the membership fee for its Amazon Prime-like Wow service.As of 12:39 p.m. ET, the stock was up 10% on the news.Image source: Getty Images.Coupang pulls a big profit leverAccording to The Korea Times, Coupang is raising the monthly price on its Wow membership by 58% to $5.74 a month.The move has attracted controversy for being overly aggressive, but should help beef up Coupang's profit margins and allow it to expand Wow benefits like free shipping, free returns, a streaming service, and free food delivery. The company finished 2023 with 14 million Wow members.The move also seems designed to give Coupang an advantage against incoming competition from Chinese rivals like Alibaba.Coupang has now nearly tripled the price of the Wow membership since it launched nearly three years ago, causing some subscribers to balk at the increase, but the company argued that Wow members save much more money than the cost of the membership.What's next for CoupangCoupang has embraced a similar e-commerce business model to Amazon and Prime has become a ""core pillar"" of Amazon's business. Indeed, it's hard to imagine Prime losing customers en masse even if Amazon raised prices aggressively.Investors should be paying attention to see if Coupang gets much pushback, but the price for Wow still seems modest given its benefits. Additionally, investing in the service for long-term growth makes sense.The e-commerce company seems to have a lot of potential, especially as it expands beyond Korea, and the price hike should add to profits and support future growth. Given that, it's not surprising investors are responding favorably to the news.Should you invest $1,000 in Coupang right now?Before you buy stock in Coupang, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coupang wasn’t one of them.

Bankrate,Best monthly dividend stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-monthly-dividend-stocks-164202740.html,Monthly dividend stocks let you experience the joy of getting paid 12 times a year.,"Dividend stocks are a popular way for investors to generate income, especially retired investors who need reliable cash flow. While most dividends are paid on a quarterly basis, some companies make their payouts on a monthly basis, and many investors like the greater frequency, in part because it can help them structure their own budgets more effectively.One of the best parts of dividend stocks is the pleasure of seeing your payout deposited in your brokerage account without you having to lift a finger – real passive income. And monthly dividend stocks let you experience that joy 12 times a year instead of just the typical four times.Here are seven top monthly dividend stocks, an often-overlooked source for monthly dividends as well as what to watch out for as you search for monthly dividend stocks.7 best monthly dividend stocksWe looked through the relatively small number of companies paying monthly dividends and sorted out some of the best that had the following characteristics (data as of April 9, 2024):Traded on U.S. exchanges, for easy accessibilityMarket capitalization of more than $1 billion, for some financial stabilityNo business development companies (BDC), which are a risky segment that often pays monthly dividendsMonthly dividends are particularly popular among real estate investment trusts (REITs) because these companies must pay out substantial dividends by law, and they have business models with recurring revenue (rents) that help support reliable cash flow.1. Realty Income (O)Realty Income is a REIT whose identity is predicated on monthly dividends, as it calls itself “The Monthly Dividend Company.” This company owns single-unit commercial properties that it leases to high-quality tenants for long terms, typically more than 10 years.Market cap: $46.6 billionYield: 5.8 percent2. SL Green (SLG)You might not be familiar with the name, but SL Green is the REIT behind a lot of Big Apple offices. In fact, the firm bills itself as “New York City’s largest owner of office real estate.” Despite concerns about employees continuing to work from home, New York City remains a top market for this type of real estate.Story continuesMarket cap: $3.6 billionYield: 5.6 percent3. STAG Industrial (STAG)This REIT focuses on industrial properties and warehouses, niches that have performed well amid the rise of e-commerce, particularly since the advent of COVID. STAG is a strong performer and expects to grow significantly in the years ahead as e-commerce continues to rise.Market cap: $7.1 billionYield: 3.9 percent4. AGNC Investment (AGNC)AGNC Investment is a REIT, but a specific type called a mortgage REIT, which owns mortgages on real estate rather than the properties themselves. In this REIT’s case, it buys safer agency-backed residential mortgages. The company has been public for more than 15 years and has paid sizable dividends along the way, though the dividend fluctuates depending on the economic climate.Market cap: $6.8 billionYield: 14.8 percent5. Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE)This lodging REIT operates more than 200 hotels under some of the industry’s most well-known brands, including Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt. While Apple got hit hard by the pandemic like many of its peers and had to cut its dividend, it’s now back to making a monthly payout.Market cap: $3.9 billionYield: 5.8 percent6. EPR Properties (EPR)EPR calls itself an experiential REIT, and that’s because it focuses on properties where consumers can have a good time, such as movie theaters, ski resorts and other cultural venues. It’s been investing in experiential properties for more than 20 years, and while it also had to eliminate its dividend during the pandemic, it’s back to making a monthly payout.Market cap: $3.2 billionYield: 7.9 percent7. Agree Realty (ADC)Agree is another name behind the name: It owns more than 1,500 properties that it leases to well-known retail companies, such as Advance Auto Parts, PetSmart, AutoZone and many more. This REIT converted to a monthly payout schedule in 2021, but it’s been public since 1994.Market cap: $5.9 billionYield: 5.2 percentCheck out closed-end funds for monthly dividendsThe number of monthly dividend-paying stocks is limited, and if you truly want a monthly dividend stream, you’d have to buy many of them, or you’ll still mostly have regular quarterly dividends. But you don’t want to put all your money in one or two monthly dividend payers, either, because you’ll take on significant risk for the modest benefit of that monthly payout.But investors do have one option if they’re looking for a diversified fund that pays out monthly: closed-end funds (CEFs). These funds are collections of stocks and bonds, and they offer some diversification in their investments, helping to reduce their risk.It’s also useful to know that CEFs take on significant debt to make their investments, meaning that they can fluctuate a lot when the market gets volatile. If they have to trim their debt during tough times, it means they’ll also need to reduce their payout.Finally, it’s worth noting that savvy investors usually buy CEFs only when they’re trading below net asset value, that is, the price of all their assets minus their debt. That practice builds in a margin of safety on the investment, helping to protect investors, but it’s no guarantee of safety.What dividend investors should watch out forMonthly dividends can be attractive, but don’t get dazzled by the prospect of a regular monthly payout and forget that the underlying company still must thrive. You’ll want to look at the following issues —including a few of the secrets to successful dividend investing – when assessing your monthly dividend stocks:Dividend sustainability: Dividend sustainability is one of the key things to watch, regardless of how often your company makes a payout. If a company cuts the payout, it could send the stock tumbling quickly. It makes little sense to buy a stock for its 5 percent dividend only for it to fall 20 percent when it has to reduce or eliminate the payout.Resilient business model: A company with a resilient business model will thrive in good times and not do so poorly in the bad times, giving it more wherewithal to pay its dividend and ideally grow it over time. Plus, a resilient business model helps the company from having to cut its payout when times get tough.High recurring cash flows: A business with high recurring cash flow, such as a subscription business or a real estate business, has greater stability, giving it the ability to safely pay dividends.Those are three issues that investors counting on dividends should pay particular attention to, but those are in addition to other issues that you need to analyze when investing in individual stocks. These issues are less pertinent when you buy the best dividend ETFs, however.And those looking for any kind of sustainable dividend stock (not just the monthly payers) should investigate the Dividend Aristocrats, which have an enviable record of returns.Bottom lineIt can be nice to get paid from your investments on a monthly basis, but it’s vital to remember that dividend sustainability is more important than how often you get paid. After all, you could divide the typical quarterly dividend into three parts and pay yourself each month. So, focus on finding companies that have a strong record of paying – and ideally – growing their payouts.Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

Some veterinarians are refining the use of Librela and Solensia.But Zoetis told the Wall Street Journal that these side effects represent a fraction of the more than 18 million shots of both drugs given in the U.S. and internationally.Veterinarians and pet owners have reported positive outcomes with the medications.However, neither the company nor researchers in arthritis and animal health have identified any connection between the drugs and the reported adverse effects, the WSJ report added.In March, the European Commission initiated an investigation into whether Zoetis hindered the market launch of a competing pain medication for dogs.The European Commission said that Zoetis, while working on Librela, also acquired another pain relief product in its late stages of development for the same purpose.

Overexcited AI companies have ordered double or triple the amount of chips they need from suppliers like Nvidia in their rush to secure them, meaning the market will be flooded, he continued.""Everything goes in the toilet, that's the history of these companies,"" Felder said.Chipmakers like Nvidia could even swing from explosive growth in revenues and profits to declines, which could mean ""some real pain for a lot of these stock prices that have discounted a fantastical future,"" Felder said.Story continuesThe markets guru also called out the recent surge in insiders selling their companies' stock as a red flag, pointing to Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon as examples.""This is a very, very dangerous equity environment,"" he said.Economic troubleMany on Wall Street expect the US economy to escape a recession, inflation and interest rates to drop this year, and unemployment to remain near historic lows.However, Felder expects ""much more of a stagflationary type of a scenario than a soft-landing or even a no-landing scenario.""The ex-trader and former hedge fund boss said the economy probably wouldn't be ""trashed"" like it was during the pandemic or Great Recession.There's likely to be more of a ""slow burn"" than a ""real painful dip"" in growth, he said. Joblessness might tick higher, and the economy might only shrink in real terms as inflation more than offsets nominal growth, he noted.Felder pointed to ageing populations in many Western countries, and deglobalization trends like reshoring, as two structural forces that will likely stop inflation from falling too far.He also cited vast amounts of government spending, the rising cost of servicing the national debt, and the Fed potentially relaxing its 2% inflation target as other inflation drivers.""It's overwhelming evidence that inflation's going to remain elevated relative to recent history,"" Felder said.If he's right, that's likely to mean interest rates stay higher for longer, the economy grows slower and might even contract, and assets like stocks perform worse than many experts predict.Read the original article on Business Insider"
