(NYSE: BHVN) announced today that 20 abstracts, including 8 oral presentations and 12 posters, will be featured this weekend starting April 13th at the 2024 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, taking place in Denver, Colorado. The presentations highlight Biohaven's leadership in neuroscience and extensive development programs evaluating novel therapies to treat neurological diseases, with abstracts covering programs that include Kv7 ion channel modulation, molecular degraders of extracellular protein (MoDEs), TRPM3 antagonism, TYK2/JAK1 inhibition, glutamate modulation, and myostatin inhibition. Irfan Qureshi, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Biohaven, commented, ""The research being presented at the AAN Annual Meeting emphasizes Biohaven's commitment to developing new therapeutic options across a range of neurological diseases. By targeting novel mechanisms of action, differentiated from currently available treatments and other therapies in development, and following innovative science, Biohaven continues to strive for better treatments for people living with neurological disorders. We are particularly honored that the AAN Science Committee selected our BHV-2100 (TRPM3) abstract as an AAN Abstract of Distinction, recognizing it as the top abstract in the pain category. Following the completion of Phase 1 studies in the first half of 2024, we look forward to initiating a Phase 2 study with BHV-2100 in migraine in the second half of the year and are excited by the potential for this novel nonopioid approach to treat pain."" Vlad Coric M.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Biohaven, added, ""Our leadership in neuroscience research is on full display at the AAN Annual Meeting with the breadth and depth of clinical, epidemiological, and preclinical programs highlighted in our scientific presentations. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders continue to represent one of the highest unmet medical needs facing our society and we must act urgently to bring better treatments to patients and improve clinical outcomes. We believe that the next generation of therapies for CNS disorders will include MoDEs for autoimmune disorders, ion channel modulation for epilepsy, migraine and other pain disorders, immune modulation for neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, myostatin targeting drugs for neuromuscular disorders and glutamate modulating agents for neuropsychiatric disorders. I am so proud of the team at Biohaven who are working tirelessly to alleviate the burden of these devastating disorders."" The complete list of Biohaven's accepted abstract titles is below.
