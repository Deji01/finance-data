Schaeffer's Investment Research,Apple Stock Could Notch New Record High,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-could-notch-record-194747011.html,The tech stock has more room to run,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock sports a 21.7% year-over-year lead, but is already down 6.5% in 2024. The shares are today pacing for their third-straight daily drop, last seen down 0.2% at $180.76, and have recently slipped back below familiar pressure at the $166 level. AAPL hit a Dec. 14, record high of $199.62, and thanks to a historically bullish trendline may soon notch a fresh peak.Apple stock is within one standard deviation of its 260-day moving average. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's data, the equity saw three similar signals in the past three years, defined for this study as having traded north of this trendline 80% of the time in the last two months, and in eight of the last 10 trading days.AAPL 260 DayJust one month later after 67% of those instances, the security was higher, averaging an 11.8% gain. A comparable move from its current perch would place AAPL at a brand-new record high of $202.08. Now looks like the right time to speculate with options, too, which are affordably priced. Apple stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 19% sits higher than 19% of readings from the last 12 months -- a relatively low reading."

Eight companies are considering selling US investment-grade bonds Tuesday, according to an informal survey of underwriters. The offerings come a day after 18 companies tapped the market, bringing February issuance to a record.Rates have climbed as Treasury investors contend with an erosion in expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this year — a policy shift that would likely fuel a bond rally — and an onslaught of new corporate issuance that has given yield-seeking investors ample alternatives.“We continue to recommend investors act soon to lock in currently attractive bond yields,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We particularly like the five-year duration segment of quality bonds, as this part of the yield curve offers the best combination of high yields, stability, and sensitivity to falling interest rate expectations.”Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.29%. The S&P 500 hovered near 5,060. Megacaps edged lower. Chevron Corp. and Hess Corp. slipped after Exxon Mobil Corp. said it’s considering a move that could break up the companies’ $53 billion merger and increase its share of Guyana’s giant offshore oil reserves. Macy’s Inc. climbed on plans to close almost a third of its namesake US locations. A bullish outlook from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. spurred an industry rally. Bitcoin hovered around $57,000.Story continuesTraders refrained from making big bets ahead of Thursday’s inflation data and a parade of central bank speakers. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman repeated her expectation that inflation will continue to decline further with interest rates held at their current level — but said it’s too soon to begin rate cuts.Officials have stressed they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs and will only do so once they’re confident that inflation is retreating on a sustained basis. The personal consumption expenditures price index will likely validate that stance and possibly further diminish market expectations for a rate cut in the coming months.“Because market expectations for a Fed cut this quarter have already reset, we don’t anticipate strong volatility resulting from this data print,” said Lauren Goodwin at New York Life Investments. “However, since market activity is likely to be heavily driven by interest rate expectations for the foreseeable future, we are watching closely for any surprises.”To Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management, while the equity market seems due for a pause and a consolidation of its recent gains, key PCE inflation data on Thursday could be the next short-term catalyst for the market, as investors are looking for additional data to help confirm if inflation is truly re-accelerating.“This is a ‘teflon’ stock market, which has shown a remarkable ability to shake off bad news and focus on what is positive,” he noted. “Nothing bad has been able to stick to the markets for long – such as upside surprises in inflation data and delayed Fed rate cut expectations.”Barclays Plc was the latest bank to ramp up its year-end target on the S&P 500 — following increases from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS Group AG, and Piper Sandler & Co. Strategists led by Venu Krishna boost forecast on US equity benchmark to 5,300 from 4,800.“The US economy continues to defy rates headwinds in 2024, much as mega​-​cap tech continues to defy even the most bullish earnings targets,” they wrote.Indeed, the “Magnificent Seven” group of tech megacaps saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group has helped power the Nasdaq 100 to a record high and its fourth consecutive monthly gain.S&P 500 companies are headed for their highest quarterly earnings beat rate since the fourth quarter of 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Wendy Soong. With more than 90% of S&P 500 companies having reported results, the gauge is on track for 7.7% year-on-year earnings per share growth, blowing past the pre-season forecast for 1.2%.The stock market is responding, with the S&P 500 last week logging its 13th closing record of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 39,000 for the first time. It’s telling that the milestones all occurred while investors speculated that the Fed will be in no rush to cut interest rates after a batch of hot inflation news and pushback from officials.To Kristina Hooper at Invesco, there is a perception that the US stock market is trading at very lofty valuations. While it is true that the S&P 500 is trading at an above-average price-to-earnings ratio, much of that is driven by just a few stocks, she noted.“The good news is that this narrow group of stocks — dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” — have been meeting the high expectations set for them,” Hooper said. “Given their collective performance, valuations for the Magnificent Seven remain elevated compared to the broader US equity market, but their earnings growth is expected to be almost five times that of the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 over the next years,”“This isn’t ‘irrational exuberance’ — it’s more like ‘rational exuberance,’ she concluded.Matt Maley at Miller Tabak has a word of caution.He says that after the big run in equities, the market is showing signs of froth. While that doesn’t mean stocks will roll over in a big way soon, it is a reason for investor to avoid being too complacent.“The stock market could easily continue to advance,” Maley noted. “However, we believe that it’s important for investors to remain nimble and to have a plan in place — in advance — for what they will do if some sort of significant ‘surprise’ creates a big increase in volatility at some point in the coming months.”Corporate Highlights:Viking Therapeutics Inc. soared after results from a mid-stage trial suggested the biotech company may field a viable competitor to weight-loss drugs from Eli Lilly & Co. and Novo Nordisk A/S.Warner Bros.

Motley Fool,Here's Why AutoZone Stock Hit a New All-Time High Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-autozone-stock-hit-193900703.html,This stock has tripled in the last five years.,"Shares of auto-parts retail chain AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) hit new all-time highs on Tuesday after the company reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2024. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, AutoZone stock was up almost 6%.Another good quarter for shareholdersIn Q2 (which ended on Feb. 10), AutoZone generated net sales of $3.9 billion, which was up almost 5% from the same quarter of last year. The growth came from opening new stores and a modest 3% increase in same-store sales.AutoZone's sales were basically what the market was expecting, but its profits outperformed. In Q2, the company had an operating-profit margin of 19.3%. That's up from an operating margin of 18.2% in the prior-year period.Higher margins led to higher profits for AutoZone. And with its profits, the company did what it does best -- buy back stock. It used $224 million to repurchase shares in Q2. This continues its long-term trend of share-count reduction, which has consistently boosted its earnings per share (EPS), as the chart below shows.AZO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) ChartWhat's next for AutoZone stock?There's nothing complicated about AutoZone's approach to market-beating stock performance. It runs a tight ship, earns a strong profit, and buys back stock. As long as the company keeps this simple formula in place, it will be hard to bet against AutoZone stock -- it's up over 200% in just the last five years.Indeed, it plans to keep the formula in place. As of the end of Q2, AutoZone still had $2.1 billion remaining in its share repurchase authorization. That's good for about 4% of outstanding shares at today's price, which can keep boosting its earnings per share in the coming year.Should you invest $1,000 in AutoZone right now?Before you buy stock in AutoZone, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AutoZone wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Norwegian Cruise Line Stock Jumped on Tuesday,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-norwegian-cruise-line-stock-191100138.html,This company is smoothly sailing now after years of choppy seas.,"Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH) jumped on Tuesday after the cruise-ship company reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. As of 1:10 p.m. ET, Norwegian stock was up about 16%.The trends are right for NorwegianThe company technically reported mixed results for Q4. Revenue was ahead of guidance, whereas its net loss was a little more than expected.But this stock is soaring today because of the positive prevailing trends in the business. The cruise line can carry more cruisers now than ever (higher capacity), has full occupancy, average ticket prices are up, and onboard spending is up, as well.Those are the big-picture trends that are meaningful to Norwegian's business. And because the trends are good, the company is guiding for better-than-expected financial results in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.Specifically, Norwegian is calling for Q1 adjusted net income of $50 million, while Wall Street had expected an adjusted net loss. For the year, the company is expecting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.2 billion, a strong 18% increase from 2023.Norwegian is going to make itAll of the cruise-ship companies incurred significant debt during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, including Norwegian. However, the company is paying it down at an admirable pace.In 2023, the company had net cash from operating activities of $2 billion and repaid $1.9 billion in debt. That's a really good start.On its current trajectory, it will be able to meet its financial needs although it won't be without some dilution to shareholders. Some of its debt will convert to shares because of how it was arranged.This dilution could have a mild adverse impact on Norwegian stock. But the business is otherwise performing quite well, which should be encouraging news for shareholders.Should you invest $1,000 in Norwegian Cruise Line right now?Before you buy stock in Norwegian Cruise Line, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Norwegian Cruise Line wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,"Barclays believes the S&P 500 could hit 6,000 soon — and it's not alone",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-believes-the-sp-500-could-hit-6000-soon--and-its-not-alone-190849325.html,Barclays and other Wall Street firms believe continued tech outperformance and a rebound in the US economy could lead stocks to their most optimistic bull case scenarios.,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) took more than two years to gain its last 1,000 points. There's an increasing number of Wall Street strategists that believe this time, it could take less than a year.As the S&P 500 recently surpassed 5,000 and continued to hit new records, strategists have raised their year-end targets. The latest is Barclays, which moved up its year-end price target to 5,300 from 4,800 as Big Tech earnings and the US economy continue to surprise consensus to the upside.But perhaps most notably, the firm isn't ruling out a better outcome than 5,300 either. Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna noted that if Big Tech earnings continue to outperform projections, the firm's bull case of 6,050 for the S&P 500 is likely.""On balance, we believe that risk/reward is tilted toward the bull case, as macro data suggest that the odds of an economic re-acceleration are beginning to outweigh the probability of even a mild recession, in our view,"" Krishna wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.Krishna added that continued Big Tech outperformance, combined with an earnings rebound in other sectors, is key.""If Big Tech extends its beat- and-raise streak and we assume ex-Tech negative revisions have bottomed, we could see the S&P 500 going to 6050 on $252 [earnings per share],"" Krishna wrote.Both Capital Economics and Yardeni Research have recently floated similar scenarios. Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni has a 5,400 target for the end of 2024 but sees the benchmark hitting 6,000 in 2025 and 6,500 in 2026.To Yardeni, continued outperformance from the US economy, and an increase in productivity, will drive the upside in stocks.""The big story is productivity is going to grow,"" Yardeni recently told Yahoo Finance. ""Technology is going to enable that. It's not just AI. And in that scenario, I see the stock market continuing to go higher, even if AI turns out to be somewhat disappointing in terms of relative to expectations because the expectations are awfully high right now.""Story continuesYardeni pointed out that this is happening in the American economy while other economies like China are lagging, making the US an attractive place for investment.""It looks like the US is going to continue to be an outstanding market, literally outstanding [and] standing out from everybody else,"" Yardeni said. ""And I think that's a big part of the story for me and why I think the market can continue to move higher.""Capital Economics chief market economist John Higgins predicts the S&P 500 can hit 6,500 by the end of 2025. This outlook is more dependent on the current AI-fueled bubble growing. For now, he maintains the bubble-like trade in the market can bring the benchmark average to 6,500 by the end of 2025.""Our end-2025 forecast of 6,500 for the index is premised on its valuation reaching a similar level to its peak during the dot com mania,"" Higgins wrote. ""The bubble in the S&P 500 that is forming now resembles the bubble that formed in the second half of the 1990s in many aspects, not least the way in which it is an attempt to capture the future benefits of a transformative technology.""""Nonetheless, its valuation remains far short of what it reached then suggesting that it has plenty more room to inflate.""A chart from Capital Economics shows that valuations based on a current price-to-forward-earnings ratio haven't reached the levels of the early 2000s dot-com bubble.

The company posted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.30 per share, beating the $1 estimate, despite sales that at $486 million missed expectations by $36 million.Earnings were up 94% on a per-share basis year over year thanks to a 350-basis-point improvement in gross margins. Sterling ended the year with a backlog of more than $2 billion in future business, a 46% increase from the end of 2022.CEO Joe Cutillo said the margin improvement was the result of ""the benefits of project selectivity and mix,"" and said he believes the momentum can continue into 2024.""We believe 2024 will be another year of bottom-line growth well in excess of our top-line growth,"" Cutillo said.

CEO Warren Buffett is renowned not just for his investments in blue-chip stocks but also for his advice on market dynamics. At the 2010 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders meeting, he revealed his approach to evaluating market health.Buffett articulated a somewhat paradoxical metric, suggesting that a decrease in housing starts could signal a healthier market ahead.“You want a bad number for a while. The only way you clean up an excess inventory is to have more demand than supply for a while,” he said.This advice illuminates the counterintuitive wisdom that sometimes, less immediate growth (in terms of new housing starts) could pave the way for a more balanced and sustainable recovery in the housing sector.Fast forward to August 2023, and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway proved its faith in the housing market’s potential by making a substantial investment in the sector. The conglomerate acquired shares in not one but three major homebuilders: D.R. Horton Inc., NVR Inc. and Lennar Corp., with a combined investment nearing $800 million. This move was a vote of confidence in these companies and a broader bet on the housing market’s resilience and potential for growth. It reflected Buffett’s knack for identifying value even in sectors that may be perceived as under duress or facing near-term headwinds.In 2024, the housing market is complex, marked by challenges related to affordability, inventory levels and mortgage rates. Yet, it is also a time of cautious optimism, with predictions pointing toward a slight improvement in market conditions.Realtor.com’s 2024 housing forecast indicates a market slowly shifting in favor of buyers and renters, supported by a slight ease in home prices and mortgage rates alongside a mild decline in rents. Specifically, the forecast anticipates a 1.7% decrease in home prices and a subtle drop in mortgage rates to an average of 6.8%, with a slight decline to 6.5% by the end of the year.Story continuesMore on Buffett: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Rents are expected to decrease by 0.2%, making renting a marginally more budget-friendly option. However, the supply of existing homes is predicted to decrease by 14% year over year as many homeowners choose to stay put, benefiting from previously low mortgage rates. This trend aligns with a market moving toward equilibrium as new construction and rental supplies continue to enter the market, albeit slowly. Realtor.com suggests that while these changes are modest, they represent a move toward a more balanced market, providing some relief to buyers and renters after years of rapid price increases and tight supply​.Buffett’s strategic investments in homebuilders reflect a deliberate approach that diverges from speculative market timing for immediate returns. This strategy emphasizes recognizing the intrinsic value and the enduring growth prospects in the housing sector. Such an approach is especially relevant for individual investors navigating the complexities of real estate investment, promoting a focus on fundamental assessment and long-term potential.In light of this, many investors are adopting innovative strategies to participate in the real estate market without needing to time their investments perfectly. Platforms enabling the purchase of shares in individual properties for as little as $100 are democratizing access to real estate investment, allowing investors to potentially benefit from the sector’s long-term growth. These platforms offer a way to diversify investment portfolios and gain exposure to real estate with minimal initial capital, aligning with the ethos of seeking value and growth potential over time, much like Buffett’s investment philosophy. These platforms facilitate portfolio diversification and real estate exposure with minimal initial investment, aligning with the principles of seeking sustainable value.It’s not about making a quick buck; it’s about understanding the basics of the market and betting on things that offer real, lasting value.Read Next:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.
