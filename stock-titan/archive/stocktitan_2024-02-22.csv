(BHM) announces a $5.0 million share repurchase plan for its Class A common stock, following SEC regulations. The repurchase plan is flexible and subject to market conditions, aiming to enhance shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bluerock Homes Trust's announcement of a share repurchase plan signifies the company's confidence in its intrinsic value and financial stability. Share buybacks often lead to an appreciation in stock value as they reduce the number of shares available in the market, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) and the stock's scarcity. It is essential to consider the size of the buyback relative to the company's market capitalization. A $5.0 million repurchase plan may have a modest impact if the market cap is significantly large. Investors should evaluate the repurchase plan in the context of the company's overall capital allocation strategy, including investments in growth and debt reduction. Market Research Analyst The implementation of a share repurchase plan under Rule 10b-18 indicates a structured approach to buybacks, minimizing potential market disruption. By adhering to certain volume and timing restrictions, Bluerock Homes Trust aims to avoid creating artificial price movements. Market conditions will influence the execution of this plan and investors should monitor the housing market trends, as they can affect the company's stock performance and the perceived success of the repurchase program. Additionally, the repurchase plan's one-year term provides the company with flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. Legal Expert Conducting the repurchase under the Exchange Act's Rule 10b-18 provides Bluerock Homes Trust with a 'safe harbor' from potential market manipulation allegations. However, the company must still comply with Rule 10b-5, which prohibits trading on material non-public information. The plan's compliance with these rules is crucial for maintaining shareholder trust and avoiding legal repercussions. Stakeholders should be aware that while the plan offers protection against certain legal risks, it does not guarantee protection against all possible regulatory or legal challenges. 02/22/2024 - 03:05 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc.

(FE), is upgrading 3.5 miles of a high-voltage power line in Monmouth County to enhance reliability for 3,950 customers. The $11 million project includes installing new poles, wires, and equipment designed to withstand severe weather and meet increased demand. The upgrade is part of a larger $223 million investment by JCP&L to improve over 60 miles of transmission lines in central New Jersey. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst Upgrading critical infrastructure, such as the 3.5 miles of high-voltage power line in Monmouth County, is a key development for FirstEnergy Corp. and its subsidiary JCP&L. This $11 million investment into modernizing the electrical grid indicates a proactive approach to addressing the dual challenges of aging infrastructure and increasing demand for electricity. The replacement of old equipment with new poles and wires designed to withstand severe weather is essential for reducing the risk of outages. This is particularly relevant given the trend towards more extreme weather patterns due to climate change.The capacity to carry more electrical load and accommodate greater customer demand is a significant factor in ensuring that the utility can keep pace with regional growth. In addition to immediate reliability improvements, this project aligns with the broader Energize365 program, which is a substantial $26 billion grid evolution initiative. By focusing on both transmission and distribution investments, FirstEnergy is positioning itself to meet future energy needs, including the integration of electric vehicles and clean energy sources.From a financial perspective, these investments are likely to be viewed favorably by investors as they suggest a long-term strategy aimed at maintaining and growing the utility's customer base. While the capital expenditure is substantial, the potential reduction in costs associated with outages and service disruptions could result in operational savings and improved customer satisfaction over time. Financial Analyst The strategic investment of $223 million to upgrade more than 60 miles of transmission lines in Monmouth County is a significant capital outlay for FirstEnergy. This initiative is part of a larger commitment to invest billions in infrastructure over the next few years. For stakeholders, the key points of interest will be the impact on FirstEnergy's balance sheet and the expected return on investment. Investors will analyze the cost versus benefits, considering the potential for increased revenue from a more reliable and capable grid.It is important to note that infrastructure upgrades can lead to regulatory rate base increases, allowing utilities to earn a return on their invested capital. This could potentially lead to higher future earnings. However, the timing of these returns and the regulatory approval process are critical factors that can affect the stock performance. Moreover, the utility sector is known for its stable but modest growth and large-scale investments must be managed carefully to maintain financial health and dividend payouts, which are key attractions for utility investors. Market Research Analyst FirstEnergy's investment in infrastructure upgrades is a response to evolving market demands. The transition to a smarter, more secure grid is not just a regional trend but a national one, as the energy sector adapts to the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the electrification of various sectors. The ability to accommodate electric vehicles and the electrification of homes and businesses is becoming a competitive differentiator for utilities.Market research indicates that consumers and businesses are increasingly valuing reliability and sustainability in their energy providers. FirstEnergy's focus on these areas could enhance its market position and brand reputation. However, the utility will need to effectively manage project timelines and costs to ensure that these infrastructure improvements translate into tangible benefits for customers and shareholders alike. 02/22/2024 - 02:31 PM New poles, wires and electrical equipment to be installed in Monmouth County HOLMDEL, N.J., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), has begun upgrading 3.5 miles of a high-voltage power line in Monmouth County to help prevent or minimize the impact of service disruptions for 3,950 customers. The work is part of a series of projects to improve the reliability of the transmission system benefiting more than 150,000 customers in the region. The 34.5-kilovolt power line runs northeast from JCP&L's Atlantic Substation in Colts Neck Township and into Tinton Falls Borough. As part of the $11 million project, JCP&L will replace the existing wires, hardware and structures that have been in place since the 1970s with new poles, wires and equipment designed to better withstand severe weather elements. The new wires can carry more electrical load and will be able to accommodate greater customer demand for electricity. They will also be able to carry increased power flow in the event of unplanned service interruptions on other lines in the area, helping to enhance reliability and minimize power outages. The majority of the new structures will be wood poles. The work is expected to be completed in late 2024. Jim Fakult, President of JCP&L: ""This important project will help reduce the risk of outages and ensure that our transmission system keeps pace with the growing demand for safe, reliable power by our customers in central Jersey."" The upgrade is the fifth in a series of projects designed to enhance reliability for JCP&L customers in central New Jersey. Overall, JCP&L is investing $223 million to upgrade more than 60 miles of transmission lines in the county. The project is part of Energize365, a multi-year grid evolution program focused on transmission and distribution investments that will deliver the power FirstEnergy's customers depend on today while also meeting the challenges of tomorrow.

Part 2 initiated with encouraging results. Safety and tolerability profile reported. Investor webcast scheduled. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of SUMMIT Part 2 marks a significant milestone in the clinical development of bezuclastinib for nonadvanced systemic mastocytosis (NonAdvSM). The reported 51% mean change in Total Symptom Score (TSS) and 49% improvement in quality-of-life (McQoL) at the 100 mg once-daily dose indicates a strong potential for bezuclastinib to become a leading treatment option. The safety profile, comparable to placebo, enhances its viability in a clinical setting. Considering the limited treatment options currently available for NonAdvSM, the introduction of an effective and well-tolerated therapy could address a significant unmet medical need, potentially leading to a rapid uptake in the market upon approval.From a research perspective, the 100% achievement rate in lowering baseline tryptase and variant allele fraction (VAF) in patients is noteworthy, as these are key biomarkers for disease burden in systemic mastocytosis. The reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden further substantiates the drug's efficacy. These pharmacodynamic results may not only support the drug's approval but also its adoption in clinical practice, as they align with measurable outcomes that healthcare providers consider when evaluating treatment efficacy. Financial Analyst The positive data from SUMMIT Part 1b and the initiation of Part 2 are likely to be well-received by investors, as they suggest a clear path forward for bezuclastinib's approval and commercialization. The robustness of the clinical data could potentially lead to a competitive advantage in the market for Cogent Biosciences. The projected completion of enrollment for SUMMIT Part 2 in Q2 2025 and the anticipated top-line results by the end of 2025 provide a timeline for investors to monitor. The company's pipeline progress, including the APEX and PEAK trials, could serve as additional catalysts for stock valuation changes. However, it's important to consider the costs associated with these trials and the financial runway needed to reach commercialization.Given the specificity of bezuclastinib's target population, sales forecasts would benefit from an understanding of the prevalence of NonAdvSM and GIST, pricing strategies and potential market penetration rates. The company's ability to capitalize on this opportunity will depend on successful trial outcomes, regulatory approval and effective commercial strategy execution. Market Research Analyst The clinical trial outcomes for bezuclastinib could disrupt the systemic mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treatment landscapes. The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data indicating significant improvements in symptom severity and quality of life are particularly compelling from a market perspective. These improvements align with the evolving focus on patient-centric care, where PRO measures are increasingly influential in drug adoption and reimbursement decisions. The novel Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary (MS2D2) and the Mast Cell Quality-of-Life (MC-QoL) scale may set a new standard for evaluating treatment impact in this therapeutic area.Furthermore, the potential positioning of bezuclastinib as a best-in-class KIT mutant inhibitor could allow Cogent to capture a significant share of the market, assuming the drug's efficacy and safety are confirmed in the ongoing trials. The company's strategic engagement with the NonAdvSM community and its focus on precision therapies for genetically defined diseases could facilitate targeted marketing and patient outreach efforts, enhancing market penetration upon drug approval. 02/22/2024 - 02:30 PM Registration-enabling SUMMIT Part 2 initiated and actively enrolling at 40 sites globally; RP2D selected at 100 mg once-daily optimized formulation based on: 51% week 12 mean change in Total Symptom Score (TSS), including 70% of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in TSS at week 12 49% week 12 mean improvement in quality-of-life (McQoL)Safety and tolerability profile generally similar to placebo with no grade 3/4 events; no bleeding, edema or cognitive events; no dose reductions and no discontinuations Cogent to host investor webcast tomorrow, February 23 at 8:00 a.m. ET WALTHAM, Mass. and BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cogent Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: COGT), a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases, today reported positive Part 1b data from the Company’s ongoing SUMMIT trial evaluating bezuclastinib in patients with nonadvanced systemic mastocytosis (NonAdvSM) at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting (AAAAI) meeting taking place February 23-26, 2024 in Washington, D.C. “The results from SUMMIT Part 1b show that bezuclastinib has the potential to provide NonAdvSM patients with a potent and well-tolerated KIT inhibitor that can drive rapid and clinically meaningful impact across a multitude of symptoms resulting in an impressive improvement in overall quality of life,” said PD Dr. Frank Siebenhaar, M.D., Head University Outpatient Clinic, Institute of Allergology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. “We are pleased to announce these positive results from our SUMMIT Part 1b trial, the specifics of our new MS2D2 symptomatic severity PRO measure, and the news that we have initiated SUMMIT Part 2, with extremely positive support from the NonAdvSM community,” said Andrew Robbins, Cogent’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The magnitude and speed of symptomatic reductions, along with corresponding improvements in quality-of-life, reported by patients in SUMMIT Part 1b has not been seen previously with other treatment options in this patient population. We are fully dedicated to our three actively enrolling, registration-directed clinical trials and see a clear path to establishing bezuclastinib as the best-in-class KIT mutant inhibitor for patients fighting systemic mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.” Patient DemographicsSUMMIT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial of bezuclastinib in patients with NonAdvSM. Thirty-four patients in Part 1b were treated with either bezuclastinib or placebo plus best supportive care. The median age of patients at study entry was 52 years (ranging from 27-76 years). Patients were enrolled with the following sub-types: 33 patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and one patient with smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM). One patient had received prior avapritinib. Safety DataThe majority of treatment emergent adverse events were low grade and reversible with no bleeding or cognitive impairment events reported across cohorts. There were no dose reductions in the 100 mg cohort and two dose reductions in the 150 mg cohort (Grade 1 ALT and Grade 2 abdominal pain). Only one serious adverse event (SAE) was reported in the 150mg cohort in which a patient experienced ALT/AST increase that led to discontinuation. Pharmacodynamic DataThirty-four patients enrolled in SUMMIT Part 1b were evaluated for signs of clinical activity over 12 weeks, including well-accepted biomarkers of disease burden. At the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100 mg once daily bezuclastinib, results showed: 100% of patients with baseline tryptase ≥20ng/mL achieved <20ng/mL at week 12 versus 0% of placebo patients100% of patients with detectable baseline variant allele fraction (VAF) achieved ≥50% reduction in KIT D816V VAF at week 12 versus 0% of placebo patients86% of patients with evaluable bone marrow samples achieved ≥50% reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden at week 12 versus 40% of placebo patients Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) DataThirty-four patients enrolled in SUMMIT Part 1b were evaluated for signs of clinical activity over 12 weeks using multiple PRO measures, including Cogent’s novel Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary (MS2D2) and the Mast Cell Quality-of-Life (MC-QoL) scale. At the RP2D 100 mg dose, patients reported: 51% week 12 mean change in MS2D2 TSS (improvement in overall symptom severity from baseline) versus 18% improvement for placebo Statistically significant reduction in total symptom severity after 12 weeks when compared to placebo (-23.78 vs. -9.03; p=0.0003)70% of patients achieved ≥50% reduction in MS2D2 TSS at Week 12 vs. 8% placebo patients 49% week 12 mean improvement in quality of life (MC-QoL) versus 24% for placebo Statistically significant improvement in quality of life after 12 weeks when compared to placebo (–24.86 vs. -12.39, p=0.046) Bezuclastinib Clinical Development Based on the complete SUMMIT Part 1 data, along with the recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, Cogent has initiated SUMMIT Part 2, a registration-directed, global, randomized placebo-controlled trial utilizing the 100 mg once daily dose of bezuclastinib. SUMMIT Part 2 is expected to include 159 patients and complete enrollment in Q2 2025, with estimated top-line results by the end of 2025. Patient enrollment continues on the registration-directed APEX trial which is expected to include approximately 65 AdvSM patients and remains on-track to complete enrollment by the end of 2024, with top-line results expected in mid-2025. In second-line Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) patients, Cogent continues to actively enroll the global Phase 3 PEAK trial and expects to complete enrollment by the end of 2024, with top-line results expected by the end of 2025.

"TD Bank Launches ""Tap to Pay on iPhone"" for Small and Micro Businesses",2024-02-22T19:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"TD Bank launches Tap to Pay on iPhone, a secure mobile payment solution for small and micro businesses, enhancing customer experience and offering convenience.","TD Bank Launches ""Tap to Pay on iPhone"" for Small and Micro Businesses Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TD Bank launches Tap to Pay on iPhone, a secure mobile payment solution for small and micro businesses, enhancing customer experience and offering convenience. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Tap to Pay on iPhone by TD Bank represents a significant shift in the payment processing landscape for small and micro businesses. This service eliminates the need for traditional point-of-sale (POS) hardware, potentially reducing overhead costs and increasing the ease of conducting transactions. The ability to accept various forms of contactless payments, including credit and debit cards, digital wallets and wearables, directly aligns with consumer preferences that have been trending towards contactless methods, particularly since the onset of the pandemic.From a market perspective, this innovation could enhance TD Bank's competitive position in the financial services sector, especially among small business owners who may prioritize convenience and cost savings. The service might also increase customer loyalty and attract new clients who are looking for streamlined payment solutions. However, the success of this initiative will depend on the reliability, security and user experience of the Tap to Pay feature. Financial Analyst TD Bank's strategic move to integrate Tap to Pay on iPhone could have financial implications for the bank and its small business customers. For TD Bank, the service could drive additional revenue streams by attracting a segment of the market that is underserved by traditional POS systems. The bank may also benefit from increased transaction volumes and the associated fees. Additionally, by leveraging existing infrastructure—customers' iPhones and the TD Bank Mobile App—the bank can minimize the costs associated with deploying and maintaining new hardware.For small and micro business owners, the primary source of income for a significant majority, the ability to accept contactless payments without investing in costly POS systems could improve profit margins. However, it is essential to monitor the adoption rate and to gauge whether the convenience translates into increased sales and customer satisfaction, which could indirectly impact the bank's stock performance. Technology Analyst The technology behind Tap to Pay on iPhone, powered by Autobooks, is a noteworthy development in financial technology (fintech). By integrating directly with the TD Bank Mobile App, the service simplifies the payment process for small businesses, allowing them to manage transactions alongside other financial activities like digital invoicing and accounting. This seamless integration could set a new industry standard for mobile banking and fintech solutions.However, the reliance on technology also introduces concerns about cybersecurity and data privacy. As businesses increasingly adopt mobile payment solutions, they become more vulnerable to potential breaches. TD Bank will need to ensure robust security measures are in place to protect sensitive financial information. The effectiveness of these security measures could influence customer trust and, by extension, the rate of adoption of Tap to Pay on iPhone. 02/22/2024 - 02:00 PM TD Bank is among the first large U.S. banks to debut Tap to Pay on iPhone, a secure mobile-based payment acceptance option that offers greater flexibility and convenience to small and micro businesses. CHERRY HILL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TD, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, today announced the launch of Tap to Pay on iPhone, enabling small and micro business owners across the U.S. to use their mobile phone for a seamless and secure point-of-sale (POS) experience.

""By equipping small businesses with modern conveniences and more technology through solutions like Tap to Pay on TD Bank Mobile App, we're helping small businesses have a seamless payment experience that's better aligned to customer expectations."" Customers Want: Easier, Better, Faster, Cheaper TD recently conducted a survey on micro businesses – defined as having 25 or fewer employees with an annual revenue of less than $100,000 – to understand how today's smallest businesses are transacting and processing payments. The survey revealed more than one-third (33%) of micro business owners (MBOs) are currently facing challenges in their day-to-day operations due to not having the necessary payment device or hardware to accept customers’ preferred payment method. ""We saw a massive consumer shift towards contactless payment adoption that started during the pandemic and continues through today,"" said Jo Jagadish, Head of Corporate Products & Services at TD Bank. ""Tap to Pay on TD Bank Mobile App offers even the smallest businesses a flexible and convenient payment solution that also delivers on customer preferences, like convenience and ease. For today's small and micro businesses, every sale – at any dollar amount – matters. By leveraging a mobile app to increase payment options, MBOs can be sure they'll never miss a cashless sale."" With the majority (81%) of MBOs relying on their business as their primary source of income, TD's Tap to Pay on iPhone will meet a critical and direct need of business owners that will help improve the overall customer experience, while eliminating MBOs' need for costlier POS devices and software. ""TD is on the front lines of our Main Street economies,"" said Amy Dinkar-Patel, Head of Small Business & Commercial Distribution at TD Bank. ""We hear small business customers' feedback and understand their pain points – which allows us to offer solutions that truly make their business stronger, more profitable and easier to run. With an offering like Tap to Pay on iPhone, we're improving the experience for our customer, and our customer's customer – it's a win all around.""

TD Merchant Solutions offers a variety of in-person, mobile, eCommerce and POS solutions so business owners can get paid by accepting customer payments in ways that work best for their business.

Negative None. Financial Analyst Share buybacks are a strategic financial maneuver that can signal a company's confidence in its own financial health and future prospects. In the case of Shell plc's announcement of purchasing shares for cancellation, several implications are worth noting. Firstly, the reduction of outstanding shares can contribute to an increase in earnings per share (EPS), potentially making the remaining shares more attractive to investors. This could lead to a positive impact on the stock price, as the market often reacts favorably to buyback announcements.However, it is crucial to consider the financial robustness of the company executing the buyback. Allocating capital to repurchase shares instead of investing in growth or paying down debt could be seen as a lack of viable investment opportunities or a move to artificially inflate stock prices. Investors should closely monitor the company's debt levels, cash flow and overall financial strategy to assess the long-term sustainability of such buybacks. Market Research Analyst Market perception of share buyback programs can vary and the context within which Shell is conducting this activity is key to understanding its potential market impact. The company has set pre-defined parameters for the buyback, which indicates a methodical approach rather than an opportunistic one. This could reassure investors of a disciplined capital allocation strategy.Additionally, the fact that trading decisions are made independently by Citigroup Global Markets Limited, within the given parameters, adds a layer of impartiality to the execution of the buyback program. It's important to observe the market's response in the days following the announcement to gauge the sentiment and potential shifts in investor confidence. Legal Expert Shell’s adherence to the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the detailed disclosure of trades is a critical aspect of the buyback program. Compliance with MAR ensures transparency and fairness in the market, which is essential for maintaining investor trust. The legal framework governing these transactions, including both EU MAR and UK MAR, is designed to prevent market manipulation and abuse.The company's LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) number is also provided, which is a unique identifier enabling transparent tracking of financial transactions.

The testing program is progressing with additional phases to support the Feasibility Study, showcasing promising results for the future of the project. Positive None. Negative None. Metallurgical Engineer An increase in copper recovery from metallurgical testing is a critical factor in enhancing the economic viability of a mining project. The reported 3.2% increase in recovery rate and the 8.3% reduction in net acid consumption can significantly impact the project's net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). From a metallurgical standpoint, the optimization of the heap leaching process, including crush size adjustments and pH level management, suggests a technical advancement that could reduce operational costs and improve metal extraction efficiency.Furthermore, the shift to a pH closer to 2.0 indicates a strategic move to minimize acid consumption without compromising copper recovery. This balance is essential in reducing environmental impacts and operational expenses related to acid procurement and handling. The scalability of the leaching protocol, as indicated by the ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 tests, will be critical to confirm these initial findings and ensure they can be replicated on a commercial scale. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the improved recovery rates are substantial. An after-tax NPV(8%) increase of approximately $262 million provides a strong indication of enhanced project profitability. When evaluating a mining project, investors closely monitor changes in recovery rates and acid consumption because these factors directly influence production costs and revenue. It's important to note that while the PEA's assumptions have been positively adjusted based on these results, the feasibility study will provide a more definitive economic analysis.Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with the scalability of these metallurgical improvements. While the results are promising, the transition from a controlled testing environment to full-scale production can present unforeseen challenges. Consequently, the upcoming feasibility study results will be pivotal in confirming the economic and technical applicability of these findings. Environmental Consultant The reduction in sulfuric acid consumption not only has financial benefits but also environmental ones. Lowered acid requirements can lead to a smaller environmental footprint, which is increasingly important in project evaluations, especially given the heightened global focus on sustainable mining practices. The application of bioleaching technology, which utilizes naturally occurring bacteria, aligns with environmentally responsible mining methods. However, it's crucial to monitor the long-term stability and effectiveness of the bacterial cultures in the leaching process to ensure consistent recovery rates over the life of the mine.As the project progresses, environmental impact assessments will need to address the potential changes in acid mine drainage and waste management strategies due to altered acid consumption. These assessments will be integral in securing operational permits and maintaining social license to operate. 02/22/2024 - 01:24 PM Metallurgical Testing Delivers a 3.2% Increase in Predicted Copper Recovery at Los AzulesTORONTO, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- McEwen Copper Inc., 47.7% owned by McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX), is pleased to announce results from the recently completed Phase 1 copper heap leaching metallurgical tests undertaken at SGS Chile Limitada in Santiago, Chile. The test results were produced utilizing conventional bio-heap leaching technology and generated an average copper recovery of 76.0%. This represents an increase of 3.2% over the recovery rate used in the June 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for Los Azules. These test results were reviewed by Jim Sorensen and Michael McGlynn at Samuel Engineering Inc., who are responsible for the development and oversight of the metallurgical programs. Phase 1 Results Based on the Phase 1 test results available at the time and prior historical column test work, the PEA used an average copper recovery of 72.8% by employing conventional bio-heap leaching technology (see results published June 20th, 2023). Final results of Phase 1 show an increase in the average recovery to 76.0% in approximately 230 days of leaching over the planned 27-year life of the project. Average net acid consumption was also reduced by 8.3% relative to the PEA. The potential impact of the 3.2% increase in average recovery and 8.3% reduction in net acid consumption can be illustrated by selectively adjusting the PEA Base Case financial model, which results in a life of mine copper cathode production increase of 172,000 tonnes and an after-tax NPV(8%) increase of approximately $262 million. This disclosure should not be taken to modify or update the conclusions of the PEA. Deposit Mineralogy Located in San Juan, Argentina, the Los Azules deposit consists primarily of secondary copper mineralization (supergene zone of predominantly chalcocite), with minimal oxide copper content. Additionally, there is a deeper primary copper (hypogene zone of predominantly chalcopyrite with some zones of significant bornite). Metallurgical Testing Phases Preliminary results from the Phase 1 program along with historical metallurgical testing at Los Azules were used to support the 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), which proposed an environmentally friendly heap leach alternative to a conventional copper concentrator. The testing program is now advancing with two additional phases (2 & 3) currently underway to support the Feasibility Study (FS). Drilling activities related to the current study work started in 2021 and are continuing into 2024. The leach testing protocols are based on conventional bio-leaching methods used extensively in commercial applications for supergene copper mineralization. The current phases, 2 & 3, are being conducted at SGS Chile and Alfred H. Knight (ASMIN Industrial Limitada) laboratories, both located in Santiago, Chile. The Phase 1 program was initiated using drill core from drilling programs completed prior to 2021, but not older than 2015, for a total of 21 column tests. Started in 2022, Phase 1 has now been completed and final results received. Preliminary results of this work and prior historical leach testing information were used for the PEA metallurgical assumptions. The Phase 2 program utilizes drill core from the 2022-2023 drilling campaign and focuses on deposit-wide variability testing, leaching protocol optimization and scalability. A total of 34 column tests are in progress, with results expected in Q2 2024. The Phase 3 program is also started, utilizing additional drill core material from the ongoing 2023-2024 drilling program. Phase 3 testing is focusing on the material of the initial 5-year mine plan, as delineated in the PEA. A total of 33 additional column tests are planned as part of this final confirmatory testing program, with results anticipated in Q4 2024. The combined metallurgical programs comprise a total of 88 column tests to be used for the FS metallurgical design basis and geo-metallurgical model. Copper assaying is conducted using a sequential method to determine the relative amounts of acid soluble (CuAS) and cyanide soluble (CuCN) copper mineralization (oxides and secondary sulfides). When combined, these two partial assay methods are generally considered readily soluble copper (CuSOL), extractable with conventional heap leaching technologies. Copper assayed that does not report to these two partial assay methods is classified as residual copper (CuRES) and is considered copper that requires additional time or is potentially not recoverable with conventional heap leaching technologies. The finalized results from the Phase 1 metallurgy program for tests completed at minus ½"" and ¾"" crush sizes confirmed that soluble copper (CuSOL) component recovery is 100% for all leachable resources. The information in Figure 1 below shows the minus ¾"" (19 mm) test results. The PEA envisions a minus ¾"" crush size for the heap leaching feed in the commercial application. Figure 1 – Soluble Copper Recovery Kinetics The recovery results for the residual copper (CuRES) component shown in Figure 2 indicated an average recovery of 25%, an increase of 10% from the 15% preliminary recovery assumption used in the PEA. The additional residual copper recovery when applied to the entire resource increases the overall average recovery from 72.8% to 76.0%. Figure 2 – Residual Copper Recovery Kinetics Figure 3 below illustrates the increase in potential copper production throughout the mine life, attributable to the improved recovery, in comparison with the PEA assumptions. The initial two production years do not show additional recovered copper, as the design capacity of the electrowinning plant considered in the PEA is fully utilized. Figure 3 – Copper Cathode Production (PEA & Revised Model) The sulfuric acid consumption has also been updated with the Phase 1 final results. The averaged net sulfuric acid consumption reported in the PEA was 18 kilograms per ton of ore processed. The finalized Phase 1 testing now indicates a reduction of 8.3% to 16.5 kilograms per ton. The primary reason for the reduction of acid consumption is minimizing excess acid in the leaching solutions and operating the columns at a pH closer to 2.0 pH than the historic column work at 1.2 pH, which minimizes acid consumption by excess unmineralized gangue material dissolution. This lowered acid requirement may also improve the project economics, both NPV and IRR, by reducing the operating costs for copper produced and increasing revenue from the same tonnes mined. Bioleaching Summary Copper bioleaching has been a commercially applied technology at altitudes similar to the Los Azules site and as much as 1,000 meters higher for several decades, in multiple locations around the world. Testing is conducted in conventional leach test columns by inoculation of the columns with naturally occurring bacterial ferrooxidans and thiooxidans prior to introduction of the leach solution. Bacterial cultures for the inoculum were sourced from the testing laboratories and adapted to the Los Azules leach material. Ferrooxidans convert the ferrous iron in solution to ferric iron, while thiooxidans convert the sulfur produced in the copper sulfide leaching activity to sulfuric acid/sulfate. Ferric iron is the key chemical component necessary for leaching of copper sulfide material. Bioactivity in the tests is monitored by measurement of the ferrous/ferric ratios and electrochemical oxidation potential in the leaching solutions.

ASP Isotopes Inc. Announces Increase in Offering Size of Convertible Notes by Quantum Leap Energy,2024-02-22T18:49:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,ASP Isotopes Inc. (ASPI) increases the size of convertible notes offering by its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC for isotopes production. The Notes may convert into common equity securities of QLE and will mature in five years. Proceeds will fund laser enrichment facilities and corporate purposes.,"ASP Isotopes Inc. Announces Increase in Offering Size of Convertible Notes by Quantum Leap Energy Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ASP Isotopes Inc. (ASPI) increases the size of convertible notes offering by its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC for isotopes production. The Notes may convert into common equity securities of QLE and will mature in five years. Proceeds will fund laser enrichment facilities and corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The expansion of the convertible notes offering by ASP Isotopes Inc.'s subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at raising capital for the company's growth initiatives, particularly the development of laser enrichment production facilities. Convertible notes are debt instruments that can be converted into equity at certain triggering events, such as an IPO or future equity financing, which provides investors with an option to participate in the company's equity upside.From a financial perspective, the decision to increase the offering size indicates robust investor interest or a greater need for capital than initially anticipated. The terms of conversion, set at a discount to future valuations, are designed to incentivize early investment while potentially diluting existing shareholders upon conversion. The five-year maturity of these notes suggests a long-term horizon for the underlying projects.Investors should be aware that the unsecured nature of these notes indicates they would be ranked lower in the event of liquidation, which adds a layer of risk. However, the restriction on repayment prior to maturity, unless a change of control occurs, provides some assurance of commitment to the long-term plan. The use of proceeds for building production facilities aligns with the company's strategic direction but also entails execution risk. Legal Expert Quantum Leap Energy LLC's approach to the convertible notes offering, targeting non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S of the Securities Act, is a legal strategy to access international capital while circumventing the rigorous registration requirements of the U.S. securities laws. Regulation S provides a safe harbor for companies to raise funds from offshore investors without the need for SEC registration, thus streamlining the process and reducing the regulatory burden.The exclusion of U.S. persons and the lack of registration under the Securities Act implies that the securities have limitations on their transferability within the United States, which could affect their liquidity. Investors should be cognizant of the legal complexities that accompany such instruments, including the potential for future regulatory changes that could impact the terms of the notes or the rights of the holders. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by ASP Isotopes Inc. to augment its capital through convertible notes reflects a broader industry trend where advanced materials companies are seeking to finance capital-intensive projects. The focus on laser enrichment production facilities is indicative of the growing demand for isotopes used in various industries, including medical, energy and defense.An analysis of the market conditions suggests that the company is aiming to capitalize on the anticipated growth in these sectors. However, the success of this financing strategy hinges on the market's confidence in the company's ability to execute its business plan and the future valuation of its subsidiary, QLE. The set valuation cap on the conversion price serves as a protective measure for investors against overvaluation risks.The development of such niche production facilities could position ASP Isotopes Inc. as a key player in the isotope market, provided that the company successfully navigates the operational and competitive challenges inherent in the industry. The potential for innovation and the securing of a supply chain for critical materials could have a positive impact on the company's valuation in the long run. 02/22/2024 - 01:49 PM WASHINGTON, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASP Isotopes” or “ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, announced today an increase to the size of the previously announced offering of convertible notes by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (""QLE”). The Company has increased the offering of QLE’s convertible notes (the ""Notes""), subject to market and other conditions (the ""Notes Offering""). The Notes will be unsecured and may be convertible into common equity securities of QLE prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain events, including an initial public offering, direct listing or a future equity financing, in each case at a price per share equal to the lower of 80% of the per share price in the applicable transaction or the per share value of one share of QLE’s common equity based on a set valuation cap. The Notes will mature on the fifth anniversary of the initial closing, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. QLE may not repay the Notes prior to maturity, unless a change of control transaction occurs. QLE intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering for the planning for, building and development of laser enrichment production facilities, as well as general corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the Notes Offering will be consummated or, if consummated, QLE will sell the maximum principal amount of Notes offered. The Notes are offered in offshore transactions outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Notes and the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and may not be sold or otherwise transferred in the United States except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any other applicable securities laws. No offering of the Notes or the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) is being made into the United States or to U.S. persons. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. This press release contains information about the pending Notes Offering, and there can be no assurance that such transaction will be completed. About ASP Isotopes Inc.

The property was sold for $311,326 per unit in a market with projected rent growth. The sale was facilitated by Marcus & Millichap's executives, Tyler Leeson and Matt Kipp, representing the seller and buyer respectively. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The sale of Chateau de Ville represents a significant transaction within the multifamily real estate sector, particularly within the context of Orange County's rental market. The high per-unit sale price of $311,326 reflects the premium on real estate in a region characterized by low vacancy rates and consistent rent growth. The scarcity of available properties and the competitive environment suggest a bullish outlook for similar assets in this locale.From a market research perspective, the data points to a robust demand for multifamily units in areas with strong employment drivers, such as Anaheim, which is home to major employers like Disneyland and Anaheim Regional Medical Center. The strategic location near key highways and educational institutions further enhances the property's value. Investors might be attracted to such assets due to their potential for stable income streams and appreciation in value over time. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of this transaction, the sale price of over $79 million for a property that hasn't changed hands in over half a century indicates a possibly significant capital appreciation. The low vacancy rates, which are below 4% for Class A and B multifamily units, are likely to support strong rental yields, making it an attractive investment for the buyer, who is a private investor. This transaction could also set a benchmark for pricing in the region, potentially influencing future sales and valuations of similar properties.Investors and stakeholders should note the long-term implications of such a purchase, including the cost of maintenance and upgrades for a property built in 1970, balanced against the potential for continued rent increases in a tight market. The financial health of the region, driven by stable employment and growth prospects, underpins the investment's solidity. Real Estate Investment Advisor The dynamics of Orange County's multifamily market, as indicated by this sale, are of particular interest to real estate investors. The sustained rent growth and low vacancy rates highlight the area's desirability and the limited supply of comparable investment opportunities. The transaction's size and the property's features, such as controlled access and amenities like a swimming pool and fitness center, align with the preferences of modern tenants and can contribute to tenant retention and attraction.Investors should consider the broader economic conditions and regional market trends when evaluating such investments. The demand indicators, including employment growth and demographic shifts, favor the multifamily segment in this region. However, potential challenges such as regulatory changes, property tax adjustments and economic downturns could affect the investment's performance. 02/22/2024 - 01:11 PM ANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marcus & Millichap (NYSE:MMI), a leading commercial real estate brokerage firm specializing in investment sales, financing, research and advisory services, announced today the sale of Chateau de Ville, a 254-unit multifamily property in Anaheim, California. The asset was brought to market for the first time in over 50 years and traded for $79,076,710 or $311,326 per unit. “Orange County has been the tightest major rental market in California for the past three years, and this trend is projected to continue with a fourth straight year of rent growth,” said Tyler Leeson, executive managing director investments in Marcus & Millichap’s Orange County office. Leeson and Matt Kipp, Marcus & Millichap first vice president investments, represented the seller, a long-term partnership, and procured the buyer, a private investor. “As the only market in the nation to enter 2024 with Class A and Class B multifamily vacancy rates below 4%, we expect to see increasing competition for apartment assets throughout Orange County,” said Kipp. The property is in North Anaheim, home of Knott’s Berry Farm.

The Materials Ecosystem: Unlocking the Value of Waste,2024-02-22T17:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Dow aims to inspire and highlight the work of others in the materials ecosystem to address plastic waste. The company is part of a global movement towards a circular economy, aiming to reduce plastic waste and create economic opportunities.","The Materials Ecosystem: Unlocking the Value of Waste Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Dow aims to inspire and highlight the work of others in the materials ecosystem to address plastic waste. The company is part of a global movement towards a circular economy, aiming to reduce plastic waste and create economic opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Economist From an environmental economics standpoint, the shift towards a circular economy for plastics presents a dual opportunity for economic growth and environmental sustainability. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's projections suggest significant economic and ecological benefits, including a reduction in oceanic plastic pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and the creation of jobs.However, the transition to a circular economy is not without its challenges. It requires substantial investment in infrastructure for recycling and waste management, as well as the development of new markets for recycled materials. The economic activity generated from recycling 20% of single-use plastics, quantified at over $10 billion, indicates a substantial untapped market with room for growth. The long-term benefits could include not only cost savings from material efficiency but also a reduction in the negative externalities associated with plastic pollution, such as harm to marine life and associated industries like fisheries and tourism. Supply Chain Analyst From a supply chain perspective, the complexity mentioned in scaling change for a circular plastics economy involves rethinking and restructuring the entire lifecycle of plastic products. This includes sourcing, design, manufacturing, consumption and post-consumer waste management. Companies like Dow are central to this transformation as they are at the nexus of materials science and production.Implementing a systems approach requires collaboration across various sectors, including agriculture, waste management and the financial industry. The interconnectedness of these sectors means that changes in one area, such as improved waste collection systems in developing countries, can have ripple effects throughout the global supply chain. For businesses, this represents both a challenge in coordination and an opportunity for innovation in logistics, materials handling and product design to minimize waste and maximize recyclability. Sustainability Consultant As a sustainability consultant, the focus would be on the strategic implications of adopting a circular economy model for companies involved in the materials ecosystem. This adoption goes beyond environmental responsibility; it's a strategic shift that can lead to competitive advantage through sustainability-driven innovation.Companies that proactively engage in developing circular economy solutions can potentially reap the benefits of enhanced brand reputation, customer loyalty and access to new markets. For instance, the demand for recycled plastics is likely to rise as more companies commit to sustainability goals. However, companies must also navigate potential drawbacks such as the initial costs of transitioning to circular systems and the need to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape that increasingly favors sustainable practices. 02/22/2024 - 12:30 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / DOWBy sharing our perspective on the dynamics of the materials ecosystem - its connections, influencers and gaps, we aim to inspire, highlight the work of others and invite conversation.Here's a riddle: what does a global materials science company such as Dow have in common with farmers in Iowa, investors in Southeast Asia and waste pickers in for example Kenya or Brazil? We are all part of the diverse and complex materials ecosystem that is developing around plastic and renewable waste to deliver its total value.Why is this happening? The world is demanding a better way to make, use and reuse plastics. Too much plastic enters our natural environment, and that's unacceptable. It's also unacceptable to view this valuable material as waste in the first place. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that by 2040, a circular economy has the potential to reduce the annual volume of plastics entering our oceans by 80%; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25%; generate savings of $200 billion per year; and create 700,000 net additional jobs. Recycling just 20% of all single-use plastic could generate more than $10 billion in economic activity.The opportunity is huge, but so is the complexity needed to scale change - and that is where a systems approach comes in. As the world transforms to a circular economy, we are being challenged to not only think about waste as a resource but also to change business models, logistics, consumption behaviors, policy and infrastructure. Experts in systems thinking believe the first step to solving a complex challenge like waste is to understand the system in which it sits. Meaningful change only happens when we understand the web of interrelations and rethink assumptions.That is why we are employing a systems lens to identify the gaps, connect the best partners and give it our best to scale how the world values, sources, transforms and monetizes plastic waste.In this first of a series of Seek Together blog articles to highlight our new insights on the materials ecosystem, let's take a look at how we're defining that system and our role in it.What is the materials ecosystems?When I think of circularity for plastics, I often think of how connected gears work together to make something larger work. As you can see in the illustration below, the materials ecosystem includes everyday consumers like you and me - and stakeholders in waste management, recycling, design, manufacturing, retail, brand ownership and public policy. It is a web of interrelated technologies, processes and people that transform used plastic and renewables into useful materials.It takes every stakeholder working together to make change happen. This includes brand owners and manufacturers designing products to be recyclable, effective recycling and waste infrastructure systems to recover end-of-life plastics, and investments across the value chain in new technologies that will transform recycled and renewable materials into products that create value. It also takes policymakers, investors and consumers to enable a systemic shift.In addition, it takes an appreciation of the nuances of local waste systems. While plastic waste is a global problem, solutions are highly localized. An improved understanding of local ecosystem actors and existing waste management systems can help ensure initiatives and investments to scale-up plastics recycling achieve the greatest impact and are tailored to the unique needs and strengths of communities.It's a complex system, for sure. But by understanding the complexity, I believe we can strengthen the role we play and who we work with.Putting systems thinking into actionWhat does applying a system lens look like in our work?For us, it starts with first understanding local systems around plastic waste - and then collaborating with the best partners and technologies for the collection, reuse and recycling of waste to enable global material ecosystems to scale.Together, we look at how things can connect better. We try to understand what influences consumer behaviors. We also consider how policy is a driving force in many ways - and we examine the gaps in the ecosystem and how we can address them.Take our work with Delterra, for example, in Argentina - where recycling rates hover at 8%. We work with Delterra to promote a circular economy and increase recycling rates through the Rethinking Recycling Program. By involving government, local recycling cooperatives, waste generators, consumers and private companies the independent environmental nonprofit seeks to improve waste management systems.This is one recent example of how the public's good intentions and recycling capacity connect and how global organizations are improving recycling as a key part of materials-management efforts.Learning by listeningAlbert Einstein is often quoted as saying, ""We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them."" I am continually inspired by our collaborators, and the bold moves they are making with us to disrupt and create a new plastics economy.Recently, I shared a stage at Fast Company's Innovation Festival with two entrepreneurs who represented vastly different roles in the materials ecosystem: Thomas Corle, CEO of New Energy Blue, and Ashish Gadnis, CEO of BanQu. Corle founded a bio-conversion company that uses renewables such as corn leaves and stems, and Gadnis runs a blockchain supply chain and economic identity platform for disenfranchised workers.Dow and New Energy Blue announced a long-term supply agreement in North America in which New Energy Blue will create bio-based ethylene from crop residues for plastics production. Recently, Dow and BanQu began work together in a pilot project called ""2Life."" Using blockchain technology, the 2Life Project aims to advance the development of the value chain traceability of our REVOLOOP™ post-consumer recycled resin manufactured in Colombia.These entrepreneurs share some important traits. They don't see waste as waste. They focus on people - farmers and waste pickers. They are diversifying how we source materials for plastics - both by what materials we use and by valuing the diverse people connected to those materials. Importantly, they are innovators with a vision of how they can do their part to advance a future that is more circular and lower carbon.These disruptors demonstrate that by working together across the materials ecosystem, we can indeed make the whole greater than the sum of the parts and turn complex challenges into opportunities for sustainability.Check out our insights on the materials ecosystemBy sharing our perspective on the dynamics of the materials ecosystem - its connections, influencers and gaps, we aim to inspire, highlight the work of others and invite conversation.I welcome you to check it out at Dow.com/materialsecosystem.Haley Lowry, Director of Sustainability at DowView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from DOW on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: DOWWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/dowEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: DOWView the original press release on accesswire.com What is Dow's goal in sharing its perspective on the materials ecosystem?

(BIG) acquires Hearthsong's award-winning toy inventory valued at over $22 million, adding 500+ new SKUs to stores at 50%-70% off retail prices. The move emphasizes Big Lots' commitment to extreme bargains and innovative products for customers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Hearthsong's inventory by Big Lots represents a strategic expansion of their product offerings, particularly in the children's toys segment. This move is likely to attract a broader customer base, especially families seeking value during key shopping seasons. By integrating over 500 new SKUs into their inventory, Big Lots is positioned to increase foot traffic and potentially boost sales during the spring and summer seasons, which are traditionally strong for outdoor and children's items.From a market research perspective, the timing of this acquisition aligns well with consumer spending patterns, as families prepare for outdoor activities and seek engaging toys for their children during school breaks. The discount pricing strategy could also resonate well in the current economic climate, where consumers are increasingly looking for ways to stretch their budgets. However, it's important to monitor how this expansion into toys, a category with significant competition, will affect Big Lots' overall market positioning and whether it can sustainably differentiate itself from other discount and toy retailers. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Big Lots' inventory purchase from Hearthsong are multifaceted. The reported value of over $22 million suggests a significant investment that could have short-term impacts on cash flow and working capital. However, the potential for increased sales revenue and higher inventory turnover could offset this initial outlay. The 'extreme value pricing' strategy, offering products at 50%-70% less than the original retail price, may drive volume but could also compress margins.It's critical to assess the inventory acquisition cost against the projected sell-through rates and customer demand elasticity at these price points. If Big Lots can leverage this acquisition to effectively clear inventory and capture market share, it could lead to a favorable impact on their financials. Investors and analysts should watch the next few quarters for evidence of increased sales growth and customer acquisition as a result of this strategic move. Retail Industry Expert The strategic acquisition by Big Lots underscores a trend in the retail industry towards consolidation and diversification of product lines to build competitive advantage. By onboarding an entire brand's inventory, Big Lots is not only expanding its product range but also enhancing its brand perception by associating with the high-quality and educational nature of Hearthsong toys.This move also indicates a shift towards direct sourcing, which can improve cost efficiencies and supply chain control. Big Lots' ability to offer significant discounts on these products may set a new precedent in the value retail segment, potentially pressuring competitors to follow suit. However, challenges such as inventory management, storage and the integration of new product types into the existing sales model must be navigated carefully to ensure this strategic move strengthens Big Lots' market position without causing operational strains. 02/22/2024 - 01:00 PM In a strategic move reflecting Big Lots' deep closeout heritage, the retail and liquidation pioneer has purchased award-winning toy company Hearthsong's full inventory, valued at more than $22 million.The acquisition brings the entire collection of high quality indoor and outdoor children's toys to Big Lots stores for the first time, ahead of the upcoming spring/summer sales season.

The hackers compiled lists of customers' data, including heritage, names, and addresses, which were sold on the dark web. The lawsuit revealed that the hacker leaked lists of Jewish and Chinese customers, posing a threat to their safety. Despite the breach, 23andMe has not informed the compromised customers about their exposed information. The company faces legal action for concealing crucial details from affected customers. Positive None. Negative Customers' personal genetic information, including heritage, names, and addresses, was compromised and sold on the dark web, posing a significant threat to their safety. 23andMe failed to disclose to the 7 million affected customers that their personal genetic information was exposed on the dark web, specifically targeting Jewish and Chinese customers. The company attempted to shift blame to customers by stating that the breach was due to customers using recycled login credentials from other websites. Despite the severity of the breach, 23andMe waited until December to report that 7 million customers were directly affected, withholding crucial information from affected individuals. Cybersecurity Expert The incident involving 23andMe's data breach has profound implications for cybersecurity practices within the genetic testing industry. The targeted nature of the attack, focusing on specific ethnic groups, suggests a level of sophistication and intent that raises concerns about the potential for genetic information to be used for discriminatory purposes. Cybersecurity protocols must be re-evaluated in the context of protecting sensitive personal data, particularly where it relates to identifiable characteristics that could be exploited.Furthermore, the delay in disclosure and the company's initial response to blame customers for using recycled login credentials points to a need for stronger regulatory frameworks that mandate timely and transparent reporting of data breaches. This is essential to maintain consumer trust and to ensure that individuals can take prompt action to protect themselves from identity theft and other forms of cybercrime. Legal Expert The legal ramifications of the 23andMe breach are significant, particularly in light of the allegations that the company failed to inform its customers of the full extent of the breach. This raises questions about compliance with data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and various state laws in the United States like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The class action lawsuit indicates potential legal exposure for failing to adequately protect customer data and for not being forthcoming about the breach's details.Moreover, the targeting of specific ethnic groups may implicate anti-discrimination laws and could lead to increased scrutiny from human rights organizations. The sale of this sensitive data on the dark web further complicates legal proceedings, as it involves international jurisdictional challenges and the need for cross-border cooperation in cybercrime investigations. Financial Analyst The breach's impact on 23andMe's financial health and stock market performance could be substantial. Data breaches often result in direct costs associated with legal fees, settlements, increased security measures and potential fines from regulatory bodies. Indirect costs may include reputational damage leading to customer churn and reduced sales. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's response and the potential financial implications, including any changes in user growth, retention rates and the cost of capital.It is also crucial to consider the broader market implications, as other companies in the genetic testing and personal health data sectors may experience increased scrutiny and pressure to enhance their cybersecurity measures, which could lead to industry-wide shifts in investment and innovation priorities. 02/22/2024 - 12:10 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / 23andMe (NASDAQ:ME) was hacked in December 2023, affecting approximately 7 million users of its genetic services website. According to a recently filed class complaint, hackers who infiltrated 23andMe's system were after the personal information of Jewish and Chinese customers, but the company hid that detail when notifying affected customers.The hackers specifically targeted the personal genetic information of Jewish and Chinese customers and compiled that data - including genetic heritage, names, and addresses - into lists that were then sold on the dark web, but 23andMe concealed both those revelations when it announced the extent of the breach in December 2023.According to the lawsuit, the hacker leaked a list of over 1 million Jewish customers expressly in retribution for the Israel-Hamas war. The hacker was also more than happy to leak a list of 350,000 Chinese customers upon request from a user with the alias ""Wuhan.""These lists generated a huge amount of interest from hackers on the dark web from all over the world and were shared and reshared an untold number of times.The disclosure of these lists threatens the safety of those customers, including from the Chinese government, which has a long history of tracking Chinese citizens.According to the lawsuit,to this day, 23andMe has not informed the 7 million compromised customers that their personal genetic information was disclosed on the dark web, nor has it told its Jewish and Chinese customers that they were specifically targeted.IF YOU ARE A VULNERABLE person whose personal genetic information identifies you as having Ashkenazi Jewish heritage or Chinese ancestry, and/or live in California, Illinois, Oregon, or Alaska, please contact us to review your rights and eligibility for compensation:https://bit.ly/3sYm8CnADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:According to a recently filed class action complaint, on Oct. 1, 2023, a hacker using the alias ""Golem"" leaked the 23andMe data of 1 million Ashkenazi Jews on Breach Forums, calling it ""the most valuable data you'll ever see.""""Golem's explicit targeting of Jewish 23andMe users is further conveyed by his use of the character 'Gollum' from The Lord of the Rings - a creature driven by greed with ugly and outsized facial features - as his profile picture.""A few hours later, a user with the alias ""Wuhan"" asked Golem if he had ""Chinese accounts,"" according to the complaint. The next day, Golem leaked the data of 7 million users, saying in the post that the customer information included phenotype and health information, photos, and identification data.Golem listed prices for the customer profiles at $1,000 for 100 profiles, $5,000 for 1,000 profiles, $20,000 for 10,000 profiles and $100,000 for 100,000 profiles.Interest in the leaked Jewish and Chinese information was immediate and overwhelming following an Israeli bombing of a Palestinian hospital.23andMe attempted to shift the blame to customers, telling them the breach was a result of customers using recycled login credentials from their accounts on other websites.Further, 23andMe then waited until December to report that 7 million customers were directly affected by the breach and didn't say anything about the data being sold on the dark web or that Jewish and Chinese customers were specifically targeted.Levi Korsinsky, LLP is investigating whether affected customers are entitled to compensation.

The non-prime RMBS transaction is worth $281.9 million, collateralized by 610 residential mortgages with borrowers possessing a non-zero WA original credit score of 739. The loans are seasoned approximately five months, with 98.9% fixed-rate mortgages and 1.1% adjustable-rate mortgages. NRMLT 2024-NQM1 has a WA original loan-to-value (LTV) of 73.6% and 8.4% of the pool has an initial interest-only period. Positive None. Negative None. Credit Analyst The assignment of preliminary ratings to mortgage-backed notes by KBRA is a significant indicator of the perceived creditworthiness and investment quality of these financial instruments. The credit score and loan-to-value metrics mentioned are crucial, as they influence the risk profile of the mortgage pool. A weighted average original credit score of 739 suggests a relatively high credit quality of borrowers, which generally correlates with a lower probability of default. The weighted average original loan-to-value (LTV) and combined LTV (CLTV) of 73.6% indicate a moderate level of borrower equity in the properties, which can act as a buffer against potential declines in property values.Investors in RMBS rely heavily on these ratings to assess risk and the predominance of fixed-rate mortgages (98.9%) in this pool provides a degree of predictability in cash flows, as opposed to the less predictable adjustable-rate mortgages. The presence of interest-only periods in 8.4% of the pool may introduce additional risk, as borrowers are not required to pay down principal during this time, potentially leading to higher balance loans at the end of the period. Overall, the high credit scores and the LTV ratios are positive indicators for investors, but they must also consider the seasoning of the loans and the proportion of interest-only loans when evaluating the potential risk. Real Estate Investment Analyst The involvement of Rithm Capital Corp., a real estate investment trust (REIT), in sponsoring this non-prime RMBS transaction is noteworthy for stakeholders. As a REIT, Rithm Capital's performance is tied to the real estate market and the performance of its investments, such as NRMLT 2024-NQM1. The diversification of originators within the mortgage pool, including NewRez LLC, American Heritage Lending and LendSure Mortgage Corporation, may help mitigate originator-specific risks. However, the servicing by a single entity, NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, could introduce servicer concentration risk.For real estate investors and market participants, the seasoning of approximately five months is relatively short, which may not fully reflect the borrowers' payment patterns over a longer period. Nonetheless, the preliminary ratings provided by KBRA offer an initial assessment of the quality and stability of the investment. It is essential for investors to monitor subsequent performance and any updates to the ratings, as changes could impact the value of these securities and the income generated by a REIT like Rithm Capital. Sustainability Analyst While the article does not explicitly address environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as they pertain to the NRMLT 2024-NQM1 RMBS transaction, it is important to consider that KBRA includes an ESG Global Rating Methodology in its analysis. The ESG considerations could become increasingly relevant for investors who are mindful of sustainability issues in their investment decisions. As ESG factors can influence the long-term performance and stability of investments, a comprehensive understanding of how these factors are integrated into the credit ratings could provide a more holistic view of the investment's risk profile. Investors should seek to understand the specific ESG factors that might affect the credit rating or rating outlook to make informed decisions aligned with their own ESG criteria. 02/22/2024 - 12:52 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KBRA assigns preliminary ratings to 6 classes of mortgage-backed notes from New Residential Mortgage Loan Trust 2024-NQM1 (NRMLT 2024-NQM1), a $281.9 million non-prime RMBS transaction sponsored by Rithm Capital Corp.

The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a regular quarterly cash dividend by The Marcus Corporation represents a commitment to shareholder returns, reflecting the company's current financial health and confidence in its ability to generate cash flow. The specified dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock indicates a distribution strategy that may be aimed at maintaining or enhancing shareholder value. The dividend yield, calculated by annualizing this quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock's current price, can be compared against the industry average to gauge attractiveness to income-focused investors.It is also noteworthy that the dividend for Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded, has been declared at $0.064 per share. This suggests a tiered dividend policy, which is not uncommon in companies with multiple share classes. The difference in dividend amounts between share classes typically reflects the voting power or other privileges associated with each class. Investors might interpret the consistent payment of dividends as a positive signal, potentially influencing the stock's market performance depending on the broader economic context and the company's sector performance. Market Research Analyst Dividend declarations can have broader implications beyond immediate shareholder returns. They often serve as indicators of a company's stability and maturity, as well as management's outlook on future earnings and investment opportunities. In the case of The Marcus Corporation, maintaining a steady dividend could be perceived as a sign of operational stability, which might be particularly relevant for the consumer discretionary sector where Marcus operates, as it is sensitive to economic cycles.Additionally, the impact on investor sentiment should be considered. Regular dividends can attract a specific investor base, such as income funds and conservative investors looking for predictable returns. This can influence the stock's volatility and trading volume. Furthermore, the timing of the dividend, in relation to economic cycles and market conditions, can also provide insights into the company's strategic financial management. 02/22/2024 - 12:00 PM MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Directors of The Marcus Corporation (NYSE: MCS) today declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock.

Photo Credit: Worldview Films “This marks a turning point in the clean energy transition. After many decades of advocacy, research, policymaking, and finally construction, America’s offshore wind industry has gone from a dream to reality,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Across Massachusetts, in 30,000 homes and businesses, when you turn on the light, you will now be using clean, affordable energy. This will make the air we breathe safer and healthier, save customers money, and bring us one step closer to achieving net-zero emissions. I’m grateful to the Legislature for their leadership in developing our offshore wind industry, state and local officials for their efforts, and the union workers who built this industry from the ground up.” “Every milestone we achieve on Vineyard Wind 1 is special, but powering up these first turbines stands apart as an exceptional achievement for Avangrid, Massachusetts, and the nation,” said Avangrid CEO Pedro Azagra. “Each rotation of the blades, and every megawatt flowing to homes across Massachusetts, is a testament to the years of perseverance and partnership that have defined this trailblazing project. From the vision of our team, to the leadership of President Biden, Governor Healey, Speaker Mariano, and Senate President Spilka, to the talent and skill of the project’s local union workforce, the hard work of so many helped to finally bring offshore wind power to the United States. We should all take pride in writing this remarkable chapter of American clean energy history.” On Tuesday, January 2, 2024, Vineyard Wind delivered approximately five megawatts of power from one turbine to the grid. Following that critical milestone, the project has provided power from each of the first five turbines intermittently, as it ramped up to initial operations. Currently, the project has successfully installed nine turbines and is in the process of installing the 10th, with preparations underway to transport the 11th turbine to the offshore project site. Building on the 68 Megawatts currently in operation, additional power will be delivered to the grid sequentially, with each turbine starting production once it completes the commissioning process. The power from the project interconnects to the New England grid in Barnstable, transmitted by underground cables that connect to a substation further inland on Cape Cod. Once completed, the project will consist of 62 wind turbines. Offshore wind is a critical energy resource in the Northeast region, and is uniquely positioned to meet the New England region’s winter peak demand. In 2018, ISO New England released an assessment, which found that 800 Megawatts of offshore wind during a two-week cold snap would have saved ratepayers $40-45 million and avoided more than 108,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to 5% of the region’s annual emissions. “The winds of change are blowing through Massachusetts, as Vineyard Wind now powers 30,000 homes in our state with clean, renewable energy,” said Senator Markey. “With billions of dollars being unlocked from the Inflation Reduction Act to drive our clean energy revolution forward, Vineyard Wind is only the beginning. I will continue to push for the creation of good-paying union jobs across the shores of Massachusetts and in communities throughout our nation through my Offshore Wind Jobs and Opportunity Act. I look forward to the completion of the project, which will deliver more than 800 megawatts of power, while also delivering for jobs and climate action in our communities.” “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is leading the way on offshore wind thanks to the innovation of private sector partners like Avangrid, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, and Vineyard Offshore coupled with the strong support of President Biden, Governor Healey, the entire Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, and our partners in the State Legislature, the City of New Bedford, and throughout the Cape and Martha’s Vineyard,” said Congressman Bill Keating. “Powering up the first five Vineyard Wind 1 turbines not only signifies a major milestone in the construction of the U.S.’s first large-scale offshore wind project, it also signifies progress towards a cleaner environment and heralds a boon for good, union jobs and economic growth throughout Southeastern Massachusetts which is something we should all be proud of.” “Massachusetts makes history again with power flowing from Vineyard Wind,” said Lieutenant Governor Driscoll. “This is a victory for the many partnerships that got us to this moment – from the development of the historic New Bedford Port, to the groundbreaking Project Labor Agreement, to the vision of the Legislature and advocates. It takes the faith, vision, and hard work of a lot of people to make this moment possible.” “Today we take a momentous step towards a clean energy future powered by wind - and our Commonwealth’s leadership on finding creative solutions to the environmental crisis,” said State Senator Karen E. Spilka (Middlesex and Norfolk), Massachusetts Senate President. “Today, and for decades to come, our environment and our residents will reap the benefits of the hard work of advocates, designers, laborers and policymakers who have put this project on the path from conception to reality. I’m grateful to my colleagues in the legislature, the Healey-Driscoll Administration, and the leaders at Vineyard Wind for making this a priority, and I look forward to seeing more of Massachusetts become powered by the wind.” “This milestone is the first of many on the path to transforming Massachusetts into a regional hub for offshore wind and is proof of the incredible potential that the Commonwealth has to lead the country, and the world, towards a clean energy future,” said State Representative Ronald Mariano (3rd Norfolk), Massachusetts Speaker of the House. “I want to thank the folks at Avangrid and CIP for their commitment to delivering clean energy to the people of Massachusetts, along with my colleagues in the House and our partners in state government who helped to turn this long-pursued vision into a reality.” “Massachusetts has been at the forefront on offshore wind in the United States, and this is a historic milestone in our clean energy revolution,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “It’s not easy to stand up a new industry, but we will continue to forge ahead and keep growing the industry to lower energy costs for our families and businesses, create good-paying jobs, and build a cleaner, healthier, and more resilient Commonwealth.” “Developing new offshore wind is the backbone of Massachusetts’ clean energy policies and is paramount to achieving our clean energy transition and emissions reduction targets,” said Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony. “It’s gratifying to see the blades spinning on the Vineyard Wind project, and we look forward to advancing our current solicitation, which is critical to further economic development priorities for Massachusetts while securing clean, resilient energy for ratepayers.” “Congratulations to Vineyard Wind - It’s incredibly exciting to witness the tangible impact of our collective dedication to combating the climate crisis,” said Emily Reichert, CEO of MassCEC. “We’re thrilled to see this visionary concept come to life and contribute to the creation of a sustainable future for generations of Massachusetts citizens to come.” “It’s great news that the Vineyard Wind project has delivered full power to consumers across the region today,” said State Representative Jeffrey N.

Green jobs are essential in addressing climate change, with 75% of respondents believing they will positively impact society. Negative None. 02/22/2024 - 11:15 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / 3MOriginally published on 3M News CenterAs the world navigates environmental challenges, societal shifts, and rapidly evolving technologies, science continues to provide solutions. The 2024 3M State of Science Insights* survey reveals people view science as critical to both society and their daily lives. Commissioned by 3M and fielded by Morning Consult, the global survey shows that science is viewed as a fundamental part of how the world addresses urgent issues like climate change, shapes the future of work, and fosters growth in STEM careers and green jobs - all essential components of a prosperous future.""It's encouraging to see widespread recognition of the critical role of science in our lives,"" said John Banovetz, executive vice president, chief technology officer and environmental responsibility, 3M. ""Science is what enables 3M to innovate vital solutions that transform lives, help preserve our planet, make people safer and more productive, and build a brighter tomorrow.""As 3M works to address global challenges, we know the opportunities and issues posed by climate change, the future of work, and emerging technologies cannot be tackled independently - they are interconnected. To drive global progress forward, the world must look at these macro-forces collectively and work together - as businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individuals.Climate change is one of the biggest threats to humankind Climate change is an incredibly complex issue impacting the global population in a variety of ways - and most acknowledge it must be addressed with urgency. In fact, more than three-quarters of survey respondents think climate change is one of the biggest threats to humankind (81%) and as the impacts of climate change affect more communities, the issue also becomes more personal.While nearly half of the global respondents claim they have already been impacted by climate change (43%), one-third (30%) believe their community will be impacted within the next ten years. Extreme weather events (52%), lack of clean water (34%), long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns (32%), and climate change related to health issues (31%) are among the top concerns.""3M is intensifying our commitment to finding innovative climate solutions,"" said Gayle Schueller, senior vice president and chief sustainability officer, 3M. ""We are focused on using cutting-edge materials science and technology to address this paramount issue, advancing decarbonization, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainable infrastructure to protect our planet and its people.""Globally, 85% of survey respondents believe companies need to be more committed to using sustainable materials, and 77% demand transparency from companies that claim sustainable commitments. 3M is proud of our diverse set of sustainability goals and reports on our progress each year in the Global Impact Report.The future of work is defined by skilled trades, STEM and green jobs The global workforce continues to evolve as shifting demographics and climate change reshape the world around us. Despite change and uncertainty for many, respondents feel hopeful that skilled trades, STEM, and green jobs will lead the way and play a significant role in the future of work. In fact, respondents say skilled trades (83%) are their top recommended career choice for younger generations to pursue, with STEM (80%) and green jobs (78%) closely following, demonstrating global relevancy and importance of these vital careers across sectors.""For the world's transition to a low-carbon economy, STEM and skilled trade careers are vital. We must encourage people to pursue these fields and support them on their journey,"" said Jayshree Seth, corporate scientist and chief science advocate, 3M. ""As the challenges facing our world evolve, the next generation can help us adapt by applying their skills to create and implement innovative science-based sustainable solutions.""While careers in STEM still offer the greatest opportunity to younger generations, green jobs are inching their way up. Not only do respondents see green jobs as a growing field (51%), but as climate change rattles communities, they believe the world needs more green workers (49%). Additionally, many see green jobs as an opportunity for innovation and problem solving.Green jobs signal hope and opportunity As global anxieties around climate change increase, the growth of green jobs can offer relief-benefitting the planet, people, and economic growth. Defined as jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the environment, green careers can be found in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and construction or expanding fields like renewable energy and energy efficiency.Along with governments, businesses, and organizations, the public is increasingly recognizing the importance of the green economy. Globally, 75% of respondents believe green jobs are crucial to addressing climate change and 77% believe green jobs will have a positive impact on society.On a personal level, many believe these jobs offer promising career opportunities, and most expect to see growth in the green jobs market over the next five years (75%). Survey findings show that with this global momentum and positive sentiment, there is an opportunity for businesses to seize the moment and drive green skills development:Green jobs are for everyone. Most respondents (70%) believe people in all career stages should look for green jobs. This could indicate that green workers are more likely to share a purpose-driven mindset than age group or professional background.There is a universal feeling of excitement and respect for green jobs. About three-quarters (73%) believe green jobs provide exciting new opportunities, have a positive impact on society (77%), and command respect for those who perform them (77%).Interest in learning green skills is widespread. Two-thirds (65%) of people would like to learn skills that could help them land a green job, and 63% also believe they don't need a career change to perform one.The AI revolution and its impact on the world around us Artificial Intelligence (AI) is associated with both opportunities and challenges, including economic transformation, fears of social disruption, governance concerns, and impacts on education and jobs. Despite these conflicting perspectives, it is undeniable that AI is shaping the future.According to survey respondents, 77% believe AI will change the world as we know it, yet 77% also believe due to its revolutionary potential, AI needs to be heavily regulated. It's clear that attitudes toward AI are situational between life at home and work. Most people (61%) note an increased presence of AI in their lives, a clear understanding of where AI is being used in their everyday life (55%), and a strong conviction that AI is a tool for problem solving (68%).Beyond AI, there is general fear that emerging technologies, robots, and automation will replace workers (66%). Possibly fueled by this concern, most people say they would be excited to work with these evolving innovations.Building a brighter tomorrow As the world transitions toward a green economy and society driven by emerging technology, people's relationship and engagement with science will continue to grow and evolve. By continuing to innovate solutions that mitigate the effects of climate change, spreading awareness of the impact and importance of green jobs, and responsibly integrating emerging technologies, 3M will help advance global progress and a brighter future for all.*State of Science Insights Methodology The 3M State of Science Insights presents original, third-party research, conducted by Morning Consult.

(NYSE American: WRAC) (the “Company”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, today announced that it will liquidate and dissolve the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”). Accordingly, the Company will redeem all outstanding shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 sold in its initial public offering (the “public shares”) that remain outstanding, effective as of March 8, 2024. As stated in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company had until March 29, 2024 to complete an initial business combination provided that for each one-month extension from July 29, 2023 through March 29, 2024, the Company deposited into the trust account established in connection with its initial public offering the lesser of $50,000 or $0.02 per shares sold in the IPO that remained outstanding. The board has determined that it will not be able to complete an initial business combination by March 29, 2024 and therefore the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the holders of the public shares (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time, to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. In accordance with the terms of the related trust agreement, the Company expects to retain up to $100,000 of the interest income from the trust account to pay dissolution expenses as well as retaining additional amounts from interest income to pay the Company’s tax obligations. The last day that the Company’s securities will trade on the NYSE American will be February 29, 2024.

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless.

Dividend Distribution Proposal,2024-02-22T19:29:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Ferrari N.V. announces a dividend distribution of Euro 2.443 per common share, representing a 35% increase from the previous year, totaling approximately Euro 440 million.

The proposal is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on April 17, 2024, with expected ex-date on April 22, 2024, record date on April 23, 2024, and payment date on May 3, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ferrari N.V.'s announcement of a substantial dividend increase of approximately 35% is a strong indicator of the company's financial health and confidence in its future earnings. This proposed increase in dividends translates into a significant return to shareholders and reflects positively on the company's ability to generate cash flow. Investors should note that the total distribution amount of approximately Euro 440 million is a considerable allocation of profits back to shareholders, which could impact the company's liquidity and future investment capabilities.Furthermore, the timing of the ex-date and payment date is crucial for investors who are looking to qualify for the dividend payout. The proposed dates indicate that shareholders who own the stock before April 22, 2024, would be eligible for the dividend, which is scheduled for payment on May 3, 2024. This information is vital for both short-term traders and long-term investors in planning their investment strategy around the dividend distribution. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the dividend announcement by Ferrari N.V. could potentially influence the stock's performance leading up to the ex-dividend date. Historically, stocks may rise as the ex-dividend date approaches, as investors look to capture the dividend payout. However, after the ex-date, the stock price typically drops by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This pattern is something that market participants might consider when analyzing the stock's price movements.It is also important to consider the signal that a 35% increase in dividends sends to the market. Such a move could be interpreted as a positive signal that the company expects strong future performance, which might attract new investors or encourage current shareholders to maintain or increase their holdings. Conversely, a substantial increase in dividends could also raise questions about why the company is not reinvesting more of its profits into growth opportunities. Economist Examining the broader economic implications, Ferrari N.V.'s decision to increase its dividend payout could be indicative of sectoral trends within the luxury automotive industry. A significant dividend hike may suggest that the industry is experiencing stable demand, allowing companies like Ferrari to return more capital to shareholders. However, it's also essential to assess macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate trends and inflation, as they can affect consumer spending on luxury goods. In a high-interest-rate environment, for instance, consumers may defer purchases of high-end vehicles, which could eventually impact the company's profitability and its ability to sustain such dividend increases in the long run. 02/22/2024 - 02:29 PM Maranello (Italy), February 22, 2024 - Ferrari N.V. (NYSE/EXM: RACE) (the “Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors intends to recommend to the Company’s shareholders a dividend distribution to the holders of common shares of Euro 2.443 per common share, with an increase of approximately 35% compared to the prior year and corresponding to a total distribution of approximately Euro 440 million.The distribution will be subject to its approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders which is scheduled to be held on April 17, 2024.If shareholders approve the proposed dividend distribution, the ex-date is expected to be April 22, 2024, the record date April 23, 2024 on both EXM and NYSE and the payment date May 3, 20241. Attachment FNV Dividend Distribution Proposal PR 22.2.24 ENG Final What is the dividend amount per common share proposed by Ferrari N.V.? Ferrari N.V. has proposed a dividend distribution of Euro 2.443 per common share. By what percentage has the dividend amount increased compared to the prior year? The dividend amount has increased by approximately 35% compared to the previous year. What is the total distribution amount for the proposed dividend?

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income of Dorchester Minerals, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2023, indicates a decrease when compared to the previous year. This decline in profitability, from $130.6 million to $114.1 million, could be indicative of operational challenges or market conditions that may have affected the company's revenue streams. The dip in operating revenues from $170.8 million to $163.8 million corroborates this trend. It is essential to examine the factors contributing to this downward trajectory, such as changes in commodity prices, production volumes, or operational expenses, to understand the company's financial health and performance.Furthermore, the distribution of $137.5 million to common unitholders, despite the drop in net income, reflects a commitment to shareholder returns. Investors should assess the sustainability of these distributions, considering the company's earnings and cash flow positions. The reserve estimates provided by the independent engineering consultant, particularly the composition and classification of the reserves, offer insights into the company's future production capabilities and potential revenue generation from its oil and gas assets. Market Research Analyst The composition of Dorchester Minerals' reserves, with a significant portion in proved developed producing reserves and a notable 40% in natural gas, provides a glimpse into the company's asset quality and operational focus. The shift towards natural gas may align with market trends favoring cleaner energy sources. However, the heavy reliance on royalty properties, which account for 82% of reserves, could expose the company to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes affecting the energy sector.Investors might also consider the geographical diversification of Dorchester's interests across 28 states, which could mitigate region-specific risks and offer stability in production. The impact of this diversification on operational efficiency and cost management is a critical factor in evaluating the company's long-term strategic positioning within the industry. Energy Sector Analyst Understanding the implications of the reserve mix is crucial for stakeholders. The fact that all natural gas reserves are classified as proved developed producing suggests that these assets are currently generating revenue, which is a positive indicator of immediate cash flow. Nonetheless, the longevity of these reserves and the prospects for replacing them once depleted are important considerations for the company's future prospects.The energy market's volatility, often driven by geopolitical events, technological advancements and policy changes, can significantly impact Dorchester Minerals' performance. The company's ability to adapt to these dynamics, as well as its strategies for managing its portfolio of mineral and royalty interests, will be pivotal in maintaining its competitive edge and financial stability. 02/22/2024 - 02:02 PM DALLAS, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorchester Minerals, L.P.

(NYSE: MLM) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share, totaling $2.96 annually. The payment is scheduled for March 28, 2024, benefiting shareholders of record by March 4, 2024. Martin Marietta, a key player in building materials, operates across 28 states, Canada, and The Bahamas, with a focus on supplying essential resources for community development. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When evaluating the declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share by Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., several financial implications merit consideration. Firstly, the announcement of a consistent dividend can signal to investors the company's financial health and a steady cash flow, potentially leading to increased investor confidence. The annualized dividend rate of $2.96 per share suggests a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which can be an attractive proposition for income-focused investors.However, it is crucial to assess the dividend payout ratio in relation to the company's earnings to gauge sustainability. A payout ratio that is too high could indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough in its own growth, which might be a concern for long-term value creation. Conversely, a modest payout ratio could suggest a balanced approach between rewarding shareholders and funding internal opportunities.Additionally, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock's current price, should be compared against industry averages and fixed-income alternatives. If the yield is competitive, it could draw more investors to the stock, potentially bolstering its price. However, if the yield is not in line with the risk profile of the company or sector, it could lead to a reassessment of the stock's attractiveness. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Martin Marietta's position as a leading supplier of building materials in the S&P 500 Index implies a significant role in the construction industry. The declaration of a quarterly dividend may reflect not only the company's current financial stability but also its management's positive outlook on future earnings and cash flow, which are essential for sustaining such dividends.It's important to analyze the company's market segments, including aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete, to understand the demand dynamics that could affect its financial performance. For instance, infrastructure spending, housing market trends and commercial construction activities are key drivers for Martin Marietta's products. An uptick in these areas could lead to increased demand for the company's materials, supporting its revenue and, by extension, its ability to maintain or increase dividends.Moreover, the company's Magnesia Specialties business caters to diverse applications, which could provide a buffer against sector-specific downturns. Diversification within its product offerings may help stabilize earnings, an essential factor for dividend-paying companies seeking to manage market volatility and investor expectations. Economist The broader economic context is critical when examining the impact of Martin Marietta's dividend announcement. The construction industry, where Martin Marietta operates, is often seen as a bellwether for the economy due to its sensitivity to interest rates and overall economic health. In a growing economy, construction activity typically increases, which could lead to higher demand for building materials.However, in an environment of rising interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases for both the company and its customers, potentially dampening demand for construction projects. This could have a knock-on effect on Martin Marietta's financials. It is important to monitor economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates and housing starts to anticipate shifts in the construction sector that might impact the company's performance.Furthermore, geopolitical events and trade policies can affect the availability and cost of raw materials, which could influence Martin Marietta's operational costs and profit margins. An economist would evaluate such external factors to predict potential challenges or opportunities for the company in maintaining its dividend payments in the long term. 02/22/2024 - 02:55 PM RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) (“Martin Marietta” or the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Bright Green Corporation regarding the final approval for unique licensing from the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy and the DEA is a significant development in the pharmaceutical sector. This licensing will enable the company to research, produce and manufacture plant-based drugs and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for Schedule I and II substances, which could have considerable implications for the domestic pharmaceutical production landscape.From a market perspective, this positions Bright Green as a potential leader in a niche yet expanding market segment. The ability to produce and manufacture controlled substances domestically addresses a critical supply chain vulnerability, especially in a time where global disruptions have underscored the importance of localizing production. This strategic move could translate into a competitive advantage for Bright Green, potentially capturing market share from imports and aligning with the 'Drugs Made in America' initiative.Furthermore, the company's focus on modular facility design for scalability speaks to a strategic approach to growth that may be well-received by investors. This infrastructure expansion, coupled with the potential for job creation, could reflect positively on the company's stock performance as it indicates a forward-looking growth plan with tangible economic benefits. Pharmaceutical Legal Expert Obtaining the approval to register and authorize Schedule I and II substances is a complex legal hurdle, especially given the stringent regulations surrounding controlled substances. Bright Green's achievement in this regard is not only a testament to their regulatory expertise but also sets a precedent for other pharmaceutical companies looking to explore similar avenues.The legal complexities of working with such substances include ensuring compliance with both state and federal laws, which often involves navigating pending policy changes. Bright Green's success in this area could pave the way for policy discussions and potentially influence future regulations concerning the production of plant-based medicines.Additionally, the mention of 'exclusive EB-5 partnership' indicates a strategic use of foreign investment to fund infrastructure expansion, which could be a clever legal structuring to support growth while contributing to economic development through job creation. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Bright Green's announcement are multifaceted. The company's entry into the controlled substance market, particularly with the ability to supply APIs for Schedule I and II drugs, opens up a new revenue stream that is likely to be lucrative given the current reliance on imports for these substances.Investors will be interested in the company's ability to secure guaranteed supply contracts with government entities and pharmaceutical companies, which would provide stable long-term revenue. The mention of EB-5 capital suggests a non-dilutive financing strategy that could be favorably viewed as it avoids shareholder dilution while raising capital for expansion.It is also important to note the potential risks associated with the production of controlled substances, including regulatory risks and the need for high levels of security and compliance. These factors could impact the company's operational costs and will be important to monitor as Bright Green progresses with its plans. 02/22/2024 - 01:30 PM BRIGHT GREEN CORPORATION BREAKS NEW GROUND IN DOMESTIC PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTION GRANTS, N.M., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bright Green Corporation (Nasdaq: BGXX) (“Bright Green” or the “Company”) company announced today that final approval has been received from the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy and the DEA for unique licensing that allows Bright Green to register, license, and authorize Schedule I and Schedule II plant-based drugs and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for research, production, and manufacturing purposes. Schedule I Substances include Psilocybin, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote, ibogaine Schedule II Substances: Opium, poppy straw, raw opium, opium extracts, powdered opium, granulated opium, tincture of opium, opium fluid extracts, opium straw concentrates, pending: erythroxylon coca (cocaine) Building on previous regulatory milestones like DEA registration for Cannabis, Bright Green was able to successfully navigate the uncharted territory of introducing additional controlled substances, even amidst high levels of uncertainty and complex pending policy changes at the federal level. Achieving this substantial approval allows Bright Green to bring their deep expertise to these issues to help propel our Drugs Made in America movement forward. The company believes this effort will help address the supply chain shortage for plant-based medicines while establishing Bright Green Corporation as the frontrunner for a share of the well-established assessable market in the U.S. worth billions that is currently served extensively by imports. The research will be conducted the Company’s C2 team in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the reshoring of production and manufacturing to the U.S. will take place at the company’s Grants, New Mexico facility. Medical plants will be produced in climate-controlled glass greenhouses engineered to ensure quality and predictability, laying a roadmap for guaranteed supply contracts with both federal government entities and other pharmaceutical interests. Bright Green expects to be the first company in almost 100 years to produce, manufacture and supply API for Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances and to deliver on contracts of this type. “As we undergo an expansion of our infrastructure, we plan to leverage the capital to be raised from our exclusive EB-5 partnership with Asia Capital Pioneers Group, as well as funding from federal agencies”, said Groovy Singh, CEO of Bright Green. “The modular design of our facilities positions us to scale with demand and ensure that as production grows, so does our capacity to create jobs in direct correlation with EB-5 capital availability in a methodical phased approach.” Read more about the current state of pharmaceutical imports to the U.S. here.

Headed to shelves from coast-to-coast now, drinkers can track down these tasty new favorites using Dogfish Head’s Fish Finder.

Trinseo Announces Quarterly Dividend of $0.01 Per Share,2024-02-22T18:27:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Trinseo (NYSE: TSE) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share, payable on April 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 4, 2024.","Trinseo Announces Quarterly Dividend of $0.01 Per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Trinseo (NYSE: TSE) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share, payable on April 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Trinseo regarding the authorization of a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share represents a tangible return to shareholders and is indicative of the company's current financial health and management's confidence in its cash flow stability. Dividends are often seen as a signal of a company's ability to generate consistent earnings and they can affect the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors. It is important to assess the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, as a measure of the return on investment for shareholders.Additionally, the sustainability of the dividend payout ratio, which is the portion of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends, should be evaluated. A low payout ratio may suggest room for future dividend increases, whereas a high ratio could indicate a potential strain on company resources. The timing of the dividend is also noteworthy, as it may coincide with fiscal reporting periods, potentially offering insights into Trinseo's upcoming earnings report. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Trinseo's dividend announcement can influence investor sentiment and market perception. Dividends are often factored into valuation models, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), which calculates the present value of anticipated dividends to determine a fair stock price. A change in dividend policy can lead to a reassessment of the company's valuation.It's also crucial to consider the competitive landscape within the specialty materials sector. Companies that offer dividends might be more appealing to certain investors compared to those that do not, especially in a market that is risk-averse or when the industry is facing economic headwinds. The announcement should be viewed in the context of industry dividend trends and the financial performance of peer companies. Economist Examining the macroeconomic implications, dividend distributions such as Trinseo's can reflect broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, for instance, dividends can be particularly attractive as they offer an alternative source of income. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the relative appeal of dividends may decrease as fixed-income investments become more competitive.The decision to pay out dividends also suggests management's stance on reinvestment opportunities. A modest dividend might imply that the company is balancing return of capital to shareholders with the need to reinvest in the business for growth. This balance is essential for long-term economic stability and reflects a company's strategic approach to capital allocation. 02/22/2024 - 01:27 PM WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinseo (NYSE: TSE), a specialty material solutions provider, today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share. The dividend will be a cash distribution payable on April 18, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 4, 2024.

Alcoa Corporation Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-02-22T16:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share for stockholders of record as of March 5, 2024, payable on March 21, 2024.","Alcoa Corporation Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share for stockholders of record as of March 5, 2024, payable on March 21, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Alcoa Corporation represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders and signals confidence from the company's management in its financial stability and profitability. Dividends are often seen as a sign of a company's mature phase of business, where excess cash is returned to shareholders rather than being reinvested heavily into the company. This could suggest that Alcoa is generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational needs and invest in growth while also rewarding shareholders.However, the size of the dividend, $0.10 per share, should be evaluated against the company's earnings per share (EPS) and the payout ratio to determine sustainability. If the payout ratio is too high, it might indicate that the company is prioritizing dividends over reinvestment in the business or debt reduction, which could be a concern for long-term growth prospects. Conversely, a modest payout ratio could imply that the dividend is well-covered by earnings and may be sustainable in the long run. Market Research Analyst The announcement's timing and its impact on investor sentiment are crucial. Dividends are a factor in the total shareholder return and consistent dividend payments can make a stock more attractive to income-focused investors. The market often reacts positively to dividend announcements, especially if they meet or exceed expectations. The consistency of Alcoa's dividend policy could also be a factor in institutional investors' assessment of the stock's suitability for dividend portfolios.It's important to consider the dividend yield, which is calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock's price. This yield is compared against industry peers and the broader market to assess competitiveness. A significant deviation from industry norms could warrant further analysis to understand the underlying strategy or financial health of the company. 02/22/2024 - 11:00 AM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of the Company’s common stock, to be paid on March 21, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 5, 2024.

The tool's ability to provide enterprise-level analytics for open source engagement could be a differentiator that sets EPAM apart from competitors. If OSPulse™ becomes a widely adopted industry standard, it could positively affect EPAM's stock performance by contributing to top-line growth and improving profit margins through potential subscription-based revenues.Investors should monitor the uptake of OSPulse™ closely, as its success could influence future earnings projections.

(AMSWA) declares a quarterly dividend of $.11 per share, payable to Class A and Class B Shareholders on May 3, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend of $.11 per share by American Software, Inc. signifies a distribution of profits back to shareholders, which can be a positive signal of the company's financial health and stability. Dividends are often seen as a reflection of a company's confidence in its current performance and future prospects. Shareholders typically view regular dividend payments as a reliable source of income, which can increase the attractiveness of the stock as an investment.From a financial analysis standpoint, it is important to assess the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock's price per share. A higher yield can make the stock more appealing to income-focused investors. However, it's also crucial to evaluate the payout ratio, which represents the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. An unusually high payout ratio could signal that the company is prioritizing dividends over reinvestment in growth opportunities, which could impact long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a dividend payment can also have implications for the stock's market performance. Dividend payments often lead to adjustments in the stock price on the ex-dividend date, which is the first day the stock trades without the right to receive the most recently declared dividend. A reduction in stock price is typically observed, reflecting the payout of cash assets. Investors and traders should be aware of this timing to understand short-term price movements.Moreover, the consistency and growth of dividends over time are factors that market analysts monitor closely as they may indicate a company's long-term commitment to returning value to shareholders. A company that can sustain or grow its dividend payout is often perceived as more stable and less risky, which can influence investor sentiment and stock valuation. 02/22/2024 - 12:29 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Software, Inc.

Respondents expect to increase AI applications from 251 to 488 by the end of 2024, with a shift in AI spending to 3.7% of the IT budget. Key AI use cases include cost optimization, predictive operations, and customer-facing recommendation engines. Positive None. Negative AI technologies are currently driving up costs across businesses more than saving through efficiencies. Enterprises are willing to pay 7-8% more for applications with AI functionality, despite the increase in costs. The study highlights that enterprises may be trailing peers in using AI to generate new revenue streams. Market Research Analyst The survey conducted by ISG reveals a significant trend in the enterprise sector's adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), with a projection to double AI-enabled applications by the end of 2024. This anticipated growth in AI applications represents a shift in resource allocation, with AI spending increasing from 2% to 3.7% of the IT budget. This data suggests a growing confidence in AI's ability to enhance business operations and deliver tangible benefits.From a market research perspective, the prioritization of AI initiatives is indicative of a competitive landscape where companies are seeking to gain an edge through technological innovation. The emphasis on creating a long-term AI strategy underscores the importance of a structured approach to integrating AI within the broader business framework. This strategic focus is likely to influence the direction of future investments and could lead to a surge in demand for AI specialists and infrastructure.However, the report also highlights a significant challenge: the increasing cost associated with AI implementation. While enterprises are willing to pay a premium for AI functionality, there is a concern that AI is currently driving up costs more than it is saving. This could impact profit margins and necessitate a careful evaluation of AI investments against expected returns. The focus on cost and labor efficiencies over the next two years suggests that businesses are looking for AI to transition from a cost center to a source of operational leverage. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the ISG survey findings are considerable for investors and stakeholders in the technology sector. The projected doubling of AI applications signifies a substantial increase in capital expenditure for enterprises, which could affect short-term profitability but potentially lead to long-term gains through improved efficiency and new revenue streams. The survey's indication that 42% of respondents are prioritizing AI use cases that improve customer experience could also have a positive impact on customer retention and lifetime value, which are critical metrics for sustainable growth.The acknowledgment that enterprises are trailing in using AI to generate new revenue streams, as noted by 27% of respondents, suggests that while AI is seen as a strategic necessity, its direct contribution to top-line growth may still be in its nascent stages. Investors should monitor how effectively companies can convert AI capabilities into revenue-generating products and services, as this will be a key determinant of AI's ROI.Additionally, the sector-specific use cases mentioned, such as recommendation engines in BFSI and retail and predictive operations in energy and manufacturing, highlight the diverse applications of AI across industries. This diversification could mitigate sector-specific risks and provide a cushion against market volatility for companies with a broad AI application portfolio. Technology Analyst The survey's insights into the enterprise AI landscape suggest a rapidly evolving technology sector where AI is becoming an integral component of business models. The focus on long-term AI strategies reflects a recognition that AI is not just a set of tools but a transformative factor that requires a holistic integration into business processes. This strategic integration is essential for harnessing AI's full potential in analytics, customer experience, HR and supply chain management.It is noteworthy that while AI is expected to drive up IT spending, enterprises are also placing a high value on AI's potential to achieve cost and labor efficiencies. This dichotomy underscores the complex relationship between initial investment in AI technology and the realization of its cost-saving benefits. The survey's findings on AI's role in increasing IT initiative spending in security, cloud and CX indicate that AI's impact is far-reaching, affecting various aspects of IT infrastructure and strategy.For technology stakeholders, the survey suggests a need to balance the enthusiasm for AI's capabilities with a prudent approach to managing costs. The willingness of enterprises to pay more for AI functionality also points to a market where AI-driven solutions can command a premium, potentially leading to increased profitability for providers of AI technologies and services. 02/22/2024 - 10:00 AM Survey of global AI decision-makers finds enterprises plan to double the number of AI-enabled applications by the end of 2024 STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New survey research from leading global technology research and advisory firm Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III) finds building a long-term AI strategy is the top priority for enterprise AI decision-makers. Forty-two percent of respondents to the ISG Market Lens™ Artificial Intelligence Study said creating a long-term AI strategy or roadmap is one of their organization’s top three priorities, followed by 37 percent who said identifying AI use cases that build new revenue streams and 34 percent who prioritize AI use cases that improve customer experience. The study was conducted globally in January 2024 and covered 200 executives with decision-making responsibility for AI initiatives and applications within IT and the business. “Enterprises currently have an average of 251 AI-enabled applications, including those in pilot or beta mode, a number they expect to nearly double to 488 by the end of 2024. This is a shift in AI spending from two percent of the IT budget in 2023 to 3.7 percent in 2024,” said Alex Bakker, ISG Distinguished Analyst and co-author of the ISG study. “These AI-enabled applications are wide-ranging, covering analytics, customer experience, HR, supply chain, procurement and more,” Bakker continued. “A long-term strategy is critical for guiding this rapid growth and ensuring AI investments are in line with business, revenue and customer experience goals.” Measuring their organization’s performance against the top AI priorities, respondents rated their progress toward a long-term strategy positively. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said their business is doing better than peer companies at formulating a long-term AI strategy, while 42 percent said their AI-supported customer experience is better than peers. However, 27 percent say they are trailing their peers when it comes to using AI to generate new revenue streams. Respondents say the most valuable AI use cases over the next two years will be cost and value optimization (rated most valuable by 26 percent of respondents), predictive operations such as supply chain (15 percent), and customer-facing recommendation engines (14 percent). In terms of use cases, cost optimization ranks highest across all industries, but other use cases vary by industry. For instance, recommendation engines rank second in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail, while predictive operations rank second in the energy and manufacturing sectors. In healthcare, quality assurance ranks second as the most important use case. “Enterprises expect AI to come at greater cost and are willing to pay 7 percent to 8 percent more for applications with AI functionality,” said Michael Dornan, principal analyst and co-author of the study. “Though the highest proportion (30 percent) of respondents said efficiency is their organization’s primary motivation for enabling AI technologies, AI is currently driving up costs across the business more than it is saving through efficiencies.” Dornan added: “Twice as many enterprises say their spending on security, cloud, CX and other IT initiatives is increasing compared with those who say it is falling, with AI considered the cause of the increase in around three-quarters of these cases. Even still, enterprises are placing the most value on achieving AI’s promise of cost and labor efficiencies over the coming two years.” ISG Market Lens™ buyer behavior studies combine findings from surveys of senior-level global executives with expert ISG research and analysis on market trends and strategic business initiatives. Recent studies explored application development and maintenance , cost optimization, cybersecurity, global capability centers, network modernization, banking and the future workplace.

NACCO INDUSTRIES DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND,2024-02-22T15:13:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NACCO Industries (NC) declares a regular cash dividend of 21.75 cents per share for both Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on March 15, 2024.","NACCO INDUSTRIES DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary NACCO Industries (NC) declares a regular cash dividend of 21.75 cents per share for both Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of NACCO Industries' regular cash dividend of 21.75 cents per share is a tangible reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate adequate cash flow. Dividends are often seen as a signal of a company's confidence in its future earnings and stability. In this case, the dividend payout could be interpreted by investors as a positive indicator, suggesting that NACCO believes it can sustain or potentially increase cash returns to shareholders.However, it's crucial to examine the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. A high yield may attract income-focused investors but can also indicate that the stock price has fallen, possibly due to underlying issues within the company or industry. Conversely, a low yield might suggest a higher stock price or a conservative dividend policy. Investors typically compare the yield against industry peers and the broader market to gauge attractiveness.Moreover, the payout ratio, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, should be sustainable. An excessively high payout ratio may not be sustainable in the long run, potentially leading to future dividend cuts if earnings decline. Conversely, a low payout ratio could indicate room for future dividend growth or that the company is reinvesting earnings back into the business for growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend by NACCO Industries can have implications for the stock's investor base. Dividend-paying stocks often attract a different type of investor, one who is looking for regular income streams and might be more risk-averse. This could potentially stabilize the stock price, as income-seeking investors tend to hold onto their shares longer, providing a steady demand for the stock.It is also important to consider the dividend's impact on the company's stock liquidity. Dividends can increase trading volume around the ex-dividend date, as investors may buy the stock to capture the dividend payout, which could temporarily affect the stock's liquidity and volatility. Observing the stock's performance around previous dividend dates might provide insights into how the market reacts to NACCO's dividend payments. Economist Examining NACCO Industries' dividend declaration within the broader economic context is essential. Dividend payments can be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and economic growth. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, dividend stocks can become more attractive relative to bonds, as they might offer higher yields. Conversely, if interest rates rise, bonds may become more appealing, potentially leading to a reallocation of capital away from dividend stocks like NACCO.Inflation also plays a role; if dividends do not increase at a rate that outpaces inflation, the real purchasing power of the dividend returns diminishes over time. Investors may seek companies with a strong track record of dividend growth that can potentially hedge against inflation. Lastly, during economic downturns, companies may cut dividends to conserve cash, so the ability to maintain or grow dividends can be seen as a sign of resilience and financial strength. 02/22/2024 - 10:13 AM CLEVELAND, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NACCO Industries® (NYSE: NC) announced today that the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of 21.75 cents per share.

The compromised personal information could lead to class-action lawsuits from customers and investigations by regulatory bodies.

The expansion will add two additional berths capable of handling the largest Excel class ships, projecting to welcome nearly 4 million guests annually by 2028. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The announcement of Carnival Corporation's $100 million pier expansion is a significant investment in infrastructure that is poised to have a notable impact on the local economy of Grand Bahama island. The expansion, which aims to double the arrival capacity at Celebration Key, indicates a strategic move to cater to increased tourism demand. This investment is expected to stimulate job creation during the construction phase and bolster the tourism sector upon completion.From an economic standpoint, the influx of nearly 4 million guests annually by 2028 could significantly increase the island's revenue from tourism, which is a critical component of the Bahamian economy. The multiplier effect of this increase in tourism could lead to ancillary business growth, such as local shops, restaurants and entertainment venues, thereby diversifying income sources for residents and contributing to economic resilience.However, it is essential to consider the potential for economic over-reliance on a single industry, which could make the local economy vulnerable to fluctuations in the cruise industry. Additionally, the environmental impact of such a large-scale project and the sustainability of increased tourism activity are factors that must be addressed to ensure long-term economic benefits. Market Research Analyst The pier expansion project by Carnival Corporation is a strategic initiative that reflects the company's confidence in the cruise industry's growth prospects. By doubling the berths at Celebration Key, Carnival is positioning itself to capture a larger market share of the cruise industry's rebound post-pandemic. This move could be seen as an indicator of the company's long-term growth strategy, which may resonate positively with investors and analysts monitoring the stock.It is also indicative of Carnival's commitment to enhancing customer experience by reducing congestion and wait times and providing more access to its exclusive destinations. This could lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, which are critical factors in driving repeat business in the cruise sector. The ability to accommodate four Excel-class ships simultaneously provides a competitive edge, as it signals the capacity to handle some of the largest and most lucrative cruise ships in operation.On the flip side, the significant capital expenditure required for such an expansion must be weighed against the expected increase in revenue. Investors will be keen on understanding the projected return on investment and how this aligns with Carnival's overall financial strategy. Environmental Analyst The environmental implications of the pier expansion by Carnival Cruise Line are a critical aspect that requires thorough analysis. The construction and operation of additional berths to accommodate larger cruise ships could have significant environmental impacts, including the potential disruption of marine ecosystems and increased pollution.It is essential to scrutinize the measures Carnival intends to implement to mitigate such impacts, such as sustainable construction practices, waste management systems and technologies to reduce emissions. These considerations are not only crucial for environmental conservation but also for maintaining the attractiveness of the destination, which is inherently linked to its natural beauty and ecological health.Furthermore, the environmental policies and practices of Carnival will be closely watched by stakeholders, including environmentally conscious travelers and investors who are increasingly prioritizing sustainability in their decision-making. The company's approach to environmental management in this project could significantly influence public perception and brand reputation in the long term. 02/22/2024 - 10:00 AM $100 million pier expansion to add two additional berths, doubling the arrivals at Carnival Cruise Line's highly anticipated, spacious new exclusive destination MIAMI, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), the world's largest cruise company, today announced plans for a $100 million pier extension that will double the arrival capacity of Celebration Key™, Carnival Cruise Line's new exclusive destination scheduled to open on Grand Bahama island in the summer of 2025. In addition to the two berths slated to be complete by 2025, the expansion will add two more berths, with all four capable of handling up to Carnival's largest Excel class ships when complete in 2026. Overall, the expanded cruise pier will accommodate up to four Excel-class ships simultaneously and is projected to welcome nearly 4 million guests annually to Celebration Key by 2028. The pier extension plans were announced Thursday, Feb. 22 at the 25th Annual Grand Bahama Business Outlook by The Honorable I. Chester Cooper, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Investments & Aviation in The Bahamas. ""As is fitting for our plans for Grand Bahama island, our vision for Celebration Key is quite grand, and we're already thinking about the next phase of expansion and development,"" said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. ""Building the second pier now allows us to implement growth plans and build itineraries with certainty, and signals to the local community just how important this development is to Carnival Cruise Line and the future of the island."" ""This is a momentous day for Grand Bahama and bodes extremely well for its future. The incredible level of new investment on the pier extension highlights the partnership between The Bahamas and Carnival Corporation and demonstrates the popularity of The Bahamas as a destination. Celebration Key will play a vital role in supporting the future prosperity of Grand Bahama and the country at large,"" said Cooper. ""Carnival Corporation's dedication to our island's growth is both commendable and inspiring – we applaud their expanded investment in Celebration Key in Grand Bahama and welcome the imminent exponential boost to the Grand Bahama economy,"" said Minister for Grand Bahama The Honourable Ginger Moxey M.P. ""We are on the brink of an exciting chapter for Grand Bahama, with Carnival Corporation's expansion opening doors to unprecedented possibilities for our residents. Let us collectively gear up for this transformative journey, as the spin-off opportunities are bound to bring about a wave of prosperity touching every corner of our beloved island."" Celebration Key – Planned with Growth in MindDesigned specifically for Carnival Cruise Line guests with occupancy growth in mind, the Celebration Key footprint has been carefully planned with expansive spaces and abundant attractions to comfortably host the additional guests expected in 2027. Featuring a mile-long, white sand beach, the largest freshwater lagoons in the Caribbean, and a range of dining, shopping and entertainment options, Celebration Key will include five distinct areas, known as portals, providing endless ways for guests to spread out, relax and enjoy their own kind of fun. With a focus on curating a distinctly Bahamian dining, shopping, and entertainment scene, Carnival Corporation is working closely with Bahamian officials and community leaders to recruit local companies, excursion operators, construction workers and entrepreneurs for the many business and job opportunities the development will generate and sustain. The company also has hired top Bahamian talent for strategic leadership roles in human resources, operations, and community affairs, and is actively recruiting to fill a number of additional senior positions in the coming months. Significant Economic Impact for the BahamasWith the additional $100 million pier extension investment, the now $600 million flagship project remains the largest of its kind ever undertaken by Carnival Corporation. The initial phase of the project, including the original two berths, is projected to help generate over 700 permanent jobs in the community – including approximately 300 Bahamians hired directly by Carnival Corporation to help welcome 2.2 million guests each year to Grand Bahama starting in 2025. Once the additional two berths are delivered, Celebration Key is expected to bring up to 4 million guests annually to the Grand Bahama destination by 2028. According to an economic impact study by Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company, over the next two decades the project will drive substantial growth in Bahamian employment, gross domestic product (GDP), and government revenue. The study estimates that the development, construction, and ongoing operation of Celebration Key will create over 2,500 direct Bahamian jobs, generate $3.2 billion in incremental revenue to the Government, and contribute $9.7 billion in incremental economic impact to the Bahamas GDP. Carnival Corporation and Carnival Cruise Line will continue to release additional details, including specifics on exciting features and development milestones for Celebration Key over the coming months.

The seeds are Non-GMO, Non-Neonic, and cater to organic-conscious gardeners. PlantlingsTM collection also returns, offering over 100 varieties of vegetable, herb, fruit, flower, and indoor baby plants for delivery starting in March. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Ferry-Morse's organic seed offerings aligns with increasing consumer trends towards organic and homegrown produce. This initiative by Central Garden & Pet Company could potentially capture a larger market share in the gardening industry, which is witnessing a rise in 'grow-your-own' movements, particularly in urban areas. By capitalizing on the organic niche, the company is positioning itself to meet the demands of a more health-conscious and environmentally aware customer base.Moreover, the introduction of over 100 USDA-certified organic seeds could lead to an increase in online sales, a segment that has seen significant growth across retail sectors. The emphasis on organic, Non-GMO and Non-Neonic products also caters to the growing segment of consumers who are concerned with ecological impacts, such as pollinator health. This strategic move may enhance the brand's reputation and could result in a positive impact on the stock market performance of Central Garden & Pet Company, as investors often look favorably upon companies that adapt to consumer preferences and show potential for expanded market reach. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the addition of a wide range of organic seeds to Ferry-Morse's inventory is likely to have several implications. Firstly, the premium pricing power of organic products could lead to higher margins and potentially increase the profitability for Central Garden & Pet Company. It is important to monitor the company's quarterly financial reports following the launch to assess the impact on revenue growth.Additionally, the timing of the release, ahead of the spring planting season, is strategic and could result in a seasonal boost in sales. However, investors should consider the costs associated with certifying and marketing these new organic products, as well as the logistics of maintaining a two-day shipping promise, which could impact the cost structure and ultimately the net income. Long-term, if the organic line is successful, it may contribute to a more stable revenue stream and diversify the company's product portfolio, which could be favorable in the eyes of investors seeking companies with sustainable growth prospects. Sustainability Expert The decision by Ferry-Morse to expand its organic seed offerings reflects a broader corporate sustainability trend. By providing Non-GMO and Non-Neonic seeds, the company is addressing environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss and pollinator decline. This approach not only caters to consumer preferences but also aligns with global sustainability goals, potentially reducing environmental risks associated with conventional agricultural practices.Furthermore, the company's commitment to sustainability could improve its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings, which are increasingly considered by investors when evaluating a company's long-term value. By demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices, Central Garden & Pet Company may attract socially responsible investors and could benefit from the growing trend of impact investing. However, the true measure of this initiative's success will depend on the company's ability to effectively market its organic products and maintain a high standard of quality and consistency in its offerings. 02/22/2024 - 10:02 AM Over 100 Edible Seeds Now USDA-Certified Organic NORTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ferry-Morse, one of the leading and oldest gardening seed brands in the United States, part of the Central Garden & Pet Company portfolio (NASDAQ: CENT) (NASDAQ: CENTA), has expanded its Organic Seed offerings in time for Spring planting season.

Cybersecurity concerns rise with 33% lacking protection. Insurance coverage gaps recognized, with companies needing more coverage than initially planned. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The robust growth in revenue among middle market companies, averaging 12.4%, indicates a significant economic contribution that could influence investor confidence and market dynamics. This growth, despite inflationary pressures, suggests resilience within this business segment, potentially translating into attractive investment opportunities. The reported pullback on expansion plans, however, may signal a cautious approach to capital allocation, which could affect future growth trajectories and should be monitored by investors for potential shifts in strategy.Furthermore, the emphasis on inflation as the primary risk reflects broader economic concerns that may impact profit margins and operational costs. The proactive measures taken by companies to manage inflation, such as raising prices and leveraging AI for efficiencies, could mitigate some of these pressures but may also lead to changes in consumer behavior and market competition. Risk Management Expert The heightened focus on cybersecurity, natural catastrophes and insurance coverage gaps underscores the evolving risk landscape for middle market companies. The reported preparedness of firms to handle catastrophic incidents and cyber threats is reassuring, yet the recognition of insurance gaps suggests a need for more comprehensive risk assessment and management strategies.The increasing severity of weather events and their impact on insurance purchasing decisions reflect a growing awareness of climate-related risks. Businesses that effectively integrate risk mitigation strategies, business continuity planning and physical risk assessments into their operations could see reduced long-term costs and enhanced sustainability. Conversely, inadequacies in coverage could lead to significant financial vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity Specialist The MMI's findings on cybersecurity concerns highlight the critical nature of cyber risk management in today's digital landscape. With a significant portion of middle market companies considering additional cyber insurance coverage, there is an acknowledgment of the severe impact cyber incidents can have on business continuity. The survey's indication of a majority seeking or considering more coverage suggests a market trend where demand for cyber insurance is likely to grow.As cyber threats evolve, companies that invest in robust cybersecurity measures and tailor their insurance to cover potential gaps will likely be better positioned to prevent and recover from incidents. This investment in cybersecurity can also serve as a competitive differentiator, potentially influencing stakeholder perceptions and market value. 02/22/2024 - 10:00 AM New Chubb and National Center of Middle Market Survey reveals inflation remains the number one risk, and rising concerns over cybersecurity, natural catastrophes and insurance coverage gaps WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chubb and the National Center for the Middle Market (NCMM) released today new data that reveals middle market companies demonstrated continued robust growth against the backdrop of inflationary pressures, cybersecurity threats, natural catastrophes and insurance coverage gaps. These findings are the centerpiece of the 2023 Year-End Middle Market Indicator (MMI). Middle market companies reported strong revenue growth compared to one year ago. On average, revenue was up 12.4%. More than half (55%) generated revenue growth of 10% or more. And more than eight in 10 (83%) said revenues were up year over year. These results are the highest since the MMI began surveying companies in 2012. ""Middle market companies are a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy, and our survey shows they are posting record growth,"" said Ben Rockwell, Division President, Chubb Middle Market. ""The findings of the MMI provide relevant direction and insights for agents and brokers to best counsel middle market companies in navigating and mitigating the risk management pressures with this critical business segment."" Increasing preparedness for emerging risks continues to be top of mind for the middle market. According to the MMI, firms believed they were completely or very prepared to respond to the following disruptions: Inflation (45%)Catastrophic incidents (53%)Cybersecurity threats (58%)However, compared to results from the MMI report in the second quarter of 2023, businesses indicated a pullback on expansion plans. In the latest report, three out of five companies (61%) said they plan to introduce a new product or service in the year ahead, versus 68% in the mid-2023 survey. There were similar declines for expansion into new domestic markets (55% vs. 62%) and adding a new plant/facility (42% vs. 48%). Inflation Number One Risk The MMI found inflation continued to be the number one risk for companies, and likely to persist due to rising labor costs and geographic conflicts impacting trade routes. Nearly 60% say they find managing inflation extremely or very challenging, with higher wages as a major factor fueling cost pressures. To combat inflation and lingering recession worries, companies say they plan on raising prices and increasing their use of AI to improve efficiencies and data analytics. Damage from Weather Events Increase in Severity The U.S. was impacted by a record 28 separate billion-dollar climate disaster events in 2023, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and respondents view this as a significant risk to their firms heading into 2024. Nearly half (48%) say it's a top three factor in their insurance purchasing decisions. Over half of firms (53%) indicated they are completely or very prepared for disruption from catastrophic incidents. The MMI confirmed the importance of developing business continuity plans, as 44% of firms say they only recovered partially or not at all from an operational disruption. ""Middle market companies can benefit from the expertise and knowledge their agent or broker possess in preparing for short- and long-term catastrophe events,"" Michelle McLaughlin, Executive Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer, Chubb Middle Market, added. ""This advice can translate into securing adequate coverage protection, risk mitigation strategies, business continuity planning and physical risk assessments for middle market companies achieving a more protected future."" Cybersecurity Concerns Rising The threat landscape for managing cybersecurity looms large for middle market companies, with 33% identifying insufficient cybersecurity protection. Other notable findings include: More than three in five (62%) survey respondents indicated cyber security as one of their top concerns factoring into their insurance purchasing decisions.Nearly half of companies (47%) believed they had adequate cyber insurance in place.A majority (52%) acknowledged that they needed or were considering the coverage.""As the predictability of cyber threats becomes more difficult, the MMI survey shows the urgent need for companies to address cyber risks to prevent catastrophic disruptions,"" said Mike Kessler, Division President, Chubb Global Cyber Risk. ""We work with companies and their broker or agent to provide insight into the causes of cyber incidents and cyber security solutions to help prevent attacks, as well as assess protection gaps and tailor coverage to help clients recover from a cyber incident."" Insurance Gaps Recognized Middle market companies acknowledge that their overall needs for particular coverages were greater than what they had envisioned in their initial planning efforts. In terms of only adequacy and needs, respondents shared the following: Multinational – 36% said they were adequately covered, but 47% indicated they need or are considering additional protection.Environmental (pollution liability) – 40% said they were adequately covered, but more than half (51%) said they need or are considering additional protection.Cyber insurance – 47% said they were adequately covered, but 52% indicated said they need or are considering additional protection.Chubb's Executive Summary with detailed findings are available here. Additional industry insights will be forthcoming across manufacturing, technology, financial services, and life sciences.

The survey is weighted to accurately reflect the size, industry-wide, and geographic distribution of this sector. These are companies with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, which represent one-third of private sector GDP, employing approximately 48 million people.

Xerox Holdings Corporation Declares Dividend on Common and Preferred Stock,2024-02-22T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on Xerox Holdings Corporation Common Stock and $20.00 per share on the outstanding Xerox Holdings Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock.,"Xerox Holdings Corporation Declares Dividend on Common and Preferred Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on Xerox Holdings Corporation Common Stock and $20.00 per share on the outstanding Xerox Holdings Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Xerox Holdings Corporation represents a commitment to return value to shareholders and can be indicative of the company's financial health and stability. The dividend amount of $0.25 per share on common stock is a tangible return on investment for shareholders and can be a factor in the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors. The timely payment of dividends is often seen as a signal of a company's confidence in its ongoing cash flow and profitability.When evaluating the impact of such a dividend declaration, one must consider the company's dividend yield, which is calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing it by the stock's price. This yield is compared to industry benchmarks and historical yields of the company to assess the attractiveness of the dividend. Additionally, the sustainability of dividends is critical; this involves reviewing the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high may not be sustainable in the long term. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of dividends by a company like Xerox, which operates in the competitive technology and document management industry, may influence investor sentiment and stock market performance. Dividend announcements can cause share price movements as they are often interpreted as signals regarding a company's future prospects. A consistent dividend payout could be perceived as a sign of stability and may attract or retain investors looking for regular income, potentially increasing demand for the stock.Moreover, the market reaction can also be influenced by how the dividend announcement aligns with market expectations. If the dividend is in line with or exceeds expectations, the stock might see a positive reaction. Conversely, if the dividend is lower than expected, it may lead to a negative market response. It's also important to consider the ex-dividend date, as the stock price typically drops by approximately the amount of the dividend after this date. 02/22/2024 - 12:00 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) announced today that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on Xerox Holdings Corporation Common Stock.

"United Expands World's Largest Flight Training Center with Huge, New Building and Room for 12 New Flight Simulators",2024-02-22T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"United Airlines opens a new 150,000-square-foot building at its Flight Training Center in Denver, adding advanced flight simulators and increasing training capacity. The airline has hired over 300 pilots in 2024 and invested in people, infrastructure, and technology to support its growth strategy.","United Expands World's Largest Flight Training Center with Huge, New Building and Room for 12 New Flight Simulators Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary United Airlines opens a new 150,000-square-foot building at its Flight Training Center in Denver, adding advanced flight simulators and increasing training capacity. The airline has hired over 300 pilots in 2024 and invested in people, infrastructure, and technology to support its growth strategy. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of United's Flight Training Center in Denver signifies a strategic investment in human capital and technology, which is essential for accommodating the company's ambitious growth trajectory under the United Next plan. The addition of 12 advanced full-motion flight simulators, with six already in place, directly enhances training capacity and pilot proficiency. This is a proactive measure to ensure that the influx of new aircraft into United's fleet is matched by a well-trained pilot workforce.From a market perspective, the investment in training infrastructure can be perceived as a long-term commitment to safety and efficiency, which are critical factors in an airline's reputation and operational success. The projected increase in training events and the ability to train more pilots per day could translate into improved service reliability and more rapid scaling of operations to meet demand. Moreover, the financial commitment to the training center, amounting to $370 million since 2016, reflects a significant capital expenditure which stakeholders should monitor in terms of return on investment through enhanced operational performance and potential market share gains. Financial Analyst United's investment in the Flight Training Center could have a material impact on the company's financials. The $145 million allocated to the new building and the anticipated $65 million in hotel expenditures for pilots in 2024 highlight a substantial increase in operating expenses. However, these investments are likely to be offset by the long-term operational efficiencies and the capacity to support a larger fleet. The creation of 370 new jobs and the associated economic activity in Denver could also foster a positive relationship with the local community and government, potentially leading to favorable conditions for future business operations.Investors should note the correlation between these investments and United's operational capacity to handle an increasing number of flights, particularly the 40 new summer flights from Denver. This expansion is a clear indicator of growth potential and could be a driver for increased revenue. The financial health of the airline will depend on how effectively it can leverage its increased capacity to generate higher passenger volumes and maintain competitive advantage. Economist The economic implications of United's expansion in Denver extend beyond the airline itself. The investment in the Flight Training Center has a multiplier effect on the local economy, as evidenced by the $44 million spent on hotel room nights in 2023, with expectations for higher expenditures in 2024. This spending stimulates the hospitality sector and creates a cascade of economic activity in related industries. Furthermore, the strategic positioning in Denver, with its growing hub and nearly $1 billion in customer experience enhancements at DEN, suggests that United is leveraging both geographical and infrastructural advantages to optimize its network efficiency and capitalize on passenger traffic growth.From a broader economic standpoint, the airline's growth initiatives can be seen as a response to increasing demand for air travel, which is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as consumer confidence and disposable income levels. The success of United's investments will thus be contingent on the prevailing economic conditions and the airline's ability to adapt to changing market dynamics. 02/22/2024 - 12:00 PM Airline has hired more than 300 pilots to-date this year and hired more than 2,300 pilots in 2023 New 150,000 square foot facility will have the potential to train up to 240 more pilots per day Investments in people, infrastructure and technology continue to fuel United Next growth strategy DENVER, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- United today opened a new, 150,000-square-foot building at its Flight Training Center in Denver. Already the largest facility of its kind in the world, the additional building gives the airline the capability to add 12 more advanced full-motion flight simulators to the facility, six of which have already been delivered. So far in 2024, the airline has hired more than 300 pilots after hiring more than 2,300 pilots last year. The new building at the campus adds even more training capacity for United's 16,000 pilots. United's Flight Training Center now has eight total buildings, more than 700,000 square feet of training space, and 46 state-of-the-art full-motion flight simulators. These investments in people, infrastructure and technology continue to fuel the airline's United Next plan. United CEO Scott Kirby was joined by leaders from the Flight Training Center and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston to celebrate the opening and show off the facility. ""We're growing faster than any airline in the industry and our investments in our pilots and their training are critical to support the unprecedented number of new aircraft United will add to our fleet in the decades ahead,"" said Kirby. ""United pilots are the best aviators in the world and the way we recruit, hire and train directly supports that high standard of excellence."" New Capabilities Located in the Central Park neighborhood of Denver, the facility spans 23-acres and is the sole training facility for the airline's nearly 16,000 active pilots and all newly hired pilots. All United pilots complete intensive simulator training with pilot instructors and evaluators during the initial qualification process and every nine months thereafter to maintain their certifications at United's Flight Training Center in Denver. Currently, United's Flight Training Center has 46 full-motion flight simulators, including six in the new building, and 21 fixed training devices.In addition to the six already in the new building, it has space to add six more full-motion flight simulators.The addition of the new building allows for a total of 52 full-motion flight simulators and 34 fixed training devices at the Flight Training Center.The new building gives the Flight Training Center the ability to conduct more than 32,000 training events annually and train up to 860 pilots per day.The facility is in operation 24 hours a day for 362 days a year.Flight Training Center's Local Impact United invested more than $145 million in the new building and it's expected to lead to more than 370 new jobs. In total, more than 1,600 of United's 10,000+ Denver-based employees work at United's Flight Training Center, representing 24 different departments in roles that include flight instructing, flight evaluating, scheduling, pilot hiring, human resources and flight standards. In 2023, more than $44 million was spent on hotel room nights in Denver for pilots visiting the training facility, with an expectation to spend more than $65 million in 2024. United's Flight Training Center was originally constructed between 1966-68 as part of the Stapleton Airport complex and has served as United's main pilot training facility since then. Since 2016, United has invested $370 million in the Flight Training Center overall. United in Denver United continues to invest in Denver. In the summer of 2023, United announced the purchase of two parcels of undeveloped land near Denver International Airport (DEN), part of which will be used to further expand its Flight Training Center as the current Flight Training Center site does not have capacity for additional growth. United is aiming to have flight training capabilities at the Flight Training Center expansion by 2028. As home to its fastest-growing hub, the airline has funneled nearly $1 billion in the past few years alone to further improve the customer experience at DEN. This includes new gates, state-of-the-art United clubs, including the largest in the United network to-date, and a new check-in lobby. United hired more than 2,500 people in Denver last year and plans to hire more than 1,000 people in 2024. United operates the most flights and carries the most passengers in the state compared to any other carrier. This summer, United will offer more than 500 daily departures from DEN, including 40 new summer flights. The airline provides service to more than 175 destinations, including 10 countries, from the Mile High City. Careers Take Flight United is the career destination of choice for pilots, offering the largest widebody fleet in North America, and the most comprehensive global network and hubs across the U.S. In 2023, United pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International, ratified a new four-year contract.

MAIA Biotechnology Completes Enrollment in THIO-101 Phase 2 Clinical Trial for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,2024-02-22T15:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Positive,"MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. completes enrollment in Phase 2 THIO-101 trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, showing promising results and potential as a new standard of care.","MAIA Biotechnology Completes Enrollment in THIO-101 Phase 2 Clinical Trial for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. completes enrollment in Phase 2 THIO-101 trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, showing promising results and potential as a new standard of care. Positive Completion of enrollment in Phase 2 THIO-101 trial for advanced NSCLC. Strong patient enrollment and completion ahead of schedule. Positive preliminary data with high disease control and response rates. THIO-101 showing potential as a new standard of care for NSCLC. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The completion of patient enrollment in MAIA Biotechnology's Phase 2 THIO-101 clinical trial represents a significant milestone in the development of new treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The focus on a telomere targeting agent is particularly noteworthy, as telomeres play a crucial role in cellular aging and cancer progression. By targeting telomeres, THIO has the potential to disrupt cancer cell division and survival. The preliminary data suggesting unprecedented rates of disease control and response could indicate a promising new avenue for NSCLC therapy, which is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The choice of the 180mg dose and the expedited completion of enrollment suggest a well-designed trial and potentially favorable safety profile. If the long-term efficacy results are positive, THIO could indeed set a new standard of care, significantly impacting patient treatment options and outcomes. However, it is important to remain cautious until the final data is released, as many treatments that show early promise do not always translate into clinical success. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the advancement of THIO-101 to the second half of Phase 2 trials is a critical step in validating the drug's efficacy and safety. The Simon 2-stage design mentioned by MAIA's CEO is a statistical method used in clinical trials to minimize patient exposure to potentially ineffective treatments. The fact that MAIA has chosen this design for their trial underscores their commitment to a rigorous scientific approach. The early selection of an optimal dose can streamline the research process, potentially reducing the time and cost associated with clinical development.For stakeholders, the success of THIO in the market hinges not only on its clinical efficacy but also on its ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and secure approval from bodies like the FDA. The promising preliminary data could attract partnership opportunities, increase investor confidence and raise the company's profile in the competitive oncology market. However, it's also critical to monitor the competitive landscape, as other companies may be developing similar or more advanced therapies that could influence THIO's market potential. Market Research Analyst In terms of market impact, the announcement by MAIA Biotechnology could have significant implications for their stock valuation and investor interest. The NSCLC market is a high-value space, with a growing incidence rate and a clear need for innovative treatments. A successful telomere targeting agent could capture a sizable market share and provide MAIA with a strong revenue stream. Investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming efficacy results, as these will provide a clearer picture of the drug's commercial viability.It's also important to consider the broader implications for the pharmaceutical industry. A new standard of care for NSCLC could shift treatment paradigms and influence research and investment in related fields. Companies with complementary therapies or diagnostic tools could benefit from such a shift. Conversely, competitors with less effective or more toxic treatments could find their market positions weakened. The anticipation of topline data in the second half of 2024 will likely keep MAIA in the spotlight among investors and industry analysts alike. 02/22/2024 - 10:30 AM Topline data expected in second half of 2024THIO-101 will be the first completed clinical study of a telomere targeting agent in the field of cancer drug discovery and treatment CHICAGO, IL, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MAIA Biotechnology, Inc., (NYSE American: MAIA) (“MAIA”, the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing targeted immunotherapies for cancer, today announced that enrollment is now complete in its Phase 2 THIO-101 go-to-market clinical trial evaluating THIO sequenced with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) cemiplimab (Libtayo®) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

As of the latest data available for the trial, 79 patients had received either 60mg (24 patients), 180mg (41 patients) or 360mg (14 patients). The original trial design targeted up to 182 patients, including all patients in the safety lead-in and 41 patients in each of the 3 tested doses (60mg, 180mg, and 360mg). Following the selection of 180 mg/cycle as the optimal dose in December 2023, all patients were subsequently enrolled at the 180mg/cycle dose and trial enrollment was completed ahead of schedule. “Enrollment in our Phase 2 THIO-101 trial has been strong from the start. With excellent results across all doses and our selection of the optimal dose in December 2023, we enrolled the necessary number of patients in the Simon 2-stage design to achieve our trial endpoints earlier than expected,” said Vlad Vitoc, M.D., MAIA’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “THIO-101 preliminary data has demonstrated unprecedented rates of disease control and response to date, and we look forward to the long-term efficacy results as we continue to monitor the enrolled patients in the upcoming months. As the only direct telomere targeting agent currently undergoing clinical development in the field of cancer, we believe THIO holds a time-to-market advantage and strong potential to become a new standard of care for NSCLC.” The main objectives of the THIO-101 trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical efficacy of THIO in patients with advanced NSCLC who have experienced disease progression or relapse after initial treatments with an immune CPI alone or in combination with chemotherapy. About THIO THIO (6-thio-dG or 6-thio-2’-deoxyguanosine) is a first-in-class investigational telomere-targeting agent currently in clinical development to evaluate its activity in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Telomeres, along with the enzyme telomerase, play a fundamental role in the survival of cancer cells and their resistance to current therapies. The modified nucleotide 6-thio-2’-deoxyguanosine (THIO) induces telomerase-dependent telomeric DNA modification, DNA damage responses, and selective cancer cell death. THIO-damaged telomeric fragments accumulate in cytosolic micronuclei and activates both innate (cGAS/STING) and adaptive (T-cell) immune responses. The sequential treatment with THIO followed by PD-(L)1 inhibitors resulted in profound and persistent tumor regression in advanced, in vivo cancer models by induction of cancer type–specific immune memory. THIO is presently developed as a second or later line of treatment for NSCLC for patients that have progressed beyond the standard-of-care regimen of existing checkpoint inhibitors. About THIO-101, a Phase 2 Clinical Trial THIO-101 is a multicenter, open-label, dose finding Phase 2 clinical trial. It is the first trial designed to evaluate THIO’s anti-tumor activity when followed by PD-(L)1 inhibition. The trial is testing the hypothesis that low doses of THIO administered prior to cemiplimab (Libtayo®) will enhance and prolong immune response in patients with advanced NSCLC who previously did not respond or developed resistance and progressed after first-line treatment regimen containing another checkpoint inhibitor. The trial design has two primary objectives: (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of THIO administered as an anticancer compound and a priming immune activator (2) to assess the clinical efficacy of THIO using Overall Response Rate (ORR) as the primary clinical endpoint. Treatment with cemiplimab (Libtayo®) followed by THIO has been generally well-tolerated to date in a heavily pre-treated population.

The report showcases surging interest in chatbot development, LangChain, and certifications like TOGAF and AWS, emphasizing the need for upskilling in a fast-evolving work environment. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The report released by Udemy signifies notable trends in the demand for specific skills, which has direct implications on the labor market and, by extension, on businesses that rely on a skilled workforce. The surge in demand for gen AI skills, cybersecurity and ethical hacking courses reflects a broader shift in the technology landscape, where businesses are increasingly reliant on AI and data security. This shift is likely to influence hiring practices, as companies may prioritize candidates with these emerging skills. Furthermore, the focus on certifications such as TOGAF and AWS suggests a growing emphasis on formal qualifications, which could reshape the IT training market and potentially increase competition among online learning platforms.The data presented indicates a potential increase in investment from companies in employee training and development, aiming to close skill gaps and enhance competitive advantage. As such, businesses in the tech sector, particularly those involved in AI, cybersecurity and cloud services, may experience a positive impact on their talent acquisition strategies and product development cycles. In the long-term, this could lead to innovations and improved security protocols, benefiting both companies and consumers. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the growing demand for technical and business skills can have a significant impact on Udemy's revenue streams. The enrollment numbers and course demand growth rates serve as indicators of the company's market position and potential for future growth. The data suggests that Udemy is successfully capitalizing on the increasing need for continuous learning and upskilling in a dynamic job market. This trend may lead to sustained customer acquisition and retention, driving long-term revenue growth for Udemy.Moreover, the interest in IT certifications and the introduction of the Integrated Skills Framework by Udemy could differentiate the company from competitors and potentially create new revenue channels through badging and certification services. Investors might view these developments as an opportunity for Udemy to expand its market share in the e-learning industry. However, it is crucial to monitor how these trends translate into financial metrics such as customer lifetime value, average revenue per user and profit margins, which are key factors in evaluating the company's financial health and stock performance. Economist The data provided by Udemy's report has broader economic implications, particularly in terms of workforce development and productivity. The emphasis on emerging skills such as gen AI, cybersecurity and ethical hacking suggests a labor market in transition, with a shift towards more specialized and high-tech roles. This could lead to higher productivity as workers become more adept at leveraging technology, but it may also exacerbate existing skills mismatches and contribute to wage polarization.Furthermore, the increasing importance placed on 'human' skills like active listening and work-life balance reflects a changing corporate culture that values soft skills alongside technical proficiency. This cultural shift could improve employee satisfaction and retention rates, ultimately enhancing economic output. However, the transition may present challenges for workers who need to adapt to new technologies and work arrangements, potentially leading to short-term disruptions in the labor market. 02/22/2024 - 11:00 AM Latest report from Udemy highlights emerging demand across technical and business skillsSAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Udemy (Nasdaq: UDMY), a leading online skills marketplace and learning platform, today released its Q4 2023 Global Workplace Learning Index, a quarterly report highlighting emergent skills that are growing in demand, as workers of today continue to navigate a fast-evolving work environment. Drawing from the activity of nearly 16,000 Udemy Business customers across the globe, Udemy is uniquely equipped to provide insight into the emergent technological and professional skills in the workplace today. These insights enable Udemy to arm organizations and learners with the information they need to stay ahead of trends and compete in a constantly evolving workplace. “2023 was a year where trends around generative AI (gen AI), hybrid work, building inclusive global workplaces, and macroeconomic uncertainty drove the consistent need to upskill across both technological and leadership capabilities,"" said Greg Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer at Udemy. “Workers today need tech skills as much as they need soft, or power skills. Our Q4 Workplace Learning Index highlights how professionals are responding to, and meeting these demands, with surging interest in skills like chatbot development, listening, and customer service.” The Index highlighted several emerging themes in corporate learning, including: Gen AI skills continue to surge, suggesting an evolution in how workers are utilizing it. Growth in LangChain (109%) and chatbot development skills (56%) suggest that workers are moving from trying to understand what gen AI is to learning how they can apply it to their roles and businesses. As of Q4 2023, 3.2 million learners had enrolled in more than 1,700 gen AI courses on the Udemy platform. According to Udemy’s Global Learning & Skills Trends Report, ChatGPT was the fastest-growing skill in 2023, with a surge of 4,419%. While ChatGPT continues to be popular and remains a surging skill in some countries, professionals are also learning how to build their own models with their own data, rather than relying solely on external bots. Just like when developers began to build their own apps, this movement could signal significant innovation in the field.The gen AI skills surge is happening in parallel with surges in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. As organizations start to leverage more data for gen AI, they may also recognize the need for stronger cybersecurity capabilities. Udemy saw growing demand for cybersecurity courses in Spain (154%) and Mexico (47%), in particular. Similarly, courses for ethical hacking saw increased demand within the entertainment and media industry (37%) and also in Mexico (28%).As workers continue to navigate hybrid or remote work and find their place in an AI-focused landscape, they’re eager to improve their “human” skills. For leaders and employees alike, skills like active listening and work-life balance are even more important as they seek to communicate with colleagues in a mix of in-person and virtual settings and try to set boundaries in a world in which work is ever-present and always on. Globally, listening skills have surged 52%, customer service skills by 51%, and work-life balance skills saw an increase of 42%.Learners continue to value and seek certifications to stand out in a competitive job market. Udemy is among the largest platforms to support IT certification on the market, with 10 million enrollments in IT certification training on the platform in the past year. Globally, the fastest-growing certification preparation courses were The Open Group Certified: TOGAF Enterprise Architecture Foundation, which saw an increase of 167%, and 1Z0-819: Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 11 Developer with an increase of 63%. In the tech industry, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification was increasingly popular, with an increase of 86%, and AWS dominated in global markets such as Japan, where AWS Certified Security - Specialty increased by 86%. To address this continued demand, Udemy introduced the Integrated Skills Framework in 2023 for the discovery, preparation, and demonstration of skill-building in organizations through badging and certifications. “The world of work is shifting quickly, and the skills necessary for success are shifting with it,” said Stephanie Stapleton Sudbury, President of Udemy Business. “As more leaders begin to integrate skills-based approaches into their talent and development strategies, it’s even more important to keep a finger on the pulse of key learning trends and top skills to prepare their workforces.” To learn more about how organizations can partner with Udemy Business to upskill for the future, visit: business.udemy.com.

(AGR) announces the use of a non-pipes alternative solution for whole home electrification in Irondequoit, NY, supporting New York's climate goals. The project aims to remove leak-prone gas mains and electrify three homes, contributing to decarbonization efforts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The company's commitment to zero-net increase in natural gas use aligns with state clean energy targets. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Policy Analyst The initiative by Avangrid to replace gas lines with full home electrification in Irondequoit, NY, aligns with broader state and national objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition towards renewable energy sources. This project is a practical example of the implementation of non-pipes alternatives (NPAs), which are increasingly significant as utilities seek cost-effective ways to address system requirements without expanding fossil fuel infrastructure.NPAs are part of a strategic shift in energy policy, focusing on demand-side solutions to manage energy use and reduce reliance on traditional gas infrastructure. The integration of NPAs into the gas system planning process by NYSEG and RG&E is indicative of a proactive approach to system decarbonization. This not only supports New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) goals but also reflects a growing trend in the utility sector to embrace sustainable practices.From a policy perspective, the success of such programs can set a precedent for other states and regions, potentially influencing legislation and regulatory frameworks to favor similar decarbonization efforts. Environmental Economist Avangrid's Whole Home Electrification Program represents an economically significant shift in addressing the externalities associated with natural gas use. By removing leak-prone gas mains and offering incentives for full home electrification, the program targets both environmental benefits—such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions—and economic efficiencies.The concept of NPAs as a cost-effective solution to avoid traditional capital projects is noteworthy. It suggests a potential reduction in long-term operational costs for utilities and a shift in capital expenditure towards more sustainable and potentially less expensive infrastructure. This may have a positive impact on Avangrid's financial performance, as well as on customer utility bills over time.Moreover, the combination of NPA-based incentives with other programs like the New York State Clean Heat Program could stimulate the local economy by creating demand for electrification services and technologies. If successful, this model could be replicated, leading to increased investment in clean energy infrastructure and potential job creation in the sector. Sustainability Advisor The transition from natural gas to electrification in residential homes, as demonstrated by Avangrid's project, is a critical component of sustainable development. The project contributes to the overarching goal of reducing carbon footprints and mitigating climate change impacts. By focusing on leak-prone areas, Avangrid is addressing a direct source of methane emissions—a potent greenhouse gas.Electrification of homes, when paired with a grid increasingly powered by renewable energy, can lead to significant reductions in household carbon emissions. This strategy may also enhance energy security by reducing dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets. Furthermore, the homeowner testimonial underscores the importance of customer perception and acceptance in the success of such sustainability initiatives.Long-term, the project's implications on Avangrid's corporate sustainability and social responsibility could strengthen its brand reputation and consumer trust, potentially leading to a competitive advantage in the energy market. 02/22/2024 - 10:57 AM Project replaced gas lines with full home electrification, which is crucial to New York’s Climate Goals Project helps customers electrify their homes with incentives ORANGE, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avangrid, Inc. (NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainabile energy company and member of the Iberdrola Group, has announced that it will use a non-pipes alternative (NPA) solution in Irondequoit, NY to realize Avangrid’s first Whole Home Electrification Program project. The project, in Rochester Gas and Electric’s (RG&E) service area, will result in the removal of 119 feet of leak-prone gas main to ultimately achieve electrification of three homes via an NPA solution. “These types of projects demonstrate our commitment to decarbonization efforts across the country,” said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. “As Avangrid’s renewable work and its utilities increasingly promote climate change objectives, projects like this will serve as a roadmap for our operations across the company.” “This program delivers benefits to customers and society as a whole,” said Trish Nilsen, president and CEO of New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and RG&E. “We use cost-effective solutions to avoid traditional natural gas capital projects that would otherwise be needed to address system requirements.” NPAs support the Company’s commitment to a zero-net increase in natural gas use, as well as system decarbonization efforts resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions that help achieve New York’s climate and clean energy targets – including those established by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). The Companies have committed more than $4 billion for clean energy and energy efficiency projects proposed throughout New York state, as part of CLCPA goals to increase renewable energy and reduce greenhouse emissions by 40 percent by 2030. One homeowner who participated said, “I was extremely reluctant to do this project. I thought this must be one of those ‘too good to be true.’ Being so skeptical, I was the last to sign on. I am so fortunate that I chose YES. I am so grateful and overwhelmed by the generosity bestowed on me.” The objective of the Whole Home Electrification Program is to target leak-prone main replacement projects where feasible and achieve full electrification of buildings located in these areas to enable retirement of the impacted section of gas main. To make these projects as economical as possible, NPA-based incentives are combined with others that may be available (e.g., New York State Clean Heat Program), resulting in conversion packages offered to customers at no cost. At NYSEG and RG&E, the NPA process has been integrated into the gas system planning process and all natural gas projects involving the construction of new pipeline or the replacement or expansion of existing pipeline are screened for applicability of NPA solutions. RG&E has partnered with ICF Resources, LLC to deliver this beneficial opportunity for exclusive upgrades to customers within the targeted segments of gas main. For customers interested in pursuing electrification and other energy options, NYSEG and RG&E have options and resources available to assist with making energy decisions.

Dartmouth College and more schools may follow suit. Kaplan survey shows potential trend reversal in college admissions. Positive None. Negative None. 02/22/2024 - 10:25 AM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Yale University announced today that it will join a growing number of top colleges and universities across the United States that are reinstating the requirement that prospective students submit scores from standardized tests, including the SAT® or ACT®; but the university also said it will permit applicants to submit scores from subject-based Advanced Placement® or International Baccalaureate® tests in lieu of SAT or ACT scores, as part of what they are calling a “flexible testing policy.” In announcing its decision, Yale said evaluating applicants without test scores “worked to the disadvantage of applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds.” On February 5, Dartmouth College became the first Ivy League school to bring back the standardized testing requirement. And results from Kaplan’s 2023 college admissions officers survey find that these schools may not be alone for long*. Of the more than 200 test optional schools Kaplan surveyed late last year, 15 percent said they are considering reinstating or will definitely reinstate the requirement. The survey also finds that among these same test optional schools, 67 percent say if a student submits a competitive SAT or ACT score, it helps their application. “When the COVID pandemic hit in March 2020, the college admissions landscape was transformed almost overnight. Pre-pandemic, the vast majority of colleges and universities still required applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores, but amid concerns about students safely being able to sit for the exams and concerns that applications may drop, most schools went test optional. What we are seeing might be a slight turning of the tide, but not yet a sea change,” said Brian Carlidge, senior vice president, Kaplan. “Kaplan’s most recent college admissions officers survey finds that a significant percentage of test optional schools are reevaluating their policies, as they may have already served their purpose and run their course, and may now be counterproductive to their original intent. Trends like this tend to have a snowball effect, so if more top schools bring back the requirement, expect more to follow. We’ll be tracking this issue carefully.” Carlidge points out that the possible shift back to standardized test scores comes amid the launch of the digital SAT in March and a possible enrollment cliff that has many colleges and universities concerned about their long term stability.

Further cost reductions and improved solar project rates of return on investments of more than 20 to 30 percent can be obtained using our patent pending solar tracker if the project is based on a ground mount or flat roof application. In recent news related to new product developments, Mass Megawatts recently announced improvements toward cost reductions using the patent pending cost cutting concentrated solar power technology. The most important innovation toward reducing the cost of electricity is related to the unique solar concentration section that works well with our patent pending solar tracker. We have two patent pending versions of concentrated solar technology. One is related to additional output for photovoltaic cells and the other is related to concentration of heat to operate a new and improved patent pending Sterling engine to produce electricity. The Concentrated Solar Sterling Engine innovation brings the best substantial cost saving improvements toward delivering solar generated electricity. The unique cost competitive solar concentration section using low-cost material generally used by canvas buildings are placed onto of the solar tracker platform works well with our solar tracker. It helps concentrate the solar rays onto the heat piston section of the Sterling Engine. The low-cost canvas material is already approved by structural engineers for buildings with the canvas like material having an expected life of 30 years, In addition to the low-cost concentrator, the improved Sterling engine reduces the mechanical issues related to pistons and its applications. In the heat displacer and piston, a rectangular extension with the four walls comprises rollers to avoid the need for precision and avoid friction when the parts are moving. The cost reduction related to robust simplicity also reduces long term maintenance issues related to traditional piston technology. Traditional Sterling engine pistons have a high service cost related to the harsh conditions the piston rings must endure. There is high temperature and high sliding velocities which can cause excessive wear and tear. As a result, short replacement intervals of piston rings and sometimes cylinders may be needed to maintain high efficiency. The innovation is a low-cost method to increase the replacement interval and reduce the service cost. The rectangular extension supports the piston during its mechanical process involving high temperatures, high sliding velocities and the non-lubricated operation related to the pistons. The addition to the reinforcement rectangular extension method also reduces unwanted spikes in temperature and friction which causes an acceleration of piston related wear and tear. The several new technologies are important additions and applications of its patent pending solar tracker. A video on the home page of www.massmegawatts.com summarizes the patent pending solar tracker. The company’s Solar Tracking System (STS) is a new patent pending product that significantly reduces the payback period for solar power investments. It is designed to automatically adjust the position of solar panels to directly face the sun as it travels from East to West throughout the day. Unlike other solar tracking technologies, the Mass Megawatts Solar Tracker utilizes a low-cost framework that adds stability to the overall system, while improving energy production levels.

(TSXV: NILI) (OTCQX: NILIF) (FSE: DJ5) (the ""Company"" or ""Surge"") is pleased to report a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) on its Nevada North Lithium Project (NNLP). The MRE, which has an effective date of February 16, 2024, was prepared by Dr. Bruce Davis, FAusIMM and includes a pit-constrained Inferred Mineral Resource of 4.67 Mt of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) grading 2,839 ppm Li at a 1,250 ppm Li cutoff.HighlightsHighest Grade Lithium Clay Resource in the USA with 4.7Mt LCE grading 2,839 ppm Li at a 1,250ppm cutoff.MRE includes over 4Mt of LCE grading 3,167 Li PPM at a 2,000 ppm Li cutoff.Significant Expansion Potential: The MRE only covers a portion of the known footprint of mineralization with substantial potential for growth.Mr. Greg Reimer, Chief Executive Officer and Director, commented, ""We are thrilled with today's maiden MRE results as they solidify that the NNLP is a significant lithium deposit and one of the highest-grade lithium clay deposits worldwide. At higher grade cutoffs, there are still very appreciable volumes of lithium that are largely contained in the clay horizons nearest surface. We will continue to derisk the NNLP through metallurgical test work, technical studies and permitting. As well, we expect to continue to expand our known resource and certainty around it through drilling.""The lithium mineral resources at the NNLP are hosted by multiple shallowly dipping and laterally extensive clay beds, separated by tuff units. The primary horizon (""Cu3"") contains the highest grades and is typically the first horizon intersected in drilling. Clay units primarily consist of massive green and dark brown laminated clay with white carbonate clots and euhedral calcite crystals. Seven lithium-rich beds have been identified to date that range in thickness from >50m to 2.5m and average around 15m thick.The MRE for the NNLP is based on twenty drill holes completed between 2022 and 2023 under a Notice of Intent (NOI) permit for a total of 2,758m and 1,973 samples. Eight of the twenty drill holes were reverse circulation (RC), five were sonic, and seven were diamond core. The 3D geological model used to inform the block model was developed in Leapfrog™ by SideQuest Geological Modelling. Many of the metrics used to derive a 1,250 ppm Li base cut-off grade were obtained in part from review of available information for deposits similar to that at the NNLP. It is expected that items such as recovery, bulk density and operating cost will change in the future with additional test work and engineering studies. The metrics used to derive a 1,250 ppm Li base case cut-off grade and define the resource pit shell include:Operating Cost per Resource Tonne: US$88.50LCE Price: US$20,000/t LCERecovery: 73.5%Bulk Density: 1.79 t/m3Pit Slope: 27°Li to LCE conversion factor: 5.323The inferred lithium mineral resource estimate is shown in bold in Table 1. The table includes the tonnage sensitivities to different cutoff grades up to a maximum of 4,000 ppm Li. The inferred resource estimate includes 100% of the resources on Surge's 100% owned ground and 25% of resources within the private block of ground in which Surge owns 25% of the subsurface rights.Table 1. 2024 NNLP Inferred Resource in bold and sensitivity to different cutoff grades.

There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve.Technical Report Under NI 43-101, Section 5.3(1)(c), Surge must file a technical report regarding the MRE within forty-five (45) days of the date of this news release.Next StepsThe remainder of 2024 will be a busy year as the company prepares for a much larger and expanded drill program upon receiving its Exploration Plan of Operations Permit. In 2024, Surge plans to complete the following: Metallurgical and Flowsheet Test WorkMetallurgical test work is well underway with Kemetco. We anticipate releasing the results of this testing in Q1 of 2024. Surface Exploration ProgramsIn 2024, Surge plans to complete a detailed surface mapping program over the property and additional soil sampling. Combined, these will help identify additional areas of outcropping clay units and help to improve our geological understanding.Spring / Summer Expansion Drilling In early spring, Surge will work with the BLM to determine how much disturbance can be reclaimed under the current NOI permit to complete additional drilling in 2024. As well, Surge plans to drill on the M3 JV property. Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA)Surge expects to undertake a PEA study on the NNLP with an anticipated target reporting date in Q4 of 2024.Qualified Person as Defined Under National Instrument 43-101Alan J.

TCBP Announces MHRA Acceptance of Amendment for ACHIEVE UK Trial,2024-02-22T14:32:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"TC BioPharm (NASDAQ: TCBP) receives MHRA clearance for dosing size increase and outpatient treatment in ACHIEVE trial for TCB-008 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The amendment allows for a dose increase to 12x10^7-23x10^7 gamma delta t-cells and patients to be treated as outpatients, impacting trial timing and FDA trial plans positively.","TCBP Announces MHRA Acceptance of Amendment for ACHIEVE UK Trial Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TC BioPharm (NASDAQ: TCBP) receives MHRA clearance for dosing size increase and outpatient treatment in ACHIEVE trial for TCB-008 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The amendment allows for a dose increase to 12x10^7-23x10^7 gamma delta t-cells and patients to be treated as outpatients, impacting trial timing and FDA trial plans positively. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of the amendment by the MHRA for TC BioPharm's clinical trial is a significant development in the progression of their lead product, TCB-008. This decision will likely expedite the trial process due to the shift from inpatient to outpatient procedures, potentially improving patient enrollment rates. The increase in dosing size may enhance the therapeutic effect, although it remains critical to monitor for any emerging safety concerns despite the current lack of such issues.From a medical research perspective, the ability to administer higher doses of gamma delta T-cells could suggest a stronger immune response against Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a severe cancer with limited treatment options. This approach aligns with the increasing interest in immunotherapy as a cancer treatment, where leveraging the body's immune system has shown promise in targeting and destroying cancer cells. Healthcare Economist TC BioPharm's amendment to conduct outpatient procedures instead of inpatient ones represents a strategic shift with economic implications. By reducing the need for overnight hospital stays, the company is likely to decrease the costs associated with the trial, which can be substantial in terms of bed occupancy and resource utilization. This change is particularly relevant given the current strain on healthcare systems like the NHS, where bed availability is a critical issue.In the long term, if TCB-008 proves effective and safe, the outpatient model could set a precedent for cost-effective cancer treatment delivery. This could have a ripple effect on healthcare economics, potentially easing the financial burden on health services and improving access to innovative treatments for patients. Market Research Analyst The announcement by TC BioPharm may resonate positively within the investment community, as it reflects the company's ability to adapt and optimize clinical trial protocols. The ability to potentially accelerate the trial timeline and improve patient enrollment can be seen as a proactive measure to bring the product to market more swiftly. Moreover, aligning the dosing levels with the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the U.S. FDA trials may streamline regulatory processes, which is often a critical factor in a biotech company's valuation.Investors tend to look favorably upon companies that demonstrate operational efficiency and strategic regulatory alignment, as these factors can reduce time to market and increase the potential return on investment. The company's anticipation of using high-dose regimens across various settings suggests confidence in the scalability and versatility of TCB-008, which could be a key differentiator in a competitive oncology market. 02/22/2024 - 09:32 AM Increases dose level in line with Cohort 2 in INDChanges from ""in patient"" to ""out patient"" procedureEDINBURGH, Scotland, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- TC BioPharm (Holdings) PLC (""TC BioPharm"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: TCBP) a clinical stage biotechnology company developing platform allogeneic gamma-delta T cell therapies for cancer and other indications, today announced that the MHRA has officially accepted its proposed amendment to the Company's clinical trial authorisation (CTA). The amendment allows for an increase in dosing size of TCB008 (unmodified expanded gamma delta T cell Lymphocytes) to 12x10^7-23x10^7 gamma delta t-cells. Additionally the amendment allows for patients to be treated as ""out patients"", easing the burden on patients and lessening the burden on clinical sites as patients will not need to be monitored overnight after the first five patients are dosed. The ACHIEVE trial is a Phase 2b trial in Acute Myeloid Leukemia testing efficacy for TCBPs lead product TCB-008 (Omnimmune). Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK regulatory authority, a government agency, for medicines and medical devices. The MHRA is responsible for the regulation of medicines and medical devices and equipment used in healthcare and the investigation of harmful incidents. Bryan Kobel, Chief Executive Officer of TC BioPharm stated, ""Management is pleased to receive amendment clearance from the MHRA, this is yet another example of the team executing on plans we have laid out for the investment community. The changes to the protocol will substantially impact both the timing of data in the ACHIEVE trial as well as impacting the proposed FDA trial. Shifting to an out patient procedure means patients in the trial are not forced to spend a night in the hospital, increasing their quality of life in a difficult time, and also allows hospitals to not need to hold a bed for a patient in a time when beds are scarce in the NHS. We believe, after feedback from the clinical sites, that this was a material rate limiting concern in enrolment and are happy we can now provide them relief. Increasing the dose size, in accordance and discussion with our investigators, can increase the positive impact in patients with no safety concerns, furthering our stance that TCB-008 should be used in a myriad of settings at high doses. This step also aligns the dosing levels with the IND, where our second cohort would be receiving this dose, and gives us a window to approach the FDA with data at this level to potentially go immediately to dose level two in our US Phase 1b in relapse/refractory AML.""

Accordingly, certain disclosure in this news release or other disclosure provided by the Company has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. In Canada, an issuer is required to provide technical information with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its mineral exploration properties in accordance with Canadian requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") applicable to registration statements and reports filed by United States companies pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As such, information contained in this news release or other disclosure provided by the Company concerning descriptions of mineralization under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC and not subject to Canadian securities legislation. This news release or other disclosure provided by the Company may use the terms ""measured mineral resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" and ""inferred mineral resources"". While these terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations (under National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the SEC does not recognize them. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, ""inferred mineral resources"" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain circumstances, the basis of a ""preliminary economic assessment"" as that term is defined in National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27 A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Certain information contained in this news release, including any information relating to future financial or operating performance may be deemed ""forward-looking"".

Such factors include, without limitation: capital requirements, fluctuations in the international currency markets and in the rates of exchange of the currencies of the United States and México; price volatility in the spot and forward markets for commodities; discrepancies between actual and estimated production, between actual and estimated reserves and resources and between actual and estimated metallurgical recoveries; changes in national and local governments in any country which DynaResource currently or may in the future carry on business; taxation; controls; regulations and political or economic developments in the countries in which DynaResource does or may carry on business; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses and permits, diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; competition; loss of key employees; additional funding requirements; actual results of current exploration or reclamation activities; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; accidents; labor disputes; defective title to mineral claims or property or contests over claims to mineral properties.
