Medical Research Analyst The discovery of a unique molecular signature for seborrheic dermatitis represents a significant advancement in the field of immuno-dermatology. The identification of 1,374 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between affected individuals and healthy controls, with a notable upregulation of Th17 and Th22 pathways, suggests potential new targets for therapeutic intervention. The correlation between Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores and immune markers provides a quantifiable measure that could improve the precision of treatment efficacy evaluations. Moreover, the reported downregulation of skin barrier markers like CLDN1/8 underscores the importance of maintaining skin integrity in managing the disease. This research could pave the way for Arcutis Biotherapeutics to develop novel treatments that address the specific pathophysiology of seborrheic dermatitis, which may have been inadequately served by therapies designed for other inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Dermatology Expert Understanding the molecular underpinnings of seborrheic dermatitis opens new avenues for targeted treatments that could significantly improve patient outcomes. The emphasis on Th17 and Th22-related pathways, which differ from those commonly associated with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, highlights the unique inflammatory nature of the condition. The downregulation of tight junction proteins and lipid metabolism genes is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that therapeutic strategies might need to focus not only on controlling inflammation but also on restoring the skin barrier function. This could lead to the development of specialized topicals or systemic treatments that specifically enhance barrier integrity and correct the lipid metabolism defects associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Biotech Industry Analyst This research underpins the potential for Arcutis Biotherapeutics to carve out a niche in the competitive landscape of dermatological treatments. As seborrheic dermatitis is a common condition with limited targeted treatment options, the company's focus on this disease could lead to an increased market share and generate interest among investors. The noninvasive tape-stripping technique for transcriptome analysis could also be seen as a methodological innovation, reducing patient discomfort and potentially accelerating the clinical research process. The collaboration with renowned institutions like Mount Sinai may enhance the credibility of the findings and could facilitate future partnerships or funding opportunities. However, it's important to monitor subsequent clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, as these will be the ultimate test of the research's commercial viability. 03/09/2024 - 04:00 PM Findings show that seborrheic dermatitis is a unique inflammatory skin disease with its own molecular signatureSuggests skin barrier disruption in seborrheic dermatitis is distinct with its own disease-specific pattern SAN DIEGO, Calif., March 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARQT), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing meaningful innovations in immuno-dermatology, highlights new research that, for the first time, reveals the gene expression profile of seborrheic dermatitis. The Arcutis sponsored research from The Kimberly and Eric J. Waldman Department of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai was presented in a scientific session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting (San Diego, CA, March 8 – 12) and answers key questions on the immune response and associated skin barrier disruption of seborrheic dermatitis. “Our research group has had a longstanding interest in defining the immunological pathways that underlie many inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, shaping our understanding of these diseases and leading to new treatments,” said Emma Guttman-Yassky, MD, PhD, the Waldman Professor of Dermatology and Immunology and Health System Chair of The Department of Dermatology, and Director of the Laboratory for Inflammatory Skin Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “We are excited to have successfully employed noninvasive tape-stripping techniques developed from studying these diseases to study an understudied and undertreated inflammatory skin disease, seborrheic dermatitis. These findings will help establish the groundwork for greater understanding of this very common condition.” “The pathophysiology of seborrheic dermatitis has been poorly understood. We sought to understand the gene expression patterns in seborrheic dermatitis in order to determine if this profile is distinct from or similar to other immune-mediated skin conditions,” said Benjamin Ungar, MD, director of the Alopecia Center of Excellence and director of the Rosacea & Seborrheic Dermatitis Clinic at Mount Sinai Health System. “Our data reveal that seborrheic dermatitis has a distinct immunological molecular profile. In addition, the skin barrier disruption observed in seborrheic dermatitis has unique molecular underpinnings, primarily in the tight junction of the epithelial skin cells and lipid metabolism pathways. These findings are the first to characterize the molecular profile of seborrheic dermatitis, and they will play an important role in advancing our understanding of this common and under-treated condition.” Dr. Ungar is also an assistant professor of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The data reported at AAD are from an observational study in which tape-strips were collected from facial lesions from 27 untreated patients with seborrheic dermatitis (Investigator’s Global Assessment score mild [IGA 2, n=400], moderate [IGA 3, n=19], severe [IGA 4, n=4]) and the facial skin of 18 healthy controls and analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Tape-strips are a non-invasive alternative to biopsy for transcriptome analysis and expression profiling. These data demonstrate that seborrheic dermatitis is an immune disease with a uniquely polarized profile distinct from atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis. In addition, skin barrier disruption is suggested by a downregulation of tight junction and lipid metabolism genes. Specific findings include: 1,374 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between seborrheic dermatitis and healthy controls (674 with increased expression, 700 with decreased expression).Strong and significant upregulation of Th17-related (i.e. IL23A, PI3, LL37) and Th22-related (i.e. IL22, S100A8, S100A12) pathways were detected in seborrheic dermatitis compared with controls.Seborrheic dermatitis also showed significant Th1 activation (OASL, STAT1, CXCL9) compared with controls.There was significant downregulation of skin barrier markers (CLDN1/8, FA2H, ELOVL3) in seborrheic dermatitis compared with controls.IGA positively correlated with immune markers, including Th1/IFNG, Th17/IL17A, and Th22/IL22 [r>0.3; P<0.1 for all] and negatively correlated with skin barrier markers (SMPD4, MGLL, PLA2G15 [r≤-0.38; P<0.05]). “Despite the high prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis, there has been little dedicated clinical or basic research into the underlying cause of this chronic, inflammatory skin disease for decades. Through this collaborative research effort, we have begun to shed some light on the pathways involved in the immune response and demonstrate that seborrheic dermatitis is clearly distinct from psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, which may help explain the clinical expression of the disease, and ultimately provide important insights into its management,” said Patrick Burnett, MD, PhD, FAAD, chief medical officer, Arcutis. “We are committed to advancing the scientific understanding of this disease through additional research and collaboration with the larger dermatology research and clinical community.” Mount Sinai has received grants from Arcutis for research conducted by Dr. Ungar and Dr. Guttman. In addition, Dr. Ungar and Dr. Guttman have served as paid consultants for Arcutis.

Financial Analyst The recent share repurchase activity by Millicom (Tigo) indicates a strategic move to manage capital allocation and return value to shareholders. Share repurchases can often signal management's belief that the company's stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, earnings per share (EPS) may increase, potentially leading to a higher stock price. However, it is critical to assess this action in the context of the company's overall financial health. Investors should consider the average purchase price in relation to the current market price and historical performance, as well as the impact on the company's cash reserves.Furthermore, the execution of the buyback under the Safe Harbour Regulation ensures compliance with market abuse regulations, which is intended to prevent market manipulation. The timing and volume of repurchases can affect market perception and therefore, this information is crucial for investors monitoring the stock's liquidity and price stability. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics perspective, the repurchase of Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) by Millicom may reflect broader trends in the telecommunications sector. Share buyback programs are common in industries generating significant cash flows, as they offer a mechanism to distribute excess capital to shareholders. It is important to analyze how this repurchase compares with competitors' capital return strategies, such as dividends and other buyback programs.Investors should also consider the potential signal this sends to the market regarding Millicom's future growth prospects and investment opportunities. A buyback could suggest that the company currently sees fewer high-return investment opportunities and is choosing to allocate capital back to shareholders instead.

Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from the SPROUT study and the late-breaking Phase 3 study on Otezla's efficacy in treating palmoplantar pustulosis represent significant developments in dermatological therapeutics. The data indicating a durable response and consistent safety profile in pediatric psoriasis patients over a 52-week period is noteworthy. The achievement of primary and secondary endpoints in both studies suggests that Otezla could become a preferred treatment option for these conditions, which currently have limited oral treatments available.From a medical research perspective, the prolonged efficacy of Otezla, with over half of the pediatric patients achieving clear or almost clear skin at the one-year mark, is particularly compelling. This could signal a shift in treatment paradigms for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children. Additionally, the confirmation of Otezla's safety profile aligns with the outcomes observed in adult populations, potentially bolstering the drug's position in the market. Dermatology Expert Otezla's success in the palmoplantar pustulosis study is of high relevance to dermatology, given the chronic and difficult-to-treat nature of the condition. The significant improvements in PPPASI scores and other secondary endpoints, such as patient-reported outcomes like quality of life, highlight the potential of Otezla to address unmet needs in this patient population. The implications for daily functioning and overall quality of life cannot be overstated, as palmoplantar pustulosis can severely limit patients' activities due to pain and discomfort.Understanding the impact of skin diseases on patients' lives is crucial and the reported improvements in symptoms and quality of life metrics with Otezla treatment could mean a substantial enhancement in patient care. This is especially pertinent considering the limited effective treatments currently available for palmoplantar pustulosis. Market Research Analyst The positive outcomes from these studies could have a significant impact on Amgen's market position. Otezla's expanded indication to include pediatric patients and those with palmoplantar pustulosis could lead to an increase in market share within the psoriasis and dermatology drug markets. The long-term data supporting Otezla's efficacy and safety is likely to influence prescribing habits and could result in increased sales and revenue for Amgen.It is important to consider the competitive landscape and potential market expansion due to these findings. The ability to tap into previously underserved segments, like pediatric patients and those with specific conditions such as palmoplantar pustulosis, may offer Amgen a strategic advantage. Additionally, the timing of these results, coinciding with presentations at a major dermatology conference, could enhance visibility among healthcare professionals and investors alike, potentially affecting Amgen's stock performance in the short term. 03/09/2024 - 12:20 PM SPROUT 52-Week Data Demonstrate Durable Response and Consistent Safety Profile of Oral Otezla in Children with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Late-Breaking Phase 3 Study of Otezla in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Achieves Primary and Secondary Endpoints at 16 Weeks THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., March 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced new, 52-week results from the Phase 3 SPROUT study examining the use of Otezla® (apremilast) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These data, along with findings from a Phase 3 late-breaking study on Otezla in palmoplantar pustulosis, will be presented at the 2024 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, March 8-12 in San Diego. ""These data reflect Amgen's commitment to exploring new ways to treat inflammatory skin disease,"" said Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, vice president, Global Medical, at Amgen. ""A decade after the launch of Otezla, we continue to study how this oral therapy can help improve care and reduce disease burden in underserved patient populations."" SPROUT Phase 3 StudyResults from SPROUT, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Otezla in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis inadequately controlled by or intolerant to topical therapy. Continued Otezla use resulted in sustained improvements in psoriasis severity and skin involvement in patients for up to one year. The safety profile was consistent with previous Otezla studies. These findings add to the published 16-week results.1 ""For the first time, we have a full year of data on a potential oral treatment for children and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who currently lack any approved oral treatment options,"" said Loretta Fiorillo, M.D., FRCPC, clinical professor of pediatrics, University of Alberta. ""At 52 weeks, more than half of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin. Otezla showed increased efficacy beyond that seen at the week 16 primary endpoint, with a durable maintenance of response – an important finding for families living with this chronic inflammatory disease."" All patients in the study received Otezla for a 36-week extended active treatment period following the 16-week randomized placebo-controlled treatment period, providing up to 52 weeks of data. There were 186 patients who completed the 36-week extension: 125 who continued to receive Otezla, and 61 patients switched from placebo to Otezla. Study findings include:2 56.3% of patients who received Otezla through week 52 achieved static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) response (score of ≥3), an investigator assessment of overall disease severity of plaque psoriasis, the study's primary endpoint.52.5% of patients who switched from placebo to Otezla achieved sPGA response at week 52.71.4% of patients who received Otezla through week 52 achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75, an investigator assessment of disease severity and skin involvement, a secondary endpoint.75.4% of patients who switched from placebo to Otezla achieved PASI-75 at week 52.Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla in adults. The most common AEs (>10%) throughout the study were nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting and headache.Findings will be presented as an e-poster with an oral presentation on Saturday, March 9 at 4:50 p.m. PST. Phase 3 Late-Breaking Palmoplantar Pustulosis FindingsAmgen also will present late-breaking findings from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Otezla in patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar pustulosis in Japan following inadequate response to topical therapy. Palmoplantar pustulosis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by pustules on the palms and soles. The condition can be difficult to treat, with limited available treatment options.3,4 ""Palmoplantar pustulosis can severely impact daily functioning due to its painful effects on the hands and feet, necessitating new therapeutic options for this impactful inflammatory skin condition,"" said Melinda Gooderham, M.D., FRCPC, dermatologist and clinical investigator at SKiN Centre for Dermatology and assistant professor, Queen's University, Ontario, Canada. ""The study presented at AAD highlighted significant improvement in disease severity, symptoms such as itch, pain, discomfort, and patient-reported quality of life among those treated with Otezla compared to placebo."" The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study included 176 patients who received Otezla (n=88) or placebo (n=88) for 16 weeks. All primary and secondary endpoints were met. Study findings include:5 67.8% of patients who received Otezla achieved the primary endpoint of PPPASI 50 (>50% improvement in the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index); this was a significantly greater response as compared to placebo (35.3%; P<0.0001).Statistically significant improvements in all secondary endpoints were observed with Otezla relative to placebo, including changes from baseline to week 16 in PPPASI, PPSI (Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index), Patient Visual Analogue Scale of palmoplantar pruritus and pain/discomfort and DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index).Treatment-emergent AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla. The most common AEs (>10%) throughout the study were diarrhea, soft feces, headache and nausea.Findings will be presented as a late-breaking oral presentation on Saturday, March 9 at 9:20 a.m. PST.

PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined. Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 920,000 patients worldwide.10 Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS INDICATIONS Otezla® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease. Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindications Otezla® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulationWarnings and Precautions Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Otezla and institute appropriate therapyDiarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomitingDepression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occurPlaque Psoriasis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicidePsoriatic Arthritis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on OtezlaBehçet's Disease: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placeboWeight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of OtezlaPlaque Psoriasis: Body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of ≥10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placeboPsoriatic Arthritis: Body weight loss of 5-10% was reported in 10% (49/497) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.3% (16/495) of patients taking placeboBehçet's Disease: Body weight loss of >5% was reported in 4.9% (5/103) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.9% (4/102) of patients taking placeboDrug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong CYP450 enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommendedAdverse Reactions Plaque Psoriasis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache, including tension headache. Overall, the safety profile of Otezla in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis was consistent with the safety profile previously established in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasisPsoriatic Arthritis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, and headacheBehçet's Disease: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infectionUse in Specific Populations Otezla has not been studied in pregnant women.

About Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes excessively dry, itchy skin that can be painful. Repeated scratching can cause the skin to thicken, harden or become vulnerable to infection. Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema – affecting 1-3% of adults worldwide – and the prevalence is increasing. The disease typically manifests in childhood followed by other allergy symptoms. About rocatinlimab Rocatinlimab (AMG 451/KHK4083), an investigational product, is a potential first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody that is being studied for its ability to inhibit and reduce the number of OX40+ pathogenic T cells responsible for driving systemic and local AD inflammatory responses. It has been reported that effector T cells expressing OX40 are present in the lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis and are critical in the disease pathophysiology. The initial antibody was discovered in collaboration between Kyowa Kirin US Research and La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Amgen and Kyowa Kirin Collaboration On June 1, 2021, Kyowa Kirin and Amgen entered into an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize rocatinlimab. Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen will lead the development, manufacturing, and commercialization for KHK4083/AMG 451 for all markets globally, except Japan, where Kyowa Kirin will retain all rights. If approved, the companies will co-promote the asset in the United States and Kyowa Kirin has opt-in rights to co-promote in certain other markets including Europe and Asia.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), our acquisitions of Teneobio, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition, and any projected impacts from the Horizon acquisition on our acquisition-related expenses going forward), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

""We are proud to debut the BIMZELX® four-year psoriasis data at the world's largest dermatology meeting, showing that the majority of adult patients treated with BIMZELX achieved deep and durable clinical response through four years, with a consistent tolerability profile. These results, from the largest pool of Phase 3 data, closely follow the U.S. launch, and reinforce our belief that BIMZELX has the potential to transform the lives of people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,"" said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President, Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S., UCB. ""Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is a chronic condition with physical skin manifestations that can place a significant burden on a patient's health-related quality-of-life. Analysis shows that through four years of bimekizumab treatment, over six out of ten patients achieved and maintained complete skin clearance, a clinically meaningful endpoint and outcome for patients. These long-term data will be highly welcomed by the dermatology community since they provide important considerations for clinical practice,"" said Dr. Bruce Strober, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Yale University, and Central Connecticut Dermatology, Connecticut, U.S. The late-breaking platform presentation shared BIMZELX pooled data from treatment initiation through four years, showing that high rates of clinical and health-related quality-of-life responses were rapidly achieved and were maintained in the long-term.¹ Responder-analyses showed that approximately nine out of ten patients treated with BIMZELX who achieved ≥90 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI90) and over seven out of ten patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI100) at Week 16 maintained their responses to Year 4.² Pooled analysis from five Phase 3/3b studies showed that BIMZELX demonstrated good tolerability and a consistent safety profile with no new safety findings identified up to four years in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.³ Highlights from the four-year BIMZELX data in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis presented at the 2024 AAD: Treatment initiation through four years: Data were pooled across the 52-week BE VIVID study, the 56-week BE READY and BE SURE studies and their open-label extension (OLE Week 144) BE BRIGHT.¹ Analyzed patients were randomized to BIMZELX 320 mg every four weeks (Q4W) to Week 16, then BIMZELX Q4W or Q8W until OLE entry.¹ Clinical and health-related quality of life (PASI90 and PASI100, body surface area [BSA] ≤1 percent and Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]0/1) responses were assessed through to Year 4 (OLE Week 144).¹ Data are presented below for all patients who received BIMZELX continuously from baseline and entered the OLE (n=771):¹ 90.9 percent achieved PASI90 at Week 16, and 86.1 percent through to Year 4.1¥65.8 percent achieved PASI100 at Week 16, and 64.7 percent through to Year 4.1¥78.5 percent achieved BSA≤1 percent at Week 16, and 79.8 percent through to Year 4.1¥71.5 percent achieved DLQI0/1 at Week 16, and 78.7 percent through to Year 4.1 ¥Responder analysis to Year 4: Patients who completed the BE VIVID, BE SURE, and BE READY Phase 3 studies could enter the BE BRIGHT OLE.² Analyzed patients were randomized to BIMZELX 320 mg Q4W to Week 16, then BIMZELX Q4W or Q8W until OLE entry, then BIMZELX Q4W or Q8W dependent on PASI response/prior dose.² Maintenance of PASI90 and PASI100 was assessed in Week 16 responders to Year 4 (OLE Week 144) and is presented below for all patients:² 87.7 percent who achieved PASI90 at Week 16 (n=693) maintained their response to Year 4.2¥73.3 percent who achieved PASI100 at Week 16 (n=503) maintained their response to Year 4.2¥Safety and tolerability through four years: Data were pooled across the 52-week BE VIVID study, the 56-week BE READY and BE SURE studies, and the OLE studies BE BRIGHT and BE RADIANT.3 The total BIMZELX exposure was 6,324.3 patient-years (PY) across the studies (n=2,186).3 Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) remained consistent or decreased with longer BIMZELX exposure. Overall, TEAEs occurred at an EAIR of 170.5/100 PY and serious TEAEs at 5.5/100 PY.3The most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (12.7/100 PY), oral candidiasis (8.9/100 PY), and upper respiratory tract infections (5.7/100 PY). Oral candidiasis decreased from 18.9/100 PY at Year 1 to 5.4/100 PY at Year 4.3 Throughout, fewer TEAEs occurred with BIMZELX every 8 weeks (Q8W) (115.4/100 PY) vs. every 4 weeks (Q4W) (224.4/100 PY).3¥ Modified non-responder imputation analyses Notes to Editors:About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.4 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.4 BIMZELX is not approved in the U.S. for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis and these are investigational indications only. Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at www.UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX. BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION4 Suicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, or other mood changes. If such changes occur, advise to promptly seek medical attention, refer to a mental health professional as appropriate, and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment. InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves. TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin at baseline, periodically during treatment with BIMZELX and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis. Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors, including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs. ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX. Most Common Adverse ReactionsMost common adverse reactions (≥1 percent) are upper respiratory infections, oral candidiasis, headache, injection site reactions, tinea infections, gastroenteritis, Herpes Simplex Infections, acne, folliculitis, other Candida infections, and fatigue.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products, which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future. UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

(NYSE: MDT) presents new data at ATTD showcasing the MiniMed™ 780G system's ability to help individuals with type 1 diabetes surpass international targets on outcome measures. The data reveals that users achieved a Time in Tight Range (TITR) of over 56%, exceeding the recommended goal of 50%. The system has shown remarkable success in improving Time in Range and moving users closer to euglycemia, enhancing overall health outcomes for people with diabetes. Positive None. Negative None. Endocrinologist From an endocrinological perspective, the MiniMed™ 780G system's ability to maintain Time in Tight Range (TITR) above 56% represents a significant advancement in diabetes management. TITR is a more stringent measure than Time in Range (TIR), aiming for glucose levels between 70-140 mg/dL, which is closer to the levels observed in individuals without diabetes. This is crucial because tighter glucose control can potentially reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with type 1 diabetes, such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The data indicating that users can achieve over 80% TIR with optimal settings suggests that the MiniMed™ 780G system could provide a substantial improvement in glycemic control, which is a cornerstone in the prevention of diabetes-related complications.Furthermore, the reduced frequency of closed loop exits to less than once per week indicates a robust and reliable system that could minimize the daily burden for patients. The high satisfaction scores and quality of life benefits reported are equally important, as patient adherence to diabetes management regimens is often correlated with ease of use and perceived impact on daily living. Medical Device Analyst From a medical device market perspective, the data presented on the MiniMed™ 780G system could have a substantial impact on Medtronic's market share and competitive positioning. The ability of the device to exceed international glycemic targets and achieve high user satisfaction could drive increased adoption rates among endocrinologists and patients. In the context of the diabetes management devices market, innovation and proven efficacy are key drivers of growth.The introduction of Advanced Insulin Delivery (AID) systems that leverage powerful algorithms to optimize glycemic control represents a significant technological leap. As Medtronic continues to innovate and demonstrate clinical effectiveness, it could solidify its standing as a leader in the healthcare technology space, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock performance. The emphasis on algorithmic power as a determinant of choice for AID systems highlights the increasing importance of software in medical devices, which could shape future R&D investments and strategic partnerships within the industry. Healthcare Economist Examining the economic implications, the MiniMed™ 780G system's effectiveness in managing type 1 diabetes could lead to a reduction in healthcare costs associated with diabetes complications. By achieving greater TITR and TIR percentages, the system may contribute to lowering the incidence of acute events and long-term complications that require hospitalization and chronic care management. This could translate into cost savings for both healthcare systems and patients, while also improving health outcomes.However, the upfront costs and accessibility of such advanced systems must be considered. The economic impact will be most beneficial if the technology is widely accessible and reimbursed by insurance providers. In the long term, widespread use of highly effective AID systems like the MiniMed™ 780G could shift the economic burden from treatment to prevention, potentially leading to a more sustainable healthcare model for chronic diseases like diabetes. 03/09/2024 - 05:40 AM New data presented at ATTD demonstrates the system's ability to help individuals with type 1 diabetes exceed international targets on outcome measures DUBLIN and FLORENCE, Italy, March 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc. (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today shared a robust set of new clinical and real-world evidence on the MiniMed™ 780G system from around the world including the largest set of data from early users in the United States. The data was presented at the 17th International Conference on Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) in Florence, Italy. These results build on the 3-year data published in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics showing over 100,000 real-world users achieving a Time in Range (TIR) of 78% with the use of recommended optimal settings, outperforming international targets of 70% TIR. New data sought to evaluate the MiniMed™ 780G system's ability to help users achieve Time in Tight Range (TITR) goals, a new and emerging supplementary metric being discussed amongst experts, which more closely mirrors the glucose levels of individuals without diabetes. Also referred to as normoglycemia or euglycemia, it is defined as the percentage of time a person spends in the glucose range of 70-140 mg/dL. TITR lowers the upper threshold of Time in Range from 180 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL. Results showed users (n=13,461) achieved a TITR of greater than 56% with the use of recommended optimal settings (100 mg/dL set target with an active insulin time of 2 hours). This data adds to a growing body of evidence that a TITR goal of 50% or greater is a reasonably achievable goal with the right therapeutic option. ""Since the landmark DCCT study, numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated the association between increased Time in Range and a reduction of diabetic complications.1-12 There's no doubt elevated glucose is harmful and the average blood sugars of those living with type 1 diabetes are higher than we should accept as a clinical community,"" said Robert Vigersky, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Medtronic Diabetes. ""The preponderance of data across randomized controlled trials and real-world studies show that the MiniMed™ 780G system is maximizing Time in Range far surpassing international targets and is taking it a step beyond by getting people closer to euglycemia.13,14 In the absence of a cure, our goal is to relentlessly innovate therapies to help people maximize their health without adding burden, which our newest AID system has proven to do."" MiniMed™ 780G System Early Success in the U.S. In an oral presentation, Dr. James Thrasher, MD, Founder, Arkansas Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, shared data on early real-world users with type 1 diabetes of the MiniMed™ 780G system in the U.S. (n=7,499). Results showed users achieved over 80% TIR when employing the recommended optimal settings, exceeding international glycemic targets (ADA guidelines recommend 70% time in range between 70-180 mg/dL), with closed loop exits occurring less than once per week on average. The enhancements introduced in this latest system have resulted in high satisfaction and improved quality of life benefits.15,16 Indeed, the latest dQ&A U.S. Pump Patient Survey (n=1,997), found that among pump users, the MiniMed™ 780G system scored first in overall pump satisfaction.*,17 The survey also showed that among people with type 1 diabetes using CGM, the Guardian™ 4 sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction.*,18 ""The results demonstrate that when the MiniMed™ 780G system is optimized with recommended optimal settings, it helps people with diabetes far exceed the ADA recommended goal of 70% Time in Range,*"" said Dr. Thrasher. ""The advent of AID systems has been nothing short of transformative in the practice of endocrinology and is really pushing all of us to introduce its protective benefits on overall health as early and often as possible. This data reinforces that the determinant of choice for AID systems should be first and foremost the power of the algorithm."" About Time in Tight RangeThe development of continuous glucose monitoring enabled the development of Time in Range (TIR), a metric used today to determine whether an individual with type 1 diabetes is meeting blood sugar management goals. Since 2019, the goal of diabetes management has been to maintain the highest TIR for as long as possible while also minimizing hypoglycemia. The introduction of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has transformed diabetes care by enabling a wider range of individuals to safely achieve blood-sugar goals with less burden and effort. AID systems are helping people achieve more ambitious goals with glucose management, prompting the emergence of a new supplementary metric that mirrors blood sugar levels of individuals without diabetes (normoglycemia or euglycemia). The MiniMed™ 780G system is demonstrating that a Time in Tight Range above 50 percent is achievable and serves as a powerful tool for those seeking more time in euglycemia.
