Positive Groundbreaking results from the TELE-ACS Trial showcase SHL's SmartHeart® technology reducing hospital readmissions by 76% and ED visits by 41%. Significant decreases in unplanned revascularizations and patient-reported symptoms were observed in the study. The trial, involving 337 participants, sets a new standard in telemedicine for post-ACS patient management. Results were presented at ACC 24 and published in JACC, highlighting the impact of SHL's telemedicine solutions on global patient care. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from the Imperial College London TELE-ACS Trial represent a significant milestone in the telemedicine industry, particularly in the field of remote cardiac care. The substantial reduction in hospital readmissions and emergency department visits is a testament to the efficacy of SHL's SmartHeart® technology. From a medical research perspective, these results suggest a paradigm shift in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patient management.Traditionally, post-MI patients face a high risk of readmission, often due to inadequate follow-up care and poor management of symptoms. The integration of telemedicine, as evidenced by the trial, not only improves patient monitoring but also enhances the timeliness and personalization of care. This is expected to lead to better patient outcomes, as indicated by the reported symptom reduction. Furthermore, the decrease in unplanned coronary revascularizations highlights the potential for telemedicine to preemptively address complications, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare systems.Another aspect worth noting is the cost implications for healthcare providers. The shift from in-person to remote monitoring can result in significant cost savings by decreasing the need for hospital resources and potentially reducing the length of in-patient stays. For insurance companies and healthcare payers, these findings could influence reimbursement policies and accelerate the adoption of telemedicine services. Healthcare Economist The economic impact of the TELE-ACS Trial's results cannot be overstated. A 76% reduction in hospital readmissions and a 41% decrease in emergency department visits have profound implications for the healthcare economy. These figures suggest a substantial decrease in healthcare utilization, which translates to lower healthcare costs for both providers and patients.For hospitals, the reduction in readmissions may lead to better allocation of resources and increased availability of beds for other patients, which is important in times of high demand. However, it's important to consider that a shift towards telemedicine could also result in a reallocation of workforce and potential job restructuring within hospital settings.From a broader economic perspective, the improved management of post-MI patients through telemedicine could lead to a healthier workforce and reduced absenteeism due to health-related issues. In the long run, this could contribute to increased productivity and economic growth. The key challenge will be ensuring equitable access to telemedicine technologies to maximize these potential economic benefits across different socioeconomic groups. Market Research Analyst In light of the TELE-ACS Trial results, the market potential for SHL's SmartHeart® and similar telemedicine solutions appears robust. The reported outcomes are likely to resonate with healthcare providers and patients alike, signaling a growing market for remote cardiac care technologies. The successful trial outcomes serve as a powerful marketing tool for SHL Telemedicine, potentially increasing its market share and stock value.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of SHL's technology following these results. A surge in demand is plausible, as healthcare providers seek to replicate the trial's success. Additionally, competitors in the telemedicine space may accelerate their research and development efforts to produce comparable or superior solutions, sparking innovation and potentially leading to a more competitive market.It is also vital to consider regulatory aspects. The acceptance of telemedicine by regulatory bodies, influenced by such clinical trial outcomes, could lead to more favorable policies and increased funding for telehealth initiatives. This, in turn, could further drive the market growth and expansion of companies like SHL Telemedicine. 04/11/2024 - 02:10 AM Groundbreaking Study reveals a 76% drop in hospital readmissions and a 41% decrease in Emergency Department visits, underscoring SHL and SmartHeart®’s pivotal role in remote cardiac care TEL AVIV & ZURICH & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SHL Telemedicine Ltd.

InterContinental Hotels Group PLC Announces Transaction in Own Shares - April 11,2024-04-11T06:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"InterContinental Hotels Group PLC announces the purchase of its own shares through Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange.

The Company bought 168,020 ordinary shares at an average price of £78.8771 per share. The intention is to cancel the purchased shares, leaving the Company with 163,717,139 ordinary shares in issue.

This move follows the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting in May 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a share buyback and subsequent cancellation by a publicly traded company is a significant event, often indicating management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value and financial health. In this case, the repurchase of 168,020 ordinary shares at a price range between £78.4200 and £79.2600 per share represents a substantial investment back into the company. This action can be interpreted as a signal to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued, which could potentially lead to a positive market reaction and an increase in the stock price.From a financial perspective, the reduction in the number of shares outstanding will increase the earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This is because the same amount of profit is now divided among fewer shares. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost of the capital used for the share buyback. The company has chosen to allocate a significant amount of capital to repurchase shares rather than investing in growth opportunities or paying down debt. Investors should assess the company's long-term strategy and the potential impact of this capital allocation decision on future growth prospects. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs are often well-received by the investor community as they can be indicative of a company's robust cash position and commitment to returning value to shareholders. The timing and scale of such buybacks can also reflect the company's market outlook and its assessment of internal investment opportunities. For InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, a global hospitality company, the cancellation of shares may also be aimed at optimizing capital structure, especially in an industry that has faced significant challenges and volatility due to factors like travel restrictions and economic fluctuations.It's also worth considering the broader market implications of such a buyback. If other companies in the hospitality sector or related industries are engaging in similar activities, it might suggest a trend where these businesses are looking to enhance shareholder value in the absence of immediate expansion opportunities. This could indicate a mature industry cycle or a strategic shift towards consolidation and efficiency rather than growth through acquisition or capital expenditures. 04/11/2024 - 02:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / April 11, 2024 / The Company announces that on 10 April 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

Tritium Receives Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter,2024-04-11T07:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Tritium DCFC  (Nasdaq: DCFC) faces a challenge as it falls short of the minimum publicly held shares for Nasdaq listing. The company plans to address this issue in a scheduled hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel.,"Tritium Receives Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Tritium DCFC (Nasdaq: DCFC) faces a challenge as it falls short of the minimum publicly held shares for Nasdaq listing. The company plans to address this issue in a scheduled hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Positive None. Negative Tritium DCFC does not currently meet the minimum 1,100,000 publicly held shares required for continued listing on Nasdaq, posing a challenge for the company's stock trading status. Market Research Analyst When a company like Tritium DCFC Limited fails to meet Nasdaq's Public Float Standard, it's a signal to the market that could lead to increased volatility in the company's stock. The public float refers to the number of shares actually available for trading by the general public. A low public float can sometimes result in reduced liquidity and higher price volatility, which might deter some investors.For Tritium, this situation presents the challenge of convincing the Nasdaq Hearings Panel of their plan to increase the public float. If successful, they could stabilize their stock's presence on the exchange. However, failure to regain compliance could result in delisting, which often leads to a decrease in share price and liquidity, as the stock would then trade on a less prestigious platform. Financial Analyst Investors should be aware that a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq is a serious matter. It indicates that Tritium must act promptly to address the issue. The company's intentions to present a plan to regain compliance is a positive step, but it's the effectiveness and feasibility of this plan that will be under scrutiny.The potential impact on Tritium's financial health should be considered. Delisting can limit a company's access to capital markets, making it more challenging to raise funds through new stock offerings. This could hamper Tritium's ability to invest in research and development or expand its operations, which is particularly critical for a company in the rapidly evolving EV charging sector. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, Tritium's adherence to Nasdaq Listing Rules is not just a matter of regulatory compliance, but also a reflection of the company's governance quality. The scheduled hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel is a due process opportunity for Tritium to address the shortfall and propose a remedial course of action.However, investors should consider the legal implications of potential delisting. It could open the door to shareholder lawsuits, especially if the share price were to suffer as a result of the delisting. The company will need to manage this process transparently and effectively to maintain shareholder trust and minimize legal risks. 04/11/2024 - 03:00 AM BRISBANE, Australia, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tritium DCFC Limited (Nasdaq: DCFC) (“Tritium” or the “Company”), a global developer and manufacturer of direct current (“DC”) fast chargers for electric vehicles (“EVs”), today announced that on April 5, 2024 the Company received a notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that the Company does not currently meet the minimum 1,100,000 publicly held shares required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(B) (the “Public Float Standard”).

Retail Technology Expert The introduction of Sensormatic Solutions' cloud-based SaaS Shrink Analyzer and Store Guest Behaviors solutions represents a significant advancement in retail technology. These systems are designed to address two critical areas: loss prevention and customer experience optimization. By leveraging RFID technology and computer vision analytics (CVA), Sensormatic is offering a proactive approach to combat shrinkage—a term which refers to the loss of inventory due to factors such as theft, fraud and administrative errors.The Shrink Analyzer application is particularly noteworthy for its potential to enhance loss prevention strategies. It utilizes an advanced data engine to analyze item-level inventory, providing retailers with actionable insights into loss events. This could lead to more targeted and effective loss prevention measures, potentially reducing costs associated with shrinkage. Furthermore, the application's ability to integrate with existing retail systems and support data exports to case management systems could streamline operations and improve efficiency.On the other hand, the Store Guest Behaviors solution offers retailers a tool to understand and improve the shopper journey. By analyzing shopper behavior data, retailers can make informed decisions about store layout, inventory management and marketing strategies. The use of existing video infrastructure for data collection is a cost-effective way to implement advanced analytics, which can lead to improved sales conversions and customer satisfaction. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst From an ESG perspective, Sensormatic's focus on environmental and social governance is commendable. The mention of innovations designed to protect merchandise while aligning with ESG objectives indicates a conscious effort to integrate sustainability into loss prevention solutions. Retailers are increasingly evaluated on their ESG performance and solutions that contribute positively to these metrics can be attractive from an investment standpoint.The integration of ESG considerations into Sensormatic's offerings could potentially enhance a retailer's reputation and customer loyalty, as consumers are showing a growing preference for companies with strong sustainability credentials. However, the actual impact on a retailer's ESG performance would depend on the effectiveness of these solutions in reducing waste and improving social outcomes, such as through ethical sourcing or fair labor practices. It's also worth noting that ESG initiatives can sometimes come with higher upfront costs, although they may offer long-term savings and reputational benefits. Cybersecurity Analyst The deployment of cloud-based solutions and the use of RFID and CVA technologies raise important cybersecurity considerations. As retailers collect and analyze more detailed customer data, they must also ensure robust data protection and privacy measures are in place. The potential risk of data breaches could lead to significant financial and reputational damage for retailers.It is important for Sensormatic to demonstrate that their solutions are built with strong cybersecurity frameworks to protect sensitive customer and inventory data. Retailers adopting these technologies should assess the security features and compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR. Effective cybersecurity measures can prevent unauthorized access to data and mitigate the risk of cyber threats, which is increasingly important as retail operations become more digitized and data-driven. 04/11/2024 - 03:29 AM Sensormatic Solutions’ Cloud-Based SaaS Shrink Analyzer Application aggregates RFID technology using an advanced data engine and visualisation tool to combat Shrink and Organised Retail Crime (ORC) The brand’s latest AI-driven Store Guest Behavior solution provides retailers with analytics and visualisation tools that enable outcomes-based improvements and satisfying customer experiences SOLIHULL, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sensormatic Solutions, the leading global retail solutions portfolio of Johnson Controls, will unveil its latest innovations at the Retail Technology Show (RTS) 2024.

(TSXV: GEL) (OTCQB: GELEF) (FSE: 97G0) (""Graphano"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report initial assay results from the 2023-24 winter drilling program on Zone 3 at its 100% owned Lac Aux Bouleaux Graphite (""LAB"") Property in Québec.Zone 3, discovered by Graphano in 2022 (see news release dated February 8, 2023), represents a highly prospective mineralized trend defined by surface trenching and drilling over an approximate strike length of 500 metres. The primary focus of the drilling program was on graphite zone expansion to enlarge the ""footprint"" of mineralization in support of the Company's ongoing Mineral Resource estimation work at both the LAB and the Standard Mine projects. The mineralization remains open in both the strike and dip directions for continued expansion.Luisa Moreno, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated: ""We are pleased with the results from Zone 3, which confirm the promising findings obtained through our surface exploration efforts. The high-grade intersections and the continuity of mineralization underscore the significant potential for expansion and reinforce our confidence in the project's prospects.""Key Highlights (See Full Results in Table 1)Current HolesDrill Hole LAB23-62 intersected 6.33% graphitic carbon (Cg) over 13.82 metres (m) starting at 38.23m drilled depth; andDrill Hole LAB24-64 intersected 5.75% Cg over 14.42m at 53.58m drilled depth, including 7.64% Cg over 7.64m at 53.58m.Previous HolesDrill Hole LB22-33 intersected 6.26% graphitic carbon (Cg) over 13.7m starting at 14.0m drilled depth, including 11.95% Cg over 4.7m at 14m drilled depth;Drill Hole LB22-45 intersected 9.09% Cg over 8.0m at 68m drilled depth; andDrill Hole LB22-52 intersected 7.17% Cg over 9.0m at 36m drilled depth.(Note: All intersections reported are based on drilled width; true widths will be determined with additional drilling programs.)The five drillholes totaling 356 metres reported in this update were drilled as step-outs to extend mineralization and to confirm structural interpretations of Zone 3. Mineralization is interpreted to occur within a near surface, synformal fold structure trending to the northeast. The drilling suggests the multiple graphite horizons are locally folded and structurally thickened which can enhance the potential for economic extraction. Holes LB23-60, 61 and 63 were drilled to evaluate the northern limb of the fold structure and holes LB23-62 and 64 the southern limb. All holes intersected significant graphite mineralization. The mineralization remains open in both the strike and dip directions for continued expansion. Full assay results from the five holes are presented in Table 1 and drill hole locations in Figure 2. Further assay results are expected to be released from the LAB Zone 3 drilling in the coming weeks.Table 1 - Drill Hole Results LAB Graphite Project ZONE 3 - Exploration Drill Results Hole No. Azimuth Dip Easting Northing From (m) To (m) Thickness (m) A1 % Cg Thickness (m) A1 x %Cg LB23-60 230 -60 457682 5134000 3.00 9.99 6.99 4.98 35 including 3.00 4.90 1.90 9.34 18 and 8.31 9.99 1.68 8.12 14 LB23-61 316 -65 457729 5134074 16.23 18.48 2.25 3.31 7 and 23.36 24.98 1.62 3.79 6 and 35.55 37.36 1.81 6.05 11 LB23-62 140 -45 457760 5134119 38.23 52.05 13.82 6.33 87 including 38.23 42.59 4.36 8.57 37 and 48.57 52.05 3.48 13.07 45 LB24-63 315 -45 457753 5134125 33.16 42.00 8.84 3.67 32 including 33.16 34.51 1.35 8.45 11 and 37.52 42.00 4.48 4.56 20 LB24-64 140 -45 457766 5134175 53.58 68.00 14.42 5.75 83 including 53.58 61.22 7.64 7.64 58 and 65.93 68.00 2.07 11.40 24 91.23 94.88 3.65 5.73 21 Notes: A1 Intervals are core length.

Negative None. 04/11/2024 - 01:00 AM The Elecsys® pTau217 plasma biomarker test is being developed as part of an ongoing partnership between Roche and Eli Lilly and CompanyOnce approved, the test will aid healthcare providers in identifying amyloid pathology, a key feature of Alzheimer’s diseaseRoche and Lilly believe the test could play an important role in improving access to early and accurate Alzheimer’s diagnosis Basel, 11 April 2024 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that its Elecsys pTau217 assay received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This blood test, which is being developed in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, will be used to help identify the presence or absence of amyloid pathology in individuals, which can help ensure they are able to receive appropriate care. This may include participation in clinical trials or access to approved disease-modifying therapies. If approved, the test could help rapidly broaden access to a more timely and accurate diagnosis and potentially mitigate the impact of Alzheimer’s disease on people and society. “The incidence of dementia is growing worldwide, with 75 percent of cases remaining undiagnosed1. Consequently, there is a critical role for Diagnostics to play in addressing this global health challenge,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “We believe pTau217 is going to be crucial in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, a condition where Roche Diagnostics is committed to improving the lives of patients worldwide. We plan to leverage our installed base of diagnostic systems, which is the largest in the world, to ensure we are able to create access to this test for those who need it the most.” “The development of the Elecsys pTau217 plasma assay is another milestone in our collaboration with Roche Diagnostics that will advance the Alzheimer’s diagnostic ecosystem,” said Anne White, executive vice president of Eli Lilly and Company, and president of Lilly Neuroscience. “We’re excited to help meet the growing need for additional diagnostic tools to enable a timely and accurate diagnosis for people with Alzheimer’s disease.” pTau217, which is a phosphorylated fragment of the protein tau, is a biomarker that has shown the ability in research settings to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other neurodegenerative disorders and has shown strong performance relative to other biomarkers2. As global leaders in Alzheimer’s innovation, Roche and Lilly hope that this collaboration can bring additional speed and scale to testing and diagnosis in this important area of unmet medical need. About Elecsys pTau217Elecsys Phospho-Tau (217P) is intended to be an in-vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the quantitative determination of the protein Phospho-Tau (217P) (pTau217) in human plasma from individuals aged 60 years and older. The test is intended for use as an aid in identifying amyloid pathology, a pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease. A positive Elecsys pTau217 result indicates a high likelihood of having a positive amyloid PET/CSF result. A negative Elecsys pTau217 result indicates a high likelihood of having a negative amyloid PET/ CSF result. An indeterminate pTau217 result indicates uncertainty on the amyloid PET/CSF result. The pTau217 result should be used in the diagnostic pathway in conjunction with other clinical information. About Roche in Alzheimer’s diseaseWith more than two decades of scientific research in Alzheimer’s, Roche is working toward a day when we can detect the disease early and stop its progression to preserve what makes people who they are. Today, the company’s Alzheimer’s portfolio spans investigational medicines for different targets, types and stages of the disease. This includes trontinemab, an innovative Brainshuttle™ anti-amyloid treatment that is specifically engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier. On the diagnostics side, it also includes approved and investigational tools, including digital and blood-based tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, aiming to more effectively detect, diagnose and monitor the disease. Yet the global challenges of Alzheimer’s go well beyond the capabilities of science, and making a meaningful impact requires collaboration both within the Alzheimer’s community and outside of healthcare. We will continue to work together with numerous partners with the hope we can transform millions of lives.

Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""expect"", ""plan"", ""estimate"", ""potential"", ""will"", ""should"", ""continue"", ""may"", ""objective"" and similar expressions. Without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to: the appointment of an additional director during the forthcoming year; expectations surrounding disrupted barge logistics and the consequences in respect thereof, including in relation to the Company's ability to maintain production at about 20,000 bopd; effects of the illegal blockade removal and release of oil convoys in respect of overall safety in the Loreto area; PetroTal's recommendations and expectations surrounding furniture negotiations with AIDECOBAP and future social fund allocation decisions. In addition, statements relating to expected production, reserves, recovery, replacement, costs and valuation are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company, including, but not limited to, expectations and assumptions concerning the ability of existing infrastructure to deliver production and the anticipated capital expenditures associated therewith, the ability of government groups to effectively achieve objectives in respect of reducing social conflict and collaborating towards continued investment in the energy sector, including pursuant to Acta, reservoir characteristics, recovery factor, exploration upside, prevailing commodity prices and the actual prices received for PetroTal's products, including pursuant to hedging arrangements, the availability and performance of drilling rigs, facilities, pipelines, other oilfield services and skilled labour, royalty regimes and exchange rates, the impact of inflation on costs, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the accuracy of PetroTal's geological interpretation of its drilling and land opportunities, current legislation, receipt of required regulatory approval, the success of future drilling and development activities, the performance of new wells, future river water levels, the Company's growth strategy, general economic conditions and availability of required equipment and services. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses; and health, safety and environmental risks), commodity price volatility, price differentials and the actual prices received for products, exchange rate fluctuations, legal, political and economic instability in Peru, access to transportation routes and markets for the Company's production, changes in legislation affecting the oil and gas industry and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; changes in the financial landscape both domestically and abroad, including volatility in the stock market and financial system; and wars (including Russia's war in Ukraine). Please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's most recent AIF and MD&A which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.OIL REFERENCES: All references to ""oil"" or ""crude oil"" production, revenue or sales in this press release mean ""heavy crude oil"" as defined in NI 51-101.

The offering includes a 30-day option for additional shares. The stock will trade on NYSE under the ticker symbol 'PACS'. Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Truist Securities are lead managers. The offering is expected to close on April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of PACS Group, Inc. reflects a significant capital market event, with the company raising approximately $450 million through the sale of 21,428,572 shares at $21.00 each. This sizeable IPO, particularly being upsized, suggests robust investor interest and confidence in the company's future prospects. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could potentially raise more capital, indicating a strong backing by financial institutions. However, investors should consider the dilutive effect of this additional share option on existing share value.It's important to analyze the valuation implied by the IPO price, which can be compared to industry multiples and growth prospects. The use of proceeds is also important to understanding the company's strategy. Since PACS will not benefit from the sale of shares by selling stockholders, the focus should be on how the company plans to utilize the $450 million in fostering growth, research and development, or debt reduction.Furthermore, the involvement of high-profile underwriters and their role in the offering may lend credibility to the IPO and could potentially impact the stock's performance post-listing. Investors should monitor post-IPO price action to gauge market sentiment and the stock's near-term trajectory. Market Research Analyst The entrance of PACS Group, Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange introduces a new player into the market, which could disrupt existing industry dynamics. The pricing of the IPO at $21.00 per share provides a benchmark for the company's market valuation and sets expectations for future performance. Market participants will be keen to observe the stock's liquidity and volatility in the days following the listing.Assessing the company's competitive position within its industry, its growth strategy and the strength of its management team will be essential for investors. The fact that the IPO was upsized may indicate stronger than expected demand or confidence in the company's growth narrative. However, it is also vital to scrutinize the company's financials and risk factors disclosed in the prospectus.The performance of PACS's stock could serve as a barometer for investor appetite for new listings and may influence the IPO market's temperature for similar companies. The role of the co-managers and their influence on the distribution of shares to institutional versus retail investors could also affect the stock's stability and long-term performance. 04/10/2024 - 11:25 PM FARMINGTON, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PACS Group, Inc.

(http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX: PYR) (OTCQX: PYRGF) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company (the “Company” or “PyroGenesis”) that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes advanced plasma processes and sustainable solutions which are geared to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and address environmental pollutants, is pleased to announce its block sale of 3,779,700 shares in HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”) to P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis, for an aggregate purchase price of $661,447.50, representing a per share price of $0.175. The sale remains subject to TSX approval. The transaction was approved unanimously by the board of directors of PyroGenesis with Mr. Pascali abstaining and will close immediately following receipt of regulatory approval. “This sale will bring PyroGenesis an influx of cash on favourable terms,” said Andre Mainella, Chief Financial Officer of PyroGenesis. “It also underscores the continued support of Mr. Pascali of PyroGenesis and HPQ.” The Company and HPQ are engaged in several long-term projects together, most notably the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR) project and the PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactor (QRR) project. The FSR project, being conducted in conjunction with HPQ Silica Polvere Inc. (“HPQ Polvere”), a wholly owned subsidiary of HPQ, is an initiative to create fumed silica from quartz in a single step. The QRR project is an initiative to create high purity silicon from quartz in a single step using a plasma reactor. For both projects, PyroGenesis is the exclusive supplier of the technology. For the FSR project, the Company benefits from a royalty payment representing 10% of HPQ Polvere’s eventual sales, with set minimums. This royalty stream can, at any time, be converted by PyroGenesis into a 50% ownership in HPQ’s remaining equity stake in HPQ Polvere. Mr. Mainella added: “We are excited about what the future holds for the projects in development with HPQ. Together, we continue to develop what we believe represents ground-breaking approaches for producing in-demand materials for heavy industry.

In each instance, the historical estimate is reported using the categories of mineral resources and mineral reserves as defined by the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Reserves, and mineral reserves at that time, and these “historical estimates” are not considered by ATHA to be current. In each instance, the reliability of the historical estimate is considered reasonable, but a Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource, and ATHA is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. The historical information provides an indication of the exploration potential of the properties but may not be representative of expected results. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Angilak Deposit: This estimate is considered to be a “historical estimate” under NI 43-101 and is not considered by any of to be current. See below for further details regarding the historical mineral resource estimate for the Angilak Property. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant issues.The quality and grade of the reported inferred resource in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured resource category.Contained value metals may not add due to rounding.A 0.2% U3O8 cut-off was used.The mineral resource estimate contained in this press release is considered to be “historical estimates” as defined under NI 43-101 and is not considered to be current.The “historical estimate” is derived from a Technical Report entitled “Technical Report and Resource Update For The Angilak Property, Kivalliq Region, Nunavut, Canada”, prepared by Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P.Geol. of APEX Geosciences, Robert Sim, B.Sc., P.Geo. of SIM Geological Inc. and Bruce Davis, Ph.D., FAusIMM of BD Resource Consulting Inc., dated March 1, 2013 for ValOre Metals Corp.As disclosed in the above noted technical report, the historical estimate was prepared under the direction of Robert Sim, P.Geo, with the assistance of Dr. Bruce Davis, FAusIMM, and consists of three-dimensional block models based on geostatistical applications using commercial mine planning software. The project limits area based in the UTM coordinate system (NAD83 Zone14) using nominal block sizes measuring 5x5x5m at Lac Cinquante and 5x3x3 m (LxWxH) at J4. Grade (assay) and geological information is derived from work conducted by Kivalliq during the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 field seasons. A thorough review of all the 2013 resource information and drill data by a Qualified Person, along with the incorporation of subsequent exploration work and results, which includes some drilling around the edges of the historical resource subsequent to the publication of the 2013 technical report, would be required in order to verify the Angilak Property historical estimate as a current mineral resource.The historical mineral resource estimate was calculated in accordance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards at the time of publication and predates the current CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May, 2014) and CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines (November, 2019).A thorough review of all historical data performed by a Qualified Person, along with additional exploration work to confirm results would be required to produce a current mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Moran Lake Deposit: Jeffrey A. Morgan, P.Geo. and Gary H. Giroux, P.Eng. completed a NI 43-101 technical report titled “Form 43-101F1 Technical Report on the Central Mineral Belt (CMB) Uranium Project, Labrador, Canada, Prepared for Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp.” and dated July 31, 2008, with an updated mineral resource estimate for the Moran Lake C-Zone along with initial mineral resources for the Armstrong and Area 1 deposits. They modelled three packages in the Moran Lake Upper C-Zone (the Upper C Main, Upper C Mylonite, and Upper C West), Moran Lake Lower C-Zone, two packages in Armstrong (Armstrong Z1 and Armstrong Z3), and Trout Pond. These mineral resources are based on 3D block models with ordinary kriging used to interpolate grades into 10 m x 10 m x 4 m blocks. A cut-off grade of 0.015% U3O8 was used for all zones other than the Lower C Zone which employed a cut-off grade of 0.035%. A thorough review of all historical data performed by a Qualified Person, along with additional exploration work to confirm results, would be required to produce a current mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 standards. 3. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Anna Lake Deposit: The mineral resource estimate contained in this table is considered to be a “historical estimate” as defined under NI 43-101, and is not considered to be current and is not being treated as such. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. A qualified person would need to review and verify the scientific information and conduct an analysis and reconciliation of historical drill and geological data in order to verify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.Reported by Bayswater Uranium Corporation in a Technical Report entitled “Form 43-101 Technical Report on the Anna Lake Uranium Project, Central Mineral Belt, Labrador, Canada”, prepared by R. Dean Fraser, P.Geo. and Gary H. Giroux, P.Eng., dated September 30, 2009.A 3-dimensional geologic model of the deposit was created for the purpose of the resource estimate using the Gemcom/Surpac modeling software. A solid model was created using a minimum grade x thickness cutoff of 3 meters grading 0.03% U3O8. Intersections not meeting this cutoff were generally not incorporated into the model. The shell of this modeled zone was then used to constrain the mineralization for the purpose of the block model. Assay composites 2.5 meters in length that honoured the mineralized domains were used to interpolate grades into blocks using ordinary kriging. An average specific gravity of 2.93 was used to convert volumes to tonnes. The specific gravity data was acquired in-house and consisted of an average of seventeen samples collected from the mineralised section of the core. The resource was classified into Measured, Indicated or Inferred using semi-variogram ranges applied to search ellipses. All resources estimated at Anna Lake fall under the “Inferred” category due to the wide spaced drill density. An exploration program would need to be conducted, including twinning of historical drill holes in order to verify the Anna Lake Project estimate as a current mineral resource. Neither the TSXV nor its Market Regulator (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. None of the securities to be issued pursuant to the Scheme have been or will be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or any state securities laws, and any securities issuable in the Scheme are anticipated to be issued in reliance upon available exemptions from such registration requirements pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable exemptions under state securities laws.

The company acquired Jolly Boots and the LHD Group fire and rescue business. FY 25 revenue is expected to be between $140 million to $150 million.

Positive Fiscal 2024 net sales of $124.7 million with a gross margin of 41.1% Acquisition of Jolly Boots and the LHD Group fire and rescue business Expected FY 25 revenue range of $140 million to $150 million Strong growth in U.S. and Latin American operations Fire services business expanded by over 80% compared to last fiscal year Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net sales increase of 10.5% for Lakeland Industries in fiscal 2024 is a positive sign of the company's growth, particularly when considering the broader market context. A detailed examination of the financials reveals strategic maneuvers, such as the acquisitions of Jolly Boots and LHD Group's fire and rescue business, which are likely to bolster the company's fire services segment. This diversification could provide a hedge against market volatility in their traditional sectors.The impact of foreign exchange movements, particularly the Argentinian peso devaluation, has adversely affected operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA, indicating a vulnerability in the company's financials to currency fluctuations. Investors should take note of the company's exposure to such risks, as it could affect future profitability. The forecasted revenue range for FY25 suggests a confident outlook, potentially attracting investor interest and impacting stock valuation positively if the company continues on its growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst Lakeland Industries' focus on its fire services business aligns with the growing demand for protective clothing in emergency services. The substantial growth in this segment, including a reported 80% increase over the previous fiscal year, reflects the company's strategic positioning and the successful integration of acquisitions. These developments are likely to capture market share and could drive long-term revenue growth.However, it's important to consider the reported decrease in the Asia business, which suggests regional challenges that may require targeted strategies to mitigate. The company's ability to navigate these hurdles while capitalizing on its strengths in the U.S. and Latin American markets will be critical for sustained growth and could influence investor sentiment. Supply Chain Analyst The one-time charge for excess and obsolete inventory that Lakeland Industries took is a significant event, as it indicates a recalibration of the company's inventory management strategy. While this charge reduced the fourth-quarter gross margin, the adjusted gross margin figure provides a more normalized view of profitability. Effective inventory management is key in the protective clothing industry to avoid overstocking and maintain liquidity.Moreover, the acquisitions mentioned are likely to have supply chain implications, potentially improving lead times and distribution capabilities. The synergy from these acquisitions could streamline operations and enhance the company's competitive edge, which is critical in an industry where timely delivery can be a deciding factor for contracts. 04/10/2024 - 10:05 PM Fiscal 2024 net sales of $124.7 million and gross margin of 41.1%Fire Services further supported by announced acquisitions of Jolly Boots and the LHD Group fire and rescue business after year-end.FY 25 Revenue expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 millionHUNTSVILLE, AL / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2024 / Lakeland Industries, Inc.

Reconciliations are provided in the tables of this press release.Management Comments""Lakeland delivered solid growth in fiscal 2024 as we continued to position the Company for meaningful expansion in FY2025 and beyond. Our full-year fiscal 2024 revenue grew by $11.8 million, or 10.5%, compared to last year, despite a 44% year-over-year decrease in our Asia business and a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. We were very pleased with the growth in our U.S. and Latin American operations, which grew 13% and 49% year-over-year, respectively,"" said Jim Jenkins, Acting President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. ""Our fire services business, a key strategic growth focus for the Company, continues to expand and grew over 80% versus last fiscal year, driven by our strategic acquisitions, superior lead times and onboarding successes with new distributors. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our Eagle Technical Products business, which has grown over 103% on a pro forma basis since being acquired by Lakeland. We are equally excited about the growth potential of our recently acquired Pacific Helmet and Jolly Boots businesses and our recently announced LHD fire and rescue business. We also saw healthy demand for our higher-value, critical environment, disposables and chemical product categories in North America and LatAm, which are a strategic focus for the Company's growth opportunities. During the year, we expanded our container programs with key national customers and took steps to bolster our North American industrial sales channels to capitalize on new market opportunities.""Mr. Jenkins continued, ""Subsequent to year-end, we were pleased to announce the acquisition of Jolly Scarpe in early February and the signing of an agreement to acquire the fire and rescue business of LHD Group in early April. Jolly Scarpe manufactures and sells a premium boots product line with a global reputation for safety, design and innovation. Along with our Pacific Helmets acquisition, the Jolly acquisition completes Lakeland's ""head-to-toe"" fire product offering, strengthens our geographic diversity, and presents exciting cross-selling opportunities with global certifications across Lakeland's existing sales and distribution channels. LHD fire and rescue offerings bring Lakeland a premium product portfolio, complementary geographic footprint, and LHD Care service offerings. LHD provides access to attractive geographies while aligning remarkably well with Lakeland's portfolio of leading fire services brands. Additionally, the LHD Care service offerings provide us with attractive recurring revenue streams that Lakeland will work to leverage and expand. These acquisitions reflect our commitment to executing and accelerating the pace of our small, strategic, and quick (SSQ) M&A strategy, and we look forward to investing strategically to broaden and diversify Lakeland's range of products and end markets.""Roger Shannon, Lakeland's Chief Financial Officer, added, ""Lakeland delivered strong year-over-year sales and profitability growth. In addition to our 10.5% year-over-year growth in Revenue, we increased Operating Profit by 7.8% and grew Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX losses, by $5.0 million, or 46.5%. Net Income and Earnings Per Share increased 189% and 196%, respectively. Our laser focus on cash flow generation resulted in $3.2 million of cash flow from operations during the quarter, $2.8 million of which was driven by the accelerated reduction of raw materials and finished goods inventory. In FY24, we produced a positive operating cash flow of $10.9 million, led by decreases in inventory of $7.7 million and improved gross margins. Our positive performance further strengthens the Company's financial position, particularly our robust balance sheet and cash position, which we believe will allow us to continue pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities.""Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Financial ResultsNet sales were $31.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as compared to $29.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Sales of our fire service, high performance, wovens, chemical, and high visibility product lines increased year over year, partially offset by a decline in disposables, primarily as a result of continued weakness in Asia. Our Q4 organic revenue grew by $0.7 million year over year, while Eagle grew by $0.5 million compared to last year, and our Pacific Helmets acquisition contributed $1.1 million in sales in Q4 of FY2024. Our wovens business grew by $1.6 million, or 85%, compared to last year, driven by continued growth in our oil and gas shutdowns business, supply chain improvements, and excess inventory sales initiatives. Our fire services business grew $1.0 million, or 18% year over year, while our high performance category increased $0.5 million, or 46%. While our fire services business will continue to be lumpy due to the tender nature of large fire orders, our fourth quarter benefitted from a large Eagle delivery and the addition of Pacific Helmet sales.On a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, domestic sales were $12.7 million or 40.6% of total revenues, and international sales were $18.6 million or 59.4% of total revenues. This compares with domestic sales of $11.8 million or 40.8% of the total and international sales of $17.2 million or 59.2% of the total in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. We saw strong fourth-quarter sales growth in every region of the world except for Asia, particularly China, which remained weak.Gross profit was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, an increase of $0.3 million, or 3.2%, compared to $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as compared with 37.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Gross profit performance in the current period was negatively impacted by a one-time adjustment of $2.7 million for discontinued products and excess inventory, which reduced the gross margin percentage by 8.7%. Excluding the inventory adjustment, fourth quarter gross profit would have been 44.6%. Versus the prior year, our gross profit margin was helped by a 3.7% improvement in sales mix from higher value products and a 3.4% improvement in freight costs.Lakeland reported an operating loss of ($3.3) million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to an operating profit of $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, due to the $2.7 million one-time inventory adjustment and a $1.7 million negative impact on operating expenses of currency fluctuations, primarily the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Additionally, higher SG&A costs, including non-recurring acquisition, severance and restructuring costs, higher selling expenses from sales growth, acquired company operating expenses, and higher bonus expenses negatively affected operating profit in the fourth quarter. Operating margins were (10.6%) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to 0.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Excluding the negative impacts of the inventory adjustment, foreign exchange, severance and acquisition expenses, our operating profit would have been $2.3 million, or 7.5% for the quarter.The Company reported a net loss of ($1.0) million, or ($0.13) per basic and ($0.13) per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, last year. In addition to the factors mentioned above, net income was negatively impacted by tax expense on the sale of the Canada warehouse.Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $1.8 million, compared with $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Foreign currency exchange movements of $1.7 million negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA. Excluding foreign exchange, fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA would have been $3.4 million, or 11.0%. For the quarter, our Adjusted EBITDA benefitted from improvements in our value-added products sales mix and lower freight expense, partially offset by higher bonus expense, higher selling expenses related to sales growth and higher professional fees, in addition to the previously mentioned foreign exchange impact.The Company did not repurchase common stock under its stock repurchase program during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. At January 31, approximately $5.0 million was available to the Company for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock.On November 1, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter, which was paid on November 22, 2023, to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2023.FY 2025 Guidance and OutlookThis initial guidance is based on our current backlog of orders and current expectations. These metrics constitute forward-looking statements and are based on current expectations. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these metrics, see ""'Safe Harbor' Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995"" below.Revenue - We expect FY25 Revenue in the range of $140 million to $150 million. This Revenue expectation includes the recently announced Jolly Scarpe and Pacific Helmets acquisitions but does not include the LHD fire and rescue business, which we expect to close in late May 2024.Adjusted EBITDA - We expect FY25 Adjusted EBITDA, excluding any material negative impact from foreign exchange, to be in the range of $16.8 million to $18.5 million(1). This Adjusted EBITDA expectation includes the recently announced Jolly Scarpe and Pacific Helmets acquisitions but does not include the LHD fire and rescue business, which we expect to close in late May 2024.(1) Excluding revenue, the Company does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis as certain items that impact Adjusted EBITDA, such as equity compensation, foreign exchange gains or losses, acquisition expenses and employee separation expenses, which may be significant, are outside the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results"" and the related footnotes at the end of this press release for detailed information on calculating non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of other non-GAAP financial measures, see the non-GAAP financial reconciliation tables in this release.Mr. Jenkins added, ""We are pleased with the progress of our acquisition strategy and how it positions us for growth in revenue and profitability. Fiscal 2024 brought significant and necessary changes to Lakeland. We enter Fiscal 2025 with momentum and high expectations. During the past year, we made important strategic investments in the fire services category of our business as well as in leadership that we expect to help advance Lakeland and our longer-term strategy. We anticipate the traction we are garnering with those investments will continue.""""Fiscal 2025 will be a year of emphasis on improving operational excellence and initiatives we believe will improve customer experiences, expand organic growth potential, and strengthen our acquisition integration process, allowing us to capitalize on acquired synergies faster. We continually assess opportunities that can either enhance our capabilities and expertise, expand our global presence, or be 'bolt-ons' that can leverage our current infrastructure,"" concluded Mr. Jenkins.Financial Results Conference CallThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Thursday, April 11, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern to discuss its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full-year financial results.

Management excludes from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA all expenses for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Other Income, which is comprised of interest income and gains (losses) from equity method investments. For Adjusted EBITDA management also excludes equity compensation, acquisition-related expenses, excess and obsolete inventory adjustments, severance costs, and start-up costs for our Mexican operations. This press release also discusses (i) Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by GAAP net sales; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA excluding FX, which is calculated by subtracting foreign currency losses from Adjusted EBITDA; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA excluding FX margin, which is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA excluding FX by GAAP net sales; (iv) operating income excluding one-time adjustments, which is calculated by subtracting excess and obsolete inventory adjustments, foreign exchange losses, acquisition expenses and severance expenses from operating income; and (v) gross margin excluding inventory adjustments, which is calculated by subtracting excess and obsolete inventory adjustments from gross margin.Management excludes these items principally because such charges or benefits are not directly related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, in the case of the inventory adjustments, because of the unusual, one-time nature of the adjustments, and in the case of foreign currency adjustment, because of the unusual nature of the material devaluation of the Argentinian peso. We use such non-GAAP measures in order to (1) make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operations, both internally and externally, (2) guide management in assessing the performance of the business, internally allocating resources and making decisions in furtherance of the Company's strategic plan, and (3) provide investors with a better understanding of how management plans and measures the business. The material limitations to management's approach include the fact that the charges, benefits and expenses excluded are nonetheless charges, benefits and expenses required to be recognized under GAAP and, in some cases, consume cash, which reduces the Company's liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations primarily by reviewing GAAP results to obtain a complete picture of the Company's performance and by including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results in its earnings releases. Non-GAAP financial measures are not alternatives for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Additional information regarding the adjustments is provided below.(1) Adjustments for Taxes, which consist of the tax effects of the various adjustments that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures, and adjustments related to deferred tax and discrete tax items. Including these adjustments permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors.(2) Adjustments for Equity Compensation, which consist of non-cash expenses for the grant of equity awards.(3) Adjustments for Other Income, which consists of interest income and gains/(losses) from Investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(4) Adjustments for acquisition-related expenses included advisory fees, due diligence expenses and legal fees related to the Company's acquisition of Eagle Technical Products Limited.(5) Adjustment for the reduction of the estimated earnout payment related to the Eagle acquisition. An increase to the accrued earnout payment of $0.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2024 and reflected in operating expenses. For fiscal year 2024, the reduction to the accrued earnout payment was $2.5 million and reflected in operating expenses.(6) Adjustment for accrued separation costs for our former CEO who retired from the Company on January 31, 2024. Severance costs for the full year included our former COO who separated from the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, our EVP of Sales and other management in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, and other management in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.(7) Adjustments for costs for our Mexican operations consists of external services and legal fees associated with the Monterrey, Mexico facility.(8) Adjustments for acquisition-related expenses included advisory fees, due diligence expenses and legal fees related to the Company's acquisition of Pacific Helmets in the first six months of fiscal year 2024.(9) Adjustments for acquisition restructuring costs consisted of cash severance payments to approximately 100 workers at our Weifang manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.(10) Adjustments for right-sizing our inventory of obsolete products.SOURCE: Lakeland Industries, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What were Lakeland Industries, Inc.'s fiscal 2024 net sales?

The company had a negative gross margin due to a one-time inventory write-down, resulting in a net loss of $4.0 million for Q4 and $9.9 million for the year. Positive None. Negative Revenue decreased by 28.9% in Q4 and 13.6% for the year Negative gross margin due to a one-time inventory write-down Net loss of $4.0 million for Q4 and $9.9 million for the year Financial Analyst Examining Kidpik Corp.'s financial results, the reported year-over-year decrease in revenue and a significant net loss are indicators of the company's struggle in the current fiscal year. The substantial inventory write-down suggests an overestimation of inventory value or a shift in market demand, leading to excess stock that could not be sold at anticipated prices. The negative gross margin reflects the impact of this write-down and is a concern for the company's profitability.However, the increase in the average shipment keep rate could be a silver lining, indicating that customers are finding the products satisfactory enough to retain them, which could be a positive sign for future sales strategies and customer retention efforts. Nevertheless, the overall financial health of the company seems challenged, which could affect investor confidence and the stock price in the short term. Market Research Analyst The e-commerce apparel market is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. Kidpik Corp.'s decision to reduce inventory levels and halt new inventory purchases could be a strategic move to realign their product offerings with current market trends. This approach may help mitigate further losses, but it also raises questions about the company's long-term growth strategy and ability to adapt to market dynamics.Furthermore, the merger with Nina Footwear could potentially open new avenues for cross-brand synergies and customer base expansion. The success of this merger will depend on the integration of the two companies' operations and whether it can result in cost savings or revenue growth. Investors should monitor the post-merger performance closely to assess the long-term viability of this strategic decision. Economist From an economic perspective, Kidpik Corp.'s financial performance might be symptomatic of broader economic trends such as consumer spending shifts or supply chain disruptions. The decrease in shipped items and the need for inventory write-downs could reflect a downturn in discretionary spending, which is often affected by macroeconomic factors like employment rates and consumer confidence.Additionally, the reported net loss and negative adjusted EBITDA highlight the importance of operational efficiency and cost management in maintaining financial stability. As the company enters into a merger, the economic environment will play a important role in determining the success of the combined entity. The ability to leverage economies of scale and improve financial performance will be critical in a potentially tightening economic climate. 04/10/2024 - 06:42 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kidpik Corp.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that this supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between companies. This non-GAAP financial measure may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain non-routine items that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measure, please see the section titled “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)”, included at the end of this release.

The offering includes ordinary warrants with an exercise price of $1.50 per share, exercisable immediately and expiring in 5 years.","NeuroSense Announces Pricing of $4.5 Million Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent Private Placement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary NeuroSense Therapeutics (NRSN) announced a securities purchase agreement with a health-care focused institutional investor for the sale of 2,980,000 shares and warrants at $1.50 per share. The offering includes ordinary warrants with an exercise price of $1.50 per share, exercisable immediately and expiring in 5 years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent transaction involving NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd. indicates a strategic capital raise through a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement. The sale of nearly 3 million ordinary shares at a fixed price of $1.50 per share, along with warrants, suggests an immediate influx of capital. This is noteworthy for investors as it could imply a dilution of existing shares, but also provides the company with funds likely aimed at furthering their research and development efforts.From a financial perspective, the key factors to consider are the offering's price relative to current market value, the potential dilutive effect on existing shareholders and the implications for the company's cash runway. The exercise price of the warrants being equal to the offering price indicates a neutral stance on future price expectations and the five-year expiry on these warrants provides long-term potential for investors to capitalize on company growth. Medical Research Analyst NeuroSense Therapeutics is engaged in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, a field that has significant unmet medical needs and thus presents substantial market opportunities. The funding acquired through this offering could accelerate the company's ongoing clinical programs or support new ones. The investor's focus on healthcare suggests a vote of confidence in NeuroSense's potential to deliver on its pipeline.For stakeholders, the progress in clinical trials and successful development of treatments could lead to significant long-term value creation. However, it's important to monitor the company's burn rate and the milestones they aim to achieve with this capital raise. The nature of drug development is inherently risky and thus the actual impact on the company's financial health will be closely tied to the clinical and regulatory outcomes of their therapies. Market Research Analyst In the biotechnology industry, funding rounds are a critical component of a company's lifecycle, often reflecting both current health and future prospects. The offering's timing and structure may indicate NeuroSense's strategic positioning within the market. The investment by a healthcare-focused institutional investor can be seen as a positive signal to the market, potentially attracting additional interest in the company's stock.It is also important to consider the broader market trends in biotech financing and how NeuroSense's offering fits within this context. If the offering is completed under favorable terms relative to industry standards, it could suggest investor confidence in the company's value proposition. Conversely, terms that are less favorable could indicate a need for capital that outweighs the cost of potential share dilution. 04/10/2024 - 07:16 PM CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd.

Market Research Analyst The recent strategic moves by Five Star Bancorp, including the hiring of Casey Grafeld and the expansion in the San Francisco Bay Area, signal a proactive approach to filling the void created by the collapse of notable banks in the region. This indicates a competitive positioning strategy that could potentially increase market share and customer trust in a shaken market. The emphasis on personalized, concierge banking services might attract clients looking for a more tailored banking experience, which could translate to higher customer retention and acquisition rates.Furthermore, the company's successful closing of additional shares suggests investor confidence in its growth strategy. The capital raised, earmarked for general corporate purposes and growth support, should provide the necessary financial flexibility to execute on expansion plans. However, it's important to monitor how effectively the new capital is deployed and whether it yields a satisfactory ROI, considering the competitive landscape. Financial Analyst The public offering of Five Star Bancorp's common stock at $21.75 per share, with proceeds of approximately $81.5 million, is a significant liquidity event for the company. This capital injection enhances the company's balance sheet resilience and provides funds for aggressive expansion maneuvers. However, investors should assess the dilutive impact of the additional shares on earnings per share and whether the expected growth justifies this dilution.It's also noteworthy that the offering was conducted with reputable financial institutions acting as bookrunner and co-managers, which could be seen as a stamp of approval for the offering's structure and pricing. Nonetheless, the true test will be the company's ability to leverage these funds to generate sustainable growth in a competitive banking landscape. Commercial Banking Expert The appointment of Casey Grafeld, with his extensive experience in relationship management and business development, is likely to enhance Five Star Bank's client service capabilities. His local ties to Marin County and previous roles at major banks could be pivotal in expanding the customer base and fostering community relationships. This local expertise could be a differentiating factor in a market that has experienced turmoil due to bank failures.However, the success of such an expansion strategy hinges on the bank's ability to provide a superior customer experience and innovative banking solutions that resonate with the needs of the Bay Area's unique demographic. The bank's performance metrics, such as customer growth rate and satisfaction scores, will be key indicators to watch in the coming quarters. 04/10/2024 - 06:30 PM RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Star Bancorp (Nasdaq: FSBC) (“Five Star” or the “Company”), a holding company that operates through its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Five Star Bank (the “Bank”), announced today the addition of Casey Grafeld, Senior Vice President / Managing Director, to Five Star Bank. Grafeld will help advance Five Star Bank’s expansion strategy in the San Francisco Bay Area with personalized, concierge commercial banking service in Marin County. “Casey Grafeld is an excellent addition to Five Star Bank’s San Francisco Bay Area team of highly experienced commercial banking professionals. He brings a great depth of knowledge and experience from over 30 years in banking and he has a stellar track record of client service and success. Adding Casey to our team exemplifies our commitment to expansion and client service in the San Francisco Bay Area,” said Five Star Bank San Francisco Bay Area Region President, DJ Kurtze. “I joined Five Star Bank because of its emphasis on high-touch, personalized, concierge banking, the caliber of its people, its ability to deliver on promises to its customers, and its commitment to investment, expansion and success in the San Francisco Bay Area. I see myself as an advisor who puts my clients’ interests first, and Five Star Bank as a great example of an organization with excellent client service. I also am delighted to extend Five Star Bank’s Bay Area presence and personalized commercial banking services to Marin County, where I’ve lived for 25 years,” said Grafeld. In his 30-year banking career, Grafeld held roles in relationship management, business development and senior management at banks including Wachovia Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Signature Bank and Flagstar Bank. He also recently served as finance chair on the board of directors of the Marin AIDS Project. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business economics with an emphasis in accounting from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The addition of Grafeld to Five Star Bank’s San Francisco Bay Area team of highly experienced commercial banking professionals is the latest in a series of the Company’s investments in the Bay Area this year. The investments exemplify Five Star’s commitment to fill a gap in high-tech, personalized concierge banking left by the Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank failures, and its belief in a strong Bay Area recovery and economy. Five Star Bank’s recent investments in the San Francisco Bay Area include the addition in February of five Bay Area commercial banking professionals and the signing of a 10-year lease for a full-service office at 345 California Street in San Francisco, scheduled to open in the third quarter this year.

ASHFORD HOSPITALITY TRUST ANNOUNCES PROGRESS IN PLAN TO PAY OFF STRATEGIC FINANCING WITH CLOSING OF SALE OF THE HILTON BOSTON BACK BAY,2024-04-10T22:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.

(NYSE: AHT) has successfully closed the sale of the Hilton Boston Back Bay for $171 million, utilizing the proceeds for debt reduction. The Company paid down approximately $68 million of its strategic financing, leaving a remaining balance of $112 million. Ashford Trust plans to continue making regular paydowns with proceeds from asset sales, aiming to reduce debt further. The Company remains optimistic about its ongoing asset sales and looks forward to providing more updates. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The divestiture of the Hilton Boston Back Bay by Ashford Hospitality Trust represents a significant transaction within the hotel real estate sector. The sale price of $171 million, or $438,000 per key, is indicative of the asset's high valuation within a prime urban market. This transaction is reflective of the current trends where strategic asset sales are utilized to improve balance sheets, particularly in reducing leverage.From a real estate investment perspective, the deployment of sale proceeds to pay down debt is a prudent move, especially considering the company's strategic financing obligations. The reduction of the strategic financing balance to $112 million is a substantial deleveraging step. This move aligns with conservative financial management practices that are favored by investors, as it may lead to improved credit ratings and reduced interest expense, potentially increasing the REIT's financial flexibility.Furthermore, the announcement that the company plans to continue this strategy by using proceeds from the sale of non-traded preferred stock and other asset sales to make regular paydowns is an important signal to the market. It suggests a disciplined approach to capital management and a commitment to strengthening the company's financial position over time. Hospitality Industry Analyst The sale of a high-profile property such as the Hilton Boston Back Bay is not only a significant financial event but also a marker of industry health and investor sentiment. The per-key price achieved is a benchmark for the market, which other players in the hospitality industry will watch closely. It serves as a barometer for the valuation of similar upscale, full-service hotels in urban centers.Moreover, the strategic move by Ashford Hospitality Trust to reduce debt and streamline its portfolio is in line with broader industry trends. As travel and hospitality recover from the impacts of global disruptions, such as the pandemic, there is a renewed focus on financial resilience and asset performance. Investors and stakeholders can interpret the successful sale at an attractive value as a positive indicator of recovery and a testament to the underlying value of well-located hospitality assets.The mention of ongoing sales processes for several assets suggests that the company is in an active portfolio optimization phase, which could lead to further reshaping of its holdings and impact the market dynamics for hotel properties. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transaction has immediate implications for Ashford Hospitality Trust's liquidity and debt profile. The use of sale proceeds for debt reduction is a strategic move that can enhance shareholder value by improving the company's balance sheet and reducing financial risk. The mention of non-traded preferred stock as a source of funds for future debt paydowns also highlights the company's commitment to diversifying its capital structure and accessing alternative financing sources.Investors will likely view the reduction in leverage positively, as it can lead to a lower cost of capital and potentially higher distributions in the future. Additionally, the company's proactive approach to debt management may be seen as a defensive strategy against potential market volatility or economic downturns, which can be particularly impactful in the hospitality sector.Overall, the sale of the Hilton Boston Back Bay and subsequent debt reduction measures can be seen as a strategic maneuver to position Ashford Hospitality Trust for sustainable growth and resilience in the face of an evolving market landscape. 04/10/2024 - 06:05 PM DALLAS, April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.

Compared with traditional rendering methods, IRX rendering acceleration technology not only enhances the experience with 120fps high-resolution graphics, but also effectively controls system power consumption. Players can define their experiences through the game's user interfaces. As an additional benefit of IRX rendering acceleration technology, developers are able to flexibly allocate rendering resources based on the game content to faithfully present the game's artistic intentions on mobile platforms. ""As the first official mobile game of the globally popular Diablo IP, Diablo Immortal must meet the expectations of many familiar players,"" said Jiaheng Wang, Technical Director of NetEase's Diablo Immortal. ""For the mobile platform, together with Blizzard Entertainment, we have created new storylines and gameplay. We hope that the mobile game can both inherit the visual attributes of the PC version, while breaking the performance limitations of smartphones, allowing mobile game players to immerse in a perfectly smooth, PC-like gaming experience.

(TSXV: ZDC) (the ""Company"") today announced its financial and operating results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.Q4 2023 revenues were $5.8 million and the Company generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million. The Company's two large pipeline security projects concluded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the Company was able to diversify its customer base as a result by adding over 190 customers. Furthermore, the Company's revenue base is now largely diversified across customers and geographies. Subsequent to the end of the year, utilization rates have reached 90% and daily revenues are at comparable levels to when the two pipelines projects were active. March 2024 was one of Zedcor's most active months ever and the Company expects to achieve record monthly revenue from its MobileyeZTM security tower fleet.During the quarter, the Company had approximately 40% of its MobileyeZ security tower fleet in Ontario. In addition, the Company exited 2023 with 50 towers at its Houston equipment and service center which has subsequently increased to 72. These security towers have reached 100% utilization and the Company is starting to build a backlog of demand at its Houston service center. The fleet is fully deployed across a number of different customers, including the largest home builder in the US, general contractors in Texas and two Canadian customers who have USA based operations.US Operations and Manufacturing Update:Zedcor's MobileyeZTM manufacturing operations are starting to ramp up. We are on track to complete 20 Solar Electric MobileyeZTM security towers in April and intend to streamline our manufacturing in order to build 50 or more security towers a month starting in Q3 2024. The Company anticipates bringing the total US fleet to 400 or more security towers by the end of 2024.Zedcor's Solar Electric MobileyeZTM will be a fully standalone security tower with battery backup. It can also be plugged in to power in winter months if there is not enough sunlight. This is an innovative security tower and first of its kind in the North American market with dual power capabilities, allowing it to function in any environment across the USA and Canada. It is also zero emissions, helping customers reduce their carbon footprint and meet environmental targets.Todd Ziniuk said: ""As the number of deployments of our MobileyeZTM continue to increase in the US, our team continually demonstrates our innovativeness. We have upgraded all of our cameras across the fleet to have AI at the edge. We have also started offering MobileyeZTM with radar units. This improves our service levels and increases our already industry leading theft diversion. The disruptive nature of our security towers, combined with 24/7 Live, Verified MonitoringTM, is having an impact on the traditional security industry as evidenced by the demand we are seeing and the backlog that we are starting to build in the US. The Company is excited about its prospects in the US market and has seen unprecedented demand for its MobileyeZTM security towers. With its manufacturing operations ramping up, the Company has control to meet the demands of the US market. We are also extremely pleased to increase our presence in retail security. This is an industry where traditional security measures are either ineffective or prohibitively expensive and the sector is ripe for disruption. We are excited to work with top names in the retail sector and we look forward to demonstrating our service first approach in order to grow the relationship.""FINANCIAL & OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE & TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023:Three months ended December 31Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s, except per share amounts)2023202220232022 Revenue5,7996,41524,88922,099EBITDA1,21,2152,3129,2448,253Adjusted EBITDA1,21,4012,3807,6457,569Adjusted EBIT1,2(391)1,3912,1144,173Net income (loss) before income taxes(860)1,0712,6523,993Net income (loss) per share Basic(0.00)0.050.040.09 Diluted(0.01)0.040.030.08 1 Adjusted for stock based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, and other income2 See Financial Measures Reconciliations below Zedcor recorded $5,799 and $24,889 of revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This compares to $6,415 and $22,099 of revenue from for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The revenue growth of 13% for the year is the result of a larger fleet of security towers located throughout the Company's six service centers in Canada. Revenue for the year grew despite pipeline construction projects for the Company's two largest customers winding down throughout 2023. A number of the security towers which were returned had been continually providing reliable security services to two different customers since 2017 without being returned to the Company for service. Once returned, Zedcor was able to repair and upgrade the returned towers, which drove costs higher in the second half of the year, while also diversifying and growing its customer base both geographically and across different industries. Adjusted EBITDA was to $1,401 and $7,645 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2,380 and $7,569 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. This represented a growth of 1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.The Company's security and surveillance services saw increased revenues and EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due largely to increased customer demand of its larger fleet of MobileyeZ security towers. The increased revenue was offset by: 1) reduced security guard revenue; and 2) reduced revenue from a two large pipeline construction projects that were completed in the second half of 2023. In addition, in Q4 2023, the Company's revenue at its two Alberta, Canada equipment centers saw reduced revenues due to inclement weather which delayed the start of construction projects for some of the Company's customers. A majority of the security towers returned from the pipeline construction project have been rented to new or existing customers across Canada and, therefore, reduced the Company's customer and industry concentration risks. Utilization for the Company's fleet of security towers averaged 82% in Q4 2023, which is a low point for the Company. Subsequent to the end of the year, utilization rebounded and was over 90% for the Company's fleet of Electric MobileyeZTM. The Company's US based operations also ramped up subsequent to the end of the year which reduced the negative impact on adjusted EBITDA. Zedcor exited the period with 825 MobileyeZTM security towers which was an increase of 319 when compared to December 31, 2022. Of the 825 units, 50 are located in Zedcor's Houston, Texas service center.Financial and operational highlights for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 include: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 net income before tax was $2,652 compared to net income before tax of $3,993 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income year over year is directly attributable to: 1) two of the Company's largest customers wrapping up pipeline construction projects during the second half of the year and 2) USA expansion costs, which totaled $721, negatively impacted net income before tax. Of the $721 in USA expansion costs, approximately 70% are one time costs related to expansion, setup of manufacturing operations and legal fees. Zedcor still remained profitable during 2023 due to: 1) a larger fleet of towers and strong customer demand which drove utilization and, in turn, revenues; and 2) $2,159 in other income. As part of the sale of the Company's Rental segment assets in 2021, the Company is to receive a 35% bonus for every dollar of EBITDA over certain thresholds. As a result of this agreement, the Company received $2,159 for the second anniversary payment.Continued traction across Ontario. The Company expanded to Ottawa in Q2 2022 and Toronto in Q3 2022. As at December 31, 2023, approximately 40% of the Company's MobileyeZ security tower fleet is located in Ontario. This represents a growth of 28% from the start of the year. The Company's intentions to diversify its geographical footprint and grow its customer base is yielding results. We are continuity to see strong demand for the Company's services in Eastern Canada and additional security towers will continue to be delivered to Ontario and Manitoba in 2024. Diversification away from the Company's core pipeline construction customers. As the Company increases its fleet of MobileyeZ and expands geographically, our risk related to customer concentration has decreased. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, 12% of the Company's revenues were generated from its top 3 customers, down from 69% over the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. While the revenue from the top three customers decreased by 57%, security tower revenue decreased by only 3% for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Zedcor's services are customer and industry agonistic and we continued to see that in 2023 as we were able to diversify our customers across the construction industry and into retail security.Expansion into retail security with a leading North American home improvement retailer. After a three-month pilot program which began in June 2023, with locations tested in British Colombia, Southern Alberta, and Southern Ontario, Zedcor entered into a master rental services agreement with to provide MobileyeZTM security towers with 24/7 Live, Verified Video MonitoringTM at numerous locations across Canada until September 2026. The number of locations that we are servicing has expanded subsequent to December 31, 2023. Award of Ontario O-Train construction mobile security project. Sites being secured include equipment storage yards, light maintenance and storage facilities and five LRT stations under construction on the O-Train West Extension. As at December 31, 2023 the Company has 24 MobileyeZTM security towers deployed with anticipated peak demand for this project which is expected to be completed in late 2026.The Company continued to attract new customers across Canada. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, the Company provided services to more than 50 new customers. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Company has added over 190 new customers.On track US expansion. In Q3 2023 the Company leased a facility and hired its first employee in the US. In addition, the Company has shipped a small number of security towers for research & development purposes to help ensure supply targets are met for its 2024 expansion program. Zedcor exited the year with 50 MobileyeZTM, obtained its Texas security license, continued positive business development with both existing Canadian customers with operations in the US and potential US based customers, hired sales people for the Houston market and generated its first US revenue in Q4 2023. The Company continued to manage its supply chain and logistics. Orders were proactively placed for light tower materials, cameras and communication equipment for the Company's 2024 capital program. Zedcor also started manufacturing operations out of its Houston facility in order to resolve bottle necks related to light tower assembly. By addressing this bottleneck, the Company can ramp up production to meet anticipated customer demand for the expansive US market. This will also allow the Company to control its capital costs, while designing innovative solutions in order to proactively meet customer needs. Additional security products will be constructed based on customer demand, expansion plans into other strategic markets in Canada and the USA, and availability of capital.SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION(Unaudited - in $000s)Dec312023Sept302023June302023Mar312023Dec312022Sept302022Jun302022Mar312022 Revenue 5,7996,4316,2166,4436,4155,7975,2564,631Net income (loss) (860)2882,4727523,0769661,528428Adjusted EBITDA¹1,4012,2851,8242,1352,3802,1211,6941,373Adjusted EBITDA per share - basic¹0.020.030.020.030.040.030.020.02Net income (loss) per share Basic(0.00)0.000.030.010.050.010.020.01 Diluted(0.01)0.000.030.010.040.010.020.01Adjusted free cash flow¹4824,6649689781,9312,076(292)1,216 1 See Financial Measures Reconciliations below LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following table shows a summary of the Company's cash flows by source or (use) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s)20232022$ Change% Change Cash flow from operating activities9,8866,1903,69660%Cash flow used in investing activities(13,451)(8,607)(4,844)56%Cash flow from financing activities4,4682,8801,58855% The following table presents a summary of working capital information:Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s)20232022$ Change% Change Current assets7,2867,542(256)(3%)Current liabilities *9,4517,3791,07215%Working capital(2,165)163(2,328)(1,428%) *Includes $3.8 million of debt and $2.4 million of lease liabilities in 2023 and $2.2 million of debt and $1.8 million of lease liabilities in 2022 The primary uses of funds are operating expenses, maintenance and growth capital spending, interest and principal payments on debt facilities.

The Company has reviewed its outstanding accounts receivable as at December 31, 2023 and believes the expected loss provision is sufficient.OUTLOOK Zedcor continues to execute its long-term strategy of growing its technology enabled security services across North America. Zedcor continues to effectively use a mix of cash flow and debt to build additional MobileyeZ security towers to provide surveillance services to our expanding customer base. While there was a decrease in utilization in Q4 2023, this was temporary and revenue and utilization levels have increased in Q1 2024. As the Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline project came to an end in Q4 2023, the Company was able to effectively redeploy equipment to other customers throughout the Company's operating regions. The Company has grown its salesforce across Canada in order to obtain contracts for its MobileyeZ and continue to expand its service offering to different industries. The Company also expanded its service offering to Houston, Texas in Q4 2023 and is excited about the early results we are seeing for expansion in Texas and other regions in the United States. The US fleet of security towers is fully utilized and the Company is starting to build a backlog of demand.Priorities that the Company intends to focus on for the remainder for 2024 include:1) Expanding operations in the United States and continuing to grow revenues in Canada. Due to significant spending on infrastructure in North America, along with increased theft and vandalism, the Company is seeing strong demand for its products in both countries. Zedcor's innovative products, coupled with the Company's commitment to customer service, are perfectly situated to disrupt the traditional security market. 2) With the strong demand that Zedcor is seeing for its security towers, the Company intends to further take control of its supply chain and remove bottlenecks for its security towers by manufacturing and assembling more of the components of its towers in house. This will allow us to actively manage demand and, over time, reduce our capital costs.3) Building new, innovative products based on customer demand. As the Company has obtained customers in different industry verticals, it has seen an increasing number of use cases for its security solutions coupled with Zedcor's 24/7 Live, VerifiedTM video monitoring. This includes a need for additional AI based technology that is actively monitored as well as a mobile security product with a smaller footprint.4) The Company intends to generate customer and shareholder value and positive earnings per share. By effectively managing its growth, executing on the above noted strategies and increasing its capital markets presence, Zedcor will be able to continue to generate positive earnings per share, grow its shareholder base and increase share price.NON-IFRS MEASURES RECONCILIATIONZedcor Inc. uses certain measures in this MD&A which do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). These measures which are derived from information reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting issuers. These measures have been described and presented in this MD&A in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company.Investors are cautioned that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per share, adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow are not acceptable alternatives to net income or net income per share, a measurement of liquidity, or comparable measures as determined in accordance with IFRS.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA refers to net income before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before costs associated with severance, gains and losses on sale of equipment and stock based compensation. These measures do not have a standardized definition prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar captioned terms presented by other issuers.Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of performance as they eliminate non-recurring items and the impact of finance and tax structure variables that exist between entities. ""Adjusted EBITDA per share - basic"" refers to Adjusted EBITDA divided by the weighted average basic number of shares outstanding during the relevant periods.A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below:Three months ended December 31Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s)2023202220232022 Net income (loss)(860)3,0762,6525,998Add (less): Finance costs4693201,6211,063Depreciation of property & equipment1,0487023,6142,412Depreciation of right-of-use assets3892441,249938Loss (gain) on sale of equipment100(15)27(139)Loss (gain) loss on disposal of right-of-use asset69(10)81(14)Income tax recovery-(2,005)-(2,005)EBITDA 1,2152,3129,2448,253 Add (deduct): Stock based compensation18045562129Foreign exchange loss (gain) 623(2)70Other income--(2,159)(883)18668(1,599)(684)Adjusted EBITDA1,4012,3807,6457,569 Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT refers to earnings before interest and finance charges, taxes, and severance costs. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT is provided below:Three months ended December 31Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s)2023202220232022 Net income (loss)(860)3,0762,6525,998Add (deduct): Finance costs4693201,6211,063Income tax recovery (2,005) (2,005)Other income--(2,159)(883)Adjusted EBIT(391)1,3912,1144,173 Adjusted free cash flowAdjusted free cash flow is defined by management as net income plus non-cash expenses, plus or minus the net change in non-cash working capital, plus severance costs, less maintenance capital. Maintenance capital is also a non-IFRS term. Management defines maintenance capital as the amount of capital expenditure required to keep its operating assets functioning at the same level of efficiency. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow reflects the cash generated from the ongoing operation of the business. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure generally used as an indicator of funds available for re-investment and debt payment. There is no standardized method of determining free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow or maintenance capital prescribed under IFRS and therefore the Company's method of calculating these amounts is unlikely to be comparable to similar terms presented by other issuers.Adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations is calculated as follows:Three months ended December 31Twelve months ended December 31 (in $000s)2023202220232022 Net income (loss)(860)3,0762,6525,998Add non-cash expenses: Depreciation of property & equipment1,0487023,6142,412Depreciation of right-of-use assets3892441,249938Stock based compensation18046562129Finance costs (non-cash portion)11614151145Income tax recovery (2,005) (2,005)8732,0778,2287,617(Deduct) non-recurring income Other income--(2,159)(883)8732,0776,0696,734Change in non-cash working capital (391)(146)1,023(1,803)Adjusted free cash flow4821,9317,0924,931 No Conference CallNo conference call will be held in conjunction with this release.

Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting https://www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Principal Risk Factors: You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. ETF shares may trade at a discount to net asset value and possibly face delisting. All or a portion of a fund's otherwise tax exempt interest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal and state alternative minimum tax. Securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility and be less liquid than larger, more established companies whereas large capitalization companies may grow at a slower rate than the overall market. A fund that effects all or a portion of its creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind may be less tax efficient. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. A fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss. In managing a fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, country, region, industry, or sector may be more affected by an adverse economic or political development than a broadly diversified fund. Commodity prices can have a significant volatility and exposure to commodities can cause the value of a fund's shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and unpredictable manner. Certain securities are subject to call, credit, extension, income, inflation, interest rate, prepayment and zero coupon risks. These risks could result in a decline in a security's value and/or income, increased volatility as interest rates rise or fall and have an adverse impact on a fund's performance. The use of listed and OTC derivatives, including futures, options, swap agreements and forward contracts, can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. Securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risk may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A fund may invest in the shares of other funds, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying funds. First Trust Advisors L.P.

The deal includes incentives from Hyatt, valued at $352,000 per key, and is expected to boost earnings and FFO per share in 2024. Positive Strategic acquisition of Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk for $230 million Prime location between Riverwalk and the Alamo in San Antonio Hotel recently renovated with no significant near-term capital needs Hyatt to manage the hotel under the Hyatt Regency brand Expected hotel EBITDA contribution of $12 to $13 million in 2024 Acquisition funded from cash on hand from the sale of Boston Park Plaza Value of approximately $352,000 per key with an 11.1x multiple on estimated 2024 hotel EBITDA Expected closure of the acquisition in late April 2024 Positive outlook for earnings growth and portfolio diversification Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk by Sunstone Hotel Investors represents a strategic move to enhance their portfolio with a high-traffic, well-positioned asset. The transaction's timing, following the disposition of Boston Park Plaza, indicates a focused capital recycling strategy aimed at optimizing asset performance and shareholder returns. The 8.0% capitalization rate and 11.1x EBITDA multiple are within the range of current market transactions, which suggests a balanced investment approach.From a diversification standpoint, the hotel's location in a market experiencing demographic growth and business-friendly initiatives is likely to contribute to steady cash flows. This aligns with Sunstone's objective to balance and diversify its portfolio. The recent renovations and minimal capital needs for the near term reduce the risk of unexpected expenditures, potentially enhancing the investment's attractiveness.However, the reliance on Hyatt's management and the $8 million key money contribution could introduce dependencies that may affect operational flexibility. Additionally, the impact of the Alamo Visitor Center and Museum development on the hotel's demand and foot traffic, while potentially positive, remains speculative until completion. Financial Analyst The financial structure of the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk acquisition by Sunstone reflects prudent use of sale proceeds from Boston Park Plaza, with an emphasis on maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. The repurchase of common stock at a discount to NAV demonstrates a shareholder value-oriented approach, while the planned reinvestment into accretive acquisitions speaks to a strategic growth mindset.The projected contribution of $12 to $13 million in hotel EBITDA and $0.06 in adjusted FFO per diluted share suggests a positive impact on Sunstone's financial performance in 2024. However, the actual performance will depend on market conditions and the hotel's ability to capitalize on its strategic location.Investors should monitor the integration of the new asset into Sunstone's portfolio and the company's ability to realize the projected earnings growth. The additional liquidity and balance sheet capacity mentioned could provide Sunstone with the flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities or return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases. Real Estate Investment Analyst The acquisition of a key property like Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk signals Sunstone's commitment to investing in prime real estate with high visibility and traffic. The value per key and the capitalization rate suggest a competitive market position, with the potential for yield optimization given the hotel's recent renovations and strategic location.The proximity to the Alamo and Riverwalk, coupled with the upcoming Alamo Visitor Center and Museum, positions the hotel to potentially benefit from increased tourism and business travel. The $500 million investment into the adjacent Alamo site could significantly enhance the area's appeal, potentially leading to an uptick in occupancy and ADR (Average Daily Rate) for the hotel.While the acquisition appears to be a strategic fit for Sunstone's portfolio, the long-term success will hinge on market trends, the execution of operational strategies and the ability to attract both group and transient demand. The hotel's performance should be evaluated against regional competitors and broader economic indicators to assess the success of the investment. 04/10/2024 - 04:10 PM ALISO VIEJO, Calif., April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Sunstone"") (NYSE: SHO) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Hyatt Hotels Corporation to acquire the fee-simple interest in the 630-room Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk (the ""Hotel""). The exceptionally well-located Hotel is situated directly between San Antonio's famous Riverwalk and the Alamo, the two most visited tourist sites in Texas. The acquisition includes nearly two acres of riverfront land and a 516-space parking garage, located adjacent to the Alamo Visitor Center and Museum which is currently under development. The Hotel recently underwent a comprehensive $37 million guestroom renovation and does not have any meaningful required near-term capital needs. Sunstone is acquiring the hotel for a gross purchase price of $230 million. Hyatt will continue to manage the Hotel under the Hyatt Regency brand and will contribute approximately $8 million of key money as part of the transaction, subject to the terms of the Company's management agreement with Hyatt. Inclusive of the incentives offered by Hyatt, the net purchase price implies a value of approximately $352,000 per key and represents an 11.1x multiple on the midpoint of the Company's estimate of 2024 hotel EBITDA and a 8.0% capitalization rate based on the midpoint of projected hotel net operating income. The acquisition will be funded from cash on hand using a portion of the sale proceeds from the previously completed disposition of Boston Park Plaza. The Company currently expects to close the acquisition in late April and that the hotel will contribute $12 to $13 million of hotel EBITDA and approximately $0.06 of adjusted FFO per diluted share during the Company's ownership period in 2024. The Company will provide additional details on the transaction, including the impact on its previously provided full year outlook as part of its first quarter earnings call in early May. Bryan Giglia, Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are excited to announce our planned acquisition of Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk which demonstrates our ability to accretively recycle capital following our disposition activity late last year. This is the best-located hotel in the city, situated in the heart of the Riverwalk, at the front door of the Alamo, and steps away from the convention center. Our premiere location allows the hotel to benefit from an attractive combination of group and transient demand in a market that continues to experience positive demographic shifts, increasing hotel demand, and a business-friendly backdrop. The Hotel has been recently renovated and is in great shape with minimal near-term capital needs but has opportunities to drive additional earnings over the long term."" Mr. Giglia continued, ""The acquisition of Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk allows us to redeploy capital at a higher long-term return and is a great example of the value we can create through our investment lifecycle approach. The addition of this hotel, combined with our two recently launched brand conversions and the completion of our transformative investment later this year at Andaz Miami Beach, will position Sunstone for significant earnings growth as we move into 2025. We also retain additional liquidity and balance sheet capacity that we can use to thoughtfully grow our portfolio and drive incremental earnings, superior returns, and greater per-share NAV growth."" Transaction Benefits Sunstone believes the acquisition of Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk will further the Company's short and long-term objectives and be additive to its stockholders in the following ways: Accretive Redeployment of Capital at a Compelling Yield: In October 2023, the Company sold the Boston Park Plaza for $370 million, reflecting a trailing capitalization rate of 7.1%, excluding future capital needs, or an implied capitalization rate of 6.1%, inclusive of expected near-term capital investments. The Company is recycling a portion of the sale proceeds into the acquisition of the Hotel at an approximately 8.0% capitalization rate and is avoiding the incremental capital spend and earnings disruption that would have been incurred through continued ownership of Boston Park Plaza. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company deployed $20 million of the sale proceeds to repurchase its common stock at a discount to consensus estimates of NAV. The Company expects to redeploy the remaining sale proceeds into additional accretive acquisitions or opportunistic share repurchases. Well-Located Hotel Real Estate: Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk is the best-located hotel in the market, situated on the highest foot-traffic area of the famed Riverwalk, at the front entrance of the Alamo, and steps away from the convention center. The adjacent Alamo site is currently undergoing a transformative restoration and enhancement, including the addition of a visitor center and museum with a total investment of $500 million, which we expect will further enhance the desirability of the Hotel's location and drive increased demand and foot traffic. Increased Diversification: The addition of the Hotel bolsters the Company's near-term earnings capacity and brings further balance and diversification to the portfolio. The Hotel allows for increased geographic diversification in a market that is benefiting from positive demographic shifts and a business-friendly backdrop. The year-round nature of market demand will provide additional balance to our cash flow, improving our already high-quality portfolio of convention, urban and resort assets. Leading Group and Leisure Market: The San Antonio market benefits from diverse and dynamic demand generators that include the 1.6 million square foot Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, Texas' top leisure attractions with the Alamo and Riverwalk, and a vibrant technology and defense industry. In the near term, the Company expects the market to benefit from the $2.5 billion expansion of the San Antonio International Airport, the $500 million redevelopment of the Alamo Visitor Center and Museum, and the recent $325 million of upgrades to the convention center. In addition, San Antonio group demand is expected to benefit in the near term, while the adjacent convention centers in Austin and Dallas are offline for construction. Further Supports a Compelling Growth Profile into 2025: The addition of the Hotel adds another layer of earnings growth for the Company's portfolio. Having recently completed the conversion of The Westin Washington, DC Downtown and the Marriott Long Beach Downtown and with the in-process transformation of Andaz Miami Beach expected to be completed by year-end, the incremental full-year earnings from the acquisition of the Hotel should combine to support robust earnings growth for Sunstone in the coming years. The Company currently anticipates closing the transaction in late April 2024. The acquisition of the Hotel is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, and the Company can give no assurance that the acquisition of the Hotel will close. The forecast amounts referenced in this release are based on the Company's assumptions of operating performance and the Company cannot assure you that the forecasts will be achieved.

The company is progressing well with the global Phase 3 clinical development plans for deucrictibant for HAE attacks. Recent achievements include the lifting of the clinical hold by the FDA and the receipt of the UK Innovation Passport for deucrictibant. The executive team has been bolstered with new hires, and upcoming investor presentations are scheduled. Positive Strong financial results reported by Pharvaris for Q4 and year-end 2023. Cash and cash equivalents stand at approximately €391 million as of December 31, 2023. Progress in global Phase 3 clinical development plans for deucrictibant for HAE attacks. FDA lifted the clinical hold on the IND application for deucrictibant for prophylaxis of HAE attacks. Receipt of the UK Innovation Passport for deucrictibant for on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE attacks. Strengthened executive team with new hires. Upcoming investor presentations scheduled for May 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The liquidity position of Pharvaris, with cash and cash equivalents of approximately €391 million as of December 31, 2023, represents a substantial increase from the previous year's €162 million. This enhancement in liquidity is indicative of a robust financial foundation, which may positively influence investor confidence. The company's ability to fund ongoing and future clinical trials, such as the pivotal Phase 3 study of deucrictibant, is important for its progression towards potential commercialization. However, the reported loss for the year 2023 has widened to €101 million from the previous year's €76.3 million, which reflects the increased investment in research and development. Investors should monitor the balance between the company's cash burn rate and the progression of its clinical programs to assess the sustainability of its financial position. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of deucrictibant through clinical trials is significant, particularly given the global Phase 3 study for on-demand treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and the upcoming end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for the prophylactic treatment. The designation of an Innovation Passport in the UK for deucrictibant underscores the potential for a more expedited regulatory pathway, which could lead to earlier market access and a competitive advantage. However, the efficacy and safety data, particularly the primary efficacy endpoint of time to onset of symptom relief, will be pivotal in determining the drug's market viability. Stakeholders should consider the potential market impact of a successful oral therapy for HAE, which could disrupt the current treatment landscape primarily composed of injectable therapies. Market Research Analyst Pharvaris' strategic appointments, such as the new Chief Financial Officer and Chief Technical Operations Officer, suggest a strengthening of the executive team in anticipation of potential growth and operational scaling. The company's focus on integrating research and clinical development, as evidenced by the promotion of Dr. Peng Lu to Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer, may enhance the efficiency of its pipeline development. The market should consider how these executive changes, along with the clinical advancements of deucrictibant, may position Pharvaris within the competitive landscape of HAE treatments. The long-term success of the company will likely hinge on the ability of its management to navigate the complex regulatory environment and effectively bring its products to market. 04/10/2024 - 04:10 PM RAPIDe-3, a global pivotal Phase 3 study of deucrictibant for the on-demand treatment of HAE attacks, is currently enrollingEnd-of-Phase 2 meeting scheduled to discuss development plan of deucrictibant for the prophylaxis of HAE attacksStrengthened executive committee with hiring of David Nassif, J.D., Chief Financial Officer, and Stefan Abele, Ph.D., as Chief Technical Operations OfficerUK Innovation Passport awarded to deucrictibant for both the on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE attacksEnded 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately €391 million ZUG, Switzerland, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pharvaris (Nasdaq: PHVS), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, oral bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists to treat and prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. “2024 is off to a strong start, supported by the incredible momentum we built in an impressive 2023—driven by a second positive data readout of deucrictibant that was validated by the support of our investors,” said Berndt Modig, Chief Executive Officer of Pharvaris. “At the start of the year, the lift of the remaining hold on the prophylaxis program in the U.S. allowed us to progress with the global Phase 3 clinical development plans for deucrictibant for prevention of HAE attacks. As we move toward the initiation of CHAPTER-3, we hope to realize the promise of the proof-of-concept CHAPTER-1 data, which support deucrictibant’s potential to be a best-in-class oral prophylactic therapy. We are pleased with the HAE community’s excitement in RAPIDe-3, which is enrolling as planned; we will provide the anticipated timing of topline data as enrollment progresses and data is accumulated. Receipt of the Innovation Passport designation for deucrictibant in the UK reflects regulatory recognition of deucrictibant’s innovation for better treatment options for people living with HAE.” Recent Business Updates and HighlightsDevelopment Pipeline Enrollment initiated in RAPIDe-3 (NCT06343779) a global Phase 3 clinical study. Pharvaris is currently enrolling in RAPIDe-3, a global pivotal Phase 3 study of deucrictibant immediate-release capsule (PHVS416) for the on-demand treatment of HAE attacks. The primary efficacy endpoint is time to onset of symptom relief, as measured by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) of at least “a little better” for two consecutive timepoints within 12 hours post-treatment. Other efficacy endpoints include time to End of Progression (EoP) in attack symptoms within 12 hours as measured by PGI-C, substantial symptom relief, and proportion of attacks achieving symptom resolution with one dose of deucrictibant as measured by Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and by Angioedema Symptom Rating Scale (AMRA).End-of-Phase 2 meeting scheduled to align on prophylactic Phase 3 clinical development plan. Pharvaris continues preparatory activities for CHAPTER-3, a global Phase 3 study of deucrictibant extended-release tablets (PHVS719) for the prophylactic treatment of HAE attacks. An End-of-Phase 2 meeting has been scheduled with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), during which Pharvaris will seek feedback and alignment on the key elements of the proposed clinical development plan.Deucrictibant awarded UK Innovation Passport. The UK Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) Steering Group, which consists of the All Wales Therapeutics and Toxicology Centre (AWTTC), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), has awarded an Innovation Passport to deucrictibant for the on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE attacks in people 12 years and older. The Innovation Passport is the entry point for the ILAP, which has a goal of accelerating the time to access to medicines in the UK, and receipt of the award activates the MHRA, NICE, SMC, and other agencies to develop a roadmap for regulatory and development milestones.Clinical hold lifted. Following review of data from a 26-week rodent toxicology study, the FDA lifted the clinical hold on the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for deucrictibant for the prophylaxis of HAE attacks.Deucrictibant data presented at recent industry meetings. Data supporting the ongoing development of deucrictibant for both the on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE attacks were presented at the GA²LEN UCARE Conference 2023, the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) 2023 Annual Scientific Meeting, Western Society of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (WSAAI) Annual Meeting 2024, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) 2024 Annual Meeting, the 3rd National Congress of the Italian Network for Hereditary and Acquired Angioedema (ITACA), and the 2024 HAE International (HAEi) Regional Conference Americas. Highlights of presentations include top-line data from the CHAPTER-1 study, the design of the RAPIDe-3 study, deucrictibant’s ability to reduce the time to EoP of HAE attacks, and a comparison of various patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. Corporate Strengthened executive team. Stefan Abele, Ph.D., joined Pharvaris as Chief Technical Operations Officer in November 2023, furthering the company’s capabilities in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) activities, supply chain, intellectual property, and project management. Effective April 15, 2024, David Nassif, J.D., will join Pharvaris as Chief Financial Officer and will be responsible for refining and implementing Pharvaris’ corporate financial strategy and activities including financial reporting and operations. In April 2024, Peng Lu, M.D., Ph.D., was promoted to Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer, as Pharvaris strategically strengthens the continuity between research and clinical development for various pipeline programs.Held Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders.

Highlights of the RMBS portfolio characteristics and the estimated total return on equity of 4.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The estimated GAAP net income of $0.38 per share for Orchid Island Capital, Inc. reflects a robust quarter, particularly noting the $0.50 per share of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments. These gains are significant as they indicate the company's ability to generate returns from its investment portfolio, a critical factor for investor confidence. The 4.2% total return on equity is a key metric for assessing the company's profitability relative to its equity base. While this figure appears solid, it is essential to compare it with industry benchmarks and historical performance to fully gauge its strength.The monthly dividend announcement of $0.12 per share is in line with the company's distribution strategy. As a REIT, Orchid Island must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, which often makes these stocks attractive to income-focused investors. The consistency of dividend payments can be a sign of stability and can influence the stock's attractiveness in the market. However, the company's statement that it has not established a minimum distribution level and cannot assure future distributions may introduce an element of uncertainty for income-dependent shareholders.Finally, the increase in shares outstanding over the quarter suggests the company might have issued new shares, which could dilute existing shareholders' equity. However, a deeper analysis would be required to understand the implications fully, including the reasons behind the potential share issuance and its impact on the company's capital structure. Market Research Analyst Orchid Island Capital's preliminary figures, including the estimated book value per share of $9.12, provide an insight into the company's net asset value. This metric is important for investors as it helps in assessing whether the stock is trading at a discount or premium to its net asset value. A book value that is close to or higher than the market price may suggest that the stock is undervalued, potentially attracting value investors.The RMBS portfolio characteristics are also noteworthy. RMBS, or Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities, are a type of investment that can be sensitive to interest rate changes and the overall health of the housing market. The portfolio's performance can significantly impact the company's returns and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends. Investors often look at RMBS valuation characteristics and risk measures to assess the quality and risk profile of the underlying assets.It is also important to note that the company's financials are preliminary and subject to change upon final review by the independent registered public accounting firm. This could mean that the final reported figures may differ from these estimates, which could influence the stock's performance upon the actual earnings release. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst The performance of Orchid Island Capital, as a REIT, hinges on its ability to manage and optimize its real estate investments, in this case, RMBS. The reported net gains from RMBS and derivative instruments suggest the company has been effectively navigating the market. However, the broader real estate market conditions, including interest rates and housing demand, can have a substantial impact on the performance of RMBS. It is imperative to analyze these macroeconomic factors alongside the company's financial metrics to predict future performance.The repurchase agreement exposure by counterparty is another critical aspect for a REIT dealing with RMBS, as it indicates the level of risk associated with borrowing. If the counterparties are stable financial institutions, the risk may be mitigated, but exposure to weaker parties could pose significant risks, especially in volatile markets.Investors should also consider the implications of the company's tax structure as a REIT, which requires the distribution of the majority of taxable income. While this can lead to high dividend yields, it also limits the amount of earnings the company can reinvest into its business, potentially affecting long-term growth. 04/10/2024 - 04:10 PM April 2024 Monthly Dividend of $0.12 Per Share of Common Stock Estimated Book Value Per Share as of March 31, 2024 of $9.12 Estimated GAAP net income of $0.38 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, including an estimated $0.50 per share of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments.

(the “Company”) (NYSE: ORC) announced today that the Board of Directors of the Company declared a monthly cash dividend for the month of April 2024. The dividend of $0.12 per share will be paid May 30, 2024 to holders of record of the Company’s common stock on April 30, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of April 29, 2024. The Company plans on announcing its next common stock dividend on May 8, 2024. The Company intends to make regular monthly cash distributions to its holders of common stock. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), the Company must distribute annually to its stockholders an amount at least equal to 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. The Company will be subject to income tax on taxable income that is not distributed and to an excise tax to the extent that a certain percentage of its taxable income is not distributed by specified dates. The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future. As of April 10, 2024, the Company had 52,973,989 shares of common stock outstanding. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 52,826,169 shares of common stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 51,636,074 shares of common stock outstanding. Estimated March 31, 2024 Book Value Per Share The Company’s estimated book value per share as of March 31, 2024 was $9.12. The Company computes book value per share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. At March 31, 2024, the Company's preliminary estimated total stockholders' equity was approximately $481.6 million with 52,826,169 shares of common stock outstanding. These figures and the resulting estimated book value per share are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Net Income Per Share and Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on RMBS and Derivative Instruments The Company estimates it generated a net income per share of $0.38, which includes $0.50 per share of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. These amounts compare to total dividends declared during the quarter of $0.36 per share. Net income per common share calculated under generally accepted accounting principles can, and does, differ from our REIT taxable income. The Company views REIT taxable income as a better indication of income to be paid in the form of a dividend rather than net income. Many components of REIT taxable income can only be estimated at this time and our monthly dividends declared are based on both estimates of REIT taxable income to be earned over the course of the current quarter and calendar year and a longer-term estimate of the REIT taxable income of the Company. These figures are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Total Return on Equity The Company’s estimated total return on equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 4.2%. The Company calculates total return on equity as the sum of dividends declared and paid during the quarter plus changes in book value during the quarter, divided by the Company’s stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the quarter. The total return was $0.38 per share, comprised of dividends per share of $0.36 and an increase in book value per share of $0.02 from December 31, 2023. RMBS Portfolio Characteristics Details of the RMBS portfolio as of March 31, 2024 are presented below. These figures are preliminary and subject to change and, with respect to figures that will appear in the Company's financial statements and associated footnotes as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, are subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm: RMBS Valuation Characteristics RMBS Assets by Agency Investment Company Act of 1940 (Whole Pool) Test Results Repurchase Agreement Exposure by Counterparty RMBS Risk Measures About Orchid Island Capital, Inc.

(NYSE: AMK) released its 'AssetMark Monthly Knowledge' Report, showing positive year-over-year growth in platform assets, net flows, and number of households for March 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in platform assets to $116.9 billion, marking a 21.5% year-over-year growth, indicates a robust expansion in AssetMark's asset base. This growth is a positive signal for investors, as it suggests that the company is successfully attracting and retaining investment capital. The 12.0% year-over-year increase in net flows is also significant, as it reflects the company's ability to draw in new money, which can be indicative of strong sales and marketing efforts, as well as investor confidence in the firm's investment offerings.However, the slight decline in AssetMark Trust Company client cash by 0.6% year-over-year, while nominal, could point to a trend where clients are choosing to invest their cash rather than hold it, which could be due to low interest rates on cash holdings or a shift in investment strategy. The increase in the number of households served by 5.5% year-over-year suggests a growing customer base, which could lead to increased revenues from service fees and asset-based charges. Overall, these metrics are essential indicators of the company's health and future revenue potential. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market context, AssetMark's performance must be evaluated against industry trends and competitor performance. The significant growth in platform assets outpaces average industry growth rates, which could signal that AssetMark is capturing market share. Additionally, the steady increase in households implies an effective customer acquisition strategy, potentially driven by digital marketing or product innovation. Investors should monitor these trends in comparison to AssetMark's peers for a more comprehensive understanding of the company's market position.It's also worth noting the importance of transparency in AssetMark's reporting. The company's decision to provide monthly data supplements, while not a substitute for formal financial statements, reflects a commitment to shareholder communication. However, their disclaimer about the preliminary nature of this data and the lack of obligation to update it suggests that investors should not rely solely on these figures for making investment decisions. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM CONCORD, Calif., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AssetMark Financial Holdings, Inc.

California Water Service Group Utilities Prepared to Comply with New PFAS Regulations,2024-04-10T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"California Water Service Group (CWT) confirms readiness to comply with new EPA PFAS regulations, setting MCLs and Hazard Index for various PFAS compounds. The company's utilities are well-prepared to treat impacted water sources and meet compliance deadlines.","California Water Service Group Utilities Prepared to Comply with New PFAS Regulations Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary California Water Service Group (CWT) confirms readiness to comply with new EPA PFAS regulations, setting MCLs and Hazard Index for various PFAS compounds. The company's utilities are well-prepared to treat impacted water sources and meet compliance deadlines. Positive California Water Service Group (CWT) is positioned to comply with the new EPA regulations regarding PFAS compounds. The EPA has set maximum contaminant levels (MCL) and Hazard Index for various PFAS compounds, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, GenX, and PFBS. Group's utilities have protocols in place to test and monitor water quality, ensuring compliance with the new regulations. The company has proactively monitored water sources for PFAS compounds before the regulatory deadlines, prioritizing customer health and safety. Group is advocating for a comprehensive regulatory approach to address PFAS contamination in water supplies, including legal action against PFAS manufacturers and seeking grant funding for treatment costs. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst The introduction of new PFAS regulations by the EPA signifies a tightening of environmental controls that could have significant implications for utilities and their operational costs. The established MCLs for various PFAS compounds are notably stringent, reflecting a shift towards more aggressive public health protection measures. Water utilities are now mandated to monitor and comply with these limits, which could necessitate substantial investments in water treatment technologies and infrastructure.From an environmental policy standpoint, the Group's proactive approach in monitoring and preparing for compliance is commendable. However, the financial implications of such regulatory compliance are considerable. The Group's litigation efforts to hold PFAS manufacturers accountable for contamination costs suggest an awareness of the potential financial burden. The pursuit of grant funding to defray costs is a strategic move, but it remains to be seen how effective this will be in offsetting the total investment required for compliance. Water Quality Scientist PFAS compounds, due to their solubility and persistence, present a complex challenge for water treatment. The Group's existing water quality assurance program and testing protocols are important in ensuring compliance with the new EPA standards. Their early adoption of testing for PFAS compounds indicates foresight and a commitment to public health.However, the technology and methods required to meet the new MCLs will likely involve advanced and potentially costly treatment processes such as granular activated carbon (GAC), ion exchange, or high-pressure membranes. The effectiveness of these treatments in consistently achieving the low MCLs set by the EPA will be a key factor in the Group's ability to maintain compliance and protect customer health. Financial Analyst The Group's announcement has implications for investors, as the costs associated with meeting the new PFAS regulation could impact financial performance. While the Group's subsidiaries appear to be well-prepared, the capital expenditure required for treatment facilities and ongoing operational costs for monitoring could affect profit margins. Investors should monitor the Group's financial disclosures for capital outlays related to compliance and any updates on litigation outcomes, which could relieve some financial pressure if successful.Furthermore, the Group's commitment to compliance and customer health may strengthen its brand reputation and could potentially lead to an increased customer base, which can be seen as a long-term investment in sustainable business practices. Nevertheless, the immediate financial impact of the regulation and how it is managed will be of particular interest to stakeholders. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN JOSE, Calif., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) adoption of a new National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) today (new PFAS regulation), California Water Service Group (Group) (NYSE: CWT) confirmed that it believes its subsidiaries are well positioned to treat potentially impacted water sources and to meet the EPA’s five-year compliance timeline. Under the new PFAS regulation, EPA established maximum contaminant levels (MCL) of 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for both PFOA and PFOS; MCLs of 10 ppt for PFHxS, PFNA, and GenX; and a combined Hazard Index of 1.0 for PFBS, PFHxS, PFNA, and GenX. Generally, PFAS are manmade compounds that are found in a number of everyday products; these compounds are soluble in water and can travel long distances. Under the new PFAS regulation, water utilities with impacted water systems across the country are required to monitor for these PFAS by 2027 and to comply with the MCLs and Hazard Index by 2029. Group’s utilities California Water Service (Cal Water), Hawaii Water Service (Hawaii Water), New Mexico Water Service (New Mexico Water), and Washington Water Service (Washington Water) have a rigorous, coordinated water quality assurance program, and the utilities have protocols in place to test and monitor the water they deliver to customers. In California and Washington, Group’s utilities have been complying with previously issued PFAS guidelines issued by State regulators. Cal Water, Hawaii Water, and New Mexico Water have tested all of their active water sources for a number of PFAS, including the six addressed in the new regulation. Washington Water Service (Washington Water) has tested all of its Group A water system sources, which are water sources subject to the new PFAS regulation. The company began monitoring all of its sources for these PFAS before it was required to do so under the new PFAS regulation, because it believed it was the right thing to do. “Protecting our customers’ health and safety is our highest priority, and we have long supported EPA’s establishment of national drinking water standards for the most common PFAS,” said Martin A. Kropelnicki, Group Chairman & CEO. “While we did not put the PFAS in the water, we are committed to treating it in accordance with all applicable regulations. Our team has already evaluated the impact of the EPA’s proposed regulations so that we could be better prepared to comply with the final set, and we are moving forward to bring any affected sources into compliance with the new MCLs and Hazard Index.” Beyond the new PFAS regulation, Group believes that a comprehensive regulatory approach is needed to properly address PFAS entering water supplies in the United States, including measures such as point-of-use restrictions on PFAS manufacturers, legislation that prohibits the sale and use of certain PFAS-containing products, certification for accurate PFAS testing methods, and establishment of a publicly available database to monitor PFAS sources entering water supplies. Additionally, Group filed lawsuits to hold PFAS manufacturers financially responsible for the costs of monitoring and treating water for PFAS and is pursuing grant funding, where available, to help reduce the financial impact of treatment on its utilities’ customers. The full name of PFOA is perfluorooctanoic acid, of PFOS is perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, of PFHxS is perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, of PFNA is perfluorononanoic acid, of GenX is hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt, and of PFBS is perfluorobutane sulfonate.

Despite a 25.6% decrease in net sales, the company focuses on diversification strategies and improving profitability.

Positive Sales increased 18.7% sequentially, showing improving business conditions. Board of Directors declared a $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased by 25.6% to $52.4 million. Gross margin was 29.5% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Cash dividend of $0.06 per share declared, payable on May 29, 2024. Negative Net sales decreased by 25.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating income decreased significantly from the prior year's third quarter. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was lower compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Market Research Analyst The reported 18.7% sequential sales increase and dividend declaration by Richardson Electronics are indicative of a positive trend in the company's operations. The reduction in inventory also suggests a strategic approach to working capital management, which is important for maintaining liquidity and operational efficiency. The focus on diversification strategies and engineered solutions is a proactive measure to mitigate the cyclical nature of semiconductor sales, which appear to be a significant segment of their business.It's important to note, however, that the 25.6% decrease in net sales year-over-year raises concerns about the company's performance in its PMT and Canvys divisions. This could signal underlying challenges in these markets or possible shifts in customer demand that need to be closely monitored. Investors should consider the company's long-term growth strategies and how they align with current global trends, such as energy transition, which could open up new avenues for growth. Financial Analyst Richardson Electronics' gross margin contraction from 31.8% to 29.5% suggests pressure on profitability, potentially due to product mix changes and manufacturing under absorption. While the company has managed to maintain a positive operating income, the sharp decline from the previous year's quarter is a point of concern. The operating expense control is a positive takeaway, indicating management's efforts to balance growth initiatives with cost management.The decline in backlog for PMT and Canvys, although marginal, could be indicative of future revenue challenges if not addressed. The dividend declaration, despite reduced profitability, reflects confidence in the company's cash flow management but warrants scrutiny on whether it's sustainable in the long-term without compromising growth investments. Supply Chain Analyst The company's success in reducing inventory for the first time in over two years highlights a significant improvement in supply chain efficiency. After a period marked by supply chain constraints, this adjustment is a positive sign that Richardson Electronics is realigning its inventory with expected market demand. However, the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable suggest potential shifts in cash flow that could impact financial stability if not managed effectively.Looking at the decrease in net sales for PMT and GES, it's essential to understand the supply chain dynamics that may have contributed to these outcomes. The semiconductor industry is known for its volatility and the company's exposure to this sector requires a resilient supply chain to adapt to rapid changes in demand. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM Sales increased 18.7% sequentially, reflecting improving business conditions. Inventory decreased $4.0 million sequentially, reflecting focus on improving working capital levels. LAFOX, Ill., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ: RELL) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended March 2, 2024. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend. ""The sequential increase in sales and profitability is encouraging, reflecting the benefits of our diversification strategies as well as our team’s focus on enhancing profitability and strengthening our balance sheet. Sales growth at GES is even more impressive, considering last year’s third quarter benefited from a large order to an EV rail customer. Overall, our net sales continue to reflect the cyclical nature of sales to semiconductor wafer fab customers that had an $11.5 million negative impact on sales during the quarter. As we navigate this period, the success of our GES business demonstrates the importance of our diversification strategies as well as our focus on providing more engineered solutions to our growing global customer base,” said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. “Throughout fiscal 2024 we have focused on decreasing inventory levels to better align with expected demand across our markets after a period of inventory growth, caused by supply chain constraints over the past several years. I am pleased with the progress our global teams are making as this quarter marks the first time we’ve seen a decline in inventory in more than two years. Overall, we continue to pursue significant long-term growth strategies that take advantage of opportunities created by recent government stimulus programs as well as global energy transition trends. Over the near-term, recent customer discussions indicate expected demand growth in the semiconductor and GES markets. As a result, we anticipate sequential sales growth in our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, as well as further improvements in profitability,” concluded Mr. Richardson. Third Quarter Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 25.6% to $52.4 million compared to net sales of $70.4 million in the prior year’s third quarter due to lower net sales in PMT and Canvys. PMT sales decreased $15.7 million from last year’s third quarter primarily due to lower sales of manufactured products for the Company’s semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment customers. GES sales increased $0.1 million from last year’s third quarter, which included a large sale of EV locomotive battery modules that did not recur in fiscal 2024. Canvys sales decreased by $3.1 million, primarily due to short-term customer pushouts in North America. Richardson Healthcare sales increased $0.7 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as higher CT tube and parts demand offset lower system sales. Backlog totaled $147.7 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $150.7 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The sequential decline was in PMT and Canvys. GES backlog of $36.8 million increased from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 by $1.1 million. Gross margin was 29.5% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 31.8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Without the under absorption of the Company’s manufacturing facility, management estimates that the Company’s consolidated gross margin for the fiscal 2024 third quarter would have been 31.0%. PMT gross margin decreased to 28.3% from 32.9% due to product mix and $0.8 million of manufacturing under absorption. GES’ gross margin increased to 26.6% from 25.7% due to product mix. Healthcare gross margin increased to 41.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 39.8% in the prior year’s third quarter as a result of an improved product mix. Canvys’ gross margin increased to 34.4% from 32.0% because of product mix. Operating expenses were $14.4 million compared to $14.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from lower incentive expenses, partially offset by higher R&D expenses in support of the Company’s growth initiatives. The Company reported an operating income of $1.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to operating income of $7.6 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Other expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, including interest income and foreign exchange, was less than $0.1 million, compared to other income of $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Cash and investments were $18.9 million as of March 2, 2024, versus $22.8 million on December 2, 2023. The use of cash during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily resulted from a $5.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $4.1 million decrease in accounts payable, and $0.4 million of capital expenditures related to the Company’s IT system, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in inventory. Financial Summary for the Nine Months Ended March 2, 2024 Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were $149.1 million, compared to net sales of $203.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.

As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased to 30.3% of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 33.0% of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily because of product mix and manufacturing under absorption in PMT, product mix in GES, as well as increased scrap expense and manufacturing under absorption in Healthcare, partially offset by a favorable product mix and lower freight costs in Canvys.Operating expenses increased 2.3% to $44.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to $43.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in operating expenses resulted from higher salaries and R&D expenses, partially offset by lower incentive expense.Operating income during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $0.5 million, compared to operating income of $23.6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Other expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.2 million, as compared to other expense of $0.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.The income tax provision was $0.1 million or an effective tax rate of 39.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to an income tax provision of $5.3 million or an effective tax rate of 22.5% during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share versus net income of $18.2 million, or $1.27 per diluted share during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.

ParkOhio Announces Ratings Upgrade from S&P Global,2024-04-10T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Park-Ohio Holdings Corp (PKOH) received an upgrade in ratings from S&P Global, with the issuer credit rating raised to B and the issue-level rating on senior unsecured notes increased to B-. The upgrades are attributed to improved operating performance in 2023, and S&P's expectation of continued profitability growth, positive cash flow, and deleveraging over the next year.","ParkOhio Announces Ratings Upgrade from S&P Global Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Park-Ohio Holdings Corp (PKOH) received an upgrade in ratings from S&P Global, with the issuer credit rating raised to B and the issue-level rating on senior unsecured notes increased to B-. The upgrades are attributed to improved operating performance in 2023, and S&P's expectation of continued profitability growth, positive cash flow, and deleveraging over the next year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An upgrade in issuer credit rating, such as the one Park-Ohio Holdings Corp received from S&P Global, signals a positive shift in the company's financial stability and creditworthiness. The upgrade to a 'B' from 'B-' suggests that ParkOhio has demonstrated an ability to improve its operating performance, which likely includes increased efficiency, cost management and potentially higher revenue streams. The issue-level rating increase for the senior unsecured notes implies a lowered risk for debt holders and may lead to reduced borrowing costs for the company. Investors should note that the stable outlook indicates a low probability of rating changes in the near term, which could provide a sense of security regarding the company's financial health. For stakeholders, the improved ratings may result in a more favorable perception in the market, potentially leading to a rise in stock price as confidence grows in the company's fiscal management and growth prospects. However, it's important to monitor whether ParkOhio can sustain the positive free operating cash flow and continue its deleveraging efforts, as these are critical factors that contributed to the rating upgrade. While the short-term benefits include potential interest savings and improved investor sentiment, long-term advantages hinge on the company's execution of its strategic plans and maintaining or improving its credit ratings. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the rating upgrade for ParkOhio is indicative of an industry environment where operational efficiency is paramount. The company's success in improving profitability and generating positive free operating cash flow is not just a testament to its individual strategy but also reflects broader trends in the manufacturing and supply chain sectors. Companies that excel in supply chain management outsourcing services, like ParkOhio, are likely benefiting from the increased demand for streamlined operations amidst global supply chain disruptions. Investors should consider the competitive landscape and how ParkOhio's enhanced credit rating positions it against peers. A higher credit rating could provide ParkOhio with a strategic advantage in securing new business contracts and expanding its global footprint. Additionally, the company's focus on capital equipment and manufactured components for assembly line production suggests alignment with industrial growth areas, such as automation and smart manufacturing, which are expected to see increased investment in the coming years. Economist From an economic standpoint, the credit rating upgrade for ParkOhio reflects broader economic conditions, including interest rates and the cost of capital. In a climate where interest rates may be rising, a higher credit rating can mitigate some of the negative impacts by enabling access to cheaper financing. This is particularly important for manufacturing companies like ParkOhio, which require significant capital for operations and growth initiatives. The ability to generate positive free operating cash flow suggests that the company is well-positioned to handle its debt obligations even in a potentially tightening monetary environment. Furthermore, the company's deleveraging indicates a strategic move towards a more conservative capital structure, which can be appealing to risk-averse investors. This financial prudence might be seen as a buffer against economic downturns, providing a level of assurance that the company can navigate through various economic cycles. However, it is important to balance deleveraging with the need for investment in innovation and expansion to ensure long-term competitiveness in the global market. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM CLEVELAND, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Park-Ohio Holdings Corp (NASDAQ: PKOH) announced today that S&P Global (“S&P”) has upgraded the ratings of Park-Ohio Industries, Inc. (“ParkOhio”), including the issuer credit rating to B from B-, and the issue-level rating on the Company’s $350 million senior unsecured notes to B- from CCC+. S&P noted that the upgrades and stable outlook reflect improved operating performance in 2023, and their view that PKOH will continue to improve profitability, generate positive free operating cash flow and continue deleveraging over the next 12 months.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Trax and PTC to integrate the Trax platforms with Servigistics signifies a strategic move in the aviation industry's digital transformation journey. From a market research perspective, this collaboration is poised to disrupt the traditional maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations by leveraging advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.By enhancing the efficiency of the service supply chain, airlines and MROs could potentially reduce downtime and improve service levels, which in turn could lead to increased market competitiveness. The ability to have the right part at the right place at the right time is not just a logistical improvement; it's a strategic advantage that could translate into significant cost savings and customer satisfaction enhancements. The ripple effect of such improvements in operational efficiency could be observed in the form of better stock performance for the companies involved, as investors typically favor firms that demonstrate innovative capabilities and operational excellence. Aviation Industry Expert The integration of Trax and Servigistics platforms represents a significant advancement in aviation MRO activities. For airlines and MROs, the optimization of the service supply chain is a critical factor in ensuring aircraft uptime and thus profitability. The aviation industry operates on slim margins where any improvement in turnaround times can have a substantial impact on financial outcomes.Furthermore, the move towards paperless aviation maintenance aligns with the industry's broader environmental and efficiency goals. It indicates a shift toward sustainability and regulatory compliance, as digital records are easier to audit and can significantly reduce the risk of errors. This integration could set a new industry standard, prompting other companies to follow suit, which would further stimulate innovation and competition in the sector.

The focus on automation and new functionality through the integration of these platforms could lead to operational cost reductions and improved asset utilization for their clients.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of the integrated solutions within the industry, as it could serve as a leading indicator of future financial performance for both Trax and PTC. The initial capital expenditure for the development and integration of these platforms may impact short-term earnings; however, the long-term benefits derived from enhanced operational efficiencies and potential market share gains could offset this. It is essential to evaluate the scalability of the solution and the ability of both companies to execute the integration successfully without disrupting current operations. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM The collaboration will establish a seamless integration between the Trax and Servigistics platforms, enabling the timely availability of critical parts and allowing companies to streamline aircraft MRO maintenance activities for peak uptime and customer satisfaction.

(ALPN) shares updated clinical data for povetacicept in IgA nephropathy, showing UPCR reductions of over 60% at 36 weeks, remission, resolution of hematuria, and stable renal function. Successful end of phase 2 meeting with FDA supports advancement to phase 3 study. Key biomarkers Gd-IgA1 and Gd-IgA1/C3 ratios significantly reduced. Monthly dosing well-tolerated with no severe infections. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The recent announcement by Alpine Immune Sciences regarding the successful conclusion of a phase 2 meeting with the FDA for povetacicept in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) represents a significant milestone in the drug's clinical development. The progression to a phase 3 study is a pivotal step, indicating the treatment has shown sufficient promise in earlier trials to warrant a more extensive investigation into its efficacy and safety.From an investment perspective, this transition from phase 2 to phase 3 can be a value inflection point for Alpine Immune Sciences, as it suggests a level of confidence from the regulatory body, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, it is important to note that clinical trials are inherently risky and a successful phase 2 outcome does not guarantee phase 3 success or regulatory approval.The reported data showing a reduction in UPCR of greater than 60% and stabilization of renal function are encouraging, as proteinuria is a key indicator of kidney damage in IgAN patients. The potential for povetacicept to become a front-line disease-modifying treatment, if approved, could disrupt the current treatment landscape and provide a new option for patients suffering from this chronic kidney disease. The long-term impact on Alpine's financials would depend on the drug's market uptake, pricing and competitive landscape at the time of potential approval. Nephrology Specialist The clinical improvements observed with povetacicept in IgAN patients, such as the significant reduction in proteinuria and the stabilization of renal function, are medically significant. Proteinuria is not only a marker of disease activity but also a prognostic indicator and its reduction is associated with better long-term kidney outcomes. The resolution of hematuria, another common symptom of IgAN, further indicates a positive response to the treatment.As a nephrologist, the dual antagonism of BAFF and APRIL by povetacicept is noteworthy because these cytokines are implicated in the pathogenesis of IgAN. By targeting these pathways, povetacicept could address the underlying immune dysfunction in IgAN, which is not directly targeted by current standard-of-care treatments that primarily focus on controlling blood pressure and proteinuria. This novel mechanism of action could be revolutionary in the management of IgAN if the phase 3 trials confirm efficacy and safety.Moreover, the monthly subcutaneous administration of povetacicept may offer a more convenient option for patients compared to current therapies, potentially improving adherence and outcomes. However, the long-term implications for kidney function and the impact on end-stage renal disease progression, a critical concern for IgAN patients, will need to be assessed in the forthcoming phase 3 studies. Biotech Market Analyst The advancement of povetacicept into phase 3 trials could have a notable impact on Alpine Immune Sciences' market positioning. IgAN, being a rare disease with limited effective treatment options, represents a high unmet medical need and a potentially lucrative market niche for novel therapies like povetacicept. The biotech sector often sees increased volatility around key clinical trial milestones and this announcement could lead to heightened investor interest in Alpine's stock.Market analysts will be closely monitoring the enrollment and progress of the phase 3 study, as well as any partnership or licensing deals that may arise as a result of these positive developments. The biotech industry values innovation, especially in areas of unmet need and Alpine's focus on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases places it in a high-growth potential market segment.Investors will also be interested in the broader implications of povetacicept's mechanism of action. If successful in IgAN, there may be potential for its application in other autoimmune diseases, which could significantly expand the drug's market potential. The company's strategic planning and execution of subsequent studies will be critical in determining its future valuation and market share. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM -- Povetacicept administered subcutaneously once every four weeks continues to be well tolerated in IgA nephropathy, with UPCR reductions of greater than 60% observed at 36 weeks, associated with remission, resolution of hematuria, and stable renal function (eGFR) -- -- Company reports successful end of phase 2 meeting with FDA, supporting advancement to a registrational, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of povetacicept in IgA nephropathy, targeted in 2H 2024 -- -- Company will host an investor call and webcast today at 5:15 pm ET -- SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALPN), a leading clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing innovative treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today shared updated clinical data for povetacicept in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) which will be presented as a late breaking poster at the World Congress of Nephrology (WCN) April 13-16, 2024 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240410724204/en/Figure 1. Povetacicept is Associated with Clinically Meaningful UPCR Reductions, Stable eGFR in IgA Nephropathy, and Reductions in Gd-IgA1 and Gd-IgA1/C3 Ratio (Graphic: Business Wire) Povetacicept is a potent dual antagonist of the BAFF (B cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation inducing ligand) cytokines, which play key roles in pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases via their roles in the activation, differentiation and/or survival of B cells, particularly antibody-secreting cells, as well as T cells and innate immune cells. RUBY-3 is a multiple ascending dose, multi-cohort, open label, phase 1b/2a study of povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis, including IgA nephropathy, where povetacicept is administered subcutaneously (SC) once every four weeks. Key Highlights Include: As of March 01, 2024, 41 patients with IgAN had received povetacicept 80 or 240 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Treatment with povetacicept 80 mg SC Q4W has been associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in proteinuria, with a 64.1% reduction from baseline in urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR; n=6) at 36 weeks, associated with stable renal function as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). At this same time, 4/6 (67%) had achieved remission, as defined as UPCR < 0.5 g/g, ≥50% reduction in UPCR from baseline, and stable renal function (≤ 25% reduction in eGFR from baseline). Resolution of hematuria, as defined as negative or trace/small hematuria in patients with non-negative/trace hematuria at baseline, was achieved in all (100%) patients with data available at 36 or more weeks (N=4). Treatment with povetacicept 240 mg SC Q4W has been associated with similar improvements in proteinuria, stable renal function, and remission, based on initial data through 12 (13 patients) and 24 (2 patients) weeks. Treatment with both doses was associated with significant reductions in the key disease-related biomarker Gd-IgA1, with the 80 mg dose achieving a 68.9% reduction at 40 weeks, and the 240 mg dose achieving a 78.6% reduction at 20 weeks. Both doses achieved reductions in IgA/C3 and Gd-IgA1/C3 ratios, which are additional severity and prognostic biomarkers in IgAN. Both doses have been well tolerated in IgAN, with no instances of IgG < 3 g/L and no severe infections. “These updated findings for povetacicept are highly promising and continue to support the potential for the program as an important new therapy in IgA nephropathy,” noted Jonathan Barratt, M.D., the Mayer Professor of Renal Medicine and Honorary Consultant Nephrologist and IgA Nephropathy Rare Disease Group Lead, University of Leicester. “The marked and clinically meaningful improvement in UPCR and stable eGFR observed with a monthly dosing regimen at 36 weeks are particularly impressive, as are the deep reductions in Gd-IgA1, a key disease-related biomarker, and resolution of hematuria in patients. The lack of serious adverse events with longer duration of treatment and higher dose is also notable and, together with povetacicept’s disease modifying potential and substantial patient experience, strongly supports the rapid advancement of povetacicept into a pivotal study for IgA nephropathy.” “Despite advancements in IgA nephropathy, there remains an urgent need for safe and convenient therapies that effectively treat the underlying cause of the disease,” said James Tumlin, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, Founder and CEO of NephroNet Clinical Trials Consortium. “Dual APRIL/BAFF inhibition is a potent inhibitor of Galactose Deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) production which is closely linked to the pathogenesis and progression of IgA nephropathy. Monthly administration of povetacicept has been shown to be well-tolerated at both the 80mg and 240 mg doses with clinical responses including Gd-IgA1, urine protein levels and eGFR stabilization within 3 months. These data strongly support the inhibition of APRIL/BAFF pathways by povetacicept and its efficacy in the treatment of IgAN as well as the need for further clinical development. If approved, povetacicept could be used a front-line disease modifying treatment in IgAN.” “These data indeed continue to further our enthusiasm for the potential of povetacicept in IgAN and other autoimmune diseases,” remarked Stanford Peng, MD PhD, President and Head of Research and Development at Alpine. “We are pleased to have completed our successful end of phase 2 meeting with FDA, enabling advancement to a registrational trial in IgAN (RAINIER) later this year. In addition, we plan to continue to explore povetacicept’s potential in multiple other autoimmune diseases via the ongoing RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 studies, and via the initiation of a phase 2 study (DENALI) in systemic lupus erythematosus later this year.” World Congress of Nephrology Late-Breaking Poster Date/Time: Monday, April 15, 2024, 5:45 pm local time (GMT-3) /4:45 pm ET/1:45 pm PT Poster Title: Updated Results from the RUBY-3 study of Povetacicept, an Enhanced Dual BAFF/APRIL Antagonist in IgA Nephropathy Poster Number: MON-304 Session Name: Poster Session 3 (Late Breaking) Location: Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer, Buenos Aires Convention Center, Buenos Aires, Argentina Presenter: James Tumlin, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, Founder and CEO of NephroNet Clinical Trials Consortium Alpine will host an investor call and webcast to discuss the data update as well as provide a corporate update.

About Povetacicept (ALPN-303) Povetacicept (ALPN-303) is a dual antagonist of the BAFF (B cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation inducing ligand) cytokines, which play key roles in pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases via their roles in the activation, differentiation and/or survival of B cells, particularly antibody-secreting cells, as well as T cells and innate immune cells. Based upon an engineered TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) domain, povetacicept has exhibited greater potency in preclinical studies versus other inhibitors of BAFF and/or APRIL alone and B cell depletion and has demonstrated initial activity in patients with IgA nephropathy. Povetacicept is in development for multiple autoimmune diseases, including IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune kidney diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune cytopenias. About RUBY-3 RUBY-3 (NCT05732402) is a multiple ascending dose, multi-cohort, open label, phase 1b/2 study of povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis, including IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and renal ANCA-associated vasculitis, where povetacicept is being administered subcutaneously for up to 104 weeks. Key endpoints include proteinuria, eGFR, renal response, and disease-related autoantibodies. About RUBY-4 RUBY-4 (NCT05757570) is a multi-cohort, open label study of povetacicept in autoimmune cytopenias, including immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease, where povetacicept is being administered subcutaneously for up to 48 weeks. Key endpoints include respective blood cell counts, durable responses, as well as disease-related autoantibodies.

Cellectis Publishes a Novel Intronic Gene Editing Approach For the Treatment of Inborn Metabolic Diseases by Edited HSPCs,2024-04-10T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Cellectis (NASDAQ: CLLS) announces a breakthrough in gene-editing therapy with the publication of a new research paper.

The study demonstrates the potential of TALEN-mediated intron editing in HSPCs for targeted transgene expression, offering new treatment possibilities for metabolic and neurological diseases. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent publication by Cellectis regarding TALEN-mediated intron editing represents a significant step forward in the field of gene therapy. The ability to direct transgene expression to the myeloid lineage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) offers a targeted approach to treating diseases. This specificity could potentially minimize off-target effects that are a common concern with broader gene-editing techniques.From a medical research perspective, the implications of this technology are vast. For inborn metabolic diseases, which often lack effective treatments, the ability to correct genetic abnormalities at the stem cell level could lead to long-term remission or even a cure. Moreover, the mention of potential applications for neurological diseases is particularly exciting. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been a significant obstacle for delivering therapeutics to the brain. If this gene-editing technique can be leveraged to overcome this barrier, it could open the door to novel treatments for a range of neurological conditions. Biotech Financial Analyst The announcement by Cellectis may have a noticeable impact on the company's financial outlook. Investors should pay attention to the potential for this technology to open up new markets in the treatment of inborn metabolic and neurological diseases. The specificity of the gene-editing platform could give Cellectis a competitive edge in the biotech industry, where precision medicine is increasingly valued.However, the path from publication to product is long and fraught with regulatory hurdles and clinical trials. Stakeholders should maintain a balanced view of the short-term versus long-term financial implications. In the immediate future, the costs associated with further research and development may weigh on earnings. Yet, if successful, the long-term payoff could be substantial, not only for Cellectis but also for patients and the healthcare system at large, which could see reduced burdens from chronic disease management. Healthcare Economist The healthcare industry is always in search of innovations that can lead to cost-effective treatments and Cellectis' research could be a step in that direction. The targeting of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for gene therapy has the potential to reduce long-term healthcare costs by providing curative treatments for diseases that currently require lifelong management.Moreover, the economic impact of treating neurological diseases extends beyond direct healthcare costs. These conditions often lead to loss of productivity and require social support systems. By potentially providing a one-time treatment that could alleviate or cure these conditions, the societal and economic benefits could be immense. It's important to recognize, however, that the adoption of such technologies will depend on their cost-effectiveness and accessibility to the broader population. 04/10/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis (the “Company”) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies, announced today the publication of a new research paper in Molecular Therapy, demonstrating that TALEN-mediated intron editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) enables transgene expression restricted to the myeloid lineage. This approach could unlock new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of inborn metabolic diseases as well as neurological diseases that require delivery of therapeutics to the brain. About HSPCs Gene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has enabled the treatment of multiple previously uncurable genetic diseases. Edited therapeutic HSPCs can engraft in the patient’s bone marrow, self-replicate, differentiate and populate other organs, propagating the therapeutic effects systemically and indefinitely after a single intervention. In this paper, Cellectis developed an intron-specific gene insertion strategy for HSPC, that restricts the expression of a therapeutic protein named IDUA to the myeloid lineage. Edited myeloid cells then act as a Trojan horse to vectorize IDUA across the blood brain barrier and thus, its delivery to the brain. This gene insertion strategy displays minimal genomic footprint and prevents the expression of IDUA by stem cells or other non-myeloid differentiated cells. It could potentially enable the development of efficient therapies for both metabolic and neurological disorders. “This novel TALEN® mediated-intron editing approach rewires the natural ability of myeloid cells to cross the blood brain barrier to efficiently vectorize a genetically encoded-therapeutic protein to the brain. In addition, by inserting the therapeutic transgene in an intronic region of the targeted gene, this approach preserves endogenous gene expression and thus, mitigates the common adverse events observed after gene insertion. This approach is, by essence, versatile and could be used to vectorize an array of therapeutic proteins to the brain and potentially address multiple neurological disorders,” commented Julien Valton, Ph.D., Vice President of Gene Therapy at Cellectis. Research data showed that: The CD11b intron-specific gene insertion approach efficiently restricts the expression of a desired transgene to the myeloid lineage, preventing its overexpression by stem cells or by other differentiated lineages. The insertion of an IDUA transgene in the first intron of the CD11b gene enables to express IDUA (the enzyme missing in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I patients), in a myeloid-specific manner without affecting CD11b endogenous expression. Edited HSPC exhibited robust engraftment in the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice, displayed multi-lineage differentiation in various hematopoietic tissues and showed significant presence in the brain as myeloid cells.

S&P Global conducted an external review of ESRT's Green Financing Framework, issuing a positive Second Party Opinion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of green senior unsecured notes by Empire State Realty Trust indicates a strategic move to diversify their funding sources and address sustainability goals. The interest rates, ranging from 7.20% to 7.41%, are relatively high, reflecting the current market conditions and possibly the creditworthiness of the issuer. Investors will likely scrutinize the alignment of the notes with the Green Bond Principles and the Second Party Opinion by S&P Global. The use of proceeds for repaying existing debt could improve the company's debt profile, but the impact on the balance sheet will depend on the terms of the debt being repaid compared to the new notes. Sustainability Analyst Empire State Realty Trust's commitment to sustainability is evident through their Green Financing Framework. The external review by S&P Global, resulting in a Second Party Opinion, adds credibility to their environmental claims. However, the actual environmental impact will hinge on the specific green projects funded by the net proceeds. Stakeholders should look for transparent reporting on these projects to assess the tangible outcomes of the company's sustainability initiatives. Legal Expert The private placement of notes, exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, suggests a targeted approach to fundraising, focusing on institutional investors. It's important to note that the unregistered nature of the offering limits its marketability, potentially affecting liquidity. Furthermore, the unconditional guarantee by the Company's subsidiaries is a common practice, providing additional security to the note holders and possibly affecting the subsidiaries' financial flexibility. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.

Prices AOMT 2024-4, a $300 Million Standalone Securitization, Further Expanding Earnings and Releasing Capital for Additional Loan Purchases Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. announces the pricing of AOMT 2024-4, a $300 million securitization backed by non-QM loans, expected to drive earnings growth and yield expansion. The deal lowers funding costs by over 100 basis points, releasing $40 million in capital for future loan purchases. Positive The pricing of AOMT 2024-4, a $300 million securitization backed by non-QM loans, is expected to drive earnings growth and yield expansion. The senior tranche of the securitization received an AAA rating from Fitch Ratings. The deal lowers the funding costs for the loans by over 100 basis points, releasing approximately $40 million in capital for future loan purchases. Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. intends to use the released capital to purchase additional high-quality current market coupon loans, improving net interest margin and positioning for future securitization transactions. The securitization will reduce the company's whole loan warehouse debt by $236 million, lowering the total recourse debt to equity ratio. AOMR plans to accelerate purchases of current market coupon loans with the capital released from the securitization, primarily through its affiliated mortgage originator. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent securitization by Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, involving a $300 million principal balance, is an astute financial maneuver that emphasizes the company's strategic focus on improving its net interest margin (NIM). By securing an AAA rating for the senior tranche from Fitch Ratings, the company not only solidifies the credibility of the securitization but also potentially lowers the cost of capital. The reduction of warehouse funding costs by over 100 basis points demonstrates a significant cost-saving initiative, which could enhance the company's profitability.Additionally, the strategy to reinvest the capital into purchasing current market coupon non-QM loans could yield a higher return on investment, given the current interest rate climate. This move indicates a proactive approach to asset management and an effort to optimize the company's loan portfolio amidst fluctuating interest rates. The retained economics of the unsold tranches also suggest a confidence in the long-term value of these assets, which could be beneficial for the company's balance sheet and appeal to investors seeking growth and stability. Market Research Analyst Angel Oak Mortgage REIT's engagement in non-QM loans is a notable strategy within the U.S. mortgage market. Non-QM loans cater to a specific segment of borrowers who do not meet the strict lending standards of traditional qualified mortgages. With a weighted average original FICO score of 748, the portfolio indicates a focus on relatively creditworthy borrowers, which could mitigate risk. Moreover, the decision to target a weighted average loan coupon of 7.4% to 8.5% reflects an aggressive pursuit of higher yields in a competitive market landscape.The company's intention to maintain a long-term recourse debt to equity ratio below 2.5x is a conservative financial posture that could reassure investors about the company's risk management practices. By balancing growth with financial prudence, Angel Oak Mortgage REIT is positioning itself to navigate through potential market volatilities while capitalizing on high-yielding opportunities. Credit Analyst From a credit perspective, the AAA rating assigned to the senior tranche of the securitization by Fitch Ratings is a strong endorsement of the quality of the underlying assets. This high rating is likely to attract institutional investors seeking investment-grade securities. The securitization also diversifies Angel Oak Mortgage REIT's funding sources and improves its liquidity profile by releasing capital tied up in whole loan warehouse debt.The reduction in the company's total recourse debt to equity ratio as a result of the securitization is a positive credit factor. It reflects a lower leverage level, which could lead to improved creditworthiness and potentially lower borrowing costs in the future. By retaining the economics of the unsold tranches, Angel Oak Mortgage REIT demonstrates its commitment to the performance of the securitized assets, which may be viewed favorably by credit rating agencies and debt investors alike. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM Securitization releases nearly $40 million of capital expected to be deployed into purchases of current market coupon loans and high-yielding assets to drive additional Net Interest Margin growth ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. (NYSE: AOMR), (the “Company,” “we,” and “our”), a leading real estate finance company focused on acquiring and investing in first-lien non-QM loans and other mortgage-related assets in the U.S. mortgage market, today announced the pricing of AOMT 2024-4, an approximately $300 million scheduled principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans, the majority of which were originated by Angel Oak’s affiliated mortgage originators. The senior tranche received an AAA rating from Fitch Ratings. “AOMT 2024-4, our first standalone securitization of the year, is expected to drive meaningful earnings growth and yield expansion in both the near- and long-term while further improving the positioning of our portfolio to perform in changing rate environments,” said Sreeni Prabhu, Chief Executive Officer and President of Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. “With this securitization, we will lock in over 100 basis points of savings on the funding costs of the loans underlying the deal. We intend to use the capital released by the securitization to continue to purchase additional high quality current market coupon non-QM loans, compounding the positive impact to our net interest margin on a go-forward basis and positioning ourselves well for future accretive securitization transactions.” Key Highlights and Updates AOMT 2024-4 includes a portfolio of 701 non-QM loans with a scheduled principal balance of $299.8 million with a weighted average loan coupon of 7.4%, a weighted average original loan-to-value ratio of 69.8%, and a weighted average original FICO score 748. The A1 through M1 tranches were sold, with the Company retaining the economics of the unsold tranches. The deal lowers the weighted average funding cost for the loans underlying the securitization by over 100 basis points compared to the warehouse funding cost prior to the securitization. With this securitization, the Company will reduce its whole loan warehouse debt by $236 million, reducing its total recourse debt to equity ratio in-kind. As new loans are purchased, recourse debt to equity will increase but is expected to remain below a recourse debt to equity ratio of 2.5x over the long-term. With the capital released from the securitization, AOMR intends to accelerate purchases of current market coupon loans, leveraging the Angel Oak ecosystem and purchasing new loans primarily through its affiliated mortgage originator. Recently-locked loans have an 8.0% – 8.5% weighted average coupon.

Stockholders to receive instructions from VStock Transfer,  for stock certificate exchange.","WiSA Technologies Announces Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary WiSA Technologies, Inc. (WISA) announces a 1-for-150 reverse stock split of its common stock, effective April 15, 2024, trading on Nasdaq Capital Market. Stockholders to receive instructions from VStock Transfer, for stock certificate exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of WiSA Technologies' 1-for-150 reverse stock split is a significant structural change that warrants attention from a financial perspective. Such a corporate action typically aims to boost the stock's market price, often to meet listing requirements or to attract a different investor base. A reverse stock split reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the price per share proportionally, without changing the company's market capitalization.For investors, this move can have mixed implications. On one hand, it could be perceived as a measure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, which might reflect underlying financial challenges. On the other hand, a higher share price could make the stock less volatile and more appealing to institutional investors who may avoid lower-priced stocks. It's important to monitor the stock's performance post-split to assess the market's reception of this action. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the reverse stock split by WiSA Technologies may signal a strategic pivot in the company's approach to market positioning. The wireless audio technology sector is competitive and maintaining a strong market presence is essential for attracting partnerships and investment. The reverse split could be interpreted as an effort to present the company as a more stable investment opportunity, potentially leading to increased interest from analysts and investors who prioritize stock price stability and quality over mere affordability.However, this action alone does not alter the fundamental value of the company or its technology's market potential. It will be important to evaluate subsequent financial reports and market performance to understand whether this structural change aligns with an improvement in the company's financial health and growth trajectory. Legal Expert Legally, the reverse stock split is a straightforward process that involves amending the company's certificate of incorporation and requires board approval, as well as compliance with state and federal securities laws. The new CUSIP number indicates a new identifier for the stock, which is a standard procedure following such a corporate action. Shareholders should be aware that while the mechanics of the reverse split are handled by the company's transfer agent and no action is typically required on their part, the impact on the value of their investment is subject to market forces.It's also important to note that reverse stock splits can sometimes lead to temporary confusion and fluctuations in the market as investors adjust to the new price levels. The legal team's execution in communicating and implementing this change is critical to ensure a smooth transition for shareholders and to maintain compliance with regulatory standards. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM BEAVERTON, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WiSA Technologies, Inc.

Taylor Bank (the ""Bank""), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

Thompson commented, ""Net income increased to $13.5 million in 2023 as compared to $11.8 million in 2022. Loan growth accompanied with higher yields on investment securities resulted in a $4.0 million or 15.2% increase in net interest income. The combined effect of the increase in net income and the decrease in total assets increased Return on Average Assets (ROAA) to 1.52% in 2023, as compared to 1.27% in 2022, and ranked 5th highest among the 24 banks and thrifts headquartered in Maryland in 2023, regardless of asset size. The Company's financial condition remained strong in 2023. Total assets were $853.0 million at December 31, 2023, which was a decrease of $53.0 million as compared to December 31, 2022. The decrease in total assets was directly attributable to a decrease in deposits, which decreased $65.8 million as compared to the prior year. After several years of significant deposit growth, the outflow of deposits was anticipated due to elevated short-term interest rates. While the bank remains highly liquid, deposit outflow reports revealed that rate sensitive deposits moved primarily into short-term bond investments. Despite continued deposit outflow, on-balance sheet liquidity was 24.2% as of December 31, 2023 and the Bank continued to have no need to access other non-core funding sources to meet loan demand and other obligations. We continue to remain highly liquid and well-capitalized, and very well-positioned to meet the loan and deposit needs of our loyal existing, and prospective customers.""Year to Date Results of Operations Net income was $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.7 million or 14.6%.

The Federal Reserve Bank increased the federal funds rate an additional 150 bps since December 15, 2022, which has increased yields on debt securities, federal funds sold, and loans. Organic loan growth combined with higher yields increased interest revenue from loans by $5.7 million or 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. Interest revenue from debt securities and federal funds sold increased by $2.6 million or 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. Costs of interest-bearing deposits increased by 82 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year. The Bank increased deposit rates over the last 12 months to remain competitive in local markets and to preserve on-balance sheet liquidity. Deposit interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $4.2 million or 265.9%, as compared to the prior year.On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the CECL model pursuant to ASU 2016-13. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical information, current information, and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The provision for credit losses of $280 thousand recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of growth in the loan portfolio during the same period. The economic indicators and related forecasts utilized in the CECL model have not changed significantly since adoption.Noninterest income for year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $59 thousand or 2.0%, as compared to the prior year, due to a decrease in income from bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies and annuities. BOLI and annuity income decreased $222 thousand or 54.2% in 2023, as compared to 2022. Increases in other sources of noninterest income including gain on transfer of other real estate owned and deposit network placement fees partially offset the decrease in noninterest income associated with BOLI and annuity income.Noninterest expense increased by $1.9 million or 14.0% in 2023, as compared to the prior year, and relates to increases in employee salaries, employee benefits expenses, data processing costs, and deposit insurance premiums assessed by the FDIC. Higher salaries expense relates to the fulfillment of open positions and higher salaries paid to remain competitive in the current labor market and resulted in a 6.7% increase in salaries expense in 2023, as compared to the prior year. Employee health insurance is a partially self-funded plan and claims incurred by the plan were higher in 2023, resulting in a $636 thousand or 39.0% increase in employee benefits costs in 2023, as compared to 2022. Claims incurred by the plan in the prior year were well below average and resulted in lower expenses during this period. Deposit insurance premiums increased by $146k or 58.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, and is the result of a change in the assessment of FDIC deposit insurance premiums effective January 1, 2023. The Bank is subject to the FDIC's base assessment rate due to strong capital levels and other regulatory risk measurements. The changes implemented by the FDIC resulted in the increase of the base assessment rate from 3 bps to 5 bps, which is a 66.6% increase.Per share data and repurchases of stock by the Company for each period is included in the following table.

The Federal Reserve Bank increased the federal funds rate an additional 150 bps since December 15, 2022, which has increased the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 0.55% in 4Q22 to 1.38% in 4Q23. The Bank increased deposit rates over the last 12 months to remain competitive in local markets and to preserve on-balance sheet liquidity. Increases in interest revenue from loans and investments in 4Q23, as compared to 4Q22, partially offset the higher deposit interest expense. Net interest income decreased $437 thousand or 5.5% in 4Q23, as compared to the prior quarter, due to seasonal decreases in noninterest bearing deposits and migration of other deposits into higher yielding money market and CD products. Yields on earning-assets increased to 4.43% in 4Q23, as compared to 3.77% in 4Q22, and 4.34% in the prior quarter.On January 1, 2023 the Company adopted the current expected credit losses (""CECL"") model pursuant to ASU 2016-13. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical information, current information, and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The negative provision for credit losses of $60 thousand recorded in 4Q23 was primarily the result of improvement in loan risk ratings within the loan portfolio. No significant changes in the economic indicators and related forecasts utilized in the CECL model occurred in 4Q23. The negative provision for credit losses of $170 thousand in 4Q22 and $80 thousand in 3Q23 was the result of recoveries of loans previously charged off.Noninterest income increased in 4Q23 by $172 thousand or 94.1%, as compared to 4Q22, due to a $148 thousand decrease in realized losses on sale of debt securities. Realized losses were $509 thousand in 4Q23 and $657 thousand in 4Q22 related to the sale of lower-yielding debt securities at a loss with proceeds reinvested into new securities or fund loans at substantially higher yields to maximize future interest revenue. Noninterest income decreased in 4Q23 by $538 thousand or 60.3%, as compared to the prior quarter, due to an increase of $425 thousand in realized losses on sale of debt securities and a decrease in gain on the transfer of other real estate owned by $92 thousand.Noninterest expense increased by $460 thousand or 11.2% in 4Q23, as compared to 4Q22, and relates to increases in employee salaries, employee benefits expenses, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Higher salaries expense relates to the fulfillment of open positions and higher salaries paid to remain competitive in the current labor market and resulted in a 5.0% increase in salaries expense in 4Q23, as compared to 4Q22. Employee health insurance is provided through a partially self-funded plan and claims incurred by the plan were higher in 4Q23, resulting in the increase in employee benefits costs by 21.9%, as compared to 4Q22. Deposit insurance premiums increased by $26k or 39.0% in 4Q23, as compared to the same period last year, and is the result of a change in the FDIC assessment calculation effective January 1, 2023. Noninterest expense increased in 4Q23 by $857 thousand or 23.2%, as compared to the previous quarter, which primarily relates to higher salaries and employee benefits expenses. Employee benefits expense increased $319 thousand, or 69.9%, due to higher claims incurred by the plan in the current quarter. Salaries expense increased $475 thousand, or 30.0%, due to yearend bonuses and contributions to the employee 401K plan based on profit sharing.Quarterly per share data and repurchases of stock by the Company for each period is included in the following table. The stock repurchase plan previously adopted by the Board of Directors remains in place and as of December 31, 2023 has 53,436 shares available for repurchase.

Significant increases in short term interest rates have encourage certain depositors to invest excess cash into short term government bonds resulting in a decrease in deposits. The Bank operates with a high level of core deposits, defined by banking regulators as checking, money market, and savings accounts plus any time deposits less than $250,000. Bank failures earlier this year have increased the focus on concentrations of uninsured deposits. All deposit accounts with a balance in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 are disclosed on quarterly regulatory reports filed with bank regulators. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had deposit accounts with balances in excess of $250,000 totaling $187.4 million, which represents 25.2% of total deposits, as compared to $258.9 million or 32.0% as of December 31, 2022 and $236.4 million or 29.6% of total deposits as of September 30, 2023. The Company did not experience any significant outflow of uninsured deposits during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Bank is a member of the IntraFi Network which enables large depositors access to multi-million dollar FDIC insurance for funds placed into the network and provides an equal amount of reciprocal deposits under FDIC insurance limits to the bank. Recent events in the banking industry led to an increase in usage of the IntraFi Network by existing and new customers. Reciprocal deposits from the IntraFi Network were $102.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $82.8 million and $94.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, respectively.On-balance sheet liquidity, as measured by cash and unencumbered available for sale debt securities, remains strong as of December 31, 2023 and equaled 24.2% of total deposits. Selected liquidity metrics are summarized in the table below.

As of December 31, 2023, the Bank has the ability to borrow up to $205.4 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank (""FHLB"") that would require pledging of loans and/or debt securities as collateral. Debt securities currently pledged are collateral for public deposits.Loans and Asset QualityIncreasing interest rates, economic uncertainty and other factors are influencing current loan demand as compared to demand experienced in previous years. Loan growth of $62.5 million or 12.2% in the previous 12 months was the result of strong demand for local real estate and borrowers seeking to lock in lower interest rates as the Federal Reserve engaged in aggressive interest rate increases. Growth in the loan portfolio during the rising interest rate environment over the last 12 months along with variable rate loans within the portfolio has expanded the yield on loans from 4.61% in 4Q22 to 5.08% in 4Q23. Loan yields increased 15 bps in 4Q23 as compared to 3Q23.Loan performance has remained strong over the past 12 months as local economic conditions have remained stable. Inflation and higher interest rates have not resulted in a deterioration of credit quality as of December 31, 2023. Past due loans have remained stable and were 0.45% of total loans as of December 31, 2023, as compared to 0.46% as of December 31, 2022 and 0.49% as of September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses increased from 0.51% of total loans as of December 31, 2022 to 0.56% of total loans as of December 31, 2023, which related to adoption of the CECL model pursuant to ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of the CECL model resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $826 thousand. Selected asset quality metrics are summarized in the table below.

AVITA Medical Updates Expected First Quarter 2024 Revenue,2024-04-10T21:11:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"AVITA Medical Updates Expected Commercial Revenue for Q1 2024, Reaffirms Full-Year Guidance","AVITA Medical Updates Expected First Quarter 2024 Revenue Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary AVITA Medical Updates Expected Commercial Revenue for Q1 2024, Reaffirms Full-Year Guidance Positive AVITA Medical revises Q1 2024 revenue guidance to US$11.0-11.3 million, below previous guidance of US$14.8-15.6 million. Full-year 2024 revenue expected at the lower end of US$78.5-84.5 million range. Challenges in new account conversions for expanded label of full-thickness skin defects cited as reason for revenue revision. 73 new accounts added since June 2023, with 71 submissions in evaluation stage as of March 31, 2024. Slower-than-expected conversion rate attributed to complexity of closing new accounts for product approved for multiple indications. AVITA Medical intensifying efforts to drive growth despite Q1 challenges. Company remains optimistic to meet lower end of annual revenue guidance range. Financial results for Q1 2024 to be reported on May 13, 2024, with a conference call scheduled on the same day. Negative Q1 2024 revenue guidance revised downward due to slower-than-expected conversion rate of new accounts. Projected approval rate of 15 new accounts per month not met, impacting revenue expectations. Challenges in VAC process and timelines affecting account approvals. Despite efforts to drive growth, slower approval pace than anticipated remains a concern. Full-year revenue expected at lower end of guidance range, indicating potential challenges ahead. Financial Analyst AVITA Medical's announcement regarding its Q1 2024 revenue falling below initial projections raises concerns about the company's short-term performance. The downward revision from $14.8-$15.6 million to $11.0-$11.3 million suggests a significant shortfall, which may be indicative of operational challenges. Investors should be aware that such a shortfall could lead to volatility in the company's stock price as the market reacts to this unexpected development.It's important to note that the slower conversion rate of new accounts, particularly for the expanded label of full-thickness skin defects, is a critical factor to consider. The complexity of closing new accounts for multiple indications might be resulting in longer sales cycles than anticipated. This could imply that AVITA Medical's sales strategy and market penetration efforts require refinement to better address the needs and decision-making processes of prospective clients.Despite these challenges, the company's reaffirmation of its full-year revenue guidance suggests confidence in its product pipeline and market strategy. The launches of PermeaDerm and RECELL GO could potentially catalyze revenue growth in the coming quarters. However, investors should monitor the company's ability to convert its robust prospecting pipeline into actual sales, as this will be important for meeting the lower end of the annual guidance. Market Research Analyst The regenerative medicine industry is marked by high growth potential and AVITA Medical's focus on wound care management and skin restoration positions it within a niche yet expanding market. The company's mention of a 'robust prospecting pipeline' and active submissions in the VAC process indicates a strong market demand for their products. However, the slower-than-expected approval rate points to a possible disconnect between product offerings and market readiness or the effectiveness of the company’s engagement with the VAC process.Understanding the VAC process is important for companies like AVITA Medical, as it is a common hurdle in the healthcare sector that can significantly delay product uptake. The company's deeper understanding of this process, as mentioned by the CEO, could be a positive sign for future sales execution. However, the true test will be in their ability to navigate these complexities more efficiently moving forward and to shorten the sales cycle for their innovative products. Medical Industry Analyst AVITA Medical's focus on regenerative medicine for wound care and skin restoration is a response to a growing need in the healthcare sector. The expanded label for full-thickness skin defects represents a significant advancement, but the slow conversion rate highlights the challenges associated with introducing innovative medical solutions into the healthcare market.It's essential to consider the clinical and economic value proposition when introducing new medical devices. The VAC process, which evaluates the value of medical products, can be stringent, as committees critically assess the impact on patient outcomes and cost savings. AVITA's current situation underscores the importance of aligning product benefits with the expectations and requirements of healthcare providers. The company's ability to effectively communicate the value of its products and navigate the VAC process will be key to its success in converting submissions into sales. 04/10/2024 - 05:11 PM VALENCIA, Calif., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: RCEL, ASX: AVH), a commercial-stage regenerative medicine company focused on first-in-class devices for wound care management and skin restoration, today announced an update to its expected commercial revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and reaffirmed expectations for full-year 2024 revenue at the lower end of the previously provided guidance of US$78.5 million to US$84.5 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, AVITA Medical now expects commercial revenue to be in the range of US$11.0 million to US$11.3 million. This range is below the previously provided revenue guidance of US$14.8 million to US$15.6 million. The revision in guidance is attributable to a slower-than-expected conversion rate of new accounts for our expanded label of full-thickness skin defects. Since the launch of the full-thickness skin defects expanded label in June 2023 through the quarter ended March 31, 2024, AVITA Medical has added 73 new accounts, including 22 new accounts in the first quarter. In addition to the new accounts, there are 71 submissions in the evaluation or decision stage of the value analysis committee (VAC) process as of March 31, 2024. However, the projected approval rate was 15 new accounts per month, for an expected total of 135 new accounts by March 31, 2024. The slower-than-expected conversion rate is attributable to the complexity of closing a new account for a product that is approved for multiple indications. Despite this, the number of submissions active in the VAC process and robust prospecting pipeline continue to reflect significant potential for new account approvals, albeit at a slower approval pace than originally anticipated. ""In light of the challenges encountered in the first quarter of 2024, we are intensifying our efforts to drive growth,"" said Jim Corbett, Chief Executive Officer of AVITA Medical. ""While our account conversion rate impacted our quarterly revenue, we remain optimistic for the full year. With the recent launch of PermeaDerm in March and the upcoming launch of RECELL GO, along with our deeper understanding of the VAC processes and timelines, we believe that we will meet the lower end of our previously provided annual revenue guidance range of US$78.5 million to US$84.5 million. We remain committed to delivering value and making a positive impact on the lives of our patients."" AVITA Medical plans to report its financial results for the first quarter 2024 after the close of the U.S. financial markets on Monday, May 13, 2024. A conference call and webcast are scheduled for that day at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 6:30 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time) to discuss its results in further detail.

Artesian Water Company Prepared to Fully Comply with EPA’s New PFAS Drinking Water Standard,2024-04-10T20:26:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Artesian Water Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Artesian Resources  (Nasdaq: ARTNA), is well-prepared to meet the EPA's new drinking water standard for PFAS contamination.

Artesian has been proactive in monitoring and treating PFAS, ensuring levels are below EPA's health advisory.","Artesian Water Company Prepared to Fully Comply with EPA’s New PFAS Drinking Water Standard Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Artesian Water Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Artesian Resources (Nasdaq: ARTNA), is well-prepared to meet the EPA's new drinking water standard for PFAS contamination. They have already installed treatment at ten facilities and plan to install at three more in 2024. Artesian has been proactive in monitoring and treating PFAS, ensuring levels are below EPA's health advisory. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst Artesian Water Company's initiative to address PFAS contamination ahead of the EPA's new regulations reflects proactive environmental governance. By installing treatment facilities early, the firm is mitigating future compliance risk and positioning itself as a leader in environmental stewardship within the utility sector. This strategy not only ensures regulatory compliance but also enhances public trust and corporate reputation, which can translate to customer loyalty and potentially a competitive advantage. The long-term foresight demonstrated by Artesian could also result in cost savings relative to peers who may face rushed compliance efforts as the 2029 deadline approaches.It is noteworthy that the company has been involved in multi-district class action settlements, which may signal a broader industry trend of holding contaminators financially accountable. This could introduce a new dynamic in the utility industry, wherein companies may increasingly seek compensation for environmental remediation costs. The financial implications of such settlements are complex and could range from offsetting remediation costs to impacting operational expenses, depending on the outcome of litigation and the extent of contamination. Financial Analyst Artesian's early investment in PFAS treatment facilities is a strategic move that may have significant financial implications. On the one hand, these upfront capital expenditures could strain short-term financials, potentially affecting profit margins and earnings per share. On the other hand, by proactively addressing PFAS contamination, Artesian may avoid future fines, reduce potential litigation costs and minimize the disruption associated with retrofitting facilities closer to the regulatory deadline. Investors should monitor the balance between these upfront costs and the long-term benefits, including the potential financial relief from the class action settlements.However, the statement that there is 'no assurance' settlements will fully offset the costs is a cautionary note for investors, indicating potential future financial exposure. The market's response to this news may depend on the perceived adequacy of Artesian's provisions for these costs and the company's ability to recover them through settlements or rate adjustments. Transparency in financial reporting regarding these liabilities will be critical for investor confidence. Water Quality Expert The presence of PFAS in drinking water is a growing public health concern and the EPA's forthcoming MCL will set a precedent for water utilities nationwide. Artesian's early actions to install treatment systems demonstrate an understanding of the health implications associated with PFAS exposure. The technology to detect and treat PFAS at lower levels is a significant advancement in protecting public health. By ensuring that PFAS levels in their water systems were below the EPA's health advisory level even before the establishment of a formal MCL, Artesian is prioritizing customer safety and health.This foresight may reduce health-related complaints and liabilities, which can be substantial in the utility industry. Furthermore, the involvement in class action settlements suggests that Artesian is not only taking steps to mitigate the issue but is also actively seeking recourse for the contamination, which could influence industry practices on managing and financing environmental health risks. 04/10/2024 - 04:26 PM NEWARK, Del., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artesian Water Company, Inc. (Artesian), a subsidiary of Artesian Resources Corporation (Nasdaq: ARTNA), a leading provider of water services on the Delmarva Peninsula, announced that it is well-prepared to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) new drinking water standard that sets a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The MCL is expected to be effective in 2029. Artesian has installed treatment for PFAS at ten of its facilities to date, and expects to install treatment at three more facilities in 2024. Artesian began its efforts to treat for PFAS a decade ago, well before EPA’s action to set a final drinking water standard. With advances in technology, PFAS now can be detected at significantly lower levels, allowing for enhanced monitoring capabilities and better identification of sources requiring treatment. While awaiting EPA’s determination of an MCL for PFAS in drinking water, during the past decade Artesian ensured levels of PFAS in its water systems were below the EPA’s health advisory level, EPA’s only prior available guidance. Additionally, Artesian is among the claimants in two multi-district class action settlements designed to resolve claims for PFAS contamination in public drinking water systems. The settlements are intended to hold accountable those responsible for the PFAS contamination of water supplies for the costs of treatment. There is no assurance, however, that the settlements will completely offset the additional costs incurred to date or into the future. “Artesian’s priority is the provision of safe, reliable water to customers. We have been at the forefront of efforts to monitor for PFAS and proactive in the installation of treatment based on the guidance available prior to EPA’s action to establish a final drinking water standard. We also believe in holding to account those responsible for the contamination of water supplies, reducing the financial burden otherwise shouldered by customers,” said Nicki Taylor, President of Artesian Water Company, Inc. About PFASPFAS are a group of manufactured chemicals used since the 1940s to produce many common household and commercial products. Products that may have contained PFAS include firefighting foams, stain repellents, non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers, popcorn bags and pizza boxes. PFAS persist in the environment, thus sometimes characterized as “forever chemicals,” and over time find their way into sources of drinking water supply. About Artesian Water CompanyArtesian Water Company is the oldest and largest regulated water utility on the Delmarva Peninsula and has been providing water service since 1905. Artesian supplies 8.8 billion gallons of water per year through 1,470 miles of main to over a third of Delawareans. Contact:Virginia EisenbreyCommunications(302) 453-6900veisenbrey@artesianwater.com What is Artesian Water Company's ticker symbol? The ticker symbol for Artesian Water Company is ARTNA. How many facilities has Artesian installed PFAS treatment at? Artesian has installed treatment for PFAS at ten facilities. Who is the President of Artesian Water Company, Inc.? Nicki Taylor is the President of Artesian Water Company, Inc. What is the EPA's new drinking water standard for PFAS?

The company raised its Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA target to $105-115 million, excluding certain expenses, due to increased demand in power generation, environmental technologies, and renewable energy projects.

Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA target raised to $105-115 million, excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses. Increased pipeline and recent contract awards reflect growing global demand for power generation, upgrades, environmental technologies, and renewable energy projects. Successful signing of a $246 million gas conversion project and multiple projects in Environmental, Renewable, and Thermal segments ranging from $5-20 million each. Optimism and confidence in the company's future performance based on new contract wins and increased EBITDA guidance. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises of a significant increase in contract signings and awards represents a strong indicator of the company's financial growth and market competitiveness. The doubling of the value of contracts year-over-year not only showcases the company's ability to attract substantial new business but also suggests a robust demand for their services in power generation, environmental technologies and renewable energy projects. The upward adjustment of the Adjusted EBITDA target for the full year 2024 to $105 million to $115 million indicates management's confidence in the company's operational efficiency and profitability. Investors should note that Adjusted EBITDA is a critical metric used to assess a company's underlying operational performance by excluding non-recurring items such as BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses.The market may react positively to this news, as it implies that B&W is not only growing but also potentially improving its margin profile. However, it's important to monitor the company's ability to deliver on these contracts and maintain cost controls to achieve the increased EBITDA target. Additionally, the exclusion of BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses may warrant a closer look to understand the full impact of these projects on the company's financials. Energy Sector Analyst Babcock & Wilcox's focus on environmental technologies and renewable and hydrogen energy projects aligns with global trends towards sustainable energy solutions. The mention of a $246 million gas conversion project alongside several other high-value projects indicates a strategic positioning within the energy sector that could offer long-term benefits. Given the increasing regulatory pressures and incentives for clean energy, B&W's portfolio diversification into renewables could provide a hedge against volatility in traditional energy markets.Investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with the rapid scaling of operations and the execution of large-scale projects. The energy sector is highly regulated and any changes in policy or delays in project implementation could affect projected revenues and EBITDA targets. Furthermore, the transition towards sustainable technologies often requires significant R&D investment, which could impact short-term margins despite the promise of long-term gains. Market Research Analyst The significant increase in contract signings indicates a growing market share for Babcock & Wilcox within the industrial and utility sectors. Their ability to secure a range of projects with values from $5 million to $20 million each suggests a versatile business model capable of catering to diverse customer needs. This versatility is a competitive advantage that can lead to a more resilient revenue stream.Understanding the market dynamics and the competitive landscape is important for investors. B&W's growth trajectory should be compared with industry peers to gauge whether this performance is an outlier or in line with sector trends. Additionally, the anticipated impact on fourth quarter 2024 results highlights the importance of monitoring the company's quarterly performance to track progress toward achieving the revised EBITDA targets. 04/10/2024 - 04:52 PM B&W’s 2024 contract signings and awards are approximately $500 million year-to-date, nearly double the amount in the same period last year Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA target increased to $105 million to $115 million, excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses AKRON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (""B&W"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: BW) announced today that year-to-date signed contracts and awards total approximately $500 million, nearly doubling the total value achieved during the same period in 2023. As a result, the Company has increased its Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA target to $105 million to $115 million excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses, an increase from its previous guidance of $100 million to $110 million, excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™ expenses. “We believe that the global industrial and utility customers’ growing needs for increased and secure power generation, upgrades and enhancements, environmental technologies and renewable and hydrogen energy projects are reflected in our increased pipeline and recent contract awards,” said Kenneth Young, B&W’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition to our recently awarded $246 million gas conversion project, our Environmental, Renewable and Thermal segments also have received several projects with values ranging from $5 million to $20 million each. These are projects with solid margins which should impact our fourth quarter 2024 results and beyond.” “As a result of these signings and commitments, we have increased our guidance to $105 million to $115 million in adjusted EBITDA, not including BrightLoop and ClimateBright expenses,” Young added. “Our success with winning a significant number of new contracts in the first 10 weeks of 2024, as well as our decision to increase our Full-Year 2024 EBITDA target, reflects our optimism about the successful execution of our revised business strategy and the overall strength of our business.” “While risks are inherent in any project execution, our project performance continues to improve each quarter as we maneuver through challenges including global business conditions and supply chain and shipping pressures,” he said. “Through our operational improvements, we continue to mitigate risks on various projects and are focused on higher margin and higher quality projects across all of our businesses, and we expect to continue to see the impact of these improvements starting in Q4 2024 and beyond.” About Babcock & Wilcox Headquartered in Akron, Ohio, Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. is a leader in energy and environmental products and services for power and industrial markets worldwide.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For a more complete discussion of these risk factors, see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. If one or more of these risks or other risks materialize, actual results may vary materially from those expressed.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate its performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, the Company believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting its financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company introduced the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because of the increasing importance of BrightLoop and ClimateBright to the future growth of the Company. Management uses EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright to assess the Company’s performance independent of these technologies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis is defined as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each of the segments, further adjusted for corporate allocations and research and development costs. At a segment level, the Adjusted EBITDA presented is consistent with the way the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business and is calculated as earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization adjusted for items such as gains or losses arising from the sale of non-income producing assets, net pension benefits, restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, costs related to financial consulting, research and development costs and other costs that may not be directly controllable by segment management and are not allocated to the segment. The Company presents consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the ongoing, operating performance before corporate overhead and other expenses not attributable to the operating performance of the Company's revenue generating segments. This release also presents certain targets for the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA in the future; these targets are not intended as guidance regarding how the Company believes the business will perform. The Company is unable to reconcile these targets to their GAAP counterparts without unreasonable effort and expense.

The acquisition brings expertise in various housing sectors and strengthens Stewart's position in the title services industry.","Stewart Grows Commercial and Affordable Housing Presence with Acquisition of All New York Title Agency, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Stewart Information Services acquires All New York Title Agency, Inc., bolstering National Commercial Services in New York and expanding into Affordable Housing services. The acquisition brings expertise in various housing sectors and strengthens Stewart's position in the title services industry. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of All New York Title Agency by Stewart Information Services Corporation represents a strategic move to bolster its National Commercial Services and expand into the Affordable Housing sector. This sector is often characterized by complex transactions and a stable demand due to the ongoing need for housing solutions that are accessible to lower-income populations. From a market perspective, the deal could enhance Stewart's competitive positioning in New York, a key market with high transaction volumes and values.Examining the potential market impact, this move may signal a bullish outlook for Stewart's growth trajectory, particularly within niche markets that may be less sensitive to economic downturns. The focus on Affordable Housing could also align with government incentives and social impact investment trends, potentially opening up new revenue streams and partnerships. However, it's important to monitor how effectively Stewart integrates All New York's operations and leverages its expertise to capitalize on these opportunities. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the acquisition's success hinges on Stewart Information Services Corporation's ability to realize synergies and enhance its service offerings in the high liability Affordable Housing market. The deal's financial terms were not disclosed, but the investment must be weighed against the expected returns from the Affordable Housing sector. The Affordable Housing market often involves complex financing structures, which could lead to higher margins if managed effectively.Investors should consider the short-term costs associated with the acquisition, such as integration expenses, against the potential long-term benefits of expanded market share and diversified revenue sources. Additionally, the Affordable Housing sector's resilience to economic fluctuations could provide a stable cash flow, but this depends on Stewart's ability to maintain All New York's strong reputation and client relationships post-acquisition. Legal Expert Legally, the acquisition of a title agency like All New York Title Agency involves due diligence on regulatory compliance, especially in a complex market like New York. The Affordable Housing sector is heavily regulated, involving federal, state and local housing laws, as well as intricate financing mechanisms like tax credits and bond enhancements. Ensuring compliance and managing legal risks will be important for Stewart to avoid potential liabilities.Moreover, the expertise of All New York in handling sophisticated transactions with multiple layers of financing and legal considerations presents a valuable asset for Stewart. The ability to navigate these legal complexities not only serves as a competitive advantage but also mitigates the risk of costly legal disputes that could arise from transactional errors or oversight. 04/10/2024 - 05:00 PM Acquisition Strengthens National Commercial Services’ Position in New York and creates a platform for National Affordable Housing Services HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stewart Information Services Corporation today announced the acquisition of the All New York Title Agency, Inc.

Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 05:22 PM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 10, 2024) - Lode Gold Resources Inc. (TSXV: LOD) (OTCQB: SBMIF) (""Lode Gold"" or the ""Company"" formerly Stratabound Minerals Corp.) is pleased to announce that it has retained the services of Carlos Saban, an exploration and mine development geologist to review the Company's Fremont Gold Project (Fremont) and to develop a geological model for a potential high-grade underground gold mine. Carlos Saban is skilled in re-interpreting complex mineralized systems. By carefully studying previously mined grades, re-analyzing cut-offs, and gaining new understanding of mineralization, structural and lithological controls, he has been able to systematically expand and upgrade resources in multiple brownfield projects, including work at the Uchucchacua and Recuperada districts, two of the top silver districts in Peru. Carlos has been involved in the identification, delineation, and modelling of several NI 43-101 mineral resource updates, including PEA- and PFS-compliant multi-million-ounce precious metal deposits during his career.Lode Gold has tasked Carlos to investigate Fremont as a potential high-grade underground mine. He will focus on understanding the mineralized veins and ore shoot plunges. This analysis will enable Lode Gold to better define brownfield exploration targets. He will also review Fremont's open-pit model, historical underground workings, previously mined grades, level plans and sections, sampling and production records, and drill hole data base to establish the structural controls of high-grade gold mineralization at Fremont and to generate exploration targets extending beyond the limits of the current published resource. Fremont began operations in or around 1860, with documented production of at least 125,825 ounces of gold at an average grade of 8 g/t Au. It was one of the many gold mines that was closed during the 1942 prohibition on gold mining due to World War II. At that time, gold was less than USD $40/Oz. Inevitably, the mine became a small-scale operation focused on high-grade (165 t/d). When the mine was shuttered by the government, Fremont was ramping up production and executing an extensive exploration program of the main Pine Tree and Josephine veins through drifting and underground diamond drilling. Work was focused on just two of the five known deposits.Lode Gold acquired Fremont in an all-share transaction in August 2021. Since then, the company has increased the Indicated resource by +125% and the Inferred resource by +456%; the Project currently hosts an NI 43-101 resource of 1.16 Moz at 1.90 g/t Au within 19.0 MT Indicated, and 2.02 Moz at 2.22 g/t Au within 28.3 MT Inferred. At a sensitivity to the March 31, 2023 PEA at USD $2,000/oz gold, the Project has an after-tax NPV(5%) of USD $370MM and a 31% IRR over an 11-year LOM.The NI 43-101 compliant resource includes the Pine Tree – Josephine and Queen Specimen deposits and extends along 1,400 metres of combined strike, which represents only 35% of the property length. This work envisioned mining the resource using open pit methods. Of note, currently the project mainly encompasses the upper levels which are less than 200 metres deep; this constitutes ~35% of that deposit. Specifically, areas of opportunities exist untapped below 200 metres, extending to 500 metres. Three step-out holes hit the mineralized structure, including a 1,200-m wildcat drill hole. This is consistent with typical orogenic deposits that have structure and control at depth such as La Ronde (Agnico-Eagle), Hemlo (Barrick), and Homestake (Dakota Gold).FREMONT HIGHLIGHTS100%-owned, 3,351 acres of private landLocated on the Mother Lode Belt (50,000,000 ounces produced)Located in Mariposa County, site of the original Gold RushExcellent site infrastructure with hydro sub-station, highway access and proximity to airports and seaportsHistorical mine production at 8 g/t Au23 km of underground mine workingsOnly two of five known deposits have been exploitedMining operation suspended due to War in 1942NI 43-101 MRE evaluates only 1.4 km of the 4 km strike length (35%)At a sensitivity to the March 31, 2023 PEA at USD $2,000/oz gold, the Project has an after-tax NPV(5%) of USD $370MM and a 31% IRR over an 11-year LOM Depth potential with three step-out holes hit the mineralized structureJon Hill, Director and Chair of Lode Gold's Technical Committee commented, ""There is no doubt that Fremont is a significant gold deposit with material upside potential. Globally, there are not many examples for orogenic gold deposits whereby upwards of 2 Moz of Mineral Resource can be optimized within a single pit as Lode Gold's published 2023 PEA demonstrates. Carlos' data review of historical data aims to identify structurally controlled, plunging high-grade targets typical of these orogenic systems, beyond the current mineral resource limits. Supporting this thesis is the grade of 8 g/t Au attributed to historical production up to when the mine was shuttered in 1942 due to World War II. We are looking forward to demonstrating the potential for a multi-million-ounce high-grade deposit to compliment the large open pit mineable resources already in hand."" ABOUT LODE GOLDLode Gold is a Canadian exploration and development company with grassroots and advanced exploration properties in highly prospective and safe mining jurisdictions.Its Golden Culvert and Win Projects, Yukon, covering 99.5 km2 across a 27-km strike length, are situated in a district-scale, high-grade-gold-mineralized trend within the southern portion of the Tombstone Gold Belt. Gold deposits and occurrences within the Belt include Fort Knox, Pogo, Brewery Creek and Dublin Gulch, and Snowline Gold's Valley target on its Rogue property in the Selwyn Basin.Its McIntyre Brook Project, New Brunswick, covering 120 km2 and a 17-km strike length in the emerging Triple Fault Gold Belt, is surrounded by Puma Exploration's Williams Brook Project (5.55 g/t Au over 50m) and is hosted by orogenic rocks of similar age and structure as New Found Gold's Queensway Project.The Company is also advancing its Fremont Gold development project in the historic Mother Lode Gold Belt of California where 50,000,000 oz of gold has been produced. Fremont, located 500km north of Equinox Gold's Castle Mountain and Mesquite mines, has a PEA with an after-tax NPV of USD $217MM, a 21% IRR, 11-year LOM, averaging 118k ounces per annum at USD $1,750 gold. A sensitivity to the March 31, 2023 PEA at USD $2,000/oz gold gives an after-tax NPV(5%) of USD $370MM and a 31% IRR over an 11-year LOM. The project hosts an NI 43-101 resource of 1.16 Moz at 1.90 g/t Au within 19.0 MT Indicated, and 2.02 Moz at 2.22 g/t Au within 28.3 MT Inferred. The MRE evaluates only 1.4 km of the 4 km strike length of the Fremont property that features five gold-mineralized zones. Significantly, three step-out holes at depth hit mineralized structure, typical of orogenic deposits that often occur at depth. Fremont is located on private land in Mariposa, the original gold rush county and is 1.5 hours from Fresno, California. The property has year-round road access and is close to airports and rail.

Investing in the Fund involves risks related to market conditions, such as inflation, interest rate hikes, bank failures, armed conflicts, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Concentration in energy sector securities makes the Fund susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory events affecting the industry, including competition, energy conservation policies, and economic slowdowns. The use of derivatives by the Fund may lead to greater losses, selling or purchasing securities at unfavorable times, limiting appreciation potential, or holding securities that would otherwise be sold. Investing in non-U.S. securities exposes the Fund to currency fluctuations, economic, and political risks associated with foreign countries. Leverage usage by the Fund increases risk and costs, potentially magnifying losses. Financial Analyst The announcement by First Trust Energy Income and Growth Fund (FEN) to increase its quarterly distribution by 33.33% represents a significant shift in the fund's dividend policy, which could have implications for investor yield expectations. The increase in distribution is a direct result of the fund's need to distribute accumulated earnings and profits, likely tied to the performance of the underlying assets, primarily Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the energy sector.Investors might interpret the distribution increase as a positive signal regarding the fund's earnings and the health of the energy sector, potentially leading to a reevaluation of FEN's valuation. However, the high distribution rate, now at 9.50% based on NAV and 9.70% on closing market price, could also raise concerns about the sustainability of such payouts in the long term, especially considering the volatile nature of the energy market and the potential impact of interest rate hikes on high-yield investments. Tax Advisor The tax implications of the distributions from FEN are noteworthy, especially since a portion may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. This aspect of the distribution could be attractive to investors seeking tax-efficient income, as returns of capital are not taxed immediately but reduce the cost basis of the investment, deferring the tax liability until the fund's shares are sold. However, it also means that the distributions are not solely composed of earnings, which could affect the perception of the fund's profitability.For investors, the final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024, to be provided on Form 1099-DIV, will be important for tax planning. This underscores the importance of understanding the tax treatment of MLP investments, which can be complex due to their unique structure and the implications for corporate income tax, as FEN is treated as a 'C' corporation for tax purposes. Energy Sector Analyst The focus of FEN on MLPs and related entities in the energy sector suggests a specialized investment approach that can offer both income and growth opportunities, but also comes with a higher risk profile. The energy sector is subject to a myriad of risks, including commodity price fluctuations, regulatory changes and macroeconomic factors. The fund's concentration in this sector means that its performance is closely tied to the health and stability of the energy market.Current market conditions, such as the ongoing armed conflicts and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, have introduced additional volatility and uncertainty. Investors should be aware that while the energy sector may offer high income potential, it also requires careful risk assessment, particularly in light of recent geopolitical tensions and the transition towards renewable energy sources, which could reshape the industry's landscape. 04/10/2024 - 05:29 PM WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust Energy Income and Growth Fund (the ""Fund"") (NYSE American: FEN) has increased its regularly scheduled quarterly distribution to $0.40 per share from $0.30 per share The distribution will be payable on April 30, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 23, 2024. The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 22, 2024. The quarterly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust Energy Income and Growth Fund (FEN): Distribution per share: $0.40 Distribution Rate based on the April 9, 2024 NAV of $16.85: 9.50% Distribution Rate based on the April 9, 2024 closing market price of $16.50: 9.70% Increase from previous distribution of $0.30: 33.33% The increase is attributable to a portion of the Fund’s estimated accumulated earnings and profits required to be distributed in connection with the previously approved merger. The distribution will be paid entirely in cash, with no option for dividend reinvestment. It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by the publicly-traded master limited partnerships (""MLPs"") in which the Fund invests, a portion of distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks a high level of after-tax total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders. The Fund focuses on investing in MLPs and related public entities in the energy sector which the Fund's investment sub-advisor believes offer opportunities for income and growth. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation, or a ""C"" corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes and, as a result, is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $226 billion as of March 28, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Energy Income Partners, LLC (""EIP"") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of March 31, 2024, EIP managed or supervised approximately $5.4 billion in client assets. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy companies, energy sector MLPs and MLP-related entities, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the shareholder report and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework.

Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The partnership between Onco360® and Alexion Pharmaceuticals represents a strategic alignment in the specialized pharmaceutical distribution sector. The selection of Onco360® as a national pharmacy partner for the distribution of Voydeya® is indicative of the company's strong position within the oncology pharmacy space. This alignment is particularly significant given the rarity and complexity of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and the need for specialized distribution channels that can handle such niche medications effectively.The distribution of Voydeya® is likely to contribute positively to BrightSpring Health Services' revenue streams, given the drug's status as a first-in-class treatment and its targeting of a specific patient demographic. The partnership could potentially lead to increased market share within the oncology pharmacy industry for BrightSpring, as it demonstrates the company's capability to manage and distribute complex treatments for rare diseases. The long-term implications for stakeholders may include sustained revenue growth and enhanced company reputation in the field of specialized pharmaceutical services. Healthcare Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement by BrightSpring Health Services regarding Onco360®'s selection by Alexion Pharmaceuticals has the potential to impact the company's stock performance. As investors often respond positively to partnerships that may lead to an expansion of services and customer base, this news could be seen as a value-adding development. BrightSpring's ability to secure a national pharmacy partnership for a high-value, innovative drug like Voydeya® underscores the company's competitive edge and operational efficiency in the oncology pharmacy market.It is important to note that the cost of treatments for rare diseases like PNH can be substantial, which might translate into significant revenue per patient for BrightSpring. However, the overall financial impact will depend on the prevalence of the condition, the adoption rate of the new treatment and the reimbursement landscape. Investors should monitor the uptake of Voydeya® and the performance of BrightSpring's Onco360® division, as well as any potential changes in healthcare policies that could affect the demand for specialized pharmacy services. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research standpoint, the introduction of Voydeya® as an add-on therapy for PNH patients experiencing extravascular hemolysis (EVH) represents a noteworthy advancement in the treatment landscape. The partnership between Onco360® and Alexion Pharmaceuticals could facilitate increased access to this innovative therapy and potentially improve patient outcomes. Clinical implications of this partnership are substantial, as it may lead to a higher rate of treatment adherence and better management of PNH symptoms due to the specialized support services that Onco360® offers.While the immediate benefits to patients are clear, it is also essential to consider the long-term effects of introducing such therapies into the market. The increased availability of specialized drugs like Voydeya® can drive further research and development in the field, potentially leading to more effective treatments for PNH and other rare diseases. For stakeholders, this could mean not only improved patient health but also the potential for BrightSpring to establish itself as a leader in the distribution of rare disease therapies, which could have lasting positive effects on the company's standing in the healthcare sector. 04/10/2024 - 04:35 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BrightSpring Health Services (“BrightSpring” or “BrightSpring Health Services”) (NASDAQ: BTSG) announced today that its company Onco360®, a leading independent oncology pharmacy, was selected as a national pharmacy partner by Alexion Pharmaceuticals for a first-in-class, oral, Factor D inhibitor, Voydeya® (Danicopan) to treat patients with a rare, life-threatening disease of the blood called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are experiencing extravascular hemolysis (EVH).

HRZN's unfunded loan approvals and commitments were $168.2 million to 14 companies as of March 31, 2024. HRZN held a portfolio of warrant and equity positions in 99 portfolio companies as of March 31, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Horizon Technology Finance Corporation's recent portfolio update indicates a proactive approach to managing their investment portfolio in a fluctuating venture environment. The origination of $33.5 million in new loans during Q1 2024 demonstrates a strategic focus on technology and healthcare sectors, which are historically resilient to economic downturns. The company's substantial committed backlog of $168 million signals a strong pipeline for future earnings, although it's important to note that these commitments are contingent upon portfolio companies meeting specific milestones.The $20 million in loan payoffs and partial paydowns, resulting in accelerated income and prepayment fees, suggests a healthy liquidity event for Horizon. This is a positive sign for investors, as it indicates that Horizon's portfolio companies are performing well enough to repay their loans ahead of schedule, which can lead to increased earnings for the company. However, investors should be cautious as these liquidity events can also signal a reduction in outstanding interest-earning assets.From a financial perspective, the decrease in regularly scheduled principal payments from $13.2 million in Q4 2023 to $10.5 million in Q1 2024 could be indicative of a broader trend in the company's investment repayments. The diversification of Horizon's portfolio, with investments in various sectors like green construction and AI in healthcare, could mitigate risks associated with any single industry. The warrant and equity portfolio, consisting of 99 companies, offers potential for non-interest income through equity appreciation, which could be a significant value-add for shareholders in the long term. Market Research Analyst Horizon's focus on technology, life sciences, healthcare information and sustainability industries is in line with current market trends that favor innovation and growth in these sectors. The strategic investments in companies like Sonex Health, Ceribell and Nexii Building Solutions reflect a targeted approach to capitalizing on industry sectors that are expected to experience substantial growth. This aligns with broader market research that suggests a continued demand for advancements in medical technology and sustainable construction.Moreover, the venture capital environment has been increasingly competitive and Horizon's cautious yet active investment strategy positions it well to leverage market opportunities. The company's ability to secure new loans and maintain a significant backlog amidst market uncertainties is commendable and reflects a robust deal-sourcing capability. The presence of a committed backlog is a strong indicator of future business activity and potential revenue, which is a positive sign for stakeholders looking for growth prospects.However, the reduction in new loan commitments from $89.4 million in Q4 2023 to $37.5 million in Q1 2024 could suggest a more selective approach or a possible shift in market conditions. Investors should monitor this trend for insights into Horizon's market positioning and risk management strategies in the upcoming quarters. Venture Capital Analyst The venture capital landscape has been characterized by cautious optimism, with investors like Horizon Technology Finance Corporation navigating the post-pandemic recovery. Horizon's strategy of extending loans to venture capital-backed companies is a way to tap into the high-growth potential of startups while mitigating risk through secured loans. The mix of new loans to existing portfolio companies underscores the importance of supporting companies through various growth stages, which can lead to stronger partnerships and potentially higher returns.Horizon's continued investment in Ceribell, Inc., despite the loan payoff, suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects and the potential for value creation through warrant holdings. This is a common strategy in venture lending, where lenders seek to balance immediate income from interest and fees with longer-term gains from equity participation.Investors should take note of the company's unfunded loan approvals and commitments, as these represent both opportunities and risks. While they indicate a robust pipeline, there is no guarantee these will convert into funded loans. The venture capital market is inherently volatile and Horizon's portfolio companies' ability to meet their milestones is important for actualizing these commitments. The company's warrants and equity positions in a diverse set of 99 portfolio companies provide a hedge against this volatility and a chance for Horizon to benefit from the potential upside of these investments. 04/10/2024 - 04:15 PM - HRZN Originates $33.5 Million of New Loans in Q1 - - HRZN Ends Quarter with Committed Backlog of $168 Million - FARMINGTON, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Horizon Technology Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: HRZN) (“Horizon”), an affiliate of Monroe Capital, and a leading specialty finance company that provides capital in the form of secured loans to venture capital-backed companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services, and sustainability industries, today provided its portfolio update for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 and an update on the lending platform (“Horizon Platform”) of Horizon Technology Finance Management LLC (“HTFM”), its investment adviser. “HRZN funded $34 million in new loans in the first quarter, as we continued to monitor the changing venture environment and maintained our cautious approach,” said Gerald A. Michaud, President of HRZN and HTFM. “We are now seeing some green shoots in our markets which we find encouraging. While we watch these developments, we continue to maintain a significant committed backlog of debt investments, which totaled $168 million as of March 31. Our backlog should provide a solid foundation for new debt investments to existing and new portfolio companies in the quarters ahead.” “During the quarter, we also received $20 million in loan payoffs and partial paydowns, generating accelerated income and prepayment fees, which added to our regular investment income from interest on our outstanding debt investments,” added Mr. Michaud. “Looking forward, we believe HRZN remains well positioned to prudently grow its portfolio of debt investments, while delivering additional value to HRZN’s shareholders.” First Quarter 2024 Portfolio Update Originations During the first quarter of 2024, HRZN funded a total of $33.5 million of loans, as follows: $15.0 million to an existing portfolio company, Sonex Health, Inc., a developer of technology, education and training programs for ultrasound guided procedures. $14.0 million to an existing portfolio company, Ceribell, Inc., a developer of an FDA-cleared rapid response electroencephalography (EEG) medical device, which measures the amount of electrical activity in different regions of the brain in order to diagnose seizures. $2.5 million to an existing portfolio company, a developer of a cloud-native software platform for the property and casualty insurance segment. $1.8 million to an existing portfolio company, Nexii Building Solutions Inc., a green construction technology company focused on creating environmentally-friendly, durable, cost-efficient and disaster-resilient buildings. $0.2 million to an existing portfolio company, Robin Healthcare, Inc., a developer of an AI device that silently observes healthcare visits, extracts data, then builds and uploads clinical notes to a patient’s electronic health record. Liquidity Events and Partial Paydowns HRZN experienced liquidity events from three portfolio companies in the first quarter of 2024, including principal prepayments and partial paydowns of $19.8 million, compared to $48.3 million of principal prepayments and partial paydowns during the fourth quarter of 2023: In February, with the proceeds of a new loan from the Horizon Platform, Ceribell, Inc. (“Ceribell”) paid its outstanding principal balance of $11.2 million on its venture loan, plus interest and end-of-term payment. HRZN continues to hold warrants in Ceribell. In March, HRZN received a principal paydown of $1.1 million on its venture loans to NextCar Holding Company, Inc. (“NextCar”). HRZN continues to hold warrants in NextCar. In March, Engage3, LLC paid its outstanding principal balance of $7.5 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. Principal Payments Received During the first quarter of 2024, HRZN received regularly scheduled principal payments on investments totaling $10.5 million, compared to regularly scheduled principal payments totaling $13.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Commitments During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, HRZN closed new loan commitments totaling $37.5 million to three companies, compared to new loan commitments of $89.4 million to four companies in the fourth quarter of 2023. Pipeline and Term Sheets As of March 31, 2024, HRZN’s unfunded loan approvals and commitments (“Committed Backlog”) were $168.2 million to 14 companies. This compares to a Committed Backlog of $218.3 million to 15 companies at HRZN as of December 31, 2023. HRZN’s portfolio companies have discretion whether to draw down such commitments and the right of a portfolio company to draw down its commitment is often subject to achievement of specific milestones and other conditions to borrowing. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be funded by HRZN. Across the Horizon Platform, the quarter ended with an additional $4.7 million of unfunded loan approvals and commitments. During the quarter, HTFM received a signed term sheet that is in the approval process, which may result in the Horizon Platform providing up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of new debt investments. These opportunities are subject to underwriting conditions including, but not limited to, the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with HTFM’s allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or funded by HRZN. Warrant and Equity Portfolio As of March 31, 2024, HRZN held a portfolio of warrant and equity positions in 99 portfolio companies, including 87 private companies, which provides the potential for future additional returns to HRZN’s shareholders.

The transaction passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of GalaxE Group by Endava represents a strategic consolidation within the technology services sector. This move is likely to enhance Endava's service offerings, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue growth. From a financial perspective, the key points of interest include the acquisition cost, how it was financed and the expected impact on Endava's balance sheet. Additionally, investors will be keen on understanding the projected synergies and whether the acquisition will be accretive to Endava's earnings per share in the short to medium term.It is also pertinent to assess the competitive landscape post-acquisition. If Endava can effectively integrate GalaxE's capabilities and client base, it could lead to a stronger competitive position. However, the risks associated with integration should not be overlooked, such as potential culture clashes and the challenge of retaining key personnel. Market Research Analyst The acquisition signals Endava's commitment to expanding its footprint in the global IT and business solutions market. By analyzing market trends, one can infer that Endava is likely aiming to leverage GalaxE's established presence in the United States to bolster its own. This may provide Endava with access to new clients and industries, thereby diversifying its revenue streams.Furthermore, the technology services industry is rapidly evolving, with an increasing demand for innovative solutions. The combined entity's ability to meet this demand through a broader service portfolio could be a significant differentiator. It will be important to monitor customer responses to the acquisition, as client retention and satisfaction are critical metrics for success in this industry. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the completion of the acquisition following the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act waiting period indicates regulatory approval, which is a positive sign for both companies. It suggests that the transaction was not seen to significantly reduce competition in the market, a important factor in antitrust considerations.However, it is important for stakeholders to remain aware of any future regulatory challenges that may arise, especially as the combined entity grows in size and market influence. Compliance with international regulations, data privacy laws and intellectual property rights will be key areas to watch, as they can have material implications on the business operations and financial health of the company. 04/10/2024 - 05:15 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endava (NYSE: DAVA), a leading technology services company combining world-class engineering, industry expertise and a people-centric mindset, successfully closed its acquisition of GalaxE Group, Inc., a global IT and business solutions provider headquartered in New Jersey, United States, following the expiration of the applicable waiting period pertaining to the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

(“Village Farms”) (NASDAQ: VFF) today announced the appointment of William Stoufer as President of Balanced Health Botanicals (“BHB”), effective immediately. Mr. Stoufer will report directly to Michael DeGiglio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms. “Bill has been a key member of BHB senior leadership, responsible for establishing strong business processes with a focus on customer excellence, which contributed positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow to Village Farms since acquisition.” said Michael DeGiglio, President and Chief Executive Officer, Village Farms. “He is a strategic, execution-focused, results-driven leader and I look forward to his ongoing contribution as we continue to strengthen BHB’s position for the significant opportunity in the United States as the regulatory landscape evolves.” Mr. Stoufer joined BHB as Chief Operating Officer in 2019, bringing with him nearly 30 years of experience in consumer-packaged goods industries, primarily in food. His prior experience includes serving as Chief Operating Officer of Ardent Mills and, during his 20-year tenure at ConAgra Brands, increasingly senior executive roles in sales, logistics and operations culminating in the role of President, ConAgra Mills. The Company also announced that Chase Terwilliger has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of BHB to pursue an opportunity outside of the CBD/cannabis industry. “I would like to thank Chase for his contribution in helping establish BHB as one of the leading companies in the US CBD market,” said Michael DeGiglio. “We wish him well in his future endeavours.” About Village Farms International Village Farms leverages decades of experience as a large-scale, Controlled Environment Agriculture-based, vertically integrated supplier for high-value, high-growth plant-based Consumer Packaged Goods opportunities, with a strong foundation as a leading fresh produce supplier to grocery and large-format retailers throughout the US and Canada, and new high-growth opportunities in the cannabis and CBD categories in North America, the Netherlands and selected markets internationally. The Company's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is one of the single largest cannabis operations in the world, the lowest-cost greenhouse producer and one of Canada’s best-selling brands.

Internationally, Village Farms is targeting selected, nascent, legal cannabis and CBD opportunities with significant medium- and long-term potential, with an initial focus on the Asia-Pacific region and Europe.

The new technology aims to identify and prevent carrier and driver fraud by analyzing billions of data points on freight location and status. It helps stakeholders save costs, improve collaboration, and enhance trust in the logistics industry. Positive None. Negative None. Supply Chain Analyst The introduction of Descartes MacroPoint™ FraudGuard represents a proactive measure in mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities within the logistics sector. The advanced technology that assesses and flags potential fraud instances could be a game-changer for freight brokers, 3PLs and shippers. By integrating FraudGuard into the existing Descartes MacroPoint service, there is a potential to streamline the process of fraud detection, which can lead to significant cost savings.From a supply chain perspective, the ability to verify the location of freight and drivers in real-time and block false tracking points is invaluable. This can not only prevent the loss of goods but also enhance the trust between all parties involved in the supply chain. The improved carrier scorecards and network performance could result in more efficient operations and potentially lower insurance premiums due to reduced risk exposure.However, the effectiveness of this technology will depend on its ability to adapt to new fraudulent methods. As bad actors evolve, so too must the preventative measures. The long-term impact on business operations will likely be positive, but the upfront cost and integration process into existing systems should be considered by stakeholders. Cybersecurity Expert Descartes MacroPoint™ FraudGuard's introduction underscores the critical need for cybersecurity measures in the logistics and transportation industry. The reliance on billions of data points to monitor freight location and status introduces a complex landscape where cybersecurity must be robust to protect against data breaches and fraudulent activities.The technology's capability to proactively flag potential fraud instances before they result in significant financial loss is crucial. It is indicative of an industry trend where cybersecurity solutions are no longer reactive but predictive. This shift can greatly enhance the resilience of logistics operations against cyber threats.While the solution appears promising, it is important to consider the potential privacy implications of such extensive data monitoring. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining the privacy of drivers and carriers will be essential to the successful adoption of FraudGuard. Additionally, continuous updates and improvements to the system will be necessary to keep pace with the evolving tactics of fraudsters. Financial Analyst The deployment of Descartes MacroPoint™ FraudGuard could have a notable impact on the financial health of companies within the logistics industry. By reducing the incidence of fraud, companies can avoid costly repercussions such as lost goods, insurance claims and damage to reputation. The ability to improve carrier scorecards and network performance through this technology may also lead to more favorable contract negotiations and partnerships.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Descartes MacroPoint services with the integrated FraudGuard feature. A high adoption rate could signal market confidence in the product and could be a catalyst for growth in Descartes Systems Group's revenue. Conversely, resistance or slow adoption could indicate challenges in market penetration or effectiveness of the service.It's also important to consider the competitive landscape. If Descartes Systems Group is the first to market with such an integrated fraud detection service, it may gain a significant competitive advantage. However, if competitors are quick to follow suit with similar offerings, the long-term financial impact may be diluted. 04/10/2024 - 06:00 PM ATLANTA, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq:DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, announced the availability of Descartes MacroPoint™ FraudGuard to help freight brokers, third-party logistics companies (3PLs) and shippers identify and prevent fraudulent activities related to carrier information, load tracking, and shipment status. The new capabilities are now included as part of the subscription for the Descartes MacroPoint service. “Fraud is a serious and growing problem in the industry. The costs associated with, for example, stolen loads, double brokering and mode switching, can be significant. Worse, it’s extremely challenging for stakeholders to find effective and timely resolutions when incidents do occur,” said Omer Ramušević, Director of Business Development, Swick Logistics. “With Descartes MacroPoint, we will have a new way to automate the early detection of potential fraud, which will be crucial to preventing disruptions for our customers, mitigating financial risk, and building trust with our shipper and carrier communities.” Descartes MacroPoint FraudGuard uses advanced technology to proactively assess and flag certain potential instances of carrier or driver fraud by evaluating billions of data points on freight location and status for accuracy. It helps to combat fraud by verifying the location of the freight and driver, blocking location tracking points that are determined to be false and managing the interaction with the customer when fraud is detected. The new capabilities help freight brokers, third-party logistics companies (3PLs) and shippers detect fraud early, save costs associated with the repercussions of fraud, improve carrier scorecards and carrier network performance, enhance trust with customers and carriers, and improve collaboration with carriers and partners when addressing concerns or disputes. Descartes MacroPoint is a multimodal visibility platform designed to help freight brokers, 3PLs and shippers gain better visibility to their freight operations and shipments. Carriers can easily connect with the solution via GPS-based electronic logging device (ELD), transportation management systems (TMS), or mobile app-based tracking methods. The platform allows for increased control and management of the supply chain—with more efficient and high-quality data to improve communication and decision-making. Using Descartes MacroPoint, companies can enhance customer service, increase distribution efficiency, better collaborate with customers, suppliers and carriers, and minimize the impact of disruptions and late delivery penalties. “Given the increasingly sophisticated tactics of bad actors combined with the sheer volume of data in transportation and logistics, it’s essential to have advanced capabilities to help monitor and minimize the impact of fraudulent activities,” said Dan Cicerchi, General Manager, Transportation Management at Descartes. “This is an industry-wide issue, and our capabilities help address these challenges, making Descartes MacroPoint an even more valuable freight visibility tool by facilitating a more secure logistics ecosystem.” About Swick Logistics Based in Naperville, IL, Swick Logistics is a full-service 3PL freight brokerage providing custom-tailored freight services—including dry van, expedited, flatbed, refrigerated, and special shipments—through its fleet and trusted partner carrier network to customers across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Castle's prognostic risk-stratification test, TissueCypher®, aims to predict progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer. Positive None. Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 05:00 PM FRIENDSWOOD, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Castle Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, recognizes the importance of Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month and is providing its support of key programs and initiatives throughout the month of April. The Company is proud to continue its ongoing collaboration with the Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN), Gastro Broadcast podcast and EndoscopyNow to help advance esophageal cancer research, prevention, education and advocacy. “Unfortunately, esophageal cancer is often detected at its late stages and the five-year survival rate of esophageal cancer patients is less than 20%,”1 said Emmanuel Gorospe, M.D., MPH, CPI, FACP, FACG, FASGE, GI Medical Director at Castle Biosciences. “Therefore, prevention and early detection are key. We are proud to continue efforts to promote awareness of the disease and provide holistic support directed towards patients as well as the GI professional community through research, advocacy and educational initiatives.” Detection of esophageal cancer and its precursor, Barrett’s esophagus (BE), is challenging because the primary symptoms — heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — are common to a multitude of less serious ailments that are typically not cause for concern. TissueCypher® is Castle’s prognostic risk-stratification test designed to predict progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer. Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN) Castle is collaborating with ECAN’s Steps to Save Lives, a virtual 5k run/walk/roll and the organization’s signature fundraising event, being held April 21–28, 2024. For more information or to get involved, visit ECAN’s Steps to Save Lives page. “When ECAN began Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month 15 years ago, most people had never heard of, what was at the time, the fastest-increasing cancer in the U.S. — up at least 600% in recent decades — and today, esophageal cancer remains the fastest-increasing cancer diagnosis among American men,”1 said Mindy Mintz Mordecai, president and chief executive officer of ECAN. “Thanks to the support of our corporate partners, not only are more people becoming aware that reflux disease can cause this devastating cancer, innovation by these companies is resulting in better tests and tools that increase the chance that patients can prevent this deadly disease before it starts.” Gastro Broadcast Castle is collaborating with Gastro Broadcast, a podcast featuring independent GI physicians having conversations with their colleagues, patient advocates and industry leaders on issues that impact gastroenterology. For an April episode, Castle collaborated with host, Dr. Naresh Gunaratnam of Huron Gastroenterology, who interviewed Dr. Sri Komanduri, Associate Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, to discuss efforts to educate the public about esophageal cancer and tools that can identify and stratify risk for the disease in patients with BE. EndoscopyNow Castle is collaborating with EndoscopyNow, a mobile application used among the GI professional community, and in April, is sponsoring EndoscopyNow’s first “Masters in Endoscopy” webinar, titled “Current Gaps and Risk Stratification in Barrett's Esophagus.” Presented by Dr. Sri Komanduri, the webinar will take place Wednesday, April 10, 2024, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time. Register for the webinar here or access it on demand in the EndoscopyNow app following the broadcast.

PITTSBURGH, April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Calgon Carbon Corporation (""Calgon Carbon"" or ""Company""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuraray Co., Ltd. (TYO: 3405) (""Kuraray""), today announced that the Company has spent the last few years preparing for the onslaught of PFAS-related demand for their most significant core business; drinking water. ""We've been preparing for this day. We understand the significance of PFAS and the MCL's, and we are ready to help communities meet these new regulations, and usher in a new era of safe drinking water,"" said Steve Schott, President and CEO of Calgon Carbon Corporation. In 2023, Calgon Carbon celebrated the completion of a virgin granular activated carbon (GAC) production expansion at its Mississippi plant. The Company now produces more than 200MM pounds of virgin activated carbon annually in the United States. ""We don't call PFAS a forever chemical, because we believe we have the right approach to treat it,"" said Jenalle Brewer, Senior Vice President, Drinking Water Solutions. ""For more than 20 years we've been successfully battling PFAS; and I believe our suite of people, products, and services are unmatched in the industry."" The science behind Calgon Carbon's approach to removing PFAS from water sources starts with people. ""Each water system is unique and requires diligent testing before treatment can even begin,"" continued Brewer. ""Our researchers, application engineers, and salespeople ensure that our treatment approach will not only meet regulations but will be customized to deliver exactly what each utility needs. For over two decades, the Company has been treating PFAS in drinking water, wastewater, and industrial applications, using FILTRASORB® granular activated carbon (GAC). GAC has been considered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the ""Best Available Technology"" to treat PFAS. The strong fluorine-carbon bond and low vapor pressure makes PFAS resistant to several conventional water treatment technologies, including direct oxidation, biodegradation, air stripping, vapor extraction and direct photolysis (UV)."" The Company recently rebranded their water filtration tanks to reflect a more aggressive approach in treating PFAS. AquaKnight™ Equipment Systems, large filtration tanks designed to create the ideal environment for the activated carbon, can be seen standing guard at hundreds of current customer sites. The last piece of the Calgon Carbon PFAS approach is reactivation. Not only a cost-effective solution, reactivation also allows utilities to lessen their environmental impact by circumventing landfills, eliminating hazardous waste liability, reducing CO2 emissions, and recycling the carbon. Different from incineration or regeneration, the Company's proprietary drinking water reactivation process has been demonstrated to destroy testable PFAS compounds to near non-detect levels. The Company currently has five strategically located reactivation plants across the United States. Calgon Carbon has launched a website to demonstrate that eliminating PFAS from U.S. drinking water is not only possible but can be done sustainably with products that are proudly made in the United States. NoMorePFAS.com About Calgon Carbon Calgon Carbon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kuraray Co., Ltd. (TYO: 3405) (Kuraray), is a global leader in the manufacture and/or distribution of innovative coal-, wood- and coconut-based activated carbon products – in granular, powdered, pelletized and cloth form – to meet the most challenging purification demands of customers throughout the world.

Mainframe software maintenance licenses are a significant expense that many firms aim to reduce or eliminate. Strategies like rehosting software in the cloud, rewriting legacy applications, and outsourcing operations are popular to cut costs while retaining legacy code. Mainframe application modernization is growing in the U.S. and Brazil, driven by cost considerations and regulatory compliance. Generative AI is gaining traction for automating mainframe modernization tasks. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Enterprises' shift towards mainframe modernization, as highlighted by the ISG Provider Lens™ report, indicates a strategic pivot that can influence market dynamics. By migrating to cloud services or outsourcing, companies aim to curb expenses associated with maintaining legacy systems. This trend reflects an operational efficiency drive, which can lead to reduced operational costs and potentially higher profit margins. The implication for investors is that companies engaging in such modernization may present a more favorable long-term cost structure. However, the initial investment in modernization and potential disruption during the transition phase could impact short-term financials.Furthermore, the report's indication of a growing market for mainframe-as-a-service (MFaaS) and outsourced operations suggests an expansion in the IT services sector. This could signal investment opportunities in companies that provide these services. The interest in generative AI for automating documentation and explaining business rules also points to an evolving landscape where technology companies that invest in such AI capabilities could gain a competitive edge. However, investors should be cautious, as the long-term efficacy and integration of GenAI in mainframe modernization are yet to be fully realized. Financial Analyst The focus on cost-cutting through mainframe modernization, as reported by ISG, has direct financial implications for the enterprises involved. By reducing the expenses on software maintenance licenses, companies could improve their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. This is a critical metric that investors use to assess a company's operating performance. The move to cloud computing may also lead to variable costs replacing fixed costs, offering more financial flexibility to respond to market demands.For stakeholders in the IT sector, particularly in cloud services and mainframe modernization, this trend presents potential revenue growth. However, it's important to monitor the competitive landscape, as increased demand could lead to market saturation and pressure on service pricing. Additionally, the report's mention of regulatory compliance as a driver for modernization in the U.S. and the growth of modernization services in Brazil's banking sector indicates regional market nuances that require tailored financial strategies. Sustainability Consultant The ISG report's observation that organizations are decommissioning on-premises data centers to meet sustainability goals introduces an environmental angle to the financial narrative. Moving to cloud-based solutions can reduce the carbon footprint of data center operations, which is increasingly important to stakeholders concerned with corporate social responsibility (CSR). Companies that effectively communicate their sustainability efforts through such modernization initiatives may see enhanced brand value and customer loyalty.Investors are paying more attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and companies that lead in sustainability might attract more investment. However, the transition to cloud services must be managed carefully to ensure that it does not lead to unintended environmental impacts, such as increased energy consumption at cloud data centers. This balance between financial benefits and environmental responsibility is a nuanced aspect that companies must navigate as part of their modernization strategies. 04/10/2024 - 02:55 PM More enterprises chip away at high costs by modernizing applications, moving to cloud or outsourcing legacy software operations, ISG Provider Lens™ report says STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As macroeconomic conditions made enterprises in the Americas more cost-conscious in 2023, interest in mainframe modernization increased significantly, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Mainframe — Services and Solutions report for the Americas finds that while not all organizations are moving away from legacy systems, mainframe software maintenance licenses represent a major expense that a growing number of firms want to reduce or eliminate. “Despite ongoing innovation in enterprise computing, mainframes are stable and reliable, so many companies remain committed to the technology,” said John Schick, Americas leader, Mainframe Modernization and Optimization, for ISG. “Mainframe optimization services and outsourcing help to make that possible.” Most IT organizations in the Americas that need to cut costs are quickly rehosting their mainframe software in the cloud, the report says. Others are rewriting legacy applications in modern programming languages or re-engineering them, both of which ensure like-for-like behavior and performance that can be validated through automated testing. Strategies to reduce costs while retaining legacy code remain popular, ISG says. The market for outsourced mainframe operations and mainframe-as-a-service (MFaaS) continues to grow. More organizations are decommissioning on-premises data centers to fulfill sustainability goals. MFaaS provides a cloud-like, pay-per-use experience on a private cloud, while mainframe operations engagements let clients retain hardware and software ownership as needed. Mainframe application modernization is accelerating in the U.S., driven more by cost considerations and the need for regulatory compliance than by innovation, the report says. In Brazil, the second-largest IBM mainframe market after the U.S., application modernization services are expected to keep growing in 2024. The country’s largest banks have started modernization and migration initiatives, attracting interest from global cloud giants. Enterprises grew more interested in generative AI’s potential to further automate mainframe modernization in 2023, ISG says. Though today’s GenAI platforms cannot replace tools that rewrite or re-engineer mainframe applications, there have been demonstrated use cases involving tasks such as explaining business rules and summarizing logic for better documentation. “Excitement about GenAI’s future is increasing interest in AI solutions that already make application modernization faster and more efficient,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. The report also explores other mainframe trends in the Americas, including the rising interest in DevOps methodologies for mainframe optimization and a wave of acquisitions in the rapidly growing market for application modernization software. For more insights into the biggest mainframe challenges enterprises face, including local skills shortages and the high cost of software integration, along with ISG’s advice for addressing them, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Mainframe — Services and Solutions report for the Americas evaluates the capabilities of 57 providers across six quadrants: Mainframe Optimization Services, Application Modernization Services, U.S., Application Modernization Services, Brazil, Mainframe as a Service (MFaaS), Mainframe Operations and Mainframe Application Modernization Software. The report names DXC Technology and Wipro as Leaders in five quadrants each. It names Capgemini, Ensono, Infosys, Kyndryl and TCS as Leaders in three quadrants each.

Kyndryl and NTT DATA are named as Rising Stars in one quadrant each.

According to UN Tourism, international tourism is on track to recover to close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels. It is now more important than ever to reaffirm our commitment to supporting climate action. This Earth Month, our Global Social Impact and Sustainability team has partnered with our SAGE (Sustainable and Green at Expedia Group) community business group and our internal People Learning Team to launch a self-paced learning module for employees covering climate change in the travel industry, how Expedia Group is powering sustainable journeys, and what Expedians can do to make an impact.The training builds on our inaugural Climate Action Plan launched last year, outlining Expedia Group's overall climate vision and approach. Because change begins at home, we're working to decarbonize our operations and have set a 2040 Net Zero target, with interim goals of:Reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 75% by 2030.Continuing to match 100% of our electricity usage with renewable purchases through 2030.Engaging with our value chain to ensure that 75% of our suppliers by emissions have set science-based targets by 2028.Our Climate Action Plan also commits us to supporting the global travel industry's ability to meet its goal of halving emissions by 2030 and reaching Net Zero by 2050. We see our role as twofold: Expedia Group enables travel suppliers to green their offerings, and we empower travelers to confidently book greener options.Travel and tourism are inherently place-based: Every trip has a destination, and positive travel experiences hinge on vibrant, prosperous destination communities. Two recent partnerships embody this recognition, demonstrating how sustainability efforts in travel can likewise support equity in local communities.Nature Positive Tourism FundExpedia Group has provided foundational philanthropic support to the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to launch the Nature Positive Tourism Fund (NPTF), leveraging WCS's long track record of global conservation in areas of outstanding natural beauty and important wildlife populations. Nature Positive Tourism directly contributes to the protection of these habitats and wildlife by engaging with the people living in regions important for conservation. This form of tourism allows travelers to enjoy global natural wonders and unique biodiversity while ensuring that tourist spending contributes directly to a more conservation-focused and sustainable economy.The Nature Positive Tourism Fund will:Provide Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities with working capital loans, grants, and access to technical experts, in order to improve infrastructure, services, and overall tourist experience, and to support the transition away from fossil fuels.Identify and improve best practices and standards in Nature Positive Tourism in collaboration with key stakeholders across the industry.Expand Nature Positive Tourism opportunities in the critically important conservation areas where WCS works, including building community-owned and -operated tourism facilities and services.We're excited to embark on this work with WCS, with initial fund disbursement supporting programs in the Madidi Landscape in Bolivia and the Kulen Prum Tep Sanctuary in Cambodia with future sites under development. Together, we'll help travelers better understand the value of nature while ensuring that nature tourism delivers economic value and benefits to local communities and contributes to conservation efforts in critical habitats.Destination Climate ChampionsExpedia Group partnered with nonprofit The Travel Foundation to launch a first-of-its-kind educational program and peer learning network for destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs). This free, self-guided program equips DMO staff with the knowledge and skills to serve as ""climate champions"" and incorporate a climate lens into their day-to-day work, while also creating a destination-specific Climate Action Plan and bolstering their ability to communicate with travelers about sustainable tourism in their destination.DMOs are a key node for climate action in the travel industry, and a destination-specific climate action plan can anchor and coordinate the efforts of travel businesses both large and small as well as governments, investors, residents, and other travel stakeholders. The course will help destinations better meet traveler expectations while building community and industry resilience to the impacts of climate change.The program is currently being piloted with DMOs from across three geographic cohorts - the EU, U.S. and Canada (Pacific Northwest), and New Zealand. We look forward to launching this program soon to DMOs around the world.In addition to this new program, Expedia Group has also sponsored the Travel Foundation to convene a coalition of nonprofits and academics to produce a white paper on Climate Justice for the travel and tourism industry, which will be published later this year.Product Features for TravelersAs we work toward a more responsible travel ecosystem, it's evident there's growing interest in sustainable travel options.

(DCGO) extends migrant services contract with NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, showcasing continued partnership and commitment to quality services.

(DCGO) extends migrant services contract with NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, showcasing continued partnership and commitment to quality services. The extension runs through 2024, allowing DocGo to focus on growth initiatives and partnerships. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Industry Analyst The extension of DocGo's contract with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development signifies a stable revenue stream for the company through the end of 2024. This is particularly important as it provides business continuity in a sector that is often subject to the volatility of government contracts. The assurance of ongoing work with NYC also allows DocGo to strategically allocate resources and focus on other growth initiatives, such as expanding programs with insurance partners and hospital systems. The diversification of services and client base is a positive indicator of the company's resilience and adaptability in the dynamic healthcare market.However, investors should be mindful of the potential risks associated with the transition to a new service provider. The process may involve unforeseen costs or disruptions that could affect the company's financial performance. Moreover, the statement that the program is expected to 'moderate over the course of 2024' suggests that there might be a decrease in revenue from this contract in the long term, which could impact future earnings. It is important for stakeholders to monitor how DocGo manages this transition and whether it can compensate for any potential downturn with its growth initiatives. Financial Analyst The announcement by DocGo reflects a proactive approach to contract management and a strategic focus on growth. From a financial perspective, the extension of the contract provides a clear short-term revenue projection, which can be favorable for the company's stock valuation. Investors often look for such predictability in cash flows, especially in industries like mobile health services where demand can fluctuate based on external factors such as policy changes and economic conditions.Furthermore, the emphasis on pursuing growth opportunities across key customer segments indicates a forward-thinking management team. The ability to reallocate corporate resources towards these initiatives could lead to improved margins and profitability if executed effectively. However, the true impact on the stock will depend on the company's ability to deliver on these growth promises without compromising the quality of current services. Shareholders should watch for the company's performance metrics and updates on the success of new partnerships and expansions in the coming quarters. 04/10/2024 - 02:13 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DocGo Inc. (Nasdaq: DCGO) (“DocGo” or the “Company”), a leading provider of technology-enabled mobile health services, announced today the extension of its current migrant services contract with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). This extension is part of a planned transition that DocGo worked on in collaboration with NYC, demonstrating a continued partnership to ensure consistent and quality services for those in need. Under the extension, DocGo will continue to provide contracted services to assist with the ongoing asylum seeker crisis in upstate New York as needed through the end of 2024 and will provide accelerated transition assistance to a new provider of services for sites in New York City concurrent with the expiration of the original term of its HPD contract in May. DocGo will continue to provide its services to NYC through the extended term while prioritizing other growth initiatives across the Company’s portfolio, including expansion of its programs with insurance partners, hospital systems, and population health programs. “We were pleased to step up and help New York City in its hour of need when other providers lacked the scale, resources, or rapid deployment expertise, and are confident in the quality and value we have delivered for this program,” said Lee Bienstock, CEO of DocGo. “We are equally pleased to work with our partners at NYC to execute a coordinated transition over the rest of the year – it is part of our overall plan, and we shared our expectation that this program would moderate over the course of 2024 on our last earnings call. This transition will enable us to dedicate more of our corporate resources and energy towards pursuing growth opportunities across our key customer segments, and we are excited about the possibilities for expansion with our current customers and the new partnerships we are signing. We believe DocGo has played a vital role in New York City's public health programs over the past three years, both in times of crisis and in the everyday lives of New Yorkers, demonstrating resilience and service delivery efficiency while successfully navigating complex healthcare challenges. We are grateful for the trust placed in us by New York City and remain dedicated to improving health outcomes and committed to bringing access to care to all those who need it.” About DocGo DocGo is leading the proactive healthcare revolution with an innovative care delivery platform that includes mobile health services, remote patient monitoring and ambulance services.

Disability Matters also recognized MillerKnoll's work with clients, specifically the company's role in supporting the design of The Harkin Institute for Public Policy and Citizen Engagement at Drake University. The Institute's new progressive facility was imagined using inclusive design principles, providing an equitable experience for all people. Led by renowned architectural firm BNIM, in collaboration with the Harkin Institute and MillerKnoll, four guiding principles were developed for the Harkin Center's building and site design: generous space, equitable experiences, clear path, and individual empowerment. MillerKnoll applied those tenets to its furniture strategy, contributing to a site that goes beyond universal design to be truly inclusive. Local to Des Moines, Iowa where the Harkin Institute is located, dealer Pigott also collaborated on every stage of the project. Jason Rosenblatt, Senior Design Strategist, MillerKnoll added, ""A significant portion of the design process (for the Harkin Institute) occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this passionate team was challenged to drive forward by shifting to an entirely virtual design and advisory process. We are incredibly proud of the outcome and look forward to our continued work as an advocate for more Inclusive Design led practices and policies around the globe.""

The platform simplifies compliance and reporting, helping BSPs secure funding and avoid penalties. Calix's partnership with Ookla and Ready.net enhances testing efficiency and network performance, ensuring BSPs can meet future funding requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The announcement by Calix, Inc. regarding the usage of its Broadband Platform by federally funded broadband service providers (BSPs) for FCC performance testing presents significant implications for the telecommunications industry. The fact that 74 percent of these BSPs are utilizing the Calix Cloud capabilities underscores a growing reliance on cloud-based solutions for regulatory compliance. This adoption reflects a broader trend in the telecommunications sector towards cloud services, which offer scalability, efficiency and the ability to manage large volumes of data, such as the 2 billion FCC performance tests mentioned.Calix's partnership with Ookla and the integration of performance insights into its platform can be seen as a strategic move to embed itself deeply within the operational frameworks of BSPs. This level of integration can lead to increased customer stickiness and potential barriers to entry for competitors. Moreover, the ability to streamline FCC compliance reporting through automated testing and reporting can reduce operational burdens on BSPs, allowing them to focus on network growth and service improvement. However, the concentration of market share in Calix's hands could raise questions about market competitiveness and the risks associated with dependency on a single vendor's platform. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Calix's announcement may be viewed positively by investors and market participants. The company's role in enabling BSPs to meet federal performance testing requirements could translate to a steady revenue stream, especially given the ongoing federal funding programs such as BEAD and RDOF. The exclusive partnership with Ready.net could further enhance Calix's market position, potentially leading to increased market share and higher revenue growth. This strategic positioning, combined with the company's commitment to domestic manufacturing in compliance with the Build America, Buy America (BABA) requirements, may also align with current political and economic initiatives to bolster domestic infrastructure and could be a factor in securing future federal contracts.However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with the regulatory environment. Changes in FCC requirements or shifts in federal funding priorities could impact the demand for Calix's services. Additionally, the reliance on public funding programs introduces an element of uncertainty, as these programs are subject to political influence and budgetary constraints. As such, it is important to monitor the policy landscape and Calix's adaptability to any changes. Market Research Analyst Calix's announcement holds strategic importance in light of the upcoming critical deadlines for the BEAD program. The company's ability to simplify access to public funding programs for BSPs could lead to an increased adoption of the Calix Broadband Platform, especially in rural areas where funding and compliance with FCC standards are important for network development and maintenance. The partnership with Ready.net could provide a competitive edge, as it may enhance the service offerings to BSPs, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.It is also noteworthy that Calix's solutions are designed to address common challenges faced by BSPs, such as the need to defer tests during high background traffic to prevent network bottlenecks. This level of detail in service provision reflects an understanding of the operational challenges in the industry and could position Calix as a thought leader in broadband performance testing. The long-term benefits for BSPs include not only compliance but also the ability to identify and rectify network performance issues, which can lead to improved customer experiences and potentially reduce churn rates. 04/10/2024 - 01:30 PM Calix continues to dramatically simplify access to public funding programs ahead of critical deadlines for BEAD, announcing 74 percent of all federally funded U.S. broadband providers are successfully leveraging cloud capabilities on the Calix Broadband Platform for compliance and reporting, with customers surpassing 2 billion FCC performance tests SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Calix, Inc. (NYSE: CALX) today announced broadband service providers (BSPs) using performance testing services—enabled by cloud capabilities on the Calix Broadband Platform—have surpassed 2 billion total tests required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Since adding FCC performance testing services to the Calix Platform, 74 percent of all federally funded BSPs in the U.S. rely on them to apply for, secure, and maintain funding. To better navigate the complexities of quarterly testing, BSPs leverage the industry’s only end-to-end platform and expertise from Calix Professional Services for performance analysis and insights that help avoid financial penalties. By enabling BSPs to execute this required testing at scale, Calix continues to actively support customers on their funding journey, helping them simplify their business while growing value for communities across rural America. Calix FCC Performance Testing and the Broadband Performance Testing Service on the Calix Platform have enabled hundreds of BSPs to successfully meet FCC requirements. In 2019, Calix partnered with Ookla—a global leader in broadband network intelligence and testing applications—and integrated scalable performance insights into the Calix Platform. By introducing performance testing prior to 2020, Calix customers were prepared for the windfall of federal funding and requirements to follow from sources like the Connect America Fund (CAF). Similarly, when performance requirements are announced for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program and Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) in the coming years, BSPs that have included performance testing throughout implementation will help prevent future missteps and maintain their funding. With billions of dollars from once-in-a-generation funding opportunities on the line, the Calix Platform has enabled funded BSPs to easily report network performance. Each test conducted on the platform is designed to measure speed and latency or to determine whether the test should be deferred. When background traffic is too high, tests are automatically deferred to prevent network bottlenecks. However, even skipped tests must be reported. Calix simplifies this cumbersome and often inefficient process of performance testing, allowing BSPs to easily streamline required testing at various endpoints and deliver findings in an FCC-complaint report. Providing BSPs with an even greater advantage during the funding process, Calix recently announced an exclusive partnership with Ready.net. The partnership will further enable BSPs to secure their fair share of funding while continuing to grow their networks and drive incredible experiences for their subscribers and communities. “Calix Cloud takes the complex and often time-consuming process of performance testing and greatly simplifies how you report and submit to the FCC,” said Scott Nyman, general manager and chief executive officer of Cirrinity. “During testing, problem areas affecting performance are easily identified, allowing my team to cut through the noise of hundreds of thousands of test rows and immediately improve results. At every point in our journey, Calix has ensured FCC performance obligations are met, helping us maintain our funding allowance and delivering significant value to the communities we serve in northeastern Wisconsin.” Calix is also fully committed to meeting and exceeding industry standards that drive broadband innovation. The company fully complies with and leads in global industry standards. Additionally, Calix remains committed to meeting the federal Build America, Buy America (BABA) requirements for BEAD and other federal funding programs by manufacturing critical broadband hardware systems domestically. This is why BSPs depend on Calix to deliver efficient, reliable solutions that help maintain the integrity of their networks and evaluate performance with precision. “There is a reason nearly three-quarters of all funded BSPs rely on the Calix Platform to win and maintain their funding,” said John Durocher, chief customer officer at Calix. “In just three years, Calix customers have conducted 2 billion FCC performance tests, showcasing the reliable, scalable value BSPs of any size are leveraging to ace funding requirements. Innovations to the industry’s only end-to-end platform have made testing effortless for our customers, especially those who lack the resources to dedicate time to demanding quarterly mandates when they need to focus on growing their network. With billions at stake in funding, Calix ensures BSPs can navigate and dramatically simplify a complex process to continue delivering incredible value to their communities.” Learn more about Calix FCC Performance Testing by scheduling a consultation today.

(TSXV:EUP)(OTCQB:AUCCF) (the ""Company"" or ""EuroPacific"") announces the start of the 2024 exploration drill program at the Miguel Vacas mine area located approximately 180 km east by road from Lisbon and approximately 70 km east from Évora, the Alentejo region capital. The 2024 drill program encompasses a minimum of 1,500 meters of ore drilling with the objective of further defining initially a shallow open pit resource of oxide Copper mineralization which will be followed by step out drilling on the deeper (> 80m) sulphide ore. Crews are onsite, and drilling has begun on April 6, 2024.Karim Rayani, Chief Executive Officer, stated ""We are pleased to announce the commencement of drilling at the Miguel Vacas Copper project located in Portugal. This program is designed to test structural framework while confirming the mineralization zone while expanding its potential. We are proceeding initially for eleven drill holes to confirm the extensions, and quality of the oxidized blanket amenable for an open pit heap leaching operation. We look forward to reporting back as operations continue.""The Miguel Vacas target is located within a large, 328 square kilometers exploration license, Borba 2, which has a well-documented potential to host precious and base metals mineralization. The mineralized systems are enhanced by the presence of abundant Au and /or Cu mineral occurrences in shear zones hosted in Devonian and Silurian metasediments and in epithermal systems associated with intra-Ordovician volcanics.The mine is surrounded by extensive marble exploitations that do not interfere with the exploration areas. On the contrary the presence of these operations is considered to be a positive factor because of the excellent acceptance by the local marble operators of a mining group like EuroPacific and by their logistical support always available both in infrastructures and potentially mining equipment.Drill Program DetailsThe actual campaign will be driven based on previous drilling and analysis that showed significant high-grade copper mineralization that has continuity with historical drilling, over wide intervals (up to 6.7 m grading 2.57 % Cu in hole BOMV-4001). Please refer to EuroPacific News Release dated March 28, 2024, for more detailed assay results.The mineralized system extends on at least 2 km along l strike and is open at depth. The plan includes a total of 11 shallow holes to confirm previous results and detail the morphology of the oxidized blanket in order to outline a resource estimation over an initial segment of approximately 1,200m. A deep undercut hole is also planned to test the deeper sulphide zone for further follow-up.Figure 1 - Drilling of first hole GPDM-001 of the 2024 campaign. South end of the old pit Miguel Vacas pit.

The deal includes the first-ever IMAX system in Jaipur and a system in Mumbai's iconic IMAX Wadala. IMAX's CEO Rich Gelfond expressed excitement over the collaboration, highlighting India's strong momentum as a top-grossing market for the company. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of IMAX Corporation in India, particularly the installation of new IMAX with Laser systems, represents a strategic move to capitalize on a growing market. India's burgeoning middle class and its appetite for premium entertainment options provide a fertile ground for IMAX's high-end cinematic experience. The choice of cities, including Mumbai and Jaipur, aligns with areas of high consumer spending power and international tourism appeal, which could lead to increased footfall and revenue for IMAX.From a market penetration perspective, IMAX's continued investment in India is a response to the competitive landscape where multiplexes are continuously upgrading their technology to enhance customer experience. This move could potentially increase IMAX's market share and strengthen its brand presence. It also indicates a bullish outlook on the Indian entertainment sector, which has shown resilience and growth despite global economic fluctuations. Financial Analyst The announcement of IMAX's largest expansion in India in five years could be seen as a positive indicator for investors, signaling growth and confidence in the Indian market. The record-breaking revenue figures from the previous year, particularly the success of Indian language films in IMAX format, suggest that there is a profitable niche for IMAX's premium offerings. This could translate into a steady stream of revenue, bolstered by the novelty of the IMAX with Laser systems and the strategic location choices.However, investors should consider the capital expenditure involved in establishing these high-tech systems and any potential impact on short-term profitability. Long-term, the investment in technology and partnerships could pay off by setting IMAX apart from competitors and driving customer loyalty. The deal with Miraj Cinemas also diversifies IMAX's portfolio within India, mitigating risks associated with market volatility. Entertainment Industry Analyst The introduction of IMAX with Laser technology in India is a significant upgrade in the cinematic experience, which could redefine the standards for movie theaters in the region. IMAX's choice to revamp the iconic IMAX Wadala and to enter Jaipur, a new market for them, shows a targeted approach to both nostalgic moviegoers and untapped audiences. The technological advancements of the 4k laser projection system could set a new benchmark for competitors, potentially leading to a tech race in the cinema industry within India.Furthermore, the partnership with Miraj Cinemas could facilitate cross-promotional opportunities and leverage Miraj's existing customer base. This symbiotic relationship might lead to increased marketability for both entities, with IMAX benefiting from Miraj's local expertise and Miraj gaining from the international prestige associated with the IMAX brand. 04/10/2024 - 01:30 PM New Collaboration Marks IMAX's Largest Agreement for New Locations in India in Five Years LAS VEGAS, April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IMAX Corporation (NYSE: IMAX) and Miraj Cinemas today announced an exciting new partnership, agreeing to install three new state-of-the-art IMAX® with Laser systems at key locations across India. This deal marks the first-ever collaboration between the two companies and IMAX's largest expansion in India in five years. Miraj Cinemas will add three new IMAX systems to key locations across India, including one in Mumbai – set to open in 2024 – one in Jaipur, and a third location to be determined at a later date. Under the deal, the Mumbai system will be located in the former iconic IMAX Wadala, which was the first IMAX location to open in India in 2003 until its closure in 2023. The deal also brings the first-ever IMAX system to the city of Jaipur, a historically significant and internationally popular tourist destination. The announcement was made today at the annual CinemaCon 2024 exhibition conference in Las Vegas.

""At Miraj, we know our audiences want larger-than-life movie experiences, and we look forward to partnering with IMAX to bring The IMAX Experience to new locations in the country, including non-metro cities.""

Last year was also the highest grossing year for Indian language films for IMAX, delivering over $15.7 million across the company's global network. Moviegoers have shown an increasing appetite for IMAX in India – ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" are the first and second-highest grossing IMAX film in the region, and three recent Indian language films – ""K.G.F: Chapter 2"", ""Jawan"" and ""Pathaan"" – are among the top ten highest grossing titles ever in the country. The three new Miraj Cinemas locations will be equipped with IMAX with Laser, IMAX's most advanced experience. IMAX with Laser has been developed from the ground-up to deliver crystal clear, lifelike images and precision audio for a moviegoing experience unlike anything else.

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Great Ajax Corp. (AJX) sets a record date for its 2024 stockholders' meeting to vote on strategic transaction with Rithm Capital Corp. The Meeting will address various key actions including stock issuance, director elections, and management agreements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Great Ajax Corp. regarding the upcoming stockholder meeting to vote on a strategic transaction with Rithm Capital Corp. is significant for current and potential investors. The request for approval to issue common stock beyond the 19.99% cap suggests a substantial equity transaction that could dilute existing shareholders' interests. This is particularly noteworthy as it requires stockholder consent due to NYSE regulations designed to protect investor interests.The potential 'change of control' indicates a significant shift in company ownership, which could result in changes to the strategic direction, operational control and overall governance of Great Ajax Corp. The market often reacts to such news with increased volatility in the company's stock price as investors reassess the company's future prospects.Moreover, the decision to enter into a Management Agreement with RCM GA Manager LLC for external management services could signal a strategic pivot towards outsourcing certain operations, which might affect operating margins and the company's cost structure in the long term. Legal Expert The legal implications of the proposed amendments to Great Ajax Corp.'s Equity Incentive Plan and the election of directors are critical for ensuring regulatory compliance and governance standards. The adoption of Amendment No. 1 to the Equity Incentive Plan will have implications for executive compensation, potentially affecting how the company attracts and retains key personnel.Furthermore, the election of four directors is a significant event as it impacts the board's composition and the future strategic decisions of the company. It's essential for the board to maintain a balance of skills and experience to navigate the company through the upcoming changes and to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the strategic transaction between Great Ajax Corp. and Rithm Capital Corp. can reshape the competitive landscape within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. The issuance of additional common stock and warrants as part of the transaction could be an indicator of the company's growth strategy, potentially expanding its asset portfolio or gaining new market capabilities.The market will closely monitor the outcome of the stockholder meeting, as the approval of these proposals could signal confidence in the company's direction or, conversely, lead to uncertainty if the transaction is viewed unfavorably.

Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 01:00 PM Open to Government, Educational, Nonprofit Organizations; Deadline to Apply is June 7 OAKLAND, Calif., April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The PG&E Corporation Foundation (PG&E Foundation) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) are now accepting applications for their Better Together Nature Positive Innovation and Resilience Hubs grant programs totaling $900,000 this year for projects and initiatives dedicated to environmental stewardship and climate resilience. Better Together Nature Positive Innovation Grant For 2024, the PG&E Foundation's Better Together Nature Positive Innovation Grant program will award up to $500,000 total — in five $100,000 regional grants — to fund projects focused on land stewardship, air quality, and water stewardship. One grant will be awarded for each of PG&E's five regions: North Valley and Sierra, North Coast, Bay Area, South Bay and Central Coast, and Central Valley. The Nature Positive Innovation Grant program, now in its third year, is part of a commitment to fund projects supporting environmental stewardship in communities PG&E serves across Northern and Central California. The program helps communities mobilize around and invest in solutions that address challenges facing the natural environment. The program is designed to support innovative and replicable resilient solutions that can be shared widely to build more sustainable habitats and communities. Resilience Hubs Grant In addition, the PG&E Resilience Hubs Grant program, now in its fourth year, is designed to help communities create a physical space or set of resources that supports community resilience — such as access to power, shelter, and information — to climate-driven disruptions, including wildfires and Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events. Once developed, these ""resilience hubs"" can also be accessed year-round as a community resource. [See a video of a climate-resilience project in Richmond.] For 2024, the PG&E Resilience Hubs Grant program will award $400,000 total at both the $25,000 and $100,000 level. These grants will be funded by PG&E Corporation shareholders as part of PG&E's investments in statewide wildfire resiliency and response, in accordance with a mandate from the California Public Utilities Commission. ""Climate change is affecting our environment and communities today, and the impacts are accelerating,"" said Carla Peterman, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer for PG&E Corporation and Chair of the Board of The PG&E Corporation Foundation. ""Our Nature Positive Innovation and Resilience Hubs grant programs are dedicated to helping the hometowns and customers we serve meet these challenges. Together, we can be stewards of our environment by developing forward-thinking, sustainable and equitable strategies benefitting our communities and setting examples that others throughout our state can follow."" Priority for both grant programs will be given to projects that address the needs of disadvantaged and/or vulnerable communities. Strategies and solutions resulting from the grants will be made publicly available to help all communities and encourage local and regional partnerships. Better Together Nature Positive Innovation proposals may cover any stage of an environmental stewardship project, including but not limited to planning, construction, design, education, and coordination. Resilience Hub proposals may include conducting a feasibility analysis to assess resilience hub needs through local engagement, planning and design of physical spaces, mobile resources that will provide community resilience, or retrofits of existing buildings or structures to support community resilience. To be eligible, applicants to either program must be a governmental organization (including tribal governments), educational institution, or 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. The deadline to apply for both grant programs is June 7, 2024.

In the case of Barrett Business Services, Inc., the intention to improve trading efficiency and share accessibility suggests an effort to increase liquidity and marketability of the stock. Historically, stock splits have been perceived positively by the market, as they often signal a company's confidence in its future performance.However, it's important to note that a stock split does not fundamentally change a company's valuation. The market cap remains the same, as the number of shares increases while the price per share decreases proportionally. Investors should consider the company's recent performance, including earnings growth and market position, to evaluate the potential long-term benefits of the split. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Barrett Business Services' decision to pursue a stock split following a period of strong earnings and a high stock price could be an attempt to capitalize on positive momentum. A higher number of authorized shares also provides the company with flexibility for future corporate actions, such as acquisitions, equity financing, or further stock dividends. The move requires shareholder approval, which is a standard governance practice, ensuring that the interests of the shareholders are considered.Investors should monitor the outcome of the upcoming annual meeting, as failure to approve the charter amendment could impact the stock's performance. Additionally, the market's reaction to the split, once executed, can provide insights into investor sentiment regarding the company's valuation and growth prospects. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the increase in authorized shares of common stock is a noteworthy change that requires a formal amendment to the company's charter. This process involves regulatory filings and shareholder voting, reflecting due diligence and adherence to corporate law. The need for stockholder approval highlights the democratic aspect of corporate governance, where significant changes to the company's capital structure are not made unilaterally.Investors should be aware of the legal implications of such amendments, as they can affect shareholder rights and the company's ability to issue new shares. The timing and execution of the stock split, contingent upon this approval, are also legally binding and must be communicated transparently to the shareholders and the market. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM VANCOUVER, Wash., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrett Business Services, Inc.

Rallybio Announces Collaboration to Advance Therapeutic Solutions for Pregnant Individuals at Risk of Fetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT),2024-04-10T20:01:00.000Z,High,Neutral,"Rallybio partners with Johnson & Johnson to develop therapies for FNAIT, receives $6.6 million investment. RLYB212 aims to prevent FNAIT in pregnant individuals. Phase 2 study planned for 2024.","Rallybio Announces Collaboration to Advance Therapeutic Solutions for Pregnant Individuals at Risk of Fetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Rallybio partners with Johnson & Johnson to develop therapies for FNAIT, receives $6.6 million investment. RLYB212 aims to prevent FNAIT in pregnant individuals. Phase 2 study planned for 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Rallybio Corporation's collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, alongside a $6.6 million equity investment, is a significant development that merits attention from a financial perspective. This collaboration is poised to enhance Rallybio's financial stability and provide additional capital that can be allocated towards the development of RLYB212, a potential therapeutic for FNAIT. The partnership with a pharmaceutical giant like Johnson & Johnson not only infuses Rallybio with capital but also offers a strategic advantage in terms of market reach and credibility in the biotech industry.Investors should note the potential for additional payments under the collaboration, which could lead to further financial benefits for Rallybio. The equity investment and subsequent funding can also be seen as a vote of confidence in Rallybio's technology and market potential. From a stock market perspective, such collaborations often lead to positive investor sentiment and can drive Rallybio's stock price upward, assuming that the market perceives this partnership and the development of RLYB212 favorably. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research standpoint, the collaboration between Rallybio and Johnson & Johnson is a strategic move that could accelerate the development of therapies for FNAIT, a rare but serious condition. RLYB212's unique position as the only reported investigational therapy for non-alloimmunized individuals at risk of FNAIT underscores its potential impact on the market. The Phase 2 dose confirmation study planned for the second half of 2024 will be critical in determining the efficacy and safety of RLYB212, which, if successful, could lead to a new standard of care for FNAIT prevention.Furthermore, the collaboration's focus on raising awareness and emphasizing the importance of screening could lead to earlier detection and treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes. As such, the medical community and potential stakeholders should closely monitor the progress of this collaboration and the clinical development of RLYB212, as it represents a significant advancement in addressing an unmet medical need. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market dynamics for rare disease treatments is essential when evaluating the impact of Rallybio's recent collaboration. The market for FNAIT therapies is niche, yet it holds a high value due to the lack of available treatments. Rallybio's strategic partnership with Johnson & Johnson could enhance its market penetration capabilities and drive the adoption of RLYB212 upon successful development and approval. The investment in awareness initiatives is also a tactful approach to create a receptive market environment for the new therapy.Moreover, the collaboration's potential to expand treatment options to a broader range of patients—both alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized—could effectively increase the target market size for Rallybio. This inclusive strategy is likely to be well-received by the patient community and healthcare providers, potentially leading to a stronger demand for RLYB212 if it is approved for use. 04/10/2024 - 04:01 PM - Rallybio to Receive Funding for FNAIT Awareness Initiative and Equity Investment from Johnson & Johnson - NEW HAVEN, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rallybio Corporation (Nasdaq: RLYB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to identifying and accelerating the development of life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases, today announced a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson1 to support the development of complementary therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing the risk of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). In addition, Rallybio received an equity investment of $6.6 million from Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc. Rallybio is developing RLYB212, a novel human monoclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody designed to prevent pregnant individuals from alloimmunizing2, thereby eliminating the risk of FNAIT and its potentially devastating consequences in their fetuses and newborns. Rallybio is on track to initiate a Phase 2 dose confirmation study for RLYB212 in pregnant individuals at higher risk of alloimmunization and FNAIT in the second half of 2024. Under this collaboration, Johnson & Johnson will provide funding for Rallybio to raise awareness of Johnson & Johnson’s FNAIT clinical program in connection with Rallybio’s ongoing FNAIT natural history study. Rallybio is also eligible to receive additional payments under the collaboration. RLYB212 is the only investigational therapy currently reported to be in clinical development to address the needs of pregnant individuals at risk of FNAIT who have not alloimmunized2. Johnson & Johnson is conducting a Phase 3 study of nipocalimab, an investigational monoclonal antibody targeting FcRn, in pregnant individuals who are already alloimmunized. As these individuals have the alloantibodies that can cause FNAIT, preventative treatment with RLYB212 would not be appropriate. “We are thrilled to be working with Johnson & Johnson on our mission to eliminate FNAIT,” said Stephen Uden, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Rallybio. “Our complementary approaches, if successful, would ensure that pregnant individuals at risk of developing FNAIT have a potential treatment option – regardless of their alloimmunization status. Together, we can more effectively and expeditiously drive awareness of FNAIT, emphasize the importance of screening pregnant individuals for their risk of developing FNAIT, and advance our complementary therapeutic approaches.” Rallybio is currently conducting a natural history study designed to provide a contemporary dataset for HPA-1a alloimmunization frequency in a racially and ethnically diverse population that is intended to support a future RLYB212 registration study. Pregnant individuals who are already alloimmunized are not eligible for inclusion in Rallybio’s natural history study, nor for potential preventative treatment with Rallybio’s investigational therapeutic, RLYB212. About FNAIT Fetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a potentially life-threatening rare disease that can cause uncontrolled bleeding in fetuses and newborns. FNAIT can arise during pregnancy due to an immune incompatibility between an expectant mother and her fetus in a platelet antigen. When alloimmunization occurs in an expectant mother, the antibodies that develop in the mother can cross the placenta and destroy platelets in the fetus. The destruction of platelets in the fetus can result in severely low platelet counts, or thrombocytopenia, and potentially lead to devastating consequences including miscarriage, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or severe lifelong neurological disability in those babies who survive. There is currently no approved therapy for the prevention or prenatal treatment of FNAIT. About Rallybio Rallybio (Nasdaq: RLYB) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop and commercialize life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases. Rallybio has built a broad pipeline of promising product candidates aimed at addressing diseases with unmet medical need in areas of maternal fetal health, complement dysregulation, hematology, and metabolic disorders. The Company has two clinical stage programs: RLYB212, an anti-HPA-1a antibody for the prevention of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) and RLYB116, an inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5), with the potential to treat several diseases of complement dysregulation, as well as additional programs in preclinical development.

Personal data compromised includes usernames, hashed passwords, contact details, and more. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst The incident involving Xfinity/Comcast represents a significant security failure with potential financial and reputational repercussions. The breach of over 35.8 million customer records not only undermines consumer trust but also exposes the company to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines under data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA. The exposure of sensitive data, including partial social security numbers, could lead to identity theft and fraud, which in turn may result in an increase in customer churn and legal costs. Furthermore, the market often reacts negatively to such events, potentially affecting the stock price. It's essential for investors to monitor the company's response, including the steps taken to enhance security measures and support affected customers. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the immediate costs for Xfinity/Comcast will likely include forensic investigations, enhanced security deployments, legal fees and customer notifications. There may also be longer-term financial impacts such as compensatory measures for affected customers, including credit monitoring services and potential class-action lawsuits. These expenses can affect the company's bottom line and may be reflected in future financial statements. Additionally, the breach could impact customer acquisition and retention rates, influencing revenue projections. Investors should assess the adequacy of the company's cyber risk insurance and evaluate the management's track record in cybersecurity to gauge future risk. Market Research Analyst Market perception is a critical factor in the aftermath of a data breach. Customers may seek alternative providers if they perceive that their data is not safe, which can erode Xfinity/Comcast's market share. It's important to analyze the competitive landscape and the availability of substitutes for consumers. The company's market position could be weakened if competitors leverage this incident to their advantage by emphasizing their own security measures. In the long term, how Xfinity/Comcast manages brand recovery and customer confidence will be pivotal. Effective communication and transparency with stakeholders can mitigate some of the negative market impacts. 04/10/2024 - 12:15 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2024 / Xfinity/Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) recently suffered a massive data breach affecting more than 35.8 million Xfinity customers.

Receives Notification of Deficiency from Nasdaq Regarding Timely Filing of Interim Report on Form 6-K Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Warrantee Inc. (WRNT) received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq for not filing its interim report on time. The company has 60 days to submit a plan to regain compliance and can be granted up to 180 days to do so. The stock's listing on Nasdaq is not immediately affected. Positive None. Negative The non-compliance notice could potentially impact investor confidence in the company's governance and financial reporting practices. Market Research Analyst The notice of non-compliance received by Warrantee Inc. from Nasdaq due to the delay in filing its interim report indicates potential operational or internal control issues. Investors often scrutinize such delays as they may hint at underlying problems such as financial discrepancies, management inefficiency, or audit complications. While the immediate impact on the trading of Warrantee's American Depositary Shares is stated to be non-existent, the market's reaction could differ. Share prices can be sensitive to perceptions of a company's administrative competence and transparency.Historically, companies that fail to meet filing deadlines are subjected to increased scrutiny and may face a lack of investor confidence, leading to a decline in share value. The 60-day window provided to Warrantee to submit a compliance plan is critical. A well-structured and timely plan can mitigate negative market reactions. Conversely, failure to address the issue promptly could result in further regulatory actions and potential de-listing, which typically has a substantial negative impact on stock prices. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the delay in Warrantee's interim report filing could be indicative of several issues, including potential revisions to financial statements or unexpected financial results. This delay introduces uncertainty, which financial markets generally dislike. Investors and analysts rely on interim reports to gauge a company's financial health and make informed decisions. The absence of this information can lead to speculation and volatility in the company's stock.Furthermore, the company's ability to regain compliance within the Nasdaq's stipulated period will be closely monitored by investors as an indicator of management's capability to resolve reporting issues. If Warrantee manages to file within the 60-day period, the negative impact may be limited. However, extended delays could suggest deeper financial or operational issues, potentially affecting long-term investor sentiment and the company's cost of capital. Legal Expert The legal implications of Warrantee's non-compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5250(c)(2) are significant. Nasdaq's rules are designed to maintain fair and orderly markets and to protect investors and the public interest. Non-compliance can lead to several legal outcomes, including the submission of a compliance plan, additional reporting requirements, or in severe cases, de-listing.It is essential for Warrantee to address the non-compliance issue swiftly to avoid further legal complications. The company's proactive disclosure in line with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b) demonstrates an awareness of regulatory obligations, which may be viewed positively by regulators. However, continued non-compliance could lead to enforcement actions by the SEC, which could be detrimental to the company's reputation and legal standing. 04/10/2024 - 04:05 PM Tokyo, Japan, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Warrantee Inc.

EBITDA of $0.8 million and $4.2 million reported for the periods. Strong cash position of $20.4 million as of February 29, 2024. Progress in Sky Ranch Master Planned Community development with multiple phases under construction. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Pure Cycle Corporation indicate a sustained positive trajectory with nineteen consecutive quarters of net income. This performance is a testament to the company's operational efficiency and strategic growth in its Sky Ranch Master Planned Community, as well as its water and wastewater segments. The significant increase in water sales to oil and gas customers, which contributed to a 127% rise in revenue over six months, suggests a robust demand in this sector, potentially tied to favorable market conditions or an expansion of Pure Cycle's customer base. Investors should note the company's ability to capitalize on these opportunities, which may indicate a strong competitive position and operational agility.From a financial standpoint, the EBITDA figures, with a substantial increase from the previous year, provide a clearer picture of the company's profitability by excluding non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization. The company's working capital and cash reserves are healthy, which suggests financial stability and the potential for future investments or expansions. However, investors should be mindful of the inherent volatility in the oil and gas sector, which could impact water sales revenue. Additionally, the progression of lot development and the increase in single-family rental units reflect a diversification strategy that could mitigate risks associated with any single revenue stream. Real Estate Development Analyst Pure Cycle's development of the Sky Ranch Master Planned Community is a significant driver of its financial success. The phased development approach, currently in phases 2A through 2C, allows for a continuous revenue stream as each phase is built out and sold. This methodical rollout is indicative of prudent project management and a strong understanding of market demand. The near completion of Phase 2A and the forecasted revenue from Phase 2 tap fees suggest that Pure Cycle is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing need for residential development in its market area.However, the land development sector presents risks such as construction delays or market downturns, which could affect lot sales and, consequently, revenue recognition. The company's forward-looking statements about lot delivery schedules and the expansion of the single-family rental segment reflect confidence in the ongoing demand for housing. Investors should consider the potential long-term benefits of rental income, which can provide a stable cash flow and enhance the company's financial resilience against cyclical real estate markets. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in water and wastewater revenue, particularly from oil and gas customers, could reflect broader industry trends such as increased drilling activity or a rise in hydraulic fracturing, which requires significant water resources. The ability of Pure Cycle to meet this demand speaks to its strategic positioning within the water resource market. The company's diversification into land development and single-family rentals is a strategic move that could buffer against the volatility of the oil and gas sector while creating new revenue streams.Looking at the operational summary, the sharp increase in water deliveries to 1,028 acre-feet over six months underscores the company's operational capacity to scale up in response to increased demand. The decrease in tap sales could be attributed to the timing of construction and is not necessarily indicative of a negative trend. Investors should keep an eye on the development of Phase 2C and the potential for increased tap sales, which could significantly impact future earnings. 04/10/2024 - 04:00 PM DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2024 / Pure Cycle Corporation (NASDAQ Capital Market:PCYO) announced its financial results for the three and six months ended February 29, 2024.

For the six months ended February 29, 2024, and February 28, 2023, we sold 15 and 39 water or water and wastewater taps for $0.6 million and $1.1 million. We have sold 723 water and wastewater taps at Sky Ranch in Phases 1 and 2A. Based on current prices and engineering estimates, we believe Phase 2 of Sky Ranch will exceed $20.0 million in additional water and wastewater tap fee revenue and cash over the next 3-5 years.As of February 29, 2024, the first development phase (509 lots) is complete and the second development phase (874 lots) is being developed in four subphases, referred to as Phase 2A (229 lots), Phase 2B (211 lots), Phase 2C (228 lots) and Phase 2D (206 lots). As of February 29, 2024, Phase 2A is approximately 96% complete and Phase 2B is approximately 52% complete. Phase 2A is substantially completed with some landscaping items remaining, and Phase 2B is expected to be complete by the end of Pure Cycle's fiscal 2024. Phase 2C construction has begun but has not met revenue recognition criteria as of February 29, 2024.As of February 29, 2024, the single-family rental business had 14 homes built and rented in Sky Ranch and 17 additional homes forecasted for construction in Phase 2B. As noted in the prior quarters, due to the overwhelming demand for rental homes at Sky Ranch, we expect to have a total of 93 homes in Phase 2 with the ability to add more than 200 homes as Sky Ranch builds out.""Our land development schedule is lining up to allow for continuous lot deliveries in the second half of 2024 and into fiscal 2025,"" commented Marc Spezialy, CFO of Pure Cycle. ""We are currently developing on three Phases within our Sky Ranch Master Planned Community, due to continued strong demand. We are also excited to begin construction on our next phase of single-family rentals which will more than double the number of units we have to rent once Phase 2B is completed,"" concluded Mr. Spezialy.Working CapitalWe reported working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $19.9 million as of February 29, 2024, with $20.4 million of cash and cash equivalents.Q2 and YTD 2024 Operational SummaryWater and Wastewater Resource DevelopmentWater deliveries increased for the three months ended February 29, 2024, to 404 acre-feet delivered as compared to 33 acre-feet delivered in Q2 2023, primarily due to increased sales to oil and gas operators and new Sky Ranch customers. Water deliveries increased for the six months ended February 29, 2024, to a record 1,028 acre-feet delivered as compared to 242 acre-feet delivered in same period of 2023. Oil and gas operations are highly variable and dependent on oil prices, demand for gas, and timing of development of other leases in our service areas; however, our current expectation is for continued strong demand for oil and gas water sales through 2024. As Sky Ranch continues to develop, we anticipate continued growth in our residential water and wastewater service revenues. Water and wastewater tap sales decreased in Q2 2024 and YTD 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the timing of closings at Sky Ranch. Tap sales are driven by building permit applications and are not contractually established with the builders.Land DevelopmentLot sales revenue decreased slightly in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023 due to timing of construction in Sky Ranch for Phase 2B and not reaching a certain milestone in the development of Phase 2C to begin revenue recognition. Because lot sale revenue is recognized as construction progresses, revenue will fluctuate due to timing of construction activities.Single Family RentalsQ1 2024 represented our first quarter of rental income for our 14 completed homes.

Vertex Enters Into Agreement to Acquire Alpine Immune Sciences,2024-04-10T20:01:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Vertex Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Alpine Immune Sciences for $4.9 Billion: A Strategic Move in Immunotherapy,"Vertex Enters Into Agreement to Acquire Alpine Immune Sciences Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Vertex Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Alpine Immune Sciences for $4.9 Billion: A Strategic Move in Immunotherapy Positive Vertex Pharmaceuticals will acquire Alpine Immune Sciences for $4.9 billion in cash. The acquisition is aimed at leveraging Alpine's lead molecule, povetacicept, for IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune diseases. Povetacicept has shown promising results in Phase 2 development for IgA nephropathy. Alpine's expertise in protein engineering and immunotherapy aligns with Vertex's strategic goals. The transaction is expected to close later in the quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. Vertex will pay $65 per share for Alpine, totaling approximately $4.9 billion. The acquisition signifies Vertex's focus on transformative medicines for specialty markets with high unmet needs. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences by Vertex Pharmaceuticals at $65 per share, totaling approximately $4.9 billion, represents a significant strategic move in the biotech industry. This purchase price suggests a strong belief in the value of Alpine's pipeline, especially povetacicept's potential in treating IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and other autoimmune diseases. The deal structure, an all-cash tender offer, indicates Vertex's commitment to a swift and decisive transaction, which is often viewed favorably by the market due to the immediate liquidity provided to shareholders.From a financial standpoint, the acquisition's impact on Vertex's balance sheet and future earnings needs to be assessed. The $4.6 billion net of estimated cash acquired implies a substantial investment, which could affect Vertex's financial leverage and cash reserves. Investors should consider how this acquisition aligns with Vertex's long-term strategy and whether the expected revenue from povetacicept, pending successful Phase 3 trials and commercialization, justifies the upfront cost.Furthermore, the timing of the deal's closure and the potential integration challenges are critical factors that can influence the short-term performance of Vertex's stock. The market's reaction will likely hinge on confidence in Vertex's ability to realize synergies and effectively capitalize on Alpine's immunotherapy expertise. Medical Research Analyst Povetacicept's role as a dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist positions it as a promising therapeutic candidate for IgAN, a disease with no approved treatments targeting the underlying cause. The potential for povetacicept to serve as a 'pipeline-in-a-product' by addressing various autoimmune conditions increases its value proposition. The anticipation of a Phase 3 clinical trial in the latter half of 2024 will be a critical milestone for both companies and could significantly impact Vertex's product portfolio if successful.Given the prevalence of IgAN and the lack of targeted therapies, povetacicept's market potential is considerable. However, the success of the drug is contingent on the outcome of the Phase 3 trials. Investors should monitor the progress of the clinical studies, as positive results could lead to substantial revenue streams for Vertex, while any setbacks could have negative implications.It's also important to note that the biotech sector is inherently risky, with high rates of clinical trial failure. The acquisition price reflects Vertex's confidence, but the inherent risks of drug development should not be underestimated. Market Research Analyst Vertex's acquisition of Alpine signals a strategic expansion into new therapeutic areas, potentially diversifying Vertex's portfolio beyond its current focus areas. The deal underscores the high value placed on innovative treatments in specialty markets with unmet medical needs. As povetacicept targets a common kidney disease with significant patient populations, the commercial opportunity upon successful development and approval could be transformative for Vertex.For stakeholders, the immediate question is how this acquisition will affect Vertex's market position and competitive edge in the immunotherapy space. The addition of Alpine's protein engineering capabilities could enhance Vertex's research and development efficiency, potentially leading to a faster drug development pipeline and quicker time-to-market for new therapies. This could provide Vertex with a competitive advantage in attracting investors looking for growth opportunities in the biotech sector.Long-term, the acquisition could establish Vertex as a leader in autoimmune therapies if povetacicept and other pipeline assets live up to their potential. The ability to leverage Alpine's immunotherapy expertise could be a key factor in driving innovation and sustaining growth in a highly competitive market. 04/10/2024 - 04:01 PM - Alpine is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies - - Alpine’s lead product, povetacicept, demonstrated best-in-class potential in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN); Phase 3 to initiate in H2 2024 - - Povetacicept holds promise as a pipeline-in-a-product, with clinical studies in additional serious diseases underway - - Alpine’s protein engineering and immunotherapy expertise augments Vertex’s toolbox and capabilities - - Vertex to host investor call today, April 10, at 4:30 pm ET - BOSTON & SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) and Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALPN), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Vertex will acquire Alpine for $65 per share or approximately $4.9 billion in cash. The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Vertex and Alpine Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close later this quarter. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240410918915/en/ Alpine’s lead molecule, povetacicept (ALPN-303), is a highly potent and effective dual antagonist of BAFF (B cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation inducing ligand). Through Phase 2 development, povetacicept has shown potential best-in-class efficacy in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). IgAN is a serious, progressive, autoimmune disease of the kidney that can lead to end-stage-renal disease. There are no approved therapies that target the underlying cause of IgAN. IgAN is the most common cause of primary (idiopathic) glomerulonephritis worldwide, affecting approximately 130,000 people in the U.S. Povetacicept is on track to enter Phase 3 clinical development in the second half of 2024. Due to its mechanism of action as a dual BAFF/APRIL antagonist, povetacicept holds the potential to benefit patients with other serious autoimmune diseases of the kidney, such as membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis, as well as autoimmune cytopenias. Clinical studies in renal indications and autoimmune cytopenias are ongoing. “Alpine is a compelling strategic fit for Vertex and furthers our ambition of using scientific innovation to create transformative medicines targeting serious diseases with high unmet need in specialty markets,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., FASN, Chief Executive Officer and President of Vertex. “We look forward to welcoming the talented Alpine team to Vertex and believe that together we can bring povetacicept, a potential best-in-class treatment for IgAN to patients faster. We also look forward to fully exploring povetacicept’s potential as a ‘pipeline-in-a-product' and adding Alpine’s protein engineering and immunotherapy capabilities to Vertex’s toolbox.” “Today’s announcement marks a new chapter for Alpine,” said Mitchell H. Gold, M.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alpine. “It became clear during our discussions with the Vertex team that we share many core values, including a commitment to patients, our employees, and an intense drive for innovation. Povetacicept has demonstrated potential best-in-class attributes in IgA nephropathy and has broad development potential across a number of other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions with significant unmet need. We look forward to the opportunity, now more than ever, to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients worldwide as part of Vertex.” Transaction Terms Under the terms of the merger agreement, Vertex will acquire Alpine for $65 per share in cash, for a total equity value of approximately $4.9 billion, or approximately $4.6 billion net of estimated cash acquired. A subsidiary of Vertex will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Alpine common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Alpine common stock and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Advisors Lazard is acting as financial advisor to Vertex. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is serving as legal counsel to Vertex. For Alpine, Centerview Partners is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Fenwick & West LLP as legal counsel. About IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) IgAN is a serious, progressive, life-threatening chronic kidney disease that is the most common cause of primary (idiopathic) glomerulonephritis, affecting people worldwide including approximately 130,000 people in the U.S. IgAN is thought to result from deposition of circulating immune complexes consisting of immunoglobulins and galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A (Gd-IgA1) in the renal glomerular mesangium, triggering kidney injury and fibrosis. A high percentage of people with IgAN progress to end-stage renal disease. There are no approved therapies that target the underlying cause of IgAN. About Povetacicept (ALPN-303) Povetacicept (ALPN-303) is a dual antagonist of the BAFF (B cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation inducing ligand) cytokines, which play key roles in pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases via their roles in the activation, differentiation and/or survival of B cells, T cells and innate immune cells. Based upon an engineered TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) domain, povetacicept has higher binding affinity and greater potency in preclinical studies versus other inhibitors of BAFF and/or APRIL alone and has demonstrated potential best-in-class efficacy in a clinical trial in patients with IgA nephropathy. Povetacicept is also in development for multiple serious diseases including other autoimmune kidney diseases and autoimmune cytopenias. Povetacicept is targeted to enter Phase 3 in the second half of 2024. Alpine will provide updated clinical data from RUBY-3, a phase 1b/2a study of povetacicept to investors during a conference call scheduled for 5:15 pm ET today, April 10, 2024.

The collaboration introduces Flex service level for NetApp Volumes, offering more storage options and performance levels. The GenAI toolkit enables efficient RAG operations on Google Cloud Vertex AI platform, empowering organizations to generate valuable insights and automations. Positive None. Negative None. Cloud Computing Specialist The integration of Google Cloud and NetApp's new Flex service level represents a significant evolution in cloud storage solutions. The ability to scale storage volumes from one GiB to 100TiB, with performance scaling up to one GiB/s, is a substantial technical advancement. This scalability is particularly important for enterprises looking to leverage cloud for AI and other intensive workloads, as it provides the necessary infrastructure to handle large datasets without compromising performance.Furthermore, the collaboration enhances the value proposition of Google Cloud by incorporating NetApp's ONTAP technology. ONTAP's data management capabilities, including automated classification and tagging, as well as fast, scalable snapshots and real-time cloning, are essential for maintaining data integrity and accelerating time-to-insight in AI-driven operations. These features can lead to cost savings and operational efficiencies for businesses, as they enable more streamlined data pipelines and reduce the risk of data corruption or loss. Data Management Analyst The announcement of the GenAI toolkit and its integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform is a notable development for enterprises looking to harness the power of generative AI. The toolkit's reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation operations simplifies the implementation of complex AI data pipelines, which is a critical factor for businesses seeking to reduce the time and resources required to derive actionable insights from their data.The automated classification and tagging feature within NetApp’s BlueXP classification service is particularly noteworthy. By ensuring data cleanliness and policy adherence, it mitigates risks associated with handling sensitive information. This is especially important in industries with stringent compliance requirements, such as healthcare or finance. The ability to roll back to previous data versions or create real-time clones with ONTAP Snapshot and FlexClone technology also provides businesses with flexibility and security, enabling them to explore various scenarios and queries without affecting production data. AI Technology Analyst The potential impact of the expanded partnership on the field of generative AI cannot be overstated. By providing a more robust and flexible infrastructure, the collaboration between NetApp and Google Cloud could accelerate the development and deployment of generative AI applications. The ability to generate high-quality, ultra-relevant insights and automations is a game-changer for businesses seeking a competitive edge.As AI and machine learning workloads continue to grow in complexity and size, the importance of having a scalable and efficient data infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. The NetApp GenAI toolkit's emphasis on optimizing RAG processes aligns with the industry's need for more sophisticated tools that can handle the nuances of AI data management. This includes the necessity for quick iteration and deployment of AI models, which the toolkit appears to address through its architecture and data management capabilities. 04/10/2024 - 01:00 PM New Google Cloud NetApp Volumes capabilities and integrations make the cloud more secure and simple for key initiatives such as generative AI SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NetApp® (NASDAQ: NTAP), the intelligent data infrastructure company, today announced an expansion of its partnership with Google Cloud to make it easier for organizations to leverage their data for generative AI (GenAI) and other hybrid cloud workloads. NetApp and Google Cloud are announcing the Flex service level for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes which supports storage volumes of nearly any size. NetApp is also releasing a preview of its GenAI toolkit reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) operations using Google Cloud Vertex AI platform. More Flexible Data Storage Options for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes Google Cloud and NetApp are announcing a new service level for NetApp Volumes called Flex that gives customers more granular control to adapt their storage and performance to match the exact needs of their cloud workloads. “Increasing demand for data-intensive applications and insights has reinforced the need for a new approach to unified data storage that gives organizations the agility to move and store data wherever it is needed at any point in time,” said Pravjit Tiwana, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cloud Storage at NetApp. “By extending our collaboration with Google Cloud, we’re delivering a flexible form factor that can be run on existing infrastructure across Google Cloud system without any tradeoffs to enterprise data management capabilities.” With the addition of Flex, NetApp Volumes customers can choose from four service levels to leverage a fully managed file service built on NetApp ONTAPTM and operated by Google Cloud, including: Standard: highly available, general-purpose storage with advanced data management capabilities and 16MiB/sec per TiB of performance, which is recommended to support workloads such as file shares, virtual machines (VMs), and DevTest environments. Premium: highly available, high-performance storage with advanced data management capabilities and 64MiB/sec per TiB of performance, which is recommended for file shares, VMs, and databases. Extreme: highly available, low-latency, high-throughput storage with advanced data management capabilities and 128MiB/sec per TiB of performance, which is recommended for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) high-performance databases and low-latency applications. Flex: highly available storage volumes with scalability from one GiB to 100TiB and up to one GiB/s of performance depending on the size of the underlying storage pool. This adaptable service level can support a wide variety of use cases, including AI. “Google Cloud NetApp Volumes remains a critical component of every enterprise’s digital transformation strategy,” said Sameet Agarwal, GM/VP, Google Cloud Storage at Google Cloud. “Utilizing Google Cloud technologies, NetApp Volumes will power new capabilities that can improve how businesses operate and create real-world value for their organizations.” The Flex service level will be generally available by Q2 2024 across 15 Google Cloud regions, expanding to the other Google Cloud regions by the end of 2024. Unlocking Enterprise Data for Generative AI in Google Cloud NetApp is also releasing a preview of its GenAI toolkit with support for NetApp Volumes. This offering, along with the accompanying reference architecture, speeds the implementation of RAG operations while enabling secure, consistent, and automated workflows that securely connect data stored in NetApp Volumes with Google Cloud Vertex AI platform. The result is a greater ability to generate unique, high-quality, and ultra-relevant insights and automations. “As the intelligent data infrastructure company, we have unmatched capabilities to support data classification, tagging, mobility, and cloning for data wherever it lives so our customers can run efficient and secure AI data pipelines,” said Pravjit Tiwana, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cloud Storage at NetApp. “Building on our partnership with Google Cloud to streamline RAG enables customers to tap into market-leading AI services and models to generate a unique competitive advantage.” The NetApp GenAI toolkit helps optimize RAG processes with unique capabilities, including: Common data footprint everywhere: NetApp ONTAP allows customers to easily include data from any environment to power their RAG efforts with common operational processes while reducing risk, cost, and time to results. Automated classification and tagging: NetApp’s BlueXP classification service automatically tags data to support streamlined data cleansing for both the ingest and inferencing phases of the data pipeline, ensuring that the right data is used for queries and that sensitive data is not exposed to the model out of policy. Fast, scalable snapshots: ONTAP Snapshot delivers near-instant creation of space-efficient, in-place copies of vector stores and databases, allowing immediate roll back to a previous version if data is corrupted or forward if point-in-time analysis is needed. Real-time cloning at scale: ONTAP FlexClone technology can create instant clones of vector index stores to safely make uniquely relevant data instantly available for different queries for different users, without impacting the core production data. “GenAI is a tidal wave of opportunity for the companies that can effectively apply their data to their industry,” said Miles Ward, CTO at SADA, An Insight Company. “At SADA we are fired up about pairing our extensive expertise with NetApp and Vertex AI to help customers accelerate their AI journeys. Why generate uninformed chats when you could generate unique, specific, relevant insights?” The GenAI toolkit will be available as a public preview within the second half of 2024.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Rent the Runway Exceeds Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Guidance for Q4 2023, Anticipates Growth in FY 2024 Positive Rent the Runway exceeded revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q4 2023. The company expects revenue growth in FY 2024 through marketing, product innovation, and strong customer retention. Q4 2023 net loss was $(24.8) million with a net loss margin of (32.7)%, showing improvement from Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $11.2 million with a margin of 14.8%, up from Q4 2022. Rent the Runway aims to achieve free cash flow breakeven for FY 2024. The company reported historical high quarterly and annual sales in the resale business, driving strong adjusted EBITDA margins. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing Rent the Runway's financial performance for Q4 2023, we observe a marginal revenue increase juxtaposed with a reduced net loss year-over-year. This suggests efficiency gains, as evidenced by the improved adjusted EBITDA margin, which rose from 9.4% to 14.8%. However, the company still faces a significant net loss margin of (32.7)%. The focus on marketing and product innovation as drivers for future revenue growth is a common strategy, but its effectiveness will depend on execution and market response.The company's commitment to achieving free cash flow breakeven in FY 2024 is a positive signal to investors, as it implies a focus on sustainable growth and financial health. The reduction in net cash used in operating and investing activities from (31.0)% to (23.6)% of revenue further supports this commitment. Although the company's net loss has decreased, it remains substantial. Thus, the path to breakeven will likely require continued cost control and possibly additional revenue streams. Market Research Analyst The slight decline in active subscribers indicates a potential challenge in customer acquisition or retention, which is critical for subscription-based models like Rent the Runway. Despite this, the company reports a historical high in quarterly and annual sales in its resale business, suggesting that this segment could be a growing contributor to overall revenue. The increase in Subscription Net Promoter scores and customer loyalty is promising, as it may lead to higher lifetime value per customer.It's important to monitor the competitive landscape, as the fashion rental market is becoming increasingly crowded. Rent the Runway's strategy to focus on personalized services, such as the Concierge Program, could differentiate it from competitors. However, the effectiveness of the newly appointed Chief Marketing Officer in re-engaging the customer growth flywheel will be essential to watch in the coming quarters. Economist Macro-economic factors such as consumer spending trends and the overall health of the retail industry will impact Rent the Runway's performance. The company's ability to achieve free cash flow breakeven will likely be influenced by broader economic conditions. If discretionary spending contracts due to economic downturns, luxury services like fashion rentals may see reduced demand.On the other hand, if the economy remains stable or improves and if Rent the Runway successfully capitalizes on consumer trends towards sustainable fashion and the sharing economy, there could be a positive impact on its financial performance. The projected revenue growth of 1% to 6% for FY 2024 is modest and reflects cautious optimism, aligning with industry growth rates for luxury and subscription-based services. 04/10/2024 - 04:01 PM Exceeded Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Guidance for Q4 2023 Expect Revenue Growth in FY 2024 through Focus on Marketing, Product Innovation and Strong Customer Retention.

Key Business and Financial Metrics Active Subscribers is defined as the number of subscribers with an active membership as of the last day of any given period and excludes paused subscribers. Average Active Subscribers is defined as the mean of the beginning of quarter and end of quarter Active Subscribers for a quarterly period; and for other periods, represents the mean of the Average Active Subscribers of every quarter within that period. Gross Profit is defined as total revenue less costs related to activities to fulfill customer orders and rental product acquisition costs, presented as fulfillment and rental product depreciation and revenue share, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations. We depreciate owned apparel assets over three years and owned accessory assets over two years, net of 20% and 30% salvage values, respectively, and recognize the depreciation on a straight line basis and remaining cost of items when sold or retired on our consolidated statement of operations. Rental product depreciation expense is time-based and reflects all rental product items we own. We use Gross Profit and Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue, or Gross Margin, to measure the continued efficiency of our business after the cost of our products and fulfillment costs are included. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin. In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful in evaluating our performance and free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful in evaluating our performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure used by management to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage of our business prior to capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial metrics are not meant to be considered as indicators of our financial performance in isolation from or as a substitute for our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial metrics presented in this press release. For example, our non-GAAP financial metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial metrics differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude interest expense, rental product depreciation, other depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, write-off of liquidated rental product assets, certain non-recurring or one-time costs (see below footnotes to the reconciliation table), non-ordinary course legal expenses, restructuring charges, loss on asset impairment related to restructuring, income tax (benefit) expense, warrant liability revaluation gains / losses, debt extinguishment gains / losses, other income and expense, and other gains / losses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA calculated as a percentage of total revenue, net for a period. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities and net cash used in investing activities on a combined basis. Free cash flow margin is defined as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. The reconciliation of presented non-GAAP financial metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below. We encourage reviewing the reconciliation in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial metrics for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items, and may include other expenses, costs and non-recurring items. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow expectations for Q1 2024 and fiscal year 2024 (as applicable) to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, in particular, share-based compensation expense, and non-recurring expenses, which can have unpredictable fluctuations based on unforeseen activity that is out of our control and/or cannot reasonably be predicted.

These programs are designed to prepare local residents for entry-level trades roles to create a skilled and diverse pipeline of talent to support the clean energy transition in Illinois. ComEd’s collaboration with local workforce and community agencies to offer career and skills training programs is an essential component of building a diverse and skilled talent pipeline needed for the future. A recent study finds that as many as 150,000 jobs are expected to be created in Illinois by 2050 to support the state’s clean energy transition. “ComEd will need skilled workers to help us to continue building a grid of the future that meets our customers’ evolving energy needs,” said Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. “Through our strong coalition of partners, we’re proud to offer workforce development programs that will help people within our region’s diverse communities gain roles in maintaining and modernizing northern Illinois’ power infrastructure.” Both CONSTRUCT and Craft Academy programs increase the pool of qualified female and minority candidates for energy and construction jobs in Illinois by strengthening job readiness and life skills in addition to preparing for industry-required testing. Today’s graduates represent diverse backgrounds and come from across ComEd’s northern Illinois footprint; more than 90% of the graduates are people of color and 15 percent are women. CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy: Celebrating its 12th year preparing local residents for careers in the skilled trades, this year’s 69 CONSTRUCT participants join the more than 800 diverse program graduates, 70 percent of whom have landed jobs after graduation. During the 11-week program, participants earn industry certifications including a Class A CDL (Commercial Driver’s License) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) 10-hour safety training, prepare for the industry-required CAST (Construction and Skilled Trades) exam, and have the unique opportunity to shadow and learn from industry partners in construction and the utilities. Upon successful completion of the program, participants receive a stipend. “I’ve been a carpenter for four years but joining CONSTRUCT has made me realize the great variety of career opportunities that lie in the utilities, and how these are only bound to grow due to the clean energy transition,” said Surezz Hunter, 2024 CONSTRUCT graduate. “The kind of support we received throughout the program to ensure we’re ready to land stable jobs is really special. I look forward to expanding my skills in the trades and making my family proud.” Through a coalition of nearly 40 educational institutions, sponsoring companies, organized labor, and workforce community agencies, ComEd recruits, trains and helps match local residents to family-sustaining roles in construction and the trades. “Central States SER, Jobs for Progress Inc. is proud to work with ComEd in removing barriers and providing the tools and support needed for individuals to enter roles in the growing energy field,” said Hugo Avila, co-director of Central States SER/SERCO, Inc.. “The opportunity for community members to build their skills for careers that offer economic mobility is life-changing, and we couldn’t be happier to be playing a part in supporting CONSTRUCT.” ""We are proud to work together with ComEd in expanding career opportunities for more community members while building a stronger, more diverse workforce for the construction field,” said Stephanie Hickman, President and CEO of Trice Construction Company. “Through our partnership with ComEd and CONSTRUCT, we have had the privilege of welcoming talented individuals into our team, each bringing their unique skills, perspectives, and experiences to the table that will have a lasting impact on our communities."" Craft Academy: One of ComEd’s newest training programs, the Craft Academy, expanded this year from three weeks to five weeks to better prepare entry-level candidates for roles in the utilities and construction fields that require pole climbing and other physical attributes. Through class instruction and physical aptitude training, this year’s 9 participants were prepared to enter apprenticeship programs or entry-level field positions, including Construction Worker and Overhead Helper. Since 2022, ComEd has hired more than 400 entry-level workers through the continuous expansion of training opportunities such as CONSTRUCT and Craft Academy. By creating new industry pathways via introductory career training, focusing on certifications and industry knowledge, ComEd is preparing to meet future talent needs. Last year alone these programs, combined with STEM offerings, helped reach 3,500 residents.

The AEC-Q101 qualification of the automotive-grade TVS suggests that Vishay is targeting this lucrative segment and is well-aligned with industry quality standards.However, the lead time of 12 weeks could be a potential drawback in an industry where speed to market is critical. It will be important for Vishay to manage its supply chain effectively to meet the expected demand and minimize potential disruptions that could arise from such lead times. Financial Analyst Vishay Intertechnology's launch of the new TVS series could have a positive impact on their financial performance, given the broad application range of these components. The adoption of these TVS devices across various sectors could lead to an increase in sales volume, potentially improving the company's revenue. Moreover, the operational efficiencies gained from the AOI-compatible wettable flanks could lead to margin improvements over time.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of these new components, as it will be a key indicator of Vishay's competitive positioning in the semiconductor market. It's also important to consider the company's ability to scale production and maintain quality, as any issues here could affect the brand's reputation and financial outcomes.In the context of the broader market, Vishay's innovation in component design and commitment to sustainability may enhance its appeal to environmentally conscious investors, possibly influencing its stock performance positively. 04/10/2024 - 11:00 AM Featuring Compact 3.8 mm by 2.0 mm Footprint, Low 0.88 mm Profile, and Wettable Flanks, Space-Saving Devices Offer Operating Temperatures to +185 °CMALVERN, Pa., April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

The agreement includes the rollout of thirteen premium meal options, emphasizing quality, nutrition, and sustainability. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The agreement between Blue Star Foods Corp. and the U.S. Military, facilitated by Eagle Rising, represents a strategic move within the food supply sector with potential economic and stock implications. The partnership aligns with the current trend of government contracts being awarded to companies with strong ESG credentials, which could position Blue Star favorably in the eyes of investors concerned with sustainable and ethical operations.The rollout to military bases signifies a substantial increase in demand for Blue Star's products, which could lead to an uptick in production and potentially boost the company's financial performance. The emphasis on locally sourced ingredients and the production of meals within the U.S. could resonate with patriotic sentiments and may also contribute to a positive public image, potentially attracting socially conscious investors.However, the success of this rollout and its impact on Blue Star's bottom line will depend on the company's ability to scale operations efficiently and manage the increased logistical demands. The long-term benefits will be contingent on the ongoing satisfaction of the military with the meal options provided and the potential for renewal or expansion of the contract. Financial Analyst Blue Star Foods Corp.'s announcement of a supply agreement with the U.S. Military has immediate implications for the company's financial outlook. The deal is likely to lead to a predictable and stable revenue stream over the contract period, which is a positive indicator for investors. The diversification of Blue Star's revenue sources, with the addition of a government contract, may reduce the company's risk profile.Investors will be monitoring the initial costs associated with the launch, such as ramping up production and distribution to multiple military bases. These costs could affect short-term profitability but are expected to be offset by the steady income provided by the contract. Moreover, the market will be looking for signs of operational efficiency and margin improvements as the company scales up to meet the demands of the contract.The stock market reaction to such news typically involves a reevaluation of the company's growth prospects. If Blue Star can demonstrate effective execution of the contract and signal potential for further government deals, this could lead to a positive reassessment of the company's valuation. ESG Analyst The partnership between Blue Star Foods Corp. and Eagle Rising underscores the growing importance of ESG factors in business operations, particularly within government contracting. The focus on sustainable seafood and the use of Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) aligns with increasing governmental and consumer demands for responsible sourcing and environmental stewardship.From an ESG perspective, this deal could enhance Blue Star's reputation as a leader in sustainable meal solutions, which is an increasingly relevant factor for investors. Companies with robust ESG practices often experience a 'halo effect', potentially leading to better access to capital, improved market perception and a competitive edge.However, it's important for Blue Star to maintain transparency and continue to meet high ESG standards. Failure to do so could lead to reputational damage and adverse effects on investor sentiment. The long-term success of this partnership may also hinge on the company's ability to demonstrate measurable ESG outcomes, which could further solidify its position within the sustainable food industry. 04/10/2024 - 11:00 AM Initial Launch Expected to Roll Out to Numerous Military Bases Over the Next Few Months Miami, FL, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blue Star Foods Corp., (“Blue Star,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) (NASDAQ: BSFC), a leader in value-added meal solutions and an integrated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) sustainable seafood company with a focus on Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS), is profoundly honored to announce the successful execution of a supply agreement to provide manufacturing of Eagle Rising specified innovative food solutions for the U.S. Military under the support of our recently established Master Service Agreement (MSA).

MethaneSAT is the first satellite funded by a nonprofit organization to accelerate more effective efforts to reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse pollutant responsible for about 30 percent of today's global warming. Blue Canyon provided its largest small satellite platform, the Saturn-class bus, integrated with infrared spectrometers that will be used to detect the colorless and odorless gas methane. This is the fifth Blue Canyon Saturn-class platform to launch and operate on-orbit successfully. Blue Canyon's platform offers robust power systems, secure data handling and industry-leading guidance and navigation with a 200-kg payload capacity. ""Blue Canyon Technologies' proven technical solutions will support this critical mission for the future of our planet and the continued exploration of Earth sciences,"" said Chris Winslett, general manager for Blue Canyon Technologies. MethaneSAT LLC, the organization behind the satellite, is a subsidiary of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. The donor-funded mission will provide global, high-resolution detection and quantification of methane emissions. ""MethaneSAT is a unique and demanding mission that will provide essential data we believe no other satellite can provide,"" said Dr. Steven Hamburg, MethaneSAT Executive Manager and Project Lead. ""Blue Canyon Technologies was selected as a best-in-class bus provider and has been a critical partner in bringing this project to fruition."" Research says that cutting methane emissions from fossil fuel operations, agriculture and other sectors as quickly as possible using existing solutions could slow the rate of warming by as much as 30 percent, which is critically important while working to decarbonize the energy system. Data from MethaneSAT, the most advanced methane tracking satellite in space, will help policymakers and industry find and fix the problem faster and more effectively.

Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 09:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2024 / NRG EnergyOriginally published on NRG Energy InsightsBy NRG Editorial VoicesCulture in Focus is a series illuminating NRG's unique workplace culture via our greatest asset: our people. The shared attitudes, values, and behaviors that permeate our everyday work environment are a source of tremendous pride, and they underscore how we meaningfully serve our more than 7.5 million customers across North America.This first installment features Bruce Chung, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Seasoned investment banker. Two-time NRG employee. Dad-rock enthusiast. First generation Korean American. History buff. Foodie. One thing's clear when talking with Bruce Chung: there's much more to him than meets the eye.Though his explanation of his CFO role is simple - ""I'm the guy that counts all the money"" - Chung's responsibilities are anything but. And yet, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone more approachable. His love for NRG and his many colleagues, as well as his enthusiasm for what's ahead, are testaments to the workplace culture that's evolving.People-centered innovationThe culture of any company can be challenging to define, especially for a company like NRG that has grown immensely through a series of acquisitions. Now in his second tenure of eight years at NRG (he served the company from 2008 to early 2016), Chung has been on the frontlines of the company's accelerated evolution.The crucial constant amidst change? NRG's people.""It's really been very much about the people, and having the respect [for] how hard people work at NRG. When you're a banker, you get to see how certain companies work, and NRG has always been one of those places where, number one, the level of talent has always been higher than other places. The work ethic has always been higher, [as have] the creativity and the willingness to be bold.""This work ethic and drive to innovate is the result of a collaborative environment in which every employee is encouraged to engage and contribute something greater in order to bring the vision of NRG to life.Never stop learningCuriosity and the desire to make a positive impact every day are what motivate Chung to contribute everything he can to the company - ""to give it everything he's got."" And he's not alone; this growth mindset permeates the halls of NRG's workplace. The continuous learning culture at NRG stems from the drive to uncover what customers are looking for. From there, the exploration becomes,""How can we make this combination something that translates into 1 + 1 = 3? We need people thinking about new things, and thinking about things in different ways. We don't know everything, and not being afraid of discovery is important.""Staying in the present while simultaneously looking ahead is a balance, one that benefits from the freedom to explore outside the box.Many perspectives, one goalThinking about things in different ways comes more easily when the workplace is as diverse as NRG's is, and our diversity is ever-growing. The differences in background and experience across our organization give us the ability to continually solve complex problems better. For Bruce, this is apparent in everyday collaboration with colleagues:""When I walk around the company and work with different teams, I see a similar level of diversity. It really instills a sense of pride for me that, as a company as large as we are, we've done the right things to create the diverse workforce that we've got.""Diversity of skin color, of religious belief, of experience, of thought, of life experiences… It's all important for coming up with the right answer for our customers, our shareholders, and our employees at large.""It is by virtue of our diversity that, not only are we a better company today, but we're collectively powering a safer, smarter, more sustainable tomorrow.Future-forward energyNow, we find ourselves at one of the most critical junctures of our corporate history, and the drive to achieve has never been higher. As a first generation Korean American, Bruce himself is no stranger to hard work and perseverance; his first job after graduating from Columbia University with a degree in history was on Wall Street, where he worked as an investment banking analyst 80-100 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, for over 11 years. That grinding work ethic is a product of his upbringing.""There was this faith that my parents had, that what they were doing and all of the hardship they were incurring at the time was all going to pay off… I've always had that ethos, to believe in the faith my parents had in me, the faith that I was going to be successful in life. It's something I reinforce in myself.""It's also something he reinforces in NRG - faith in a future elevated by the bold vision of the brightest innovators pushing the energy industry forward. Our strong shared purpose - to power a brighter future, together - combined with our commitment to never stop improving is cultivating a unique culture where everyone is empowered to do work that truly matters.Want to connect with Bruce?
