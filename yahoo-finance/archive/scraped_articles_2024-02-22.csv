Motley Fool,Why Rivian Stock Plunged Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-rivian-stock-plunged-today-195759596.html,"The electric vehicle maker delivered a mixed quarter and disappointing forward guidance, and announced a 10% workforce reduction.","Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) are down 25.7% as of 1:30 p.m. ET Thursday after the electric vehicle company announced mixed quarterly results, disappointing forward guidance, and a layoff of 10% of its workforce amid dwindling cash reserves.On Rivian's progress despite macro headwindsFor its fourth quarter of 2023, Rivian's revenue grew 167% year over year to $1.315 billion, translating to a non-GAAP (adjusted) net loss of $1.308 billion, or $1.36 per share. Analysts, on average, were modeling a narrower net loss of $1.32 per share, but on lower revenue of $1.26 billion.Trending toward the bottom line, Rivian's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $1.096 billion in Q4, narrowed from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.461 billion in last year's fourth quarter.Rivian produced 17,541 vehicles and delivered 13,972 vehicles during the quarter, up from 10,020 and 8,054 vehicles produced and delivered in the same year-ago period, respectively.""We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macroeconomic conditions,"" stated Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth.""Rivian ended 2023 with $9.368 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Including capacity on its revolving credit facility, total liquidity stood at $10.468 billion.What's next for Rivian investors?Rivian also announced it will reduce its salaried workforce by roughly 10% to cut costs in the near term.Looking ahead to 2024, Rivian issued guidance for 57,000 vehicles produced -- far below Wall Street's estimates for 81,700 units. Rivian said that should translate a full-year adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.7 billion, assuming capital expenditures of roughly $1.75 billion.Story continuesIn the end, Rivian has certainly made progress ramping up its operations and curbing expenses.

This Fund Says It Cracked the CodeAT&T Says Three-Quarters of Its Mobile Network Has Been RestoredFrom the US to Europe and Japan, equities hit all-time highs, with the most-valuable chipmaker up 15% Thursday and on course to add more than $230 billion to its market capitalization. That would be the biggest single-session increase in value ever — eclipsing a $197 billion gain made by Meta Platforms Inc. With the numbers now in, bulls are calculating Nvidia’s new price-to-earnings ratio, or how much investors are paying for future growth. Put another way, the company’s earnings have been growing faster than its shares.“Nvidia got to where it is because of extremely strong earnings and revenue,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. “When a company posts 265% year-over-year revenue growth — like Nvidia did — it deserves a premium valuation.”The MSCI ACWI Index of both developed and emerging-market shares headed toward its highest level ever. The Nasdaq 100 added almost 3%, while the S&P 500 climbed the most since November. The $15 billion VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 6.5%. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc. — two other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth — rallied to records. Super Micro Computer Inc., which has become a darling for investors wanting exposure to the revolutionary technology, soared 30%.Equities were also buoyed by solid manufacturing, housing and labor-market data, with traders taking more hawkish Fedspeak in stride. Treasury 10-year yields rose one basis point to 4.33%.Story continues“Few things are more certain than death, taxes, and Nvidia beats on earnings,” said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. “The bar was set quite high, and incredibly they’ve once again stepped up and hit a home run.”Nvidia’s market capitalization has now increased by more than $700 billion this year — with its valuation now topping $1.9 trillion — as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.Companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are Nvidia’s largest customers — accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, — as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.“Demand for AI is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” said Tom Hulick at Strategy Asset Managers. “We own NVDA and continue to hold the company. This is an exciting momentum play that we have been promoting and participating with for a few years now.”Demmert at Main Street Research says that for investors who already own Nvidia, the recommendation would be to hold the stock and avoid selling in order to capture future expected growth “as we are still early in this transformative AI technology.”“For investors who don’t own the stock, we would be buying on any weakness,” he noted. “With Nvidia’s stock, there will be corrections and bumps along the way, but the stock will continue to climb the wall of worry.”Nvidia’s results come as a relief for AI bulls, as expectations have improved significantly, according to Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. Despite the industry surge, she sees potential for further gains in technology shares — especially those that would benefit from the AI revolution.“We think the near-term momentum in AI-related stocks is likely to continue,” Marcelli noted. “To position, we maintain our preference for semiconductors and software, and see opportunities in beneficiaries of AI edge computing, big tech, and their partners.”Nvidia’s blockbuster results also underscored the tech dominance over the rest of the stock market, with the “Magnificent Seven” group of megacaps leading gains.To Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research, US equities are poised to power ahead over the next two to three weeks — with the AI-leveraged names, most of the “Mag 7,” and momentum themes driving the gains.Indeed, other stock-market industries are not rallying as strongly as the tech sector.“We still believe it is going to be important for the stock market to broaden out a lot more than it has this year if it’s going move a lot more than it already has so far this year,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “What we’re trying to say is that although the tech sector is the most important one for the stock market right now, there are still plenty of opportunities in other sectors in the marketplace.”The tech rally has propelled the valuation of the Nasdaq 100 to an elevated level versus history, with a similar picture for the S&P 500. Lofty valuations could ultimately curb more gains as investors weigh how much they’re willing to pay for stocks valued on future growth.Still, Citigroup Inc. strategist Scott Chronert said recently that index price-to-earnings readings could be misleading because 40% of the S&P 500 trades off other metrics. He predicted that more stocks could re-rate even with the US benchmark trading at 20 times forward earnings — which is exactly what followed.Meantime, demand for options protecting against a short-term pullback in the Nasdaq 100 is easing after nearing the highest level in months before Nvidia’s earnings report.The implied volatility premium for one-month puts over calls — known as the skew — on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF had increased to about 3.5 points this week, a level last seen for any length of time back in November. The concerns were focused in the market for short-term options, with the difference between one-month and three-month skews reaching the narrowest level since April 2022 before widening back out.Corporate Highlights:AT&T Inc. said three-quarters of its mobile network had been restored after a widespread outage affected tens of thousands of its wireless subscribers across the US.AbbVie Inc. is selling around $15 billion of bonds in the US investment-grade market on Thursday to help fund its acquisitions of ImmunoGen Inc. and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings Inc., adding to a recent rush of buyout financings.Space exploration startup Intuitive Machines Inc. will attempt on Thursday to put the first intact, US-made lander on the moon in more than 50 years.Rivian Automotive Inc., an electric-vehicle maker, issued a disappointing production forecast and announced another round of job cuts.Moderna Inc. reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts’ expectations by gaining Covid vaccine market share on its rival, Pfizer Inc.Newmont Corp., the world’s top gold producer, will sell six mines and two projects in a set of divestitures aimed at generating $2 billion in cash.Grab Holdings Ltd., a ride-hailing company, forecast 2024 revenue below analysts’ estimates, suggesting a deeper-than-anticipated slowdown in its core online business.Key Events This Week:China property prices, FridayGermany IFO business climate, GDP, FridayECB publishes 1- and 3-Year inflation expectations survey, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 1.8% as of 1:13 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 2.8%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%The MSCI World index rose 1.5%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro was little changed at $1.0818The British pound was little changed at $1.2649The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 150.62 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 0.4% to $51,611.42Ether rose 1.7% to $2,978.5BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 4.34%Germany’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 2.44%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.11%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.1% to $78.77 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.3% to $2,020.91 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik, Carmen Reinicke, Ryan Vlastelica, Carly Wanna, Farah Elbahrawy and Thyagaraju Adinarayan.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA24’s Risky Hollywood MomentPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV MarketHow Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect ConsumersHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign RobocallsUS Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Bloomberg,Wall Street to Follow Canada’s Hot Risk Transfer Trade,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-canada-hot-risk-134635220.html,(Bloomberg) -- A little-watched corner of Canada’s credit market is being shaken up by the country’s largest lenders as they pile into securities that shift credit risks to other investors — a play likely to be copied by their counterparts on Wall Street.

Now Beth Hammack Is LeavingCanada’s ‘Big Five’ have quickly ramped up the use of synthetic risk-transfer tools, which allow them to partly pass the risk of loans going sour to private investors. The push comes as they face tougher regulatory requirements on capital buffers.Exposure to synthetic securitizations has more than doubled over the last two years, swelling to C$86.6 billion ($64.2 billion) at the end of the last financial year, from C$40.3 billion in 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the last year alone, this has become a trade that Canada’s five largest lenders have joined in on, versus just a single player in the past, namely Bank of Montreal.The surge in activity underscores how banks are tackling new rules that require them to hold more capital. US banks face billions of dollars more in capital measures under a set of rules known as Basel Endgame, while Canadian regulators have already enforced many of those changes and implemented two additional hikes to the largest banks’ capital requirements, beginning in late 2022.“Synthetic securitization can become an essential part of bank activity,” said Robert Smalley, a financials credit desk analyst at UBS Group AG. “It certainly will be for US banks as they look to incorporate the final Basel requirements.”Representatives for BMO, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank confirmed their synthetic securitization exposures, while representatives for Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada declined to comment.Story continuesIt’s only logical that Canadian banks are major participants in the recent wave of synthetic securitizations, said Smalley, citing the confluence of increasing domestic and international capital requirements.And with rules around capital floors likely to increase in the coming years, Canadian banks are expected to use synthetic risk transfers even more in the future, according to Scotiabank global equity research analysts Meny Grauman and Felix Fang.“We believe it is reasonable to expect these numbers to grow as we head into F2026 and beyond,” they wrote in a January note to clients.Securitization SpreeLenders use the securitizations — also known as credit, synthetic or significant risk transfers — to prop up their regulatory ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets without having to issue capital instruments like equity. They slice reference assets into tranches and generally pass on about a tenth — typically the riskiest parts — to private investors.This way, they’re able to slow the growth of their risk-weighted assets and also lower provisioning — the amount of funds needed to cover losses from soured loans — said Himanshu Bakshi, a credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Bank of Montreal has deployed these types of transfers for years. The lender noticeably cranked up its exposure in 2022 and 2023, largely because of its acquisition of San Francisco-based Bank of the West, said Bakshi.The $16.3 billion deal, which closed last February, would have inflated Bank of Montreal’s risk-weighted assets, he said. Bank of Montreal also tends to have a higher risk appetite for loans than its Canadian peers, making its asset quality lower, he added.Other Canadian lenders like Bank of Nova Scotia sounded out investors last year for inaugural synthetic note offerings, amid the highest interest rates in 22 years.Bank of Nova Scotia recently hired a banker from Bank of Montreal’s desk in charge of structuring synthetic risk transfers, known as SRTs, that help banks rebuild capital reserves.‘RWA Diet’In the US, private equity and hedge fund firms are preparing to buy synthetic securitizations by banks after interest-rate increases left lenders with unrealized losses. Issuance in the world’s largest economy is “poised for dramatic expansion,” specialist investor Seer Capital Management wrote in a January note, with regional lenders also expected to join the fray.Last September, the Federal Reserve responded to frequently asked questions with guidance on what types of transactions could be eligible for capital relief. Passing on the risk of loans to a special purpose vehicle, which would then sell credit-linked notes to investors, can count as a synthetic securitization. Banks can also issue credit-linked notes directly but will have to ask for the Fed’s “reservation of authority” if they are to count toward capital relief.Fed officials have since fielded several requests by banks to treat the issuance of certain credit-linked notes as synthetic securitizations. “Many US banks have put themselves on an ‘RWA diet’ until questions around capital requirements are finalized,” said Smalley. “As a result, these banks will look to mitigate risk in the most efficient ways available.”Lenders that quickly develop expertise will further monetize by providing structuring, advisory and distribution services to mid-sized and smaller banks, Smalley added.“Given the size of the economy and banking system, US issuance is likely to dwarf the current market and create a multitude of compelling investment opportunities to complement growing European and Canadian bank issuance,” Seer said.--With assistance from Esteban Duarte.(Adds banker hiring in 15th paragraph.

Motley Fool,"Why Meta, Amazon, and Other ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Rallied Today",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-meta-amazon-other-magnificent-190324474.html,One member of the influential group reported blockbuster earnings that lifted many of its members higher.,"There's strong evidence that one of the biggest contributors to the market's ongoing bull market rally is artificial intelligence (AI). The boom that began early last year has continued, though market watchers have been debating whether it could last. Results released today by one member of the auspicious collective known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" put the debate to rest, at least for the time being.With that as a backdrop, social media maven Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) climbed 4.3%, e-commerce pioneer Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) rose 3.1%, and enterprise software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) climbed 1.9%, as of 1:24 p.m. ET.Image source: Getty Images.Evidence that the AI boom will continueThe catalyst that seems to have sparked a rally among some members of the Magnificent Seven was a blockbuster earnings report from member Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker arguably confirmed the coming AI boom when early last year the company reported record revenue in its data center segment, which includes processors used for AI. That trend has continued and Nvidia's fortunes, along with that of its shareholders, have risen with it.For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan 28.), Nvidia delivered revenue of $22.1 billion, surging 265% year over year, while climbing 22% sequentially. This boosted already strong profitability, with adjusted earnings per share of $5.16, which surged 486% and increased 28% quarter over quarter. This marks the third successive quarter that Nvidia has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales and profit growth.CEO Jensen Huang left no doubt as to what fueled the chart-topping results. ""Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations,"" he said.The Magnificent SevenThe Magnificent Seven were among Wall Street's top performers last year. The common thread that unites these industry leaders is their undeniable ties to AI. Since it was arguably the accelerating adoption of generative AI that helped spark last year's stock market rally, it isn't surprising these companies were among the top beneficiaries in 2023:Story continuesNvidia: Up 239%Meta Platforms: Up 194%Tesla: Up 102%Amazon: Up 81%Alphabet: Up 58%Microsoft: Up 57%Apple: Up 48%The widespread use of these advanced algorithms is expected to increase at a rapid clip over the next few years. Generative AI is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42%, topping $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to data provided by Bloomberg Intelligence. Given the magnitude of that opportunity, it's reasonable that the biggest players in the field will reap the biggest rewards -- but not all the Magnificent Seven stocks will benefit equally.Profiting from AIWe're only just beginning to understand how pervasive generative AI will be, but the Magnificent Seven companies highlighted above have carved out lucrative niches for themselves in the AI revolution:Nvidia designs the chips with the computational horsepower necessary to train and run AI systems -- and has seen its sales soar as the adoption of AI took hold.Meta Platforms is an AI pioneer, deploying the technology to deliver relevant content to users on its social media platform, identify people in photos posted on its site, and target advertising to its users. Not content to stop there, Meta introduced LLaMA AI, among the top large language models offered on the major cloud computing platforms.Amazon has long used AI systems to control its e-commerce empire, from scheduling deliveries to controlling inventory levels and everything in between, and has already added a growing list of AI tools for its Amazon Web Service cloud customers.Microsoft saw the writing on the wall last year and was quick to integrate AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its most widely used productivity tools.Each of these companies is approaching AI in a way that best serves its existing business, and each will likely continue to profit as these secular tailwinds gain momentum. Furthermore, the widespread use of AI has only just begun, so it follows that the gains will continue as adoption increases.From a valuation standpoint, each of these stocks is relatively inexpensive, depending on your metric of choice. Meta and Microsoft currently sell for 24 and 32 times forward earnings, respectively, making them the clear favorites. Amazon currently sells for roughly 2 times forward sales, which makes it dirt-cheap. By most metrics, Nvidia appears expensive. However, on a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio basis -- which factors in expected growth -- Nvidia is valued at less than 1, the benchmark for an undervalued stock.Whatever your favored metrics, there's a clear argument to be made that each of these stocks is not only inexpensive, but will continue to benefit from the tailwinds of AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,Here’s what Walmart’s 3-for-1 stock split means for investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-what-walmarts-3-for-1-stock-split-means-for-investors-185433546.html,Walmart is conducting a stock split for the first time in nearly 25 years. Here's what investors should know before they trade shares.,"Walmart (WMT) investors are gearing up for a stock split at the end of this week.For the 12th time in 50 years, Walmart will conduct a stock split in an effort to make shares more affordable for its employees. Walmart last carried out a 2-for-1 stock split on April 20, 1999. This time, it will be the company's first 3-for-1 stock split.Here's how it will work: Shares issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23, for investors who own shares of the retailer ""at the close of business"" on Thursday, Feb. 22. On Monday, Feb. 26, at market open, Walmart will begin trading on a post-split basis.This split will increase the number of shares of Walmart's outstanding common stock to approximately 8.1 billion from 2.7 billion shares before the split. Although the stock will trade at a lower price, it won't change the underlying value of existing investments in the company.In a note to clients, CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram explained that the action is ""purely cosmetic"" with no ""impact to fundamentals."" However, he noted, stock splits ""are perceived as a shareholder-friendly move and a sign of confidence.""The Walmart company logo is displayed as traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on May 30, 2023, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)Why Walmart chose to issue stock nowWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said the timing of the stock split made sense given Walmart's growth future plans, which it announced at its last annual meeting.Sundaram pointed to other recent announcements from the company, like a pay increase for store managers from $117,000 per year to $128,000 per year, with bonuses of up to 200% of base salary. Walmart also announced a $9 billion dollar investment to modernize stores, which he said ""should help drive traffic and volume growth ... and help offset waning average ticket growth.""Paying homage to founder Sam Walton, McMillon said he wants all employees to feel a part of Walmart's story, writing in a statement, ""As Sam said, 'We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.'""Story continuesBabson College director Laurie Krigman said there are three reasons why the company would decide on a stock split.First, it signals ""confidence"" in the future of the company. Second, it brings the stock price down to the ""preferred trading range."" The third reason is liquidity, where ""more shares are trading, even though it's the same dollar amount that's trading,"" Krigman said.""It just kind of made sense to do a stock split,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said to Yahoo Finance. ""And this way, it just becomes a little bit more accessible for further employees, and it's all about value and affordability, which is really core to their their culture.""What it means for Walmart stockAs of late, Walmart stock has gotten a lot of buzz. Shares of the retailer hit a record high on Feb. 20 following the company's earnings report and stock split announcement.Some see the stock split as a positive catalyst since more retail investors are able to afford the lower-priced stock post-split.""We view [the stock split] as incrementally positive to WMT's growth and multiple expansion prospects,"" Tarlowe said.However, it hasn't always played out that way. Since 1975, Walmart stock has seen positive returns in the three months following a stock split six out of nine times.And overall, the record is pretty mixed. For instance, Walmart saw a 73% return in the three months after its July 1982 stock split. But shares of Walmart declined by 20% in the three months after the 2-for-1 split in February 1993.In the end, Krigman offered a warning to potential investors: Be sure you understand the fundamentals and how the company is performing first.""It really doesn't mean anything,"" Krigman said about the stock split. ""It's an accounting gimmick.""Krigman reminded investors who own shares that, after the split, they ""are economically in exactly the same position.""—Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But the news was even worse than that. Sunnova reported only $194.2 million in revenue for Q4, and a loss of $1.53 per share.Sunnova's Q4 earnings reportSunnova CEO William Berger described Sunnova's performance as ""good,"" but it's hard to see how he came to that conclusion. Instead of growing as analysts had expected, Sunnova's Q4 sales contracted by about 1% year over year. The company's losses, meanwhile, ballooned by 750%.For the year, the news was a bit better -- but still not great. Sales for 2023 came in at a healthy $720.6 million, up 29% year over year. Yet Sunnova still lost money for the year -- $3.53 per share, two and a half times worse than the company's loss in 2022.Management blamed ""an increase in interest expense, higher general and administrative expense, a write off of goodwill"" for the losses, and redirected investor attention to what it calls its ""adjusted EBITDA"" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- a non-GAAP figure) instead. On that metric, Sunnova's earnings looked better -- $274.5 million for the year.Is Sunnova stock a buy after its sell-off?Continuing the theme into guidance, Sunnova said it expects to generate between $350 million and $450 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2024 -- which sounds like a good thing. The problem is that it doesn't tell investors much about how profitable the company will be under standard earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Story continuesOf further concern, management insists that by the end of 2024 it will be generating ""annual cash"" of ""between $200 million and $500 million."" It's not clear, however, if this term refers to actual free cash flow. In 2023, the company had no free cash flow at all, for example, and instead burned through approximately $2.1 billion in negative free cash flow -- nearly twice the rate of cash burn in 2022.Long story short, Sunnova thinks it had a good year in 2023, and will have an even better one in 2024. As for me, I'm not so sure.Should you invest $1,000 in Sunnova Energy International right now?Before you buy stock in Sunnova Energy International, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sunnova Energy International wasn’t one of them.

Business Insider,"Layoffs are a nightmare for employees, but Wall Street loves them",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lost-job-might-good-someone-182701468.html,Companies with strong profits are letting workers go to prove to Wall Street that they're serious about cutting costs and becoming more efficient.,"Layoff chatter is freaking out employees, but it is making one group of people very happy: investors.Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/InsiderCompanies just can’t stop talking about their plans to cut jobs. A recent Bloomberg analysis found that the rate of mentions of layoffs in quarterly earnings calls was at its highest since the start of the pandemic. And while all the layoff chatter is deeply unnerving for workers, executives keep talking about plans to slash payrolls for a pretty clear reason: Investors are eating it up.It may seem counterintuitive for Wall Street to reward companies for letting people go. After all, layoffs are usually thought to be a sign that the business isn’t doing so hot. But plenty of these companies are posting strong profits — they’re letting go of workers as part of an effort to show investors they’re serious about cutting costs and becoming more efficient. Wall Street, in turn, has been pretty jazzed about all the talk of scaled-back workforces. Meta’s downsizing has been met with a hell yeah — the company’s stock price has increased by more than 170% over the past year. Spotify’s stock jumped by 7.5% after its layoff announcement in December and is up 30% so far in 2024. And while a lot of the layoff talk is concentrated in tech, investors were also quite pleased about job cuts at Estée Lauder.Investors’ cheering on workforce reductions isn’t necessarily a novel phenomenon. Companies are profit-seeking endeavors, after all, and cutting labor costs is a signal to shareholders that executives are trying to increase those profits.“Ultimately, companies want to demonstrate to all stakeholders that they’re being thoughtful stewards of capital, so arguably these kinds of actions are one way that they can show that,” said Scott Kessler, a global sector lead for technology, media, and telecommunications at Third Bridge Group.Some factors in the recent bout of layoffs — and investor reactions — are unique. Many companies took an aggressive approach to hiring during the pandemic, particularly tech companies whose engagement boomed while everyone was stuck at home. As consumption patterns normalized and interest rates increased, riskier projects became more expensive. Companies started doubling down on what they already did well instead of investing in new projects that required more people. The cuts, many executives say, are a way of getting their head counts down to a more normal size, or a size Wall Street will feel better about.Story continuesIn early February, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report that many of the companies announcing layoffs were doing so not because their outlooks had worsened but as part of an effort to “improve company valuations by responding to investor demands to shrink workforces that were perceived to have grown too large and expensive.”Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, argued that “after many years of engaging in probably what I would call ‘moonshot’-type projects, whether it’s the metaverse or what have you, it seems like tech companies have finally found some fiscal discipline, and clearly a lot of it’s leading to reining in some of those moonshot projects and focusing more on the business at hand.”“When rates were low, a lot of these projects made sense,” Samana added. “When you plug in 0%, a lot of projects have positive present value, and when you plug in 5%, a lot of those become negative.”Ted Mortonson, a managing director at Baird, said some tech companies were downsizing in order to become a more attractive target for buyers. Essentially, cuts make firms a “leaner, meaner” opportunity for M&A — or just for weathering the high-interest-rates storm.Then there’s the artificial intelligence of it all. Though some of the excitement around AI has died out over the past year, big companies are still chatting about it on earnings calls. The analysts I spoke with said hopes around AI were likely driving some layoffs — and investor optimism about them. Kessler said that since tech companies were trying to sell customers on “the productivity and efficiency benefits” of AI, they could reiterate that argument by using the tools in their own business and doing some “head-count rationalization” as well.The tech companies developing AI products are the best positioned to try them out. “If you can automate and orchestrate an end-to-end solution from a compute standpoint, you just don’t need the head count,” Mortonson told me, though he added that despite all the hype, AI likely wouldn’t make a big difference in company efficiency for some time.Wall Street hasn’t rewarded every company’s layoff announcement, especially those indicative of broader problems within the business. And while these announcements are triggering a stock-price op in the short term, the results may not stick. Research suggests layoffs are bad for stock prices over the long term and can often be a drag on business because they hurt morale and productivity and are quite expensive.In some cases layoffs really are inevitable, but it’s hard not to feel like they should be a last resort, not a relatively simple strategy for upping profit margins and making investors happy. “Stock soars after company lays off thousands of workers” headlines should give everyone pause, especially as they proliferate.Emily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.Read the original article on Business Insider"
