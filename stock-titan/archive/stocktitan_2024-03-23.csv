About Marker Therapeutics, Inc.Marker Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company specializing in the development of next-generation T cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumor indications. The T cell therapy technology developed by Marker is based on the selective expansion of non-engineered, tumor-specific T cells that recognize tumor associated antigens (i.e., tumor targets) and kill tumor cells expressing those targets. This population of T cells is designed to attack multiple tumor targets following infusion into patients and to activate the patient’s immune system to produce broad spectrum anti-tumor activity. Because Marker does not genetically engineer the T cells, Marker believes that its product candidates will be easier and less expensive to manufacture, with reduced toxicities, compared to current engineered CAR-T and TCR-based approaches, and may provide patients with meaningful clinical benefit. As a result, Marker believes its portfolio of T cell therapies has a compelling product profile, as compared to current gene-modified CAR-T and TCR-based therapies.

The project aims to provide fuel-free power to the Pee Dee region and is part of Duke Energy's commitment to a lower carbon future. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Economist An analysis of Duke Energy's proposed Robinson Solar Center from an economic perspective indicates a strategic move in response to the growing energy demands of South Carolina. The state's rapid population growth, coupled with economic expansion, necessitates increased power supply. The shift towards solar represents an adaptation to market forces that are increasingly favoring renewable energy sources over traditional fossil fuels. This transition is expected to have a positive long-term economic impact by potentially lowering operational costs due to the fuel-free nature of solar power and enhancing the state's appeal to environmentally conscious businesses and residents.However, the upfront capital expenditure for the solar facility is substantial and the regulatory approval process can impact the project's timelines and cost efficiency. Stakeholders should consider the balance between the immediate financial burden and the anticipated future savings in energy costs. Moreover, the integration of such a large-scale renewable project into the existing energy grid will require careful planning to manage intermittency and ensure reliability. Environmental Policy Analyst From an environmental policy standpoint, Duke Energy's initiative aligns with broader regulatory trends pushing for a reduction in carbon emissions. The proposal for the Robinson Solar Center not only supports South Carolina's cleaner energy ambitions but also sets a precedent for utility-scale renewable projects in the region. If approved, it may catalyze further investment in green technologies and infrastructure, contributing to the state's environmental targets.It is important to assess the potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation phases. While solar energy is a cleaner alternative to nuclear or fossil fuels, the land use for such a large-scale project can have ecological implications. The project's alignment with environmental regulations and its potential to disrupt local ecosystems must be carefully evaluated to ensure sustainable development. Energy Market Analyst Examining the proposal from an energy market perspective, the introduction of a 76-megawatt solar facility by Duke Energy is a significant development. It reflects the broader industry trend towards diversification of energy sources. The facility's scale suggests a considerable contribution to the region's energy mix, potentially influencing market dynamics by increasing the supply of renewable energy. This could lead to more competitive electricity prices for consumers in the long run.The project's success hinges on factors such as the cost of solar technology, government incentives and the evolving landscape of energy demand. Investors should monitor these variables closely as they will determine the project's profitability and its impact on Duke Energy's financial performance. Additionally, the interplay between this new solar capacity and existing energy sources will be pivotal in shaping the future energy market in South Carolina. 03/22/2024 - 12:09 PM Robinson Solar Center will be key next step to transitioning to cleaner energy economy for the stateProject builds on long history of powering the economy of the Pee Dee regionGREENVILLE, S.C., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today requested approval by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) to build and own a 76-megawatt utility-scale solar power facility adjacent to the existing Robinson Nuclear Plant site located in both Chesterfield and Darlington counties. ""Making smart investments in South Carolina's energy future is a priority for Duke Energy – one that focuses on delivering reliable, affordable service every day to the customers and communities we serve, and on transitioning to cleaner energy options and a lower carbon future,"" said Mike Callahan, Duke Energy's South Carolina state president. ""The proposed Robinson Solar Center is part of the thousands of megawatts of solar that will help us do that."" If approved, construction is expected to begin on the approximate 345-acre existing site in 2026 with the facility targeting full operation in 2027. The facility will provide fuel-free power to meet the growing needs of the Pee Dee region of South Carolina. For more information on the project, visit duke-energy.com/RobinsonSolarCenter. A diverse energy mix From population growth to the expansion of manufacturing and other major economic development wins, South Carolina is booming. According to the Census Bureau, the Palmetto State had the fastest growing population in the nation in 2023, largely due to the tremendous impact of the state's economic prosperity. Transitioning to cleaner energy sources like solar, while also meeting growing energy needs, requires a diverse mix of resources like the Robinson Solar Center to ensure continued and future reliability. ""We are using an 'all-of-the-above' approach that incorporates renewables like solar, next-generation and existing nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric sources,"" Callahan said. ""This diverse mix will help Duke Energy meet customer expectations for cleaner energy while also reliably powering communities across the state."" Nuclear remains critical to state's future For more than 50 years, Robinson Nuclear Plant has played a critical role in powering communities in the Pee Dee region and continues to be an essential part of the company's current and future diverse energy mix. Nuclear is the only carbon-free generation source that is available 24/7 in every type of weather. Duke Energy intends to relicense its entire nuclear fleet (11 reactors at six plant sites in the Carolinas). We expect to submit Robinson Nuclear Plant's license renewal application in 2025 to allow it to continue reliable, clean, cost-competitive operations for our customers for decades to come.

The decision follows a court ruling on procedural fairness. Organigram is disappointed and is evaluating next steps. Positive None. Negative The reclassification of Organigram's Jolts lozenge products as edible cannabis by Health Canada could impact the company's product strategy and market positioning negatively. Legal Expert The reclassification of Organigram's Edison Jolts lozenges by Health Canada from an ingestible extract to an edible cannabis product has significant legal and regulatory implications. The initial court decision that found a procedural breach by Health Canada indicated a potential for Organigram to maintain their product's status. However, the final redetermination by Health Canada upholds the original classification, which means that the company must now navigate a different set of regulations that apply to edibles.This change could affect labeling, marketing, permissible THC levels and packaging requirements, potentially increasing compliance costs for Organigram. In the broader legal landscape, this decision sets a precedent for how similar products may be classified in the future, influencing the strategies of other cannabis companies. It is important for stakeholders to monitor how Organigram adapts to these regulatory changes and what legal steps they might take in response. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the reclassification of Organigram's product could influence consumer perception and market dynamics within the cannabis industry. Edibles typically have a different consumer base compared to other forms of cannabis consumption and this shift might necessitate a change in Organigram's marketing strategy to target a new segment.Furthermore, the cessation of Jolts production in its current form and the sell-through of remaining inventory may impact Organigram's short-term revenue and market share. Competitors might capitalize on this transition period to capture consumers who were loyal to the Jolts brand. Long-term, Organigram's ability to innovate and adapt to the new classification will be critical in maintaining their competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market. Financial Analyst From a financial viewpoint, the reclassification of Edison Jolts lozenges has immediate implications for Organigram's revenue stream and cost structure. The suspension of production suggests a potential loss in sales volume and revenue, at least temporarily. Moreover, the development and marketing of a compliant product could incur additional R&D and marketing expenses.Investors should consider the impact of these regulatory challenges on Organigram's financial health, especially if the company faces delays in reintroducing a compliant product to the market. The ability to manage inventory levels and mitigate the costs associated with regulatory compliance will be key factors in maintaining financial stability and investor confidence during this period. 03/22/2024 - 07:00 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Organigram Holdings Inc. (“Organigram” or the “Company”) (TSX: OGI; NASDAQ: OGI), announced today that, despite strong evidence supporting its classification as an ingestible extract, it has received a final redetermination from Health Canada that its patented Edison Jolts lozenge products (the “Products”) are to be classified as edible cannabis. The final redetermination follows the August 2023 decision of the Federal Court of Canada (the “Court”) to grant Organigram’s application for judicial review of a decision of Health Canada determining that the Products are to be classified as edible cannabis. The Court found there was a breach of procedural fairness by Health Canada and the matter was then remitted back to Health Canada for redetermination taking the Court’s reasons into consideration. “We are disappointed with the outcome of Health Canada’s further review of our Jolts product,” said Beena Goldenberg, CEO of Organigram. “Our patented Jolts lozenge was launched over two years ago following significant research and development and was specifically designed to appeal to consumers looking to access regulated and tested ingestible products from the legal market that met their needs for potency and price. We are currently assessing our options to continue to meet the needs of consumers while retaining them within the legal market,” she concluded. Organigram has stopped the production of Jolts in its current format and is currently working with Health Canada on timing to sell through remaining inventory to the provincial distributors.

Plans to release management proxy circular and Modern Slavery Report. Cameco is a global uranium provider with investments in nuclear fuel cycle companies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of an annual report on Form 40-F, including audited financial statements and management's discussion, is a key event for investors as it provides a comprehensive overview of Cameco's financial health and strategic direction. The inclusion of the Canadian annual information form (AIF) and the technical report for the Cigar Lake operation adds further depth, allowing investors to assess the company's assets and operational capabilities in detail.From a financial perspective, the disclosure of audited statements is essential for transparency and forms the basis for valuing the company's stock. Cameco's controlling ownership of high-grade uranium reserves and low-cost operations are significant factors that can contribute to the company's competitive advantage and appeal to investors seeking exposure to the clean energy sector. Additionally, the company's investments in Westinghouse Electric Company and Global Laser Enrichment suggest a diversified approach to the nuclear fuel cycle, which could mitigate risk and enhance growth prospects. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst Cameco's inaugural Modern Slavery Report, as mandated by the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act (Canada), represents a significant development in its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) profile. For socially conscious investors, adherence to such regulations is not just a matter of compliance but also an indicator of the company's commitment to responsible business practices.This report could potentially influence investor sentiment and attract ESG-focused funds, especially if the findings demonstrate a strong ethical supply chain framework. It is important to note that ESG factors are increasingly impacting investment decisions and can affect a company's reputation and, ultimately, its share price. The proactive disclosure of ESG-related information can be seen as a positive step towards greater corporate transparency and accountability in the mining sector, which historically has faced scrutiny over its social and environmental impact. 03/22/2024 - 08:36 PM SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) reported today that it filed its annual report on Form 40-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

CARTICA ACQUISITION CORP ANNOUNCES CONTRIBUTION TO TRUST ACCOUNT FOR EXTENSION AMENDMENT,2024-03-22T21:31:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Cartica Acquisition Corp announces a cash contribution of $40,000 per month to its trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to extend the date for completing an initial business combination. The contribution will be made by Cartica Acquisition Partners,  until January 7, 2025, if approved.","CARTICA ACQUISITION CORP ANNOUNCES CONTRIBUTION TO TRUST ACCOUNT FOR EXTENSION AMENDMENT Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Cartica Acquisition Corp announces a cash contribution of $40,000 per month to its trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to extend the date for completing an initial business combination. The contribution will be made by Cartica Acquisition Partners, until January 7, 2025, if approved. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Cartica Acquisition Corp regarding the Sponsor's commitment to contribute cash to the trust account in anticipation of a Charter Extension has notable implications for shareholders and potential investors. The cash infusion is designed to support the company's financial stability during the extended period for completing an initial business combination. In terms of immediate financial impact, the additional funds may reassure investors of the company's liquidity, potentially influencing stock stability or attractiveness in the short term.However, the dilutive effect on per-share value after redemptions should be carefully considered. The detailed calculation provided, showing the impact of redemptions on per-share value, is critical for investors calculating potential returns. The conditionality of the contribution on the approval of the Charter Extension is also a significant contingency that stakeholders must factor into their assessments. The potential for liquidation if a business combination is not completed by the new deadline introduces a layer of risk that must be weighed against the temporary financial bolstering provided by the Sponsor's contributions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Cartica's strategy to extend the deadline for an initial business combination reflects a broader trend within the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) market, where sponsors sometimes seek more time to find a suitable merger target. This extension, if approved, could affect investor sentiment, as it suggests that Cartica has yet to secure a business combination, which can be perceived as a lack of viable targets or challenges in finalizing a deal.The announcement also indicates a mechanism to protect shareholder value through contributions that increase the redemption amount, albeit marginally. This strategy could be interpreted as an incentive for shareholders to remain invested during the extended search period. The nuanced impact on redemption values, depending on the number of public shares redeemed, underscores the complex dynamics at play in SPAC transactions and the importance of shareholder actions in influencing individual investment outcomes. Legal Expert The legal implications of Cartica's proposed Charter Extension and the Sponsor's conditional contribution are rooted in the governance structure of SPACs. The requirement for shareholder approval highlights the importance of corporate governance and shareholder rights in such entities. The company's discretion in extending the search period up to January 7, 2025, without accruing interest on the contributions, reflects a contractual agreement between the Sponsor and the company that investors should examine closely.Additionally, the announcement serves as a reminder of the legal framework governing SPACs, where a failure to complete a business combination within the stipulated timeframe necessitates liquidation. The Sponsor's obligation to contribute additional funds is contingent upon the Charter Extension's approval, emphasizing the role of shareholder voting in determining the company's financial trajectory. The legal stipulations regarding the repayment of the contribution upon a successful business combination or liquidation provide clarity on the Sponsor's exit strategy and the finite nature of the commitment. 03/22/2024 - 05:31 PM NEW YORK, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cartica Acquisition Corp (""Cartica"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: ""CITE"", ""CITEU"", ""CITEW"") announced today that Cartica Acquisition Partners, LLC (the ""Sponsor"") will make a cash contribution of an aggregate of $40,000 to Cartica's trust account for each month (as further detailed below), in connection with the shareholder vote to approve an amendment to its charter to extend the date by which Cartica has to complete an initial business combination from April 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Company's board of directors (the ""Charter Extension""). CARTICA ACQUISITION CORP ANNOUNCES CONTRIBUTION TO TRUST ACCOUNT FOR EXTENSION AMENDMENTAs a result of the above change, if the Charter Extension is approved and implemented, the Sponsor or its designees will contribute to the Company as a loan (the ""Contributions"") an aggregate of $40,000 for each month (commencing on April 7, 2024 and on the 7th day of each subsequent month) until January 7, 2025 (the ""Extension Period""), or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial business combination, which amount will be deposited into the trust account. Accordingly, the amount paid per share will be reduced proportionately as the amount of public shares which remain outstanding increases after redemptions in connection with the Charter Extension. For example, if Cartica completes an initial business combination on July 7, 2024, which would represent three (3) months and no public shares are redeemed in connection with the Charter Extension, then the aggregate amount deposited per share will be approximately $0.028 per share, with the aggregate maximum contribution to the Trust Account being $120,000. However, if 2,214,415 public shares are redeemed and 2,000,000 public shares remain outstanding after redemptions in connection with the Charter Extension, then the amount deposited per share for such three-month period will be approximately $0.06 per share. Accordingly, if Cartica completes an initial business combination on July 7, 2024, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for an initial business combination or Cartica's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $11.098 (plus any applicable interest accrued) if all of public shares remain outstanding after redemptions, or approximately $11.13 per share (plus any applicable interest accrued) if 2,214,415 public shares are redeemed and 2,000,000 public shares remain outstanding, in comparison to the current redemption amount of approximately $11.07 per share (which amount includes interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes). Any Contribution is conditioned upon the implementation of the Charter Extension. No Contribution will occur if the Charter Extension is not approved or is not completed. The amount of each Contribution will not bear interest and will be repayable by the Company to the Sponsor or its designees upon consummation of its initial business combination. The Company will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional months until January 7, 2025. If the Company opts not to utilize any remaining portion of the Extension Period, then the Company will liquidate and dissolve promptly in accordance with its charter, and its Sponsor's obligation to make additional contributions will terminate.

Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity,2024-03-22T21:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Millicom (Tigo) has repurchased 25,625 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between March 18, 2024, and March 22, 2024, as part of the share repurchase program.

The daily average price paid ranged from SEK 199.55 to SEK 205.24. Following the purchases, Millicom holds 1,013,486 treasury shares as of March 22, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The share repurchase activity by Millicom represents a strategic move to manage its capital structure and potentially signal confidence in the company's value. From a market research perspective, repurchasing shares can often be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, indicating that the company believes its stock is undervalued. This can lead to an uptick in investor confidence and a possible increase in the stock price.However, the impact on the stock market also depends on the scale of the buyback relative to the company's overall market capitalization. With Millicom holding 1,013,486 treasury shares post-purchase out of a total of 172,096,305 shares outstanding, the buyback is not significantly large when compared to the total number of shares. Therefore, while the action is positive, its impact may be relatively muted in the broader market context. Financial Analyst Analysing the financial implications of Millicom's repurchase activity requires an examination of the company's liquidity and cash flow. The repurchase program uses the company's capital to buy back shares, which could be seen as an alternative to investing in growth opportunities or paying down debt. It's essential to assess whether this capital deployment aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and financial health.Investors should consider the daily average price paid for the shares and the total repurchase amount, as these figures provide insight into the company's valuation metrics. The repurchase at prices ranging from 199.55 to 205.24 SEK per SDR suggests a targeted investment at a price range Millicom deems fair. The exclusion of commissions in the disclosed figures also points to a transparent reporting of the repurchase costs. Legal Expert It's important to note that Millicom's share repurchase program is being executed in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Safe Harbour Regulation. This compliance ensures that the buybacks are conducted within legal boundaries and are protected from potential claims of market manipulation. The adherence to these regulations is critical for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal repercussions.Additionally, the detailed disclosure of the repurchase activity, including the breakdown of transactions, reflects the company's commitment to transparency. For stakeholders, such compliance and openness are key factors when assessing the governance quality of a company. It's also indicative of a well-managed approach to capital distribution policies. 03/22/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, March 22, 2024 – Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 25,625 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between March 18, 2024 and March 22, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

The ratings reflect AL's strong financial fundamentals, young fleet, diverse customer base, and access to capital markets. Despite industry challenges and key-man risk, AL's Stable Outlook is supported by its resilient performance during the pandemic and favorable industry dynamics. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The affirmation of Air Lease Corporation's issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings by KBRA, alongside the stable outlook, signals to investors a perceived reliability and creditworthiness of the company in the medium term. The A- rating reflects a balance between strong financial fundamentals, such as liquidity and cash-flow metrics and the risks inherent in the cyclical nature of the aviation leasing industry. The company's strategy of maintaining low leverage, at around 2.5x Debt-to-Equity, is noteworthy as it suggests a conservative financial posture, although the current 2.8x ratio indicates a slight deviation from this target.From an investment perspective, the stable outlook and access to capital markets at attractive rates could be seen as positive indicators for potential investors. However, the cyclical nature of the industry and reliance on wholesale funding are factors that require careful consideration, as they could affect the company's performance in the event of an industry downturn. Additionally, the recent significant write-down of aircraft detained in Russia highlights geopolitical risks that can have a material impact on the company's financials. Market Research Analyst The global aircraft leasing industry is characterized by its sensitivity to economic cycles and geopolitical events, as evidenced by Air Lease Corporation's recent experience with aircraft detained in Russia. The company's young and in-demand fleet, as well as its solid orderbook, provide visibility for future growth and suggest a strategic positioning to capitalize on the favorable industry dynamics, such as the current strong demand for air travel paired with limited aircraft supply.Investors should consider the potential for increased delinquencies or defaults among airline customers in the event of an economic downturn or other adverse events, as this could directly impact Air Lease's profitability and liquidity. The stable outlook, however, does provide some assurance of the company's ability to weather such challenges, as it has done through the pandemic and subsequent market recovery. Legal Expert The equalization of the A- rating for the Sukuk trust certificates with Air Lease Corporation's senior unsecured debt rating is a legal acknowledgment of the company's irrevocable obligations under its purchase undertaking. This legal structure ensures that payments are met following certain dissolution events, which provides a level of security to investors. The BBB rating for the preferred shares, being two notches lower, reflects their deeply subordinated nature and the discretionary aspect of dividends, which are important considerations for investors seeking to understand the risk profile of different investment instruments within the company.For stakeholders, the 75% equity credit for preferred shares indicates a degree of loss absorption that could potentially shield senior creditors in adverse scenarios. This structural feature is an essential legal aspect that could influence investor decisions, particularly for those assessing the risk-return profile of subordinated instruments compared to senior debt. 03/22/2024 - 05:01 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KBRA affirms the A- issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings as well as the BBB rating for the preferred shares for Air Lease Corporation (NYSE: AL, “the Company”), a global aircraft leasing company based in Los Angeles, California. KBRA also affirms the A- rating of the Sukuk trust certificates issued by Air Lease Corporation Sukuk Limited. In addition, KBRA assigns a senior unsecured rating of A- to €600.0 million 3.70% Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due April 15, 2030. The Outlook of the ratings is Stable. Key Credit Considerations The issuer and senior unsecured ratings of Air Lease are driven by the company’s global franchise, leading market position and highly experienced management team with deep relationships with airlines and OEMs. Air Lease’s credit profile is further supported by strong financial fundamentals, as reflected in its strong profitability, liquidity, and cash-flow metrics, and its almost entirely unencumbered asset base. The ratings also consider Air Lease’s young and in-demand fleet, diverse customer base, solid orderbook providing visibility for future growth, and substantial forward lease placement of orders. AL has excellent access to the capital markets as demonstrated by their issuance activities in the past couple of years in a challenging market environment. The Company maintains a low leverage strategy targeting around 2.5x Debt-to-Equity, although leverage was slightly higher at 2.8x Debt-to-Equity as of December 31, 2023, due to the significant write-down of aircraft detained in Russia in 2022. The 2.8x Debt-to-Equity ratio takes into account 75% equity credit consideration by KBRA for the preferred shares. KBRA expects AL’s leverage to return to historic norms in the near to medium term through retention of profits. The ratings are balanced by the disciplined funding and placement planning required to manage the significant orderbook, an element of key-man risk despite good succession planning, the cyclical nature of the industry, potential credit issues of its airline customers, and event risks related to air travel. The A- rating of the Sukuk trust certificates is equalized with AL’s senior unsecured debt rating based on AL’s irrevocable obligations under its purchase undertaking to provide necessary funds to ensure payments of principal and periodic distribution amounts are met following the occurrence of a Dissolution Event (which does not include a Total Loss Dissolution Event) and AL’s obligations under the purchase undertaking and servicing agency agreement ranking pari-passu with AL’s other senior unsecured obligations. The BBB rating of the Preferred Shares is two notches lower than the senior unsecured rating reflecting the deeply subordinated features of the preferred shares indicated by their ranking in the capital structure, their discretionary and non-cumulative dividend feature, and their perpetual nature. The 75% equity credit indicates that the preferred securities are highly loss-absorbing given their structural features, which protect senior creditors against credit losses to some extent. The Stable Outlook reflects AL’s resilient performance through the pandemic-driven severe downturn and the aftermath from the Russian-Ukraine conflict. AL demonstrated robust access to capital markets at attractive rates, effective management of lessee deferrals and defaults, and successful aircraft remarketing efforts, while maintaining moderate leverage and adequate liquidity and profitability. Besides AL’s reported loss in FY22 driven by the extraordinary write-off on aircraft in Russia, AL has been profitable and has had no aircraft impairment since inception. The Stable Outlook also takes into considerations the favorable near-term industry dynamics with strong aircraft demand as a result of strong passenger travel demand but limited aircraft supply. Rating Sensitivities A ratings upgrade in the near future is not expected given the industry’s potential challenges, susceptibility to event risk in general and the company’s reliance on wholesale funding, despite the Company’s resilience demonstrated during the pandemic. The Stable Outlook could be revised to Negative or the ratings could be downgraded or reviewed for downgrade if air traffic declines and leads to increased delinquencies, defaults and/or impairments, or a decline in funding availability with significant negative impacts on profitability, capital and/or liquidity metrics. A notable increase in the company’s asset encumbrance could also trigger a review. To access rating and relevant documents, click here.

Financial Analyst The merger between Axonics and Boston Scientific represents a significant event within the medical device sector, which can influence market dynamics and investor sentiment. From a financial perspective, mergers often aim to create synergies that can lead to cost savings and increased revenue potential. Investors should monitor how the combined entity plans to integrate operations and whether the merger will result in an expanded product portfolio that could drive market share gains. Furthermore, the deal could affect the valuation multiples of both companies, as well as their competitors, as market expectations adjust to the new business structure. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the competitive landscape, the merger could alter the balance of power in the neuromodulation space, where both companies operate. It is essential to assess how this consolidation might affect competition and customer choice. The potential for cross-selling and upselling to existing customer bases of both firms could enhance market penetration. Additionally, the increased financial and operational resources of a larger entity may enable more aggressive research and development, possibly leading to innovation that can set new industry standards. Legal Expert The transaction is subject to regulatory scrutiny, including antitrust laws in the U.S. and internationally. The outcome of this process is not guaranteed, as regulators will assess the merger's impact on market competition. Any conditions imposed by these regulatory bodies could influence the final structure and benefits of the deal. Investors should be aware of the legal hurdles that could delay or alter the expected synergies and financial outcomes of the merger. The timing of the closing, expected in the first half of 2024, is also a critical factor, as prolonged regulatory processes can affect investor confidence and the strategic planning of both organizations. 03/22/2024 - 04:01 PM IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Axonics, Inc.

POET Technologies Announces Intention to Amend Warrant Terms,2024-03-22T19:32:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"POET Technologies Inc. announces the amendment of common share purchase warrants to reduce the exercise price and add an Acceleration Clause, subject to warrantholder approval and final acceptance by the Exchange.","POET Technologies Announces Intention to Amend Warrant Terms Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary POET Technologies Inc. announces the amendment of common share purchase warrants to reduce the exercise price and add an Acceleration Clause, subject to warrantholder approval and final acceptance by the Exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by POET Technologies Inc. to amend the terms of their existing common share purchase warrants is a strategic move that could potentially incentivize warrant holders to exercise their options sooner rather than later. By reducing the exercise price from C$4.95 to C$1.80, the company is essentially lowering the entry cost for investors, which may lead to an increased cash flow for POET if a significant number of warrants are exercised. This could provide the company with additional capital to fund ongoing operations or invest in new projects.Moreover, the introduction of an Acceleration Clause aligns with common practices intended to motivate a quicker conversion of warrants into shares. This clause might be triggered if the stock performs well, thus potentially shortening the duration for which these warrants are outstanding. It is essential to monitor the stock's performance to anticipate any rapid changes in the expiry date of the warrants, which could affect the liquidity and market dynamics of POET's stock. Market Research Analyst POET Technologies' amendment to the warrant terms could be indicative of their current market positioning and future expectations. The significant reduction in exercise price may reflect an adjustment to market conditions since the initial private placement. It's important to consider the competitive landscape of the data center, telecommunication and artificial intelligence markets where POET operates. The capital influx from exercised warrants may provide the company with the means to invest in R&D or strategic initiatives to maintain or improve its competitive edge.However, this move could also signal to the market that the company's shares were overvalued at the time of the original warrant issue, or that the company anticipates needing more capital than initially expected. Stakeholders should assess the potential dilutive effect of warrant exercises on their shareholdings and the impact on the company's earnings per share. Securities Lawyer From a legal standpoint, the necessity for POET Technologies to obtain the consent of all warrant holders before the amendments can take effect is a critical procedural step. This requirement is in line with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange and ensures fairness and transparency in the process. Investors should be aware that such amendments are subject to regulatory scrutiny and the final acceptance of the Exchange, which serves as a safeguard against potential abuses of corporate power.The Acceleration Clause addition is a standard mechanism in warrant contracts, but it is important that warrant holders fully understand the implications of this clause. It essentially conditions the timing of their investment decision on the market performance of the underlying shares. Legal counsel for warrant holders might advise on the risks and benefits of consenting to such amendments, considering individual investment strategies and the potential for an accelerated expiry date. 03/22/2024 - 03:32 PM TORONTO, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- POET Technologies Inc. (""POET"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSXV: PTK; NASDAQ: POET), the designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer™, Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and light sources for the data center, tele-communication and artificial intelligence markets, announced today, that it intends to amend the terms of 563,317 common share purchase warrants of the Corporation (the ""Warrants"") that were issued pursuant to a private placement that closed on December 2, 2022 (the ""Private Placement""). Each Warrant is currently exercisable by the holder thereof to acquire one common share of the Corporation (each, a ""Common Share"") at an exercise price of C$4.95 (US$3.61) per Common Share until December 2, 2025. The purpose of the proposed amendments (collectively, the ""Amendments"") is to (i) reduce the exercise price of the Warrants from C$4.95 (US$3.61) to C$1.80 (US$1.33) per Common Share, and (ii) add an Acceleration Clause (as defined herein) to comply with the requirements of the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""Exchange""). Warrantholder Approval In accordance with the terms of the Warrants and the policies of the Exchange, the Corporation must obtain the consent of all holders of Warrants in order to give effect to the Amendments. Therefore, in order to give effect to the Amendments, the Corporation will be promptly seeking the written consent of all holders of Warrants to such Amendments.

(TSXV:EUP)(OTCQB:AUCCF U.S.) (the ""Company"" or ""Europacific"") is pleased to announce a corporate update letter to shareholders in address from the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Karim Rayani.Dear Shareholders,As we embark on the ensuing year ahead, I'm pleased to share with you a corporate update letter outlining the Company's objectives and strategies for 2024 and beyond.We are in the midst of what is quickly shaping up to be a very favorable macroeconomic environment for Gold, Copper and precious metals. Yet a perplexing disparity persists for companies despite the favorable backdrop as metal prices head higher market capitalizations continue to struggle creating unprecedented opportunities in the resources sector. Additionally low interest rates can weaken the purchasing power of fiat currencies, making precious metals relatively more attractive as a store of value setting stage for a return to commodities and market capitalizations within the junior mining sector.One of the commodities that I feel presents tremendous opportunity in the sector is Copper, the recent surge in copper prices combined with anticipated supply shortfalls over the next few years Copper is a value proposition that one should not ignore.Supply-Demand Imbalance: With increasing demand for copper driven by infrastructure projects, renewable energy initiatives, and electric vehicle adoption, the market is facing a potential supply-demand imbalance. The result upward pressure on prices, benefiting copper producers.Investment Potential: The expected shortfall in copper supply creates an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on potential price appreciation. Investors can consider exposure to copper through various avenues such as stocks of mining companies, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or directly trading copper futures contracts.Strategic Importance: Copper is a critical metal with diverse industrial applications, ranging from construction and electronics to transportation and telecommunications. Its strategic importance in various sectors ensures sustained demand, further supporting its price outlook.Long-term Trends: Structural shifts such as the transition to renewable energy, electrification of transportation, and urbanization in emerging markets are expected to drive long-term demand for copper. Investing in copper now could position investors to benefit from these ongoing trends.Geopolitical Factors: Geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and supply chain disruptions can impact copper production and distribution. As such, can provide a hedge against geopolitical risks and uncertainties.Overall, the combination of surging copper prices and anticipated supply shortfalls presents an opportunity for investors bullish on the copper sector. However, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider risk factors before making investment decisions.I was newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, director of EuroPacific on October 17, 2023, and since have made several changes to streamline operations optimizing resources and enhancing productivity across all aspects of operations. We prioritize and recognize the importance of sustainable and social initiatives to the well-being of our communities as we develop our asset portfolio.Looking ahead, our primary objective for the ensuing year is the Immediate planning of advancing the Miguel Vacas Copper prospect. An 11-hole program totaling 1,000-meters is currently being planned to test the surface mineralization along strike, we will be reporting back in the coming weeks on the estimated start date once drill contractors have been confirmed.A 2-year exploration plan has been approved internally for the advancement of the project where we feel a resource can be developed.The area lies approximately 180km east by road from Lisbon and 70km from Évora, the Alentejo region capital. It is close (< 10km) to the small towns of Estremoz, Borba, Vila Viçosa and Alandroal.Confirm the high- grade zones from old reports and expand the ""mining widths"" to a more substantial target size over the main drilled area covering a strike length of 1.1 km of the mineralized shear zone.Infill drilling with a 100m X 100m grid to produce an initial reliable mineral resource estimation (Inferred category) of the supergene heap leachable copper blanket (0 - 80m depth).Further soil testing and advancement studies, for expansion along less advanced prospects including geochemistry (soils and rocks) along with geophysics (Airborne EM and Ground IP).Borba 2 projects, further exploration plans underway with well-documented potential to host precious and base metals mineralization for Copper and Gold.The Miguel Vacas mine was an open pit copper mine last operated in 1986 by heap leaching methods. Records show that between the 1920's and 1990, 346 068 tonnes of oxide copper mineralization were mined but due to poor recovery only 895 tonnes of copper metal were produced. Copper grades ranged from 0.6 to 0.7% in the early years of the operation but later reached up to 1.4%. This mine was closed in 1986 due to financial trouble after having produced 464,100 t of ore with an average grade of 2.1% Cu. Prior exploration was carried out by Rio Tinto for epithermal gold deposits during the early 1980's. The project changed hands a number of times before we were able to acquire ownership.Miguel Vacas deposit - old open pit Recent exploration results have indicated a potential strike extension of 2 km. Cu-bearing shear zones.Assays from a channel sampling program carried out in 2006 by Rio Narcea Gold Mines (RNGM) in the old Miguel Vacas north pit walls, has indicated a width of 13.5 meters @ 1.6% Cu, including 2 meters @ 4.9% Cu. The results from the southern wall are nearly identical with an interval of 13.6 meters @ 1.6 % Cu. The samples were taken at the far ends of the old pit that extends presently 250 meters along strike.Historical and recent drilling confirms these results. Highlights include 6m @ 0.8% Cu from hole MV04, 10.0m @ 0.9% Cu from hole MV05, 8.6m @ 1.1% Cu from hole MV07, 7.9m @ 2.03% Cu from hole MV08, 4.25m @ 1.5% Cu from hole MV09, 16.5m @ 1.5% Cu from hole MV10, 6.0m @ 1.0% Cu from hole MV14, 7.9 m @ 1.0 % Cu from hole MV16, 21.6m @ 1.6% Cu from hole MV19 and 10.7m @ 1.94% Cu from hole BOMV15001.Rio Narcea produced an in-house resource estimation (non-compliant) exercise based on a 100 x 100m drilling campaign (20 holes in total) using the basic Tysson Polygon method. Results point out to a figure of 5.54 Mt with a total contained 68,186 tonnes Cu metal. This includes a total of 1.12 Mt @t 1.23% Cu from the oxidized blanket and 4.4 Mt @ 1.24% Cu from primary sulphide ore.3D view of the Miguel Vacas deposit This underground mine was registered in 1866 and operated intermittently until around 1900. There are records for a total of 9 mine levels down to a total depth of 200m.The vein system occupies a 1km long section of the fault zone and includes three main veins that have been mined in the past: Vein 1 (main vein) - N50oE/80o NW, up to 1.2 m thick, mined over 800m along strike; Vein2 - NS/50o E, average 1.3m thickness and Vein 3 - NS/90o;no records on thickness.Dump samples of silicified and sheared acid tuffs from the Bugalho mine area within the Vascas deposit assay up to 9.14 g/t Au and 0.35% Cu. The mineralization is from a wide NE-SW trending shear zone that can be mapped on at least 5 km along strike. Detailed follow-up is planned in this prospect.Interpreted geological section (hole PAM-1) of main mineralized system. Significant drill intercepts comprise 5.45 m @ 1.53 g/t Au, including 2.47m @ 2.44 g/t Au in hole PAM-1. The highest individual value obtained came from a gossanous quartz-dolomite altered marble @ 5.77 g/t Au over an intercept of 0.75m. Banded carbonatization and low-temperature silica alteration occur thoroughly in the hole. Zones of poor recovery are interpreted to represent karst fill features.Results obtained for Borehole PAM-2, located in the same zone include an intercept of 17 m @ 0.5 g/t Au, including an interval of 2m @ 3.7 g/t Au. The mineralized zone coincides with sections of intense silica-carbonate alteration with several massive gossan zones and localized fresh sulphide dissemination (chalcopyrite and pyrite).Longitudinal section of Miguel Vacas and drilling planned for 2024 Additional new targets identified with follow-up mapping, soil and rock geochemistry along with detailed geophysics (IP/resistivity), followed by drill checking.Exploring for critical elements, particularly copper, presents a compelling value proposition in today's market characterized by a global deficit. As industries increasingly rely on copper for essential applications in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and infrastructure development, the demand for this critical element continues to outpace supply. By securing access to new copper reserves through exploration efforts, companies can not only mitigate supply chain risks but also stand to benefit from potentially lucrative opportunities in a market hungry for this indispensable resource.EuroPacific is opportunistically positioned as we further develop and explore the Miguel Vacas Copper project. The Company is also in the process of rebranding and will be announcing a name change to better align the Company's focus in the Iberian Peninsula.About Europacific Metals IncEuropacific Metals Inc. is a Canadian public company listed on TSXV and in US on OTCQB.

The offering included 147,500 shares of common stock priced at $8.00 per share, along with unregistered warrants. The net proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial maneuver by TFF Pharmaceuticals, involving a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of warrants, is a strategic move to bolster the company's working capital and support general corporate functions. This type of capital raising is often employed by clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies to sustain operations before reaching profitability. The decision to price the shares at $8.00, which is considered 'at-the-market' under Nasdaq rules, suggests a neutral stance towards current market valuation, avoiding the potential discounting that could devalue existing shares.From a financial perspective, the gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 million, before fees and expenses, may seem modest for a biopharmaceutical firm. It's imperative to consider the burn rate of the company and how these funds will extend the company's runway. Investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of the additional shares and warrants on their existing holdings. The exercise of the warrants could potentially provide a future cash influx, but also further dilution. It's important to monitor how effectively the company deploys these funds towards advancing its TFF technology platform, which could, in turn, drive future growth. Biotechnology Market Analyst The capital infusion for TFF Pharmaceuticals comes at a critical juncture for the company, which is navigating the capital-intensive phase of clinical trials. Their proprietary Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform represents a novel approach in drug delivery, potentially improving the solubility and absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. The success of this platform could have significant implications for the drug development industry, offering a competitive edge over traditional drug formulations.The biotechnology sector is highly sensitive to technological advancements and investor sentiment. The market's reaction to TFF Pharmaceuticals' offering will hinge on confidence in the TFF platform's future success and the company's ability to execute its development plans efficiently. Industry observers will be keen on the company's forthcoming milestones and how this capital raise might accelerate the path to commercialization for its drug candidates. Securities Law Expert The mechanisms TFF Pharmaceuticals employed in raising capital—registered direct offering and a private placement of warrants—must adhere to strict regulatory frameworks. The use of a shelf registration statement for the common stock offering, previously filed and declared effective by the SEC, enables a quicker response to market conditions, allowing the company to raise funds as needed within a set period.The private placement of unregistered warrants falls under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D, which exempts certain transactions from the rigorous registration requirements, provided they are not offered publicly and are sold to accredited investors. This method of offering could limit the liquidity of the warrants, as they cannot be sold in the public market without either an effective registration statement or an exemption. Investors should be cognizant of the legal nuances and restrictions associated with unregistered securities and their potential implications on marketability. 03/22/2024 - 03:11 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Nasdaq: TFFP) (the “Company” or “TFF Pharmaceuticals”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on its patented Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform, today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for the purchase and sale of 147,500 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $8.00 per share.

The company views the German market as pivotal to its international cannabis strategy, alongside its involvement in the Netherlands' legal recreational cannabis program. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent legislative change in Germany, which partially legalizes cannabis for personal use, is a significant development for companies operating in the cannabis industry. One of the key aspects to consider is how this will affect the demand dynamics within the German market. With the ability for individuals to possess, cultivate and obtain cannabis through social clubs, we can anticipate an increase in legal consumption. This could lead to a shift in consumer behavior, with potential customers transitioning from the black market to legal channels, thus expanding the total addressable market for companies like Village Farms International.From a market research perspective, it's essential to monitor the trends and consumer preferences that will emerge as a result of this legislation. The demand for specific strains, product types and consumption methods may evolve and companies that are able to quickly adapt to these preferences will likely gain a competitive edge. Furthermore, the establishment of cannabis social clubs could create a new retail environment, which may influence marketing strategies and distribution models. Legal Expert The removal of cannabis from the German Narcotics Act is a transformative legal development that opens up a new realm of regulatory compliance and opportunities. For businesses like Village Farms, it's important to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively to ensure compliance with both German laws and international regulations. The ability to cultivate up to three plants at home and the establishment of cannabis social clubs introduces a new legal framework that companies must understand in order to operate successfully within the market.One area to watch is how the German government will regulate the production, distribution and sale of cannabis. The legal framework will likely include quality and safety standards, particularly since Village Farms boasts EU GMP certification. Companies that maintain high standards and comply with regulations can leverage this as a competitive advantage and a mark of trust for consumers. Financial Analyst The announcement by Village Farms International regarding the German cannabis legislation presents potential financial implications for the company and its investors. The expansion into the German market is likely to impact the company's revenue streams and could provide a significant growth opportunity. With Germany's position as Europe's largest economy, the opening of its market to legal cannabis could serve as a catalyst for further European market liberalization, potentially increasing Village Farms' addressable market.It's important to assess the company's current financial health and its capacity to scale operations to meet the anticipated increase in demand. Investors should look for indicators such as the company's capital expenditure plans, supply chain readiness and any strategic partnerships that may be formed to capitalize on this new market opportunity. While there's potential for increased revenues, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with regulatory changes and market competition as more players aim to enter the German market. 03/22/2024 - 03:30 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia and ORLANDO, Fla., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Farms International, Inc.

The data from the Phase 3 CANOPY trial show a potential signal of clinical protection from symptomatic COVID-19. The company plans to further analyze the relationship between serum virus neutralizing antibody titers and clinical efficacy in future trials. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The interim exploratory data from Invivyd's CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial presents an interesting perspective on the potential efficacy of VYD222, a monoclonal antibody designed for pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. The distinction made between participants with prior immunity and those without is noteworthy. Historically, monoclonal antibody trials have focused on naïve populations, but the inclusion of individuals with pre-existing immunity could suggest a shift in the understanding of therapeutic efficacy in a more varied demographic.The data, while not yet conclusive, indicate a potential correlation between serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers and clinical protection. This could have implications for future clinical trial designs and the development of monoclonal antibodies as a preventative measure. The analysis of symptomatic COVID-19 events as a secondary endpoint underscores the exploratory nature of this data, which does not directly impact regulatory filings but does provide a foundation for future research and development strategies. Epidemiologist The reported rates of symptomatic COVID-19 in the CANOPY trial's cohorts offer preliminary insights into the real-world effectiveness of VYD222 across different levels of immune compromise. The low incidence of symptomatic cases in both cohorts, especially when compared to the placebo group, raises questions about the potential role of VYD222 in broader prophylactic strategies. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution, as the data are exploratory and the full dataset from the Day 180 analysis is pending.Understanding the dynamics of sVNA titers in relation to clinical outcomes is important for public health strategies. These interim results could influence future vaccination policies and the development of targeted prophylactic treatments for individuals at high risk of exposure or with compromised immune systems. The ongoing monitoring of these participants will be essential in determining the long-term protective effects of VYD222 and its possible integration into existing prevention protocols. Biotech Industry Analyst From an industry perspective, Invivyd's interim data release is a strategic move that may position the company as a thought leader in the evolving landscape of COVID-19 prophylaxis. The emphasis on the relationship between neutralizing titers and protection is a step towards more personalized healthcare solutions. While the immediate financial impact on Invivyd's stock may be limited due to the exploratory status of the findings, the long-term potential of VYD222 to meet unaddressed needs in immune-compromised populations could be significant.Investors should monitor the progress of the CANOPY trial closely, as the Day 180 results will provide a more comprehensive understanding of VYD222's efficacy and safety profile. Positive outcomes could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive the company's valuation. However, the biotech sector is highly volatile and the eventual market success of VYD222 will depend on a variety of factors including competitive products, market demand and the regulatory landscape. 03/22/2024 - 03:28 PM Analysis of secondary endpoint of symptomatic COVID-19 events in CANOPY is unrelated to regulatory filing or review, but may be hypothesis generating for future Invivyd discovery and development workToday’s update on Day 67 and Day 90 event rates is the first of two planned public updates on symptomatic COVID-19 events in CANOPY; Invivyd plans to analyze all future events at Day 180Further defining the relationship between serum virus neutralizing antibody titers and clinical protection that prospectively builds on published data is an anticipated goal of future clinical trials WALTHAM, Mass., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Invivyd, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company on a mission to protect the vulnerable from serious viral infectious diseases, today announced interim exploratory COVID-19 clinical event data for VYD222, an investigational, monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The data announced today from the ongoing Phase 3 CANOPY clinical trial reflect and add further to the initial potential signal of clinical protection from symptomatic COVID-19 shared in December 2023, and may be useful in updating prior published work that analyzed the relationships between serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers and protection in patients who had no prior exposure to vaccination or natural infection.1 “While these interim clinical efficacy data are exploratory and not part of the primary immunobridging endpoint of the CANOPY clinical trial, we believe they further our efforts to understand the relationship between sVNA titers and clinical efficacy in individuals who have some level of vaccine- or infection-induced immunity,” said Dave Hering, Chief Executive Officer. “As we continue to build out our company and advance the science describing monoclonal antibody pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), we believe we can incorporate these findings into future prospectively designed clinical studies that seek to establish formal relationships between neutralizing titers and protection. Exploratory data such as provided in today’s update are important for broad reflection as they represent some of the first data from a clinical trial conducted with a monoclonal antibody in a population that has acquired prior immune exposure from either vaccination or natural infection. By contrast, studies of prior authorized COVID-19 PrEP mAbs largely relied on participants required by protocol to be naïve to vaccination or prior infection2. As such, these people would presumably have no baseline titers. We continue to explore how measured titers compare with calculated titers and look to assess if higher levels of protection in future studies may be possible with lower levels of additional titers conferred from mAbs.” The ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VYD222 and to assess immunobridging from VYD222 to certain historical data from the company’s previous Phase 2/3 clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (EVADE). Symptomatic COVID-19 event collection in the CANOPY clinical trial is a secondary exploratory endpoint designed to allow Invivyd to contemplate further discovery and development work only. The CANOPY clinical trial enrolled participants in two cohorts. Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions (n=306). Cohort B is a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that enrolled adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise who are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings. All CANOPY Cohort A participants received VYD222 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. Cohort B participants were randomized 2:1 to receive VYD222 or placebo administered via IV infusion. Updated Findings As previously disclosed by the company in December 2023, a potential early signal of clinical protection from symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR was observed. Invivyd is now providing an update on the clinical cases of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 through Day 90. Beyond today’s update, additional cases of COVID-19 have occurred in Cohorts A and B post Day 90. These data are planned to be analyzed at Day 180 and presented when available.

(IVVD) receives emergency use authorization for PEMGARDA, a monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 prevention in immunocompromised individuals. The company anticipates product availability soon, with a strong financial position and ongoing clinical trials supporting its efficacy and safety. Positive PEMGARDA is the first PrEP monoclonal antibody authorized by the FDA for COVID-19 in immune-compromised individuals. Invivyd's novel technology platform approach led to the development of PEMGARDA, addressing rapid viral evolution. The company has an estimated $200.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, with recent share sales further strengthening its financial position. PEMGARDA's EUA is based on positive immunobridging data from the CANOPY trial, demonstrating neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Clinical data from the ongoing CANOPY trial supports the safety and efficacy of PEMGARDA in immunocompromised individuals. Invivyd aims to continuously innovate and provide vulnerable populations with access to innovative antibody therapies. An interim analysis of safety data from the CANOPY trial shows a low incidence of anaphylaxis and mild to moderate infusion-related reactions. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The authorization of PEMGARDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals represents a significant advancement in COVID-19 prevention strategies. The use of immunobridging data to obtain emergency use authorization indicates a shift towards more flexible and rapid regulatory processes in response to public health needs. By focusing on serum virus neutralizing antibody titers as a surrogate marker for efficacy, Invivyd has managed to streamline the development and approval timeline for its monoclonal antibody. This strategy may set a precedent for future therapeutics targeting rapidly evolving pathogens.From a research standpoint, the continued in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, underscores the potential for PEMGARDA to be effective against current and future strains. However, the emergence of new variants that may not be neutralized by existing mAbs, including PEMGARDA, remains a concern. Continuous viral surveillance and predictive modeling will be critical in ensuring the long-term efficacy of such treatments. Financial Analyst The financial implications of PEMGARDA's EUA are multifaceted. Invivyd's stock (Nasdaq: IVVD) is likely to respond positively to this development, as the authorization could translate into significant revenue streams for the company. The timely sale of shares totaling $40.5 million in gross proceeds under its At-the-Market facility demonstrates strategic financial planning, bolstering the company's balance sheet ahead of the commercial launch. Investors should note the company's cash runway projection, which indicates sufficient funds into the fourth quarter of 2024, excluding anticipated cash collections from PEMGARDA sales.However, investors must also consider the risks associated with the biopharmaceutical industry, such as potential safety concerns that could affect drug adoption and sales. The reported cases of anaphylaxis, although a small percentage, might influence prescribing patterns and patient acceptance. Close monitoring of post-launch safety data and market uptake will be essential in evaluating the long-term financial impact of PEMGARDA on Invivyd's performance. Market Research Analyst The commercial launch of PEMGARDA is poised to address a significant unmet need among immunocompromised individuals, a demographic that continues to be at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes despite vaccination. The market potential for pre-exposure prophylaxis treatments is substantial, given the ongoing threat posed by COVID-19 and the potential for future pandemics caused by similar viruses. Invivyd's strategic positioning, with its proprietary technology platform INVYMAB, could enable the company to capitalize on this market by rapidly developing and deploying mAbs for emerging viral threats.Market adoption will depend not only on the clinical benefits but also on factors such as ease of administration, cost, insurance coverage and competition from other prophylactic and therapeutic options. The IV infusion route may pose logistical challenges compared to oral or subcutaneous alternatives, potentially affecting market penetration. Nevertheless, the immediate availability of the product and the anticipation of future clinical studies to explore broader protective benefits suggest a proactive approach to market entry and expansion. 03/22/2024 - 03:04 PM PEMGARDA (pemivibart) is authorized in the U.S. for PrEP of COVID-19 in certain adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe immune compromise Emergency use authorization based on positive immunobridging data and on safety data from the CANOPY clinical trial along with ongoing in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1PEMGARDA is the first PrEP monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive EUA from the U.S. FDA based on a novel, rapid, repeatable immunobridging trial design PEMGARDA is the first authorized mAb from Invivyd’s novel technology platform approach designed to address the challenge of rapid viral evolutionProduct availability in the U.S. anticipated imminentlyEstimated cash and cash equivalents of $200.6 million as of December 31, 2023 In February 2024, the Company sold shares totaling $40.5 million in gross proceeds under its At-the-Market facility further strengthening its balance sheet ahead of PEMGARDA launchConference call today at 4pm ET to discuss the EUA and commercial launch of PEMGARDA WALTHAM, Mass., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Invivyd, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVVD), a biopharmaceutical company on a mission to protect the vulnerable from serious viral infectious diseases, today announced that PEMGARDA™ (pemivibart), formerly VYD222, a half-life extended monoclonal antibody (mAb), has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2. “The PEMGARDA EUA marks a transformational moment for Invivyd and for the many moderately to severely immunocompromised people who are vulnerable to COVID-19 disease in the U.S. This EUA milestone represents strategic proof-of-concept for our company and platform, affirming the unique strategy we embarked on over a year ago: to use rapid innovation and surrogate markers to bring new antibodies to market repeatedly,” said Dave Hering, Chief Executive Officer of Invivyd. “PEMGARDA is the first authorized monoclonal antibody from our proprietary platform approach. We are committed to ongoing process improvement while working with global regulatory agencies with the aim to increase the speed and efficiency of new mAb candidate development even further. Additionally, we are planning to explore the protective clinical benefits of mAb prophylaxis for symptomatic COVID-19 disease in future studies.” Mr. Hering added, “We are proud that roughly one year after initiating the Phase 1 trial of our mAb now known as PEMGARDA, we are expecting to have product available for order imminently, with initial supply already packaged and awaiting final release at our U.S.-based third-party logistics provider. I’m deeply grateful to our dedicated team members who made this achievement possible and everyone else who has supported our work, especially our clinical trial participants and investigators. Finally, we also appreciate the continuous engagement from the FDA as they have worked with urgency to make this medicine available to populations in serious need.” “People who are immunocompromised continue to be disproportionally impacted by COVID-19 even after receiving multiple vaccine doses,” said Cameron R. Wolfe, M.B.B.S., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine, Transplant Infectious Disease at Duke University School of Medicine. “I’m excited to have PEMGARDA as an additional COVID-19 preventive option for moderately to severely immunocompromised adult and adolescent patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients and those with hematological malignancies. These types of patients, among others, continue to have both an impaired response to vaccines and a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.” “COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat and major concern to those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised,” said Jorey Berry, President and CEO of the Immune Deficiency Foundation and a steering committee member of the Immunocompromised Collaborative. “As such, we are delighted that a new monoclonal antibody for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 will be available soon for certain vulnerable populations.” Multiple medical conditions or treatments may result in moderate-to-severe immune compromise and an impaired immune response to COVID-19 vaccination including, for example, hematologic malignancies (blood cancers) or treatment with immunosuppressive therapy after a solid organ or stem cell transplant.1 Observational studies have demonstrated that people with immune dysfunction have a higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death, despite vaccination, than the general population.2-3 The EUA of PEMGARDA is based on the totality of scientific evidence available, such as data showing that immunobridging was established in the CANOPY clinical trial and that the calculated serum neutralizing antibody titers against JN.1 were consistent with the titer levels associated with efficacy in prior clinical trials of adintrevimab (ADG20), the parent mAb for VYD222, and other monoclonal antibody products. JN.1 is currently the dominant variant circulating in the U.S. according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).4 PEMGARDA (pemivibart) (4500 mg) is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion. PEMGARDA is Invivyd’s first authorized mAb and the first mAb to receive EUA based on a rapid immunobridging trial design that is expected to be repeatable to help address the need to mitigate ongoing viral evolution. It was developed using INVYMAB™, the company’s platform approach which combines state-of-the-art viral surveillance and predictive modeling with advanced antibody engineering. INVYMAB is designed to enable the rapid, serial generation of durable mAbs targeting conserved epitopes that could be deployed to keep pace with SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution or other viral threats. With a commitment to serial innovation, Invivyd aims to ensure that vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised people, have continuous access to innovative antibody therapies. The Company estimates it had approximately $200.6 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. The estimated amounts are preliminary, have not been audited and are subject to change upon completion of the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In February 2024, the Company sold shares of common stock totaling $40.5 million in gross proceeds under its At-the-Market facility further strengthening the Company’s balance sheet ahead of PEMGARDA launch. Based on current operating plans and excluding anticipated cash collections from PEMGARDA sales, Invivyd expects its existing total cash and cash equivalents will enable the company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2024. Interim CANOPY Clinical Data Update CANOPY is an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of VYD222 (PEMGARDA) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 which enrolled adults ≥18 years of age in two cohorts. Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise (n=306); Cohort B is a 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which adults who do not have moderate-to-severe immune compromise received VYD222 (n=317) or placebo (n=162). The interim data presented below are subject to further analysis. Summary of CANOPY immunobridging data An immunobridging approach was used in the CANOPY clinical trial, utilizing the relationship between serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers and clinical efficacy that was demonstrated in the previous EVADE clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20), the parent mAb for VYD222, and clinical trials of other mAbs that were previously authorized by the FDA. EVADE was a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of adintrevimab for PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve, unvaccinated individuals, which showed that a neutralizing titer of 3514 on Day 90 was associated with approximately 70% clinical efficacy in the PrEP cohort (approximately 70% relative risk reduction in development of symptomatic COVID-19 between the adintrevimab and placebo arms). The CANOPY trial was designed to utilize current relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants in the analyses of neutralizing titers. The primary immunobridging endpoint for Cohort A was based on calculated sVNA titers on Day 28 following VYD222 administration compared with the calculated Day 28 reference titer derived from historical Day 90 data from the EVADE trial. The most relevant SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in the U.S. at the time of the analysis (JN.1), was selected as the variant for the analysis of the primary immunobridging endpoint. Summary of initial CANOPY immunobridging data from Cohort A (immunocompromised cohort): The Day 28 calculated sVNA titer for VYD222 against JN.1 was 7365 (90% CI: 7148, 7589).The ratio between the Day 28 titer for VYD222 against JN.1 of 7365 and a Day 28 adintrevimab reference titer of 8944 was 0.82 (90% CI: 0.80, 0.85), showing that immunobridging was established in the CANOPY clinical trial.The Day 90 calculated sVNA titer for VYD222 against JN.1, prior to redosing, was 3199 (90% CI: 2995, 3418).The titers against JN.1 are projected to stay above the reference titer of 3514 for approximately 77 days (median) following a single dose of VYD222 (Figure 1).The range of titers achieved against JN.1 for 3 months following administration of VYD222 were consistent with the titer levels associated with efficacy of other SARS-CoV-2 targeting mAbs in prior clinical trials.6 Figure 1. Calculated sVNA titers against JN.1 based on observed pharmacokinetic concentration by timepoints (Cohort A) Figure 1 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bccd1b05-c199-4795-915c-fce5cbe3d651 Summary of CANOPY safety data The safety of VYD222 (PEMGARDA) is based on exposure of 623 participants who received at least one dose of VYD222 4500 mg IV in one of two cohorts in the ongoing CANOPY trial. Cohort A is a single-arm, open-label trial in adults who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions (n=306). Cohort B is a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that recruited adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise who are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings. Cohort B participants were randomized 2:1 to VYD222 (n=317) or placebo (n=162). Interim safety data presented today included 296 people in Cohort A who received a second dose of VYD222 three months after the initial dose. In Cohort B, 450 participants received a second dose of VYD222 or placebo three months after the initial dose. Cumulative safety with the first two doses of VYD222 is assessed only in Cohort A because unblinded safety data in Cohort B were not available after Day 28. Anaphylaxis was observed in four of 623 (0.6%) participants in CANOPY, all in Cohort A. Two participants had anaphylaxis during the first infusion, for whom treatment included diphenhydramine. Two participants had anaphylaxis during the second infusion. All four reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VYD222. Three participants had complete resolution, and one participant had acute resolution with sequelae related to a flare of an underlying condition. For the two participants who experienced anaphylaxis with the second dose, both incidents were reported as life-threatening, and they experienced symptoms during the infusion and following discontinuation of the infusion. Both participants were treated with diphenhydramine and epinephrine. One participant also received oral prednisone and metoprolol for an associated flare of an underlying condition. Please see PEMGARDA Important Safety Information below, including a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The systemic infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions observed in Cohort A are summarized in Table 1. The severity of the reactions was generally mild (17/27) or moderate (8/27), but two reactions were life-threatening. Table 1. Cohort A (Open-label cohort with moderate-to-severe immune compromise) – Systemic infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions Cohort A (n=306)VYD222 First DoseVYD222 First & Second Dose, CumulativelySystemic infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions20 total (20/306 = 7%)(20 mild or moderate, including 2 anaphylaxis*)27 total (27/306 = 9%)(17 mild and 8 moderate, including 2 anaphylaxis*; plus 2 life-threatening anaphylaxis) *These two events were initially classified as mild or moderate hypersensitivity adverse reactions. Subsequently, during the review of the EUA application, the FDA reclassified these hypersensitivity adverse reactions as anaphylaxis adverse reactions. Safety data through Day 28 from Cohort B (post-first dose only) were also analyzed in support of the EUA filing, including randomized data on systemic infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions, as shown in Table 2. As of Day 28, there were no observations of anaphylaxis in the Cohort B VYD222 arm. Unblinded safety data in Cohort B were not available yet after Day 28. Table 2.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS Anaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA in 0.6% (4/623) of participants in a clinical trial.Anaphylaxis was reported during the first and second infusion of PEMGARDA.Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening.Prior to administering PEMGARDA, consider the potential benefit of COVID-19 prevention along with the risk of anaphylaxis.Administer PEMGARDA only in settings in which healthcare providers have immediate access to medications to treat anaphylaxis and the ability to activate the emergency medical system (EMS), as necessary.Clinically monitor individuals during the infusion and for at least two hours after completion of the infusion.Discontinue PEMGARDA immediately if signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or any severe systemic reaction are observed and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy. CONTRAINDICATIONS PEMGARDA is contraindicated in individuals with previous severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of PEMGARDA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related ReactionsSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with PEMGARDA. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration, and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy. Clinically monitor individuals during infusion and observe for at least two hours after infusion is complete. Risk of Cross-Hypersensitivity With COVID-19 VaccinesPEMGARDA contains polysorbate 80, which is in some COVID-19 vaccines and is structurally similar to polyethylene glycol (PEG), an ingredient in other COVID-19 vaccines. For individuals with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, consider consultation with an allergist-immunologist prior to PEMGARDA administration. Risk for COVID-19 Due to SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants Not Neutralized by PEMGARDACertain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that are not neutralized by monoclonal antibodies such as PEMGARDA. PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. Inform individuals of the increased risk, compared to other variants, for COVID-19 due to emergent SARS-CoV-2 viral variants not neutralized by PEMGARDA. If signs and symptoms of COVID-19 occur, advise individuals to test for COVID-19 and seek medical attention, including starting treatment for COVID-19 as appropriate. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS PregnancyThere are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. PEMGARDA should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus. LactationThere are no available data on the presence of PEMGARDA in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for PEMGARDA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PEMGARDA. Pediatric UsePEMGARDA is not authorized for use in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of PEMGARDA has not been established in pediatrics. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) FOR PEMGARDA The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA for the emergency use of the unapproved product PEMGARDA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg): Who are not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who have not had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 andWho have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate response to COVID-19 vaccination. LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORIZED USE PEMGARDA is not authorized for use: For treatment of COVID-19, orFor post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in individuals who have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, should receive COVID-19 vaccination.In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. PEMGARDA may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs.

About PEMGARDA PEMGARDA (pemivibart), formerly known as VYD222, is a half-life extended investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb). PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd’s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and demonstrated clinically meaningful results in global Phase 2/3 clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA was designed for broad activity and has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity in pseudotyped virus-like particle and authentic virus neutralization assays against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, the dominant variant in the U.S. currently according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells. PEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb with emergency use authorization in the U.S. for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2. Anaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events (all grades, incidence ≥2%) observed in participants who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise treated with PEMGARDA included systemic and local infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, influenza-like illness, fatigue, headache, and nausea.

Various safety information provided for NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL. Company's pending label expansions in Europe on track. Significant ramp-up in sales force and promotional activities. Expectations of increased sales and patient access. Negative None. Cardiovascular Specialist The recent FDA approval of label expansions for NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET represents a significant development in the field of cardiovascular disease (CVD) management. The expanded indication for primary prevention in patients with high cardiovascular risk but without established disease marks a pivotal shift. Previously, the focus was predominantly on secondary prevention—treating patients post-cardiovascular events. This proactive approach could lead to a decrease in the incidence of first-time cardiovascular events, potentially reducing the overall burden of CVD on the healthcare system.From a clinical perspective, the absence of statin requirement in the new labels provides an alternative treatment for patients who are statin-intolerant due to side effects, which is a common issue in lipid management. The ability to use NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET either alone or in combination with statins offers greater flexibility and individualization of treatment plans. However, it's important to monitor the long-term safety profile of these drugs, as any new treatment may present unforeseen risks over time. Market Research Analyst The label expansion for Esperion's products has the potential to significantly impact the company's market share and revenue. With an estimated 70 million patients in the U.S. now eligible for treatment with NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET, the addressable market has substantially increased. This expansion aligns with the growing trend of personalized medicine and could position Esperion as a leader in the non-statin lipid-lowering market.However, the success of these products will depend on several factors, including the adoption rate by healthcare providers, the competitive landscape and reimbursement by payers. Esperion's proactive measures, such as ramping up their sales force and creating new promotional materials, indicate a strategic approach to capitalize on the expanded indications. The anticipated label determination in Europe will also be a critical factor to watch, as a positive outcome could further boost the company's growth prospects. Pharmaco-Economist Examining the pharmacoeconomic implications of the expanded indications for NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET, the potential cost-effectiveness of these drugs in primary prevention needs to be scrutinized. While they may reduce the need for more expensive treatments associated with cardiovascular events, the overall impact on healthcare expenditure will depend on their pricing strategy and the actual reduction in cardiovascular events achieved in real-world settings.It's also essential to consider the broader economic implications, such as the potential reduction in lost productivity and healthcare costs associated with cardiovascular events. If the drugs prove to be effective in preventing first-time events, they could offer substantial savings to the healthcare system. However, the long-term cost savings must be weighed against the immediate increase in drug spending. 03/22/2024 - 03:10 PM – New Labels Expand Treatable Population to ~70 Million Patients in U.S. – – First LDL-C Lowering Non-Statin Indicated for Primary Prevention Patients – – Approvals Based on Positive CLEAR Outcomes Data and Reflect a Highly Differentiated Product Profile – – Positive CHMP Opinion Received; European Cardiovascular (CV) Risk Reduction Label Determination Anticipated in Q2 2024 – – Conference Call and Webcast on Monday, March 25 at 8:00 a.m. ET – ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (NASDAQ: ESPR) today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved broad new label expansions for NEXLETOL® (bempedoic acid) Tablets and NEXLIZET® (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablets based on positive CLEAR Outcomes data that include indications for cardiovascular risk reduction and expanded LDL-C lowering in both primary and secondary prevention patients. In addition, the enhanced labels support the use of NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET either alone or in combination with statins. They also include new indications for primary hyperlipidemia, alone or in combination with a statin, and are the only LDL-C lowering non-statin drugs indicated for primary prevention patients. “We are pleased to receive approval for our highly anticipated label expansions in the U.S., which will enable more than 70 million patients to now be eligible for NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET,” said Sheldon Koenig, President and CEO. “Importantly, these approvals expand the accessibility of our highly effective drugs to primary prevention patients, or to those who are at high risk of having a cardiovascular event, but who have not yet had one. These approvals also eliminate the statin use requirement, allowing patients to take NEXLETOL or NEXLIZET either with or without a statin, which significantly reduces previously existing prescribing limitations. We are confident these approvals position NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET as the non-statins of first choice within the cardiovascular risk reduction treatment paradigm.” “We are thrilled with these significantly expanded labels and look forward to being able to now reach millions more patients with our life-saving drugs. In anticipation of these approvals, we have significantly ramped up our sales force, developed a powerful suite of new promotional materials, created a bold new consumer campaign, enhanced our patient support programs, and continued working with payers to ensure improved patient access.” “NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET are once-daily, accessible, oral medications that reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular risk, but without the side effects most common to statins. NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET are also the first oral non-statin LDL-C lowering drugs to be approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of CV events in both primary and secondary prevention patients. We believe this significantly differentiated profile is a game changer for patients and healthcare providers alike and that we expect sales to meaningfully inflect as a result. I want to thank the entire Esperion team for its unwavering commitment to patients and to getting us to this stage. I have the utmost confidence in our future success.” The Company’s pending label expansions in Europe remain on track, with a positive opinion received from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on March 21, 2024. The Company anticipates a final determination by the European Medicines Agency in the second quarter of 2024. The U.S. approvals of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL for cardiovascular risk reduction and LDL-C lowering were based on data generated from the CLEAR Outcomes trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2023, assessing the effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular outcomes in nearly 14,000 patients with, or at high risk, of cardiovascular disease. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.4 years and bempedoic acid (contained in NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET) was generally safe and well tolerated. In the study, LDL-C was reduced by 20%, hsCRP was reduced by 22%, and glucose was not elevated by bempedoic acid compared to placebo. Patients who received bempedoic acid in the trial experienced a relative risk reduction of: 15% for MACE-3 (death from a cardiovascular cause, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial infarction)27% for nonfatal myocardial infarction19% for coronary revascularization39% for MACE-3 in primary prevention patients Conference Call and Webcast InformationEsperion will host a conference call and webcast on Monday, March 25 at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss these FDA approvals and its new and expanded indications for NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET. Please click here to participate in the conference call. The live webcast can also be accessed on the Investors and Media section of the Esperion website. Access to the webcast replay will be available approximately two hours after completion of the call and will be archived on the Company’s website for approximately 90 days. INDICATION NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL are indicated: The bempedoic acid component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization in adults who are unable to take recommended statin therapy (including those not taking a statin) with: established cardiovascular disease (CVD), orat high risk for a CVD event but without established CVD. As an adjunct to diet: NEXLIZET, alone or in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH.NEXLETOL, in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, or alone when concomitant LDL-C lowering therapy is not possible, to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe or any of the excipients. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported. Hyperuricemia: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, may increase blood uric acid levels, which may lead to gout. Hyperuricemia may occur early in treatment and persist throughout treatment, returning to baseline following discontinuation of treatment. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. Tendon Rupture: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, is associated with an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. Tendon rupture may occur more frequently in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, in patients with renal failure, and in patients with previous tendon disorders. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL at the first sign of tendon rupture. Consider alternative therapy in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture. The most common adverse reactions in the primary hyperlipidemia trials of bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, in ≥2% of patients and greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with ezetimibe (a component of NEXLIZET) and at an incidence greater than placebo in clinical trials were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis, pain in extremity, fatigue, and influenza. In the primary hyperlipidemia trials of NEXLIZET, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and greater than placebo) observed with NEXLIZET, but not observed in clinical trials of bempedoic acid or ezetimibe, were urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and constipation. The most common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial for bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, at an incidence of ≥2% and 0.5% greater than placebo were hyperuricemia, renal impairment, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, muscle spasms, gout, and cholelithiasis. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL when pregnancy is recognized unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breast-fed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL. Report pregnancies to Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. Adverse Event reporting line at 1-833-377-7633. Please see full Prescribing Information for NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL.

This marks AbbVie's first solid tumor treatment post ImmunoGen acquisition. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The approval of ELAHERE marks a significant advancement in the oncology field, particularly for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The ability of ELAHERE to reduce the risk of cancer progression by 35% and improve overall survival is not just a statistical victory but a real-world benefit for patients who have limited treatment options. This development could potentially redefine the standard of care for this patient group, shifting the treatment paradigm away from traditional platinum-based chemotherapies that often result in resistance.From a clinical perspective, the fact that ELAHERE is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is noteworthy. ADCs are a class of therapeutics that combine the specificity of antibodies, which can target cancer cells expressing certain proteins, with potent cytotoxic drugs. The targeted approach of ELAHERE, focusing on folate receptor alpha (FRα)-positive tumors, exemplifies the move towards personalized medicine in oncology. This specificity not only enhances the efficacy of the treatment but also minimizes the impact on healthy cells, potentially reducing side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy. Medical Research Analyst AbbVie's acquisition of ImmunoGen, the developer of ELAHERE, appears to have been a strategic move that is now bearing fruit with this FDA approval. The transition from accelerated to full approval underscores the robustness of the MIRASOL Phase 3 trial data. For investors and stakeholders, this could signal a strengthening of AbbVie's oncology portfolio and potentially bolster the company's revenue stream in the competitive cancer therapeutics market.It's important to analyze the market potential of ELAHERE, considering the prevalence of FRα-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and the current lack of effective treatments. If ELAHERE is adopted widely, it could capture a significant market share. However, it's also important to monitor post-marketing safety and efficacy data, as these could impact the drug's market performance and AbbVie's financials in the long term. Market Research Analyst The approval of ELAHERE could influence AbbVie's stock market performance, as the company expands its presence in the solid tumor treatment market. The specific focus on a niche but critical area of unmet medical need—FRα-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer—allows AbbVie to target a segment that could be less sensitive to broader market dynamics and competition. This approval may also serve as a bellwether for AbbVie's future success in solid tumor treatments, potentially impacting investor confidence and the company's valuation.Furthermore, the approval could have a ripple effect on the biotechnology sector, particularly for companies developing ADCs or targeting similar pathways. Competitors may need to reassess their strategies and we might see an increase in research and partnership activities focused on ADCs and personalized therapies. Investors should watch for shifts in the competitive landscape and consider the implications for market dynamics and stock valuations in the sector. 03/22/2024 - 03:02 PM - The full approval of ELAHERE is based on the confirmatory MIRASOL Phase 3 trial that supports the medicine as a potential new standard of care for folate receptor alpha (FRα)-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) - Data show that ELAHERE treatment resulted in an overall survival benefit and reduced the risk of cancer progression by 35% - ELAHERE represents AbbVie's first approved solid tumor treatment following the recent acquisition of ImmunoGen NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval for ELAHERE® (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) for the treatment of folate receptor alpha (FRα)-positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal adult cancer patients treated with up to three prior therapies. Patients with these cancers often present with late-stage disease, undergo surgery and are then treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. They may become resistant to this treatment and require another therapy, such as ELAHERE. ""The full FDA approval of ELAHERE for eligible patients with ovarian cancer represents the culmination of years of work by the ImmunoGen team. ELAHERE is the first and only antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approved in the U.S. for this difficult-to-treat malignancy,"" said Roopal Thakkar, M.D., senior vice president, chief medical officer, global therapeutics, AbbVie. ELAHERE was first granted FDA accelerated approval in November 2022 and the conversion to full approval is based on data from the confirmatory Phase 3 MIRASOL trial. This trial compared ELAHERE to investigator's choice (IC) of chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) whose tumors express high levels of FRα and who have been treated with up to three prior therapies. The primary endpoint of MIRASOL was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment and key secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). ""As the first treatment to show a statistically significant overall survival benefit in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, ELAHERE provides an effective new option for patients with folate receptor alpha positive tumors. These patients previously had very limited options and ELAHERE changes that,"" said Kathleen Moore, deputy director and associate director of clinical research at the Stephenson Cancer Center of The University of Oklahoma and MIRASOL principal investigator. ABOUT THE PHASE 3 MIRASOL TRIALMIRASOL is a randomized Phase 3 trial of ELAHERE versus investigator's choice (IC) of single-agent chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan). Eligibility criteria include patients with PROC whose tumors express high levels of FRα, using the Ventana FOLR1 Assay, and who have been treated with up to three prior regimens. The primary endpoint of this trial is progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). The trial enrolled 453 patients. Patients were stratified by number of prior lines of therapy (14% had one prior line of therapy, 39% had two prior lines of therapy, and 47% had three prior lines of therapy) and by IC chemotherapy, with paclitaxel as the most commonly chosen (41%), followed by PLD (36%) and topotecan (23%). 62% of patients received prior bevacizumab; 55% received a prior PARP inhibitor. Based on current results: OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50, 0.88; p=0.0046), representing a 33% reduction in risk of death in the ELAHERE arm compared to the IC chemotherapy arm.PFS HR was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81; p<0.0001), representing a 35% reduction in the risk of tumor or cancer progression in the ELAHERE arm compared to IC chemotherapy.ELAHERE showed overall fewer Grade 3+ adverse events and a lower rate of discontinuations due to adverse events when compared to the IC chemotherapy control group.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including lab abnormalities, were increased aspartate aminotransferase, fatigue, increased alanine aminotransferase, blurred vision, nausea, increased alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, abdominal pain, keratopathy, peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain, decreased lymphocytes, decreased platelets, decreased magnesium, decreased hemoglobin, dry eye, constipation, decreased leukocytes, vomiting, decreased albumin, decreased appetite, and decreased neutrophils. ABOUT OVARIAN CANCEROvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers in the United States. Each year, approximately 20,000 patients are diagnosed. Most patients present with late-stage disease and will typically undergo surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients eventually develop platinum-resistant disease, which is difficult to treat. In this setting, standard of care single-agent chemotherapies are associated with low response rates, short durations of response, and significant toxicities. ABOUT ELAHEREELAHERE (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) is a first-in-class ADC comprising a folate receptor alpha-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the maytansinoid payload DM4, a potent tubulin inhibitor designed to kill the targeted cancer cells. Patients requiring access support may call 1-833-ELAHERE or visit www.elahere.com. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ELAHERE in Europe has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Regulatory submissions for ELAHERE are also under review in multiple other countries. INDICATIONELAHERE is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with folate receptor-alpha (FRα) positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved test. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: OCULAR TOXICITY ELAHERE can cause severe ocular toxicities, including visual impairment, keratopathy, dry eye, photophobia, eye pain, and uveitis.Conduct an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to initiation of ELAHERE, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated.Administer prophylactic artificial tears and ophthalmic topical steroids.Withhold ELAHERE for ocular toxicities until improvement and resume at the same or reduced dose.Discontinue ELAHERE for Grade 4 ocular toxicities.WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONSOcular Disorders ELAHERE can cause severe ocular adverse reactions, including visual impairment, keratopathy (corneal disorders), dry eye, photophobia, eye pain, and uveitis. Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE. Eleven percent (11%) of patients experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, including blurred vision, keratopathy (corneal disorders), dry eye, cataract, photophobia, and eye pain; two patients (0.3%) experienced Grade 4 events (keratopathy and cataract). The most common (≥5%) ocular adverse reactions were blurred vision (48%), keratopathy (36%), dry eye (27%), cataract (16%), photophobia (14%), and eye pain (10%). The median time to onset for first ocular adverse reaction was 5.1 weeks (range: 0.1 to 68.6). Of the patients who experienced ocular events, 53% had complete resolution; 38% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade at last follow up). Ocular adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of ELAHERE in 1% of patients. Premedication and use of lubricating and ophthalmic topical steroid eye drops during treatment with ELAHERE are recommended. Advise patients to avoid use of contact lenses during treatment with ELAHERE unless directed by a healthcare provider. Refer patients to an eye care professional for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to treatment initiation, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Promptly refer patients to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular signs and symptoms. Monitor for ocular toxicity and withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on severity and persistence of ocular adverse reactions. Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ELAHERE. Pneumonitis occurred in 10% of patients treated with ELAHERE, including 1% with Grade 3 events and 1 patient (0.1%) with a Grade 4 event. One patient (0.1%) died due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonitis and lung metastases. One patient (0.1%) died due to respiratory failure of unknown etiology. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of ELAHERE in 3% of patients. Monitor patients for pulmonary signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, which may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded through appropriate investigations. Withhold ELAHERE for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis until symptoms resolve to ≤ Grade 1 and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue ELAHERE in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis. Patients who are asymptomatic may continue dosing of ELAHERE with close monitoring. Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 36% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE across clinical trials; 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions included peripheral neuropathy (20%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%), paraesthesia (6%), neurotoxicity (3%), hypoaesthesia (1%), peripheral motor neuropathy (0.9%), polyneuropathy (0.3%), and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy (0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neuropathy, such as paresthesia, tingling or a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, or dysesthesia. For patients experiencing new or worsening PN, withhold dosage, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on the severity of PN. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ELAHERE can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it contains a genotoxic compound (DM4) and affects actively dividing cells. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ELAHERE and for 7 months after the last dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (≥20 %) adverse reactions, including lab abnormalities, were increased aspartate aminotransferase, fatigue, increased alanine aminotransferase, blurred vision, nausea, increased alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, abdominal pain, keratopathy, peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain, decreased lymphocytes, decreased platelets, decreased magnesium, decreased hemoglobin, dry eye, constipation, decreased leukocytes, vomiting, decreased albumin, decreased appetite, and decreased neutrophils. DRUG INTERACTIONS DM4 is a CYP3A4 substrate. Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions with ELAHERE when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS LactationAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ELAHERE and for 1 month after the last dose.

Independent director Mr. Stan V. Smith, Ph.D. purchased 170,940 shares. The Company's immuno-oncology therapies targeting difficult-to-treat cancers received support from five independent directors, showcasing confidence in the science and clinical pathways. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company's insider, particularly a board member, increases their stake, it often signals a strong vote of confidence in the company's prospects. In the case of MAIA Biotechnology, the purchase of 170,940 shares by Dr. Stan V. Smith represents a significant financial commitment. This act can be interpreted as a positive indicator to investors, suggesting that the director has faith in the company's strategic direction and the potential success of its immuno-oncology therapies.However, it is important to consider the scale of this investment relative to the overall private placement. The transaction involving 2,043,587 shares indicates that Dr. Smith's purchase was a fraction of the total offering. While noteworthy, the impact on the company's financials might be limited. Investors should also scrutinize the terms of the warrants, as these could dilute existing shares if exercised, potentially impacting the stock's value.Lastly, the gross proceeds of approximately $2.9 million from the private placement must be weighed against the company's cash burn rate and the cost of ongoing clinical trials. This funding should be seen in the context of the company's operational runway and its sufficiency in reaching critical milestones in the development of its therapies. Biotech Industry Analyst MAIA's focus on telomere-targeting approaches represents a cutting-edge area in cancer treatment. Telomeres are protective caps on the ends of chromosomes and their maintenance is important for cancer cell survival. Targeting these structures could potentially lead to treatments for hard-to-treat cancers. Dr. Smith's endorsement and repeated financial backing could lend credibility to MAIA's scientific approach and its potential to disrupt the cancer therapy market.However, the biotech industry is highly competitive and fraught with risk, especially in the clinical stage. The success of MAIA's therapies is not guaranteed and the path from clinical trials to market approval is long and uncertain.

CPS Announces $50.0 Million Securitization of Residual Interests,2024-03-22T17:55:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.

The transaction involved a qualified institutional buyer purchasing asset-backed notes secured by an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate owning residual interests in five securitizations.

(CPSS) announced the closing of a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. The transaction involved a qualified institutional buyer purchasing asset-backed notes secured by an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate owning residual interests in five securitizations. Collateral includes amounts from underlying spread accounts and over-collateralization. Monthly payments consist of interest and principal to maintain a minimum collateral ratio, with the offering being private and unregistered. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests by Consumer Portfolio Services signifies a strategic financial maneuver in the asset-backed securities market. This move allows CPS to leverage its existing securitization structures to generate immediate liquidity. The transaction involves an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate, which underscores a partial yet significant transfer of economic interests in the underlying securitizations.From a financial standpoint, the collateral composition, comprising spread account balances and over-collateralization, indicates a risk mitigation strategy. The reliance on over-collateralization as a safety cushion reflects CPS's commitment to ensuring the security of the notes. By tying the principal payments to a minimum collateral ratio, CPS further aligns the interests of the note holders with the performance of the underlying assets.The private nature of the offering, being outside the purview of the Securities Act of 1933, suggests a targeted approach towards sophisticated investors, likely due to the complex nature of the securities involved. This approach can be advantageous for CPS as it may result in more favorable terms compared to public offerings. However, it is also indicative of a higher risk profile that may be associated with such securities, which is typically more acceptable to qualified institutional buyers. Market Research Analyst Consumer Portfolio Services' recent securitization transaction may signal confidence in the performance of its loan portfolios, as residual interests are often retained for their potential upside. The sale of these interests to an institutional buyer could reflect a positive outlook on the credit performance of CPS's underlying assets. Market participants often view such transactions as a barometer for the health of the consumer finance sector, especially in subprime markets where CPS operates.Furthermore, this transaction may have implications for CPS's stock performance. Investors typically interpret securitization deals as a means to improve a company's balance sheet strength and liquidity position. The immediate influx of $50.0 million enhances CPS's financial flexibility, which could be utilized for further lending activities or for other strategic initiatives. In the long term, the impact on the stock will hinge on the company's ability to deploy this capital effectively and the ongoing performance of the securitized assets. 03/22/2024 - 01:55 PM LAS VEGAS, Nevada, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPSS) (“CPS” or the “Company”) today announced the closing of a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In the transaction, a qualified institutional buyer purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in five CPS securitizations issued from January 2022 through January 2023. Collateral for the notes includes 80% of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and 80% of the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the related receivables less the outstanding principal balance of the notes associated with the securitization. On each monthly payment date, the notes will be paid interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. All of such securities having been sold, this announcement of their sale appears as a matter of record only. About Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.

(LGI) announces a monthly distribution of $0.10459 per share, payable on April 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 11, 2024. The Fund also paid a distribution on March 22, 2024. The distribution consists of return of capital. The Fund's 5-year average annual total return is 9.76%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Lazard Global Total Return and Income Fund regarding its monthly distribution of $0.10459 per share represents a routine event for current shareholders. However, the detail that the entire distribution is classified as a return of capital is noteworthy. A return of capital indicates that the fund is not generating enough income or capital gains to cover the distributions and is instead returning part of investors' original investment. This can be an indicator of underperformance relative to the fund's objectives, which typically aim to provide income from dividends or interest and capital gains from investments.From a financial analysis perspective, the fund's average annual total return of 9.76% over a five-year period is solid, but the annualized current distribution rate of 6.87% of NAV as of the end of February suggests that the distributions might be unsustainable if they exceed the fund's income and capital gains. Investors should be cautious as a consistent return of capital could erode the fund's asset base over time, potentially impacting long-term capital appreciation and income generation capabilities. Tax Advisor For shareholders, the classification of the entire distribution as a return of capital has tax implications. Unlike dividends or capital gains, a return of capital is not immediately taxable. Instead, it reduces the shareholder's cost basis in the investment, which can lead to a higher capital gain or a lower capital loss upon the sale of the shares. It's important for investors to understand these tax consequences and adjust their investment strategy accordingly. If the fund continues to distribute returns of capital, shareholders might face larger than expected capital gains taxes in the future when they sell their shares.It is also critical for shareholders to keep accurate records of these distributions for tax-reporting purposes. The discrepancy between accounting principles and federal income tax regulations can lead to confusion, hence the need for clarity and proper documentation. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market context, the fact that Lazard Global Total Return and Income Fund's cumulative distributions are entirely from return of capital could be indicative of broader market conditions. For instance, if the market is experiencing low interest rates, funds that rely on income from fixed-income securities might struggle to generate high yields. Additionally, if the stock market is not performing well, capital gains might also be limited.Investors often view regular distributions as a sign of a fund's health and performance. The fund's ability to maintain its distribution levels despite the challenging conditions could be seen as a positive by investors who prioritize steady cash flow. However, the sustainability of such distributions should be monitored closely, especially if market conditions do not improve. 03/22/2024 - 01:40 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard Global Total Return and Income Fund, Inc. (the ""Fund"") (NYSE:LGI) is confirming today, pursuant to its Managed Distribution Policy, as previously authorized by its Board of Directors, a monthly distribution of $0.10459 per share on the Fund’s outstanding common stock. The distribution is payable on April 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 11, 2024. The ex-dividend date is April 10, 2024. The Fund will pay a previously declared distribution today, March 22, 2024. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid, including today’s distribution, from the following sources: net investment income, net realized capital gains (short-term and long-term), and return of capital. All amounts are expressed per share of common stock and are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the US, which may differ from federal income tax regulations. Current Distribution % of the Current Distribution Total Cumulative Distributions for the Fiscal Year to Date % of the Total Cumulative Distributions for the Fiscal Year to Date Net Income $0.00000 0 % $0.00000 0 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains $0.00000 0 % $0.00000 0 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains $0.00000 0 % $0.00000 0 % Return of Capital $0.10459 100 % $0.31377 100 % Total $0.10459 100 % $0.31377 100 % Average annual total return (in relation to NAV) for the 5-year period ending on February 29, 2024 9.76 % Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of February 29, 2024 6.87 % Cumulative total return (in relation to NAV) for the fiscal year through February 29, 2024 3.09 % Cumulative fiscal year distributions as a percentage of NAV as of February 29, 2024 1.15 % You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution Policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income"". The amounts and sources of distributions reported above are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund provides financial intermediary firms the information necessary to produce the Form 1099-DIV, and then the relevant financial intermediary firm will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The Company is maintaining its Woxna Graphite Mine on a “production-ready” basis to minimize costs and is conducting ongoing research and development to produce higher value specialty products. The Company is also evaluating a potential restart of production at the Woxna Graphite Mine. The Company anticipates that it has sufficient funding to meet anticipated levels of corporate administration and overheads for the ensuing twelve months however, it will need additional capital to provide working capital and recommence operations at the Woxna Graphite Mine, establish a production facility for the Anode Project, to fund future development of the Norra Karr Property or to complete exploration activities in Romania. There is no assurance such additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. In the longer term the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets is dependent upon the Company’s ability to preserve its interest in the underlying mineral property interests, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the achievement of profitable operations and the ability of the Company to obtain financing to support its ongoing exploration programs and mining operations. Outlook We continue to see European policy initiatives increasingly taking shape as industrial policy, hardly seen in the western world since WW2. The object of improving European competitiveness is clear. We have in previous notes followed how this has developed via the general climate agenda, the Critical Raw Materials Act and the Net-Zero Industry Act. Relevant to us is that one of the fundamental starting points is access to raw materials and process technologies of these. Woxna Graphite Mine We maintain our built and permitted Woxna graphite mine and plant on care and maintenance, while monitoring market signals to consider a restart of graphite concentrate production, as the first step to developing a downstream anode business. Despite the looming demand-supply deficit, flake graphite prices have remained weak this past year.[1] Increased capacity in Chinese synthetic graphite production has been an important factor[2]. It is estimated that China accounts for 92% of global anode production[3]. This is important as it leads to constraints and impairs competitiveness for European auto industry. Of course, this offers Sweden a great opportunity as a producer, and Woxna a first mover advantage to help address this. Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earth Project At our Norra Kärr development project, we are working fully focused on our mining lease application. We aim to have this submitted within 12 months from now. As this is done based on the new 2021 design of this project, we are benefitting from authorities and other stakeholders evaluating the merits of the project based on recent plans that substantially reduce the potential for environmental risk. During this year we plan to establish an office near site from which this work and the important initiatives around social license and stakeholder engagement will be carried out. Norra Kärr, as one of the largest HREE deposits globally, and the most advanced one in the EU, has the potential to be a cornerstone supplier to Western magnet producers[4].Additionally, with Sweden recently having joined NATO, we feel the importance of Norra Kärr may become more pronounced also outside the EU. Bihor Sud Nickel-Cobalt Exploration Project Since having obtained permission to enter our underground galleries last year, this project has been advancing rapidly. As we have reported during the past year, we have encountered and assayed high grades of Co-Ni-Au and Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization’s over large distances underground. These results confirm our belief that this is a high prospective exploration project with potential for both scale and high-grade mineralization. We have retained possession of an underground drill, which is being prepared to be put to work in areas from the inside of the G4 and G7 galleries. During spring we plan a surface drill program on 50-100 m deep geophysical anomalies and to explore the depth extent of G7 Co-Ni-mineralization. Additionally, we have entered our next target, Gallery 2, for which we have high expectations. As far as exploration projects go, we feel that this is an exceptional one, and we are hopeful for plenty of news flow during the coming quarters. ______________________________________________ [1]https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/why-battery-material-prices-slumped-under-pressure-in-the-first-half-of 2023?mc_cid=1c25ba3e5d&mc_eid=33b1527344[2]https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/natural-graphite-market-dominated-by-oversupply-2023-in-review?mc_cid=2a16054797&mc_eid=33b1527344[3]https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/in-charts-why-decoupling-from-chinas-anode-market-could-be-difficult-for-the-west?mc_cid=b3fbca6cc2&mc_eid=33b1527344[4] https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-production-outside-asia-gearing-up-2024-preview/ Financial Information The report for three months ending April 30, 2024, is expected to be published on or about June 21, 2024.

Announces Reverse Stock Split to be Effective March 27, 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRM) announces a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its common shares to meet the minimum bid price requirement for Nasdaq listing. Shareholders approved the split, reducing outstanding shares from 96.6 million to 9.66 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Castor Maritime Inc. to implement a 1-for-10 reverse stock split is a strategic financial move aimed at consolidating shares and potentially boosting the share price above Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. This action usually indicates that a company's stock has been trading at lower levels and the management is taking steps to remain compliant with exchange listing requirements. In the short term, such a move can lead to increased investor confidence if it successfully elevates the stock price to meet Nasdaq's standards.However, there are long-term implications to consider. Reverse stock splits do not inherently change the company's market capitalization or its underlying value. Investors should be cautious, as the perceived increase in share price may not be supported by fundamental improvements in the company's financial health or operational performance. It's also essential to monitor the liquidity of the stock post-split, as a reduced number of shares may impact trading volumes. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Castor Maritime's reverse stock split reflects broader industry trends where shipping companies are facing volatile markets and may need to optimize their financial structures. The shipping industry is highly cyclical and influenced by global economic conditions, trade flows and commodity prices. Investors often view reverse splits with skepticism, as they can be seen as a cosmetic fix rather than a solution to fundamental business challenges.It's important to analyze the company's operational efficiency, debt levels and future growth prospects. Castor Maritime's ability to navigate the complex shipping market post-split will be a key determinant of its long-term success. Additionally, the impact on shareholder value must be assessed, considering that while the percentage ownership remains unchanged, the market's reaction to such corporate actions can vary significantly. Legal Expert Legally, a reverse stock split is a permissible corporate action when authorized by shareholders, as in the case of Castor Maritime. The company has followed due process by seeking shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting and has complied with the necessary legal formalities, including the issuance of a new CUSIP number post-split. Shareholders should be aware of their rights in such scenarios, particularly concerning the handling of fractional shares which will be compensated with cash payments.This legal maneuver does not alter shareholders' voting rights but does require clear communication and transparency to ensure shareholders are fully informed of the implications. Additionally, the company must continue to adhere to regulatory requirements post-split to maintain its listing, which includes meeting the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. 03/22/2024 - 04:05 PM LIMASSOL, Cyprus, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRM), (“Castor”, or the “Company”), a diversified global shipping company, announces that its board of directors (the “Board”) has determined to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares. The Company’s shareholders approved the reverse stock split by a ratio of not less than 1-for-two and not more than 1-for-100 and granted the Board the authority to determine the exact split ratio and when to proceed with the reverse stock split at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on September 1, 2023. The reverse stock split will take effect, and the Company’s common shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis under their existing symbol “CTRM” on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) as of the opening of trading on March 27, 2024. The CUSIP number of Y1146L 208 will be assigned to the Company’s common shares when the reverse stock split becomes effective. When the reverse stock split becomes effective, every 10 of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares will be combined into one issued and outstanding common share, without any change to the par value of $0.001 per share or any shareholder’s ownership percentage of the Company’s common shares, subject to the effects of any rounding. This will reduce the number of outstanding common shares from approximately 96.6 million shares to approximately 9.66 million shares. Immediately following the effective time of the reverse stock split, the Company’s common shares will have the same voting rights and will be identical in all other respects to the common shares prior to effectiveness of the reverse stock split. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Shareholders who would otherwise receive a fraction of a common share of the Company will receive a cash payment in lieu thereof. The reverse stock split is undertaken with the objective of meeting the minimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement for maintaining the listing of the Company’s common shares on Nasdaq. Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s current report on Form 6-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31, 2023, a copy of which is available at www.sec.gov.

Veru Reschedules Annual Meeting of Shareholders,2024-03-22T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Veru Inc. reschedules its 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to allow time for reviewing restated financial statements.

Research and development expenses were overestimated, leading to an extended cash runway for the company.","Veru Reschedules Annual Meeting of Shareholders Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Veru Inc. reschedules its 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to allow time for reviewing restated financial statements. The company is in the process of restating historical financial statements, with expected filings by April 15, 2024. Research and development expenses were overestimated, leading to an extended cash runway for the company. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure by Veru Inc. regarding the restatement of historical financial statements is a matter that merits attention from a financial perspective. The restatement process suggests discrepancies between previously reported and actual research and development (R&D) expenses, impacting the company's cash flow projections. This could lead to a reassessment of the company's financial health and operational efficiency.Investors often scrutinize the accuracy of financial statements as they reflect the company's ability to manage its resources. In this case, the overestimation of R&D expenses indicates a potential lapse in financial control and raises questions about the reliability of internal reporting mechanisms. The adjustment implies that the company will have a longer cash runway than initially reported, which might be perceived positively as it suggests a reduced immediate need for additional financing. However, the necessity for a restatement could also negatively affect investor confidence, potentially impacting the stock's valuation. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Veru Inc.'s announcement can influence investor sentiment and market perception of the company's governance practices. Restatements can lead to volatility in the stock market as they are often unexpected and can indicate deeper issues within a company's operations or financial reporting. The delay in the Annual Meeting of Shareholders allows for a comprehensive review of the restated financials, which is important for maintaining transparency and trust with investors.This news is particularly relevant to stakeholders and potential investors who are evaluating the company's long-term growth potential and its ability to manage R&D investments effectively. Companies in the biopharmaceutical sector are heavily reliant on R&D for their pipeline development and future revenue streams. Therefore, accurate accounting in this area is essential for projecting future performance and making informed investment decisions. Corporate Governance Expert Corporate governance comes into sharp focus when a company announces a restatement of its financials. The disclosure by Veru Inc. may prompt a review of the company's internal controls and the effectiveness of its governance framework. Stakeholders will be interested in understanding the root causes of the overestimation of expenses and the steps the company is taking to prevent similar issues in the future.For a biopharmaceutical company, maintaining rigorous financial controls is essential, especially when dealing with complex R&D accounting which involves estimates and judgments. The company's response to this issue, including the transparency of its communication and the corrective actions implemented, will be closely monitored. These factors are integral to restoring confidence among investors, regulators and partners. 03/22/2024 - 04:05 PM --Restated historical financial statements expected to be filed no later than April 15, 2024-- --2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to follow financial statements filings-- MIAMI, FL, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veru Inc. (NASDAQ: VERU), a late clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines for preserving muscle for high quality weight loss, oncology, and viral induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, today announced that it is rescheduling its 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders originally scheduled to be held on March 26, 2024. As previously disclosed, the Company is in the process of restating its historical financial statements which are expected to be finalized and filed no later than April 15, 2024. The Company’s estimated research and development expenses recorded were higher than the actual expenses that were incurred and the Company’s cash on hand is expected to last longer than initially stated. The Annual Meeting is being rescheduled to allow shareholders ample time to review the restated financial statements. The Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 15, 2024, disclosed the need for the restatement due to overestimating certain research and development expenses associated with the Company’s projects with third-party service providers and the accounting for these expenses. The Company records estimated expenses of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers based on factors such as estimates of the work completed as provided to the Company by confirmations by such third-party service providers and provisions within agreements with such third-party service providers such as scope of work, payment, timeline and similar provisions. The Company’s estimated research and development expenses recorded were higher than the actual expenses that were incurred. The net result of research and development estimated expenses being recorded at too high of an amount is that the Company’s cash on hand is expected to last longer than initially stated. Once the Company has completed and filed the restated financial statements, the Company will notify shareholders of the new date and time for its Annual Meeting. About Veru Inc.Veru is a late clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines for the treatment of metabolic diseases, oncology, and ARDS. The Company’s drug development program includes two late-stage novel small molecules, enobosarm and sabizabulin. Enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), is being developed for two indications: (i) Phase 2b clinical study of enobosarm as a treatment to augment fat loss and to prevent muscle loss in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly patients receiving a GLP-1 RA who are at-risk for developing muscle atrophy and muscle weakness and (ii) subject to the availability of sufficient funding, Phase 3 ENABLAR-2 clinical trial of enobosarm for the treatment of androgen receptor positive (AR+), estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer in the 2nd line setting. Sabizabulin, a microtubule disruptor, is being developed as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of hospitalized patients with viral-induced ARDS. The Company does not intend to undertake further development of sabizabulin for the treatment of viral-induced ARDS until we obtain funding from government grants, pharmaceutical company partnerships, or other similar third-party external sources. The Company also has an FDA-approved commercial product, the FC2 Female Condom® (Internal Condom), for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. About Enobosarm Enobosarm (aka ostarine, MK-2866, GTx-024, and VERU-024), a novel daily oral selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), has been previously studied in 5 clinical studies involving 968 older normal men and postmenopausal women as well as older patients who have muscle wasting because of advanced cancer. Advanced cancer simulates a “starvation state” where there is significant unintentional loss of both muscle and fat mass like that seen with GLP-1 RA treatment. The totality of the clinical data from these five clinical trials demonstrates that enobosarm treatment leads to preservation of muscle mass with improvements in physical function as well as significant reductions in fat mass. Enobosarm has a large safety database, which includes 27 clinical trials involving 1581 men and women dosed with duration of treatment in some patients for up to 3 years. In this large safety database, enobosarm was generally well tolerated with no increase in gastrointestinal side effects. This is important as there are already significant and frequent gastrointestinal side effects with a GLP-1 RA treatment alone. The efficacy and safety clinical data that were generated from five enobosarm clinical trials in both elderly patients and in patients with a cancer induced starvation-like state provide strong clinical rationale for enobosarm. The expectation is that enobosarm in combination with a GLP-1 RA would potentially augment the fat reduction with higher quality total weight loss while preserving muscle and physical function. Planned Phase 2b enobosarm clinical trial design for potentially high quality weight loss The Phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-finding clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enobosarm 3mg, enobosarm 6mg, or placebo as a treatment to preserve muscle and augment fat loss in 90 sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly (>60 years of age) patients receiving a GLP-1 RA who are at-risk for developing muscle atrophy and muscle weakness. The primary endpoint is lean body mass (muscle), and the key secondary endpoints are total body fat mass and physical function at 16 weeks. The IND has received FDA clearance, and the clinical study is expected to begin in April 2024 with the topline clinical results from the trial expected calendar year-end 2024. After completing the efficacy dose-finding portion of the Phase 2b clinical trial, participants will then continue into a Phase 2b extension clinical trial where all patients will stop receiving a GLP-1 RA, but will continue taking placebo, enobosarm 3mg, or enobosarm 6mg for an additional 12 weeks. The Phase 2b extension clinical trial will evaluate whether enobosarm can maintain muscle and prevent the fat and weight rebound that occurs after stopping a GLP-1 RA drug. The topline results of the separate Phase 2b extension clinical study is expected in calendar Q2 2025. Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, express or implied statements related to whether and when the planned phase 2b trial of enobosarm discussed above will commence or produce topline data or patients will progress into the extension study, the planned design, timing, endpoints, patient population and patient size of such trial and whether such trial will successfully meet any of its endpoints, whether enobosarm will enhance weight loss or preserve muscle in, or meet any unmet need for, obesity patients and whether it will enhance weight loss, whether the Company will be successful in its transformation into a late stage biopharmaceutical company focused on obesity and oncology, the expected timing of the Company’s completion and filing of restated financial statements and the net effect of such restatement on the Company’s historical financial statements and the timing for the determination of a new date and time for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

EF Hutton was the sole book running manager, and Celine & Partners, P.L.L.C. and Robinson & Cole LLP provided legal counsel. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Black Hawk Acquisition Corporation's initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company, injecting capital that could be used to finance its strategic plans. The structure of the units, including one share of common stock and a fraction of a right to receive another share, is particularly noteworthy. This structure suggests a mechanism to potentially reward early investors upon a successful business combination. It's essential to consider how this setup might influence the stock's liquidity and volatility, as the separation of units into individual securities could lead to differentiated investment strategies.Additionally, the role of EF Hutton as the sole book running manager indicates a level of confidence in the underwriter's ability to manage the offering successfully. The involvement of established legal counsel also adds a layer of credibility to the process. Investors should monitor the performance of BKHAU closely, as it could provide insights into market appetite for new listings and the company's perceived potential. The effectiveness of the registration statement by the SEC adds a regulatory seal of approval, which is important for investor confidence. Market Research Analyst Entering the NASDAQ under the ticker 'BKHAU' positions Black Hawk Acquisition Corporation in a competitive landscape where visibility and investor sentiment play critical roles. The timing and success of this IPO could be indicative of broader market trends, especially in the context of investor confidence in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). It's important to analyze the market's reception of BKHAU to gauge whether investors are bullish or cautious about such investment vehicles in the current economic climate.From a market research perspective, the performance of BKHAU could serve as a bellwether for other companies considering going public through a SPAC. Tracking the post-IPO trading behavior will provide valuable data on investor behavior and the effectiveness of the company's go-to-market strategy. The decision to list common stock and rights separately in the future could also affect the trading dynamics, potentially increasing the stock's visibility and attractiveness to different investor segments. Legal Expert The legal aspects surrounding this IPO, including the involvement of reputable law firms such as Celine & Partners and Robinson & Cole, underscore the importance of compliance and due diligence in the process.

The company implemented expense-reduction measures to extend cash runway. Financial results show a decrease in net loss for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Seclidemstat shows promising results in treating Ewing sarcoma. Positive Resumption of patient enrollment in a clinical trial for Seclidemstat in combination with Azacitidine for hematologic cancers. Implementation of expense-reduction measures to extend cash runway. Significant decrease in net loss for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Positive results from Seclidemstat in treating Ewing sarcoma. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Salarius Pharmaceuticals, as reported, shows a significant reduction in net loss from $31.6 million in 2022 to $12.5 million in 2023. This reduction can be attributed to both a one-time non-cash expense in the previous year and aggressive cost-saving measures. The company's decision to resume patient enrollment in a clinical trial and the continuation of its Ewing sarcoma study are strategic steps that could potentially yield positive data, enhancing the company's value proposition to investors.However, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $12.1 million to $5.9 million raises concerns about the company's liquidity and long-term financial stability. While the current cash is expected to fund operations into the first half of 2025, investors should consider the burn rate and the potential need for additional funding, which could lead to dilution of shares or increased debt. Medical Research Analyst The resumption of patient enrollment in the hematologic cancer trial and the ongoing Ewing sarcoma study are critical for Salarius Pharmaceuticals' pipeline development. The preliminary results showing a 50% objective response rate in a subset of patients and an extended overall survival rate are promising. However, these are interim results and should be interpreted cautiously until more comprehensive data is available.Seclidemstat's fast track, orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations by the FDA for Ewing sarcoma suggest regulatory confidence in the drug's potential, which could expedite the development process. Nevertheless, the true impact on the company's valuation will depend on the outcomes of the ongoing trials and the ability to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively. Market Research Analyst Salarius Pharmaceuticals' strategic focus on protein inhibition and degradation to develop cancer therapies places it within a highly competitive and innovative segment of the biopharmaceutical market. The company's targeted approach in treating hematologic cancers and Ewing sarcoma, which have unmet medical needs, could position it favorably if the clinical outcomes are positive.Investors should monitor the competitive landscape and the progress of similar drugs in development by other companies. Market dynamics, such as the potential market size for seclidemstat and SP-3164, payer willingness to cover these treatments and the global demand for novel cancer therapies, will ultimately influence the company's market potential and stock performance. 03/22/2024 - 04:05 PM Patient Enrollment Resumed in the Investigator-initiated Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Seclidemstat in Combination with Azacitidine to Treat Hematologic Cancers Company Implemented Significant Expense-reduction Measures to Extend Cash Runway HOUSTON, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using protein inhibition and protein degradation to develop cancer therapies for patients in need of new treatment options, today reported financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. Financial Highlights Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.9 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $6.4 million, or $2.83 per share, reflecting lower operating expenses resulting from the cost-savings plan implemented in the third quarter of 2023.Net loss for 2023 was $12.5 million, or $3.84 per share, compared with a net loss for 2022 of $31.6 million, or $14.88 per share. The 2022 net loss included a one-time non-cash expense of $8.9 million, or $4.17 per share, due to a loss on impairment of goodwill.Cash and cash equivalents were $5.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with $12.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The company collected all its remaining CPRIT payments during 2023. In August 2023 Salarius announced a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. While these efforts are ongoing, the Company continues to support its clinical programs, as appropriate, and the cost-savings measures approved by the Board of Directors are designed to enable the Company to continue supporting such activities. These measures included a reduction in certain executive, clinical and research and development staff, and the opportunistic engagement of consultants, among other activities. “During the second half of 2023 and the first months of 2024, Salarius reduced operating expenses, allowing us to extend our cash runway to generate additional clinical data in the seclidemstat hematologic and Ewing sarcoma clinical trials. We believe these data, if positive, will further enhance our opportunities to maximize shareholder value,” said William McVicar, Ph.D., Chairman of the Salarius Pharmaceuticals Board of Directors. “As previously announced, the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) investigator-initiated hematologic cancer trial is active and enrolling patients, and we look forward to clinical trial updates later this year. The Company’s Ewing sarcoma Phase 1/2 study is not currently enrolling patients, but previously enrolled patients continue to be followed.” Fourth Quarter Financial ResultsNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.9 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $6.4 million, or $2.83 per share. The decrease was due to the cost-savings plan implemented in the third quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses were $0.06 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the above-mentioned cost-savings plan. Net cash used for operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 million, compared with $4.7 million during the same quarter in 2022, reflecting the above-mentioned cost-savings plan. Full Year Financial ResultsNet loss for 2023 was $12.5 million, or $3.84 per share, compared with a net loss for 2022 of $31.6 million, or $14.88 per share. This reduction of approximately $19.1 million resulted from an $8.9 million one-time non-cash expense for impairment of goodwill in 2022, significantly lower research and development expenses and lower general and administrative expenses in 2023 resulting from the Company’s idled clinical trial in late 2022, and cost-cutting measures that began in the third quarter of 2023. Costs resulting from the acquisition and development of SP-3164 in 2022 did not repeat in 2023. Research and development expenses were $7.2 million for 2023, compared with $15.8 million for 2022. The decrease was principally due to the company’s lower spending on SP-2577, which went on clinical hold during the fourth quarter of 2022 and remained idle through 2023, cost cutting measures undertaken beginning in the third quarter of 2023 and SP-3164 acquisition costs in 2022 that did not repeat in 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for 2023 was $12.8 million, compared with $17.6 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall operating loss in the current year. As of December 31, 2023, Salarius had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $5.9 million, compared with $12.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Current cash and cash equivalents are expected to fund the company’s planned operations into the first half of 2025. Targeted Protein Inhibitor (Seclidemstat) HighlightsSeclidemstat (SP-2577) is a novel oral reversible inhibitor of the LSD1 enzyme that is being studied as a treatment for hematologic cancers in an investigator-initiated clinical trial at MDACC and in a Company-sponsored trial as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma. In December 2022, researchers at MDACC reported interim clinical trial results evaluating seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients who relapsed or progressed after hypomethylating agent therapy. Of eight evaluable patients, four (50%) had an objective response. These researchers reported a 90% probability of survival for 11 months in patients receiving seclidemstat plus azacitidine. Typically, overall survival is four to six months after failing therapy with hypomethylating agents. The hematologic cancer Phase 1/2 clinical trial being conducted at MDACC is now listed as active and recruiting on clinical trials.gov – trial NCT04734990. Seclidemstat has received fast track, orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Ewing sarcoma and has been studied in a Company-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial evaluating its use in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide (TC) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma. To date, 13 relapsed Ewing sarcoma patients, including five patients with first relapse and eight patients with second relapse, have been enrolled at 600 mg or 900 mg of seclidemstat dosed twice daily in combination with TC. The five first-relapse patients demonstrated a 60% objective response rate (ORR) and a 60% disease control rate (DCR), including one complete response and two partial responses. Among the three patients achieving objective responses, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) has not been reached with these patients still alive with disease control and objective responses at 17.4, 25.7 and 27.2 months, and increasing, after starting seclidemstat + TC combination therapy.The eight second-relapse patients demonstrated a 13% ORR, a 25% DCR and a mPFS of 1.6 months (range: 0.0 months to 10.7 months).Together, the 13 first- and second-relapse patients demonstrated a mPFS of 8.1 months (range: 2.0 months to 27.2 months). Five patients, or 38%, achieved confirmed disease control and progression has not been observed in any of these patients while on study. Salarius has completed the FDA Type B End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting process for the seclidemstat Ewing sarcoma development program and has amended the current clinical trial protocol to reflect guidance agreed to with FDA. There is currently one patient enrolled in the Ewing sarcoma clinical trial who recently achieved a partial response, defined as a 30% or greater reduction in their target lesions, and this patient is continuing treatment with seclidemstat plus TC therapy. The Ewing sarcoma trial is currently active but is not enrolling additional patients. Targeted Protein Degrader (Molecular Glue) HighlightsSP-3164 is an oral, next-generation molecular glue that uses Salarius’ deuterium-enabled chiral switching platform to stabilize the preferred (S)-enantiomer of avadomide, an extensively studied clinical compound that has demonstrated encouraging single-agent and combination-therapy clinical efficacy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and other hematologic malignancies. The addition of deuterium at the chiral center of the molecule prevents conversion to the unwanted (R)-enantiomer, allowing for isolation and development of the preferred (S)-enantiomer into a potential new cancer treatment. In July 2023 the FDA cleared the Company’s investigational new drug (IND) application to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial with SP-3164 in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. That trial has not commenced. About Salarius PharmaceuticalsSalarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for patients with cancer in need of new treatment options. Salarius’ product portfolio includes seclidemstat, its lead candidate, which is being studied as a potential treatment for pediatric cancers, sarcomas and other cancers with limited treatment options, and SP-3164, an oral small molecule protein degrader being developed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The issuance of $550 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2029 and $450 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2032 indicates a proactive approach to capital management. This action is likely to affect the company's leverage and interest expense profile, potentially influencing its credit ratings and stock valuation. Investors should note the interest rates attached to these notes, which are relatively high compared to current U.S. Treasury rates. This suggests that Hilton is compensating investors for taking on additional risk associated with the company's credit profile. The intended use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt, could improve the company's debt maturity profile and liquidity position. However, the impact on the company's financial flexibility and overall cost of capital will depend on the terms of the debt being repaid and the opportunities pursued with the remaining funds. Market Research Analyst Hilton's decision to issue Senior Notes and the chosen interest rates reflect broader market conditions and investor appetite for corporate debt. In the hospitality industry, access to capital is essential for maintaining and expanding operations, especially in a post-pandemic recovery phase. The move to secure long-term financing could be indicative of Hilton's confidence in its business model and future growth prospects. It's important to recognize the competitive landscape in which Hilton operates. The company's ability to secure favorable terms despite the relatively high-interest rates could signal strength and stability to investors. On the other hand, the market's reception of these notes will also provide insight into how investors view the risk associated with the hospitality sector as it recovers from global disruptions. Legal Expert The issuance of Senior Notes by Hilton is structured to comply with securities regulations, specifically leveraging exemptions under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. This approach allows Hilton to target institutional investors and certain non-U.S. persons without the burden of a public registration. The legal intricacies of such offerings are important for ensuring the company's compliance and minimizing legal risk. Investors should be aware that the Notes are not registered under the Securities Act, which means they are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may lack the liquidity of publicly traded securities. The reliance on exemptions also underscores the targeted nature of the offering, aimed at sophisticated investors capable of evaluating the risks associated with the investment. 03/22/2024 - 05:28 PM MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) (“Hilton”) announced today that its indirect subsidiary Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc.

Operating expenses increased, with net loss of $14.8 million for 2023. Positive Stockholders approved merger with Serina Therapeutics, Inc.

This move effectively reduces the company's debt burden, potentially improving its balance sheet and financial ratios. However, the extension of the line of credit repayment date and the additional $4.4 million secured from Juvenescence Limited suggest a continued reliance on external funding, which could raise concerns about the company's liquidity and ongoing funding requirements. The reverse stock split is a strategic step that may be aimed at boosting the stock price to meet exchange listing requirements or to attract institutional investors, though it could also be interpreted as a measure to counteract previous stock price declines.From a broader perspective, the increase in general and administrative expenses, particularly those associated with the planned merger with Serina Therapeutics, indicates strategic positioning but also reflects substantial cash outflows for corporate activities. The decrease in research and development expenses might raise questions about the company's commitment to innovation, which is critical in the biotechnology sector. Investors may view this as a red flag, given that R&D is the lifeblood of biotech companies. The reported net loss has widened compared to the previous year, which could negatively influence investor sentiment and AgeX's stock price in the short term. Biotechnology Market Analyst AgeX's merger with Serina Therapeutics represents a pivotal move within the biotechnology industry, potentially combining resources and expertise to accelerate the development of therapies for human aging and regeneration. Mergers and acquisitions are common in this sector as companies strive to diversify their portfolios and enhance their competitive edge. However, the financial stability of the merged entity will be crucial, given the high costs and long timelines associated with bringing new therapies to market.The reported decrease in R&D spending is somewhat atypical for a growth-phase biotech company. This could suggest a strategic pivot or resource allocation towards integration efforts with Serina Therapeutics. The biotechnology industry is heavily reliant on consistent investment in R&D to drive innovation and pipeline development. Therefore, stakeholders should monitor whether this decrease is a temporary measure or indicative of a longer-term trend, which could impact the company's future growth prospects. Debt Financing Expert The details surrounding AgeX's debt restructuring and additional line of credit highlight the complexities of debt financing in the biotech sector. The conversion of preferred stock to eliminate debt is a tool that can help manage a company's liabilities and potentially strengthen investor confidence by improving equity. However, the automatic conversion of preferred stock into common stock dilutes existing shareholders' equity, which could have a negative impact on share value. Furthermore, the reliance on a single creditor, Juvenescence Limited, for both the extinguishment of debt and the provision of additional credit lines, may introduce financial risk due to the concentration of credit exposure.The extension of the line of credit repayment date suggests that AgeX is not generating sufficient cash flow to meet its original obligations, which is not uncommon in the biotech industry where revenues can be unpredictable and often hinge on successful clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The financial flexibility provided by Juvenescence is essential for AgeX's short-term operations, but it also signals the need for careful monitoring of the company's cash burn rate and the establishment of a clear path to profitability or additional funding sources. 03/22/2024 - 05:27 PM ALAMEDA, Calif., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“AgeX”; NYSE American: AGE), a biotechnology company developing therapeutics for human aging and regeneration, reported its financial and operating results for fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023 and recent highlights. Recent Highlights ●Stockholders approved transactions for merger with Serina Therapeutics, Inc. ●Obtained $4.4 million addition to line of credit from Juvenescence Limited ●Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock ●Completed reverse stock split at a ratio of 1 for 35.17 Liquidity and Capital Resources Issuance of Preferred Stock to Eliminate $36 Million of Indebtedness and Conversion to Common Stock During July 2023, AgeX and Juvenescence Limited entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which AgeX issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock to Juvenescence in exchange for the extinguishment of a total of $36 million of indebtedness under a loan agreement and certain promissory notes. The Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of AgeX common stock on February 1, 2024. Increase in Line of Credit On November 8, 2023, AgeX’s secured, convertible line of credit from Juvenescence Limited was increased by $4,400,000, subject to Juvenescence’s discretion to approve and fund each of AgeX’s future loan draws. On February 9, 2024, the repayment date of AgeX’s borrowings under Juvenescence line of credit was extended from February 14, 2024 to May 9, 2024. Balance Sheet Information Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, AgeX owed Juvenescence Limited $4.5 million in principal and origination fees on account of loans extended to AgeX. Fourth Quarter and Annual 2023 Operating Results Operating expenses: Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $3.6 million as compared with $1.8 million for the same period of 2022. Operating expenses for the full year 2023 were $10.1 million as compared with $7.0 million in the same period of 2022. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by more than $0.3 million to $0.7 million from approximately $1.0 million in 2022. The net decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of $0.2 million in outside research and services allocable to research and development expenses and $0.1 million in salaries and payroll related expenses allocated to research and development expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $3.3 million to $9.3 million from approximately $6.0 million in 2022. The net increase is attributable to increases of $2.5 million in professional fees for legal services, professional fees for tax and accounting services, and consulting expenses incurred in connection with due diligence and other expenses related to the planned merger with Serina Therapeutics, Inc (“Serina”), $0.4 million for the write off of prepaid expenses incurred in prior periods related to a shelf registration statement for an at-the-market offering of AgeX common stock that expired in January 2024, $0.4 million estimated litigation fees, $0.2 million in salaries, consulting fees, and payroll related expenses, including severance related expenses arising under a Transition Services and Separation Agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer, $0.1 million in investor relations related expenses, and $0.1 million in insurance expense, allocated to general and administrative expenses. These increases were offset to some extent by a $0.2 million decrease in minimum royalty fees resulting from the termination of certain license and sub-license agreements, $0.1 million net decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation to employees, consultants and directors, and a $0.1 million decrease in patent and license maintenance related fees. Other expense, net: Net other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 consists primarily of $5.4 million of amortization of deferred debt costs on loans from Juvenescence, write off of deferred debt cost upon $36 million debt exchanged for preferred stock in July 2023, and other debt related expenses included in interest expense, offset by $0.5 million net interest income primarily earned from a promissory note from Serina. Other expense, net in 2022 consists primarily of $3.3 million of amortization of deferred debt issuance costs on loans from Juvenescence to interest expense, and $0.2 million change in fair value of warrants issued to Juvenescence in connection with borrowings under the 2022 Secured Note. Net loss attributable to AgeX: The net loss attributable to AgeX for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $14.8 million, or ($13.73) per share (basic and diluted), compared to $10.5 million, or ($9.70) per share (basic and diluted), for 2022. Going Concern Considerations As required under Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (ASC 205-40), AgeX evaluates whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date its financial statements are issued. Based on AgeX’s most recent projected cash flows, AgeX believes that its cash and cash equivalents and available sources of debt and equity capital would not be sufficient to satisfy AgeX’s anticipated operating and other funding requirements for the twelve months following the filing of AgeX’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the ability of AgeX to continue as a going concern. About AgeX Therapeutics AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: AGE) is focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to treat human diseases to increase healthspan and combat the effects of aging.

NLS Pharmaceutics Announces Closing of $1.75 Million Registered Direct Offering,2024-03-22T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NLS Pharmaceutics  announced the closing of a registered direct offering of 7,000,000 common shares at $0.25 per share, raising $1.75 million.

The proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.","NLS Pharmaceutics Announces Closing of $1.75 Million Registered Direct Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary NLS Pharmaceutics announced the closing of a registered direct offering of 7,000,000 common shares at $0.25 per share, raising $1.75 million. The company also issued unregistered warrants for 3,500,000 common shares at the same price. The proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd.'s registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of warrants represents a significant capital infusion for the company. With a total gross proceed of $1.75 million, this capital raise, albeit modest in size, is a pivotal step for NLS in bolstering its working capital and supporting general corporate functions. However, the offering price of $0.25 per share suggests a potential dilution effect for existing shareholders. Stakeholders should monitor the utilization of these funds, as efficient deployment could enhance the company's research capabilities and accelerate the development of therapies for central nervous system disorders.It's important to note that the warrants are immediately exercisable at the same price as the direct offering, which could lead to further dilution if exercised. Investors should consider the five-year expiration on these warrants, as it provides a lengthy window for potential conversion, affecting the stock's performance over time. The role of H.C. Wainwright & Co. as the exclusive placement agent also underscores the importance of experienced intermediaries in executing such financial transactions. Biotech Industry Analyst NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd. operates within the high-stakes biopharmaceutical industry, where funding is important for sustaining long-term research and development efforts. The funds raised through this offering are earmarked for working capital and general corporate purposes, which is typical for clinical-stage companies. However, the specificity of the allocation and the impact on the company's pipeline progression are not detailed. For industry observers, the ability of NLS to advance its clinical trials or achieve regulatory milestones with the raised capital will be a key indicator of the offering's success.Furthermore, the reliance on a 'shelf' registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing the company to act swiftly in capitalizing on favorable market conditions. This move could be interpreted as a strategic approach to funding, but it also raises questions about the company's cash runway and the need for continued capital raises in the future. Securities Law Expert The mechanics of the registered direct offering and the private placement of unregistered warrants involve nuanced securities regulations. NLS's adherence to the 'shelf' registration statement for the common shares and the use of Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D for the private placement of warrants demonstrate compliance with the Securities Act of 1933. Potential investors and current shareholders should be aware of the implications of these regulatory frameworks, such as the restrictions on the sale of unregistered securities and the conditions under which they may be legally traded.It is also critical to understand that the warrants, being unregistered, carry certain limitations on their marketability. This can affect their attractiveness to investors who prefer more liquid investment options.

The Company's securities on Nasdaq are not immediately affected, but it must submit a plan to regain compliance within 60 days. Positive None. Negative The delayed filing of the Annual Report led to a delinquency notification from Nasdaq, indicating non-compliance with listing rules. The Company's securities are at risk if compliance is not regained within the specified timeline. The review of transactions with Brian Kahn by the Audit Committee has caused delays in filing the Annual Report. The Company's executives, including Bryant Riley, were affirmed to have no involvement in alleged misconduct related to Brian Kahn and Prophecy Asset Management LP. Financial Analyst B. Riley Financial's delayed annual report filing raises concerns about the company's internal controls and transparency, which are critical for investor confidence. This situation can put pressure on the company's stock price as the market reacts to uncertainty. Investors often view delayed filings as red flags, possibly indicating deeper financial or operational issues. The market may also speculate on the severity of the findings from the audit committee's review of transactions, despite the company's statement of non-involvement in alleged misconduct. It is essential for the company to provide a clear plan and timeline for regaining compliance to mitigate market concerns. Legal Expert Receiving a delinquency notification from Nasdaq is a procedural step, yet it underscores the gravity of adhering to regulatory requirements. The SEC mandates timely disclosures to maintain fair and orderly markets. The company's ability to submit a comprehensive plan to regain compliance will be scrutinized for its adequacy. The role of the audit committee and external counsel in this process is to ensure that all transactions are thoroughly reviewed and any issues are rectified. The outcome of this investigation may have legal implications, depending on the nature of the transactions with Brian Kahn and any potential findings of misconduct. Market Research Analyst The delay in filing the annual report can influence investor perception beyond the immediate stock price impact. It's important to analyze comparable situations in the financial sector to predict potential outcomes. Historical data suggests that companies that swiftly address filing issues and communicate transparently with shareholders tend to recover more quickly from any negative market sentiment. The company's proactive engagement with its auditors and the plan to regain compliance will be key factors in maintaining stakeholder trust and minimizing long-term reputational damage. 03/22/2024 - 04:30 PM LOS ANGELES, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- B.

(TLF) reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with revenues of $76.2 million, operating income of $4.4 million, and net income of $3.8 million. Despite a 5.1% revenue decline from 2022, the company improved gross margins to 59.3% and decreased operating expenses by 9.7% to $40.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA reached $6.5 million, ending the year with $12.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. show a mixed performance for the fiscal year 2023. Despite a decrease in revenues by 5.1%, the company managed to increase its net income significantly from $1.2 million to $3.8 million. This can be attributed to a reduction in operating expenses and an improvement in gross margins. The reduction in operating expenses by 9.7% is a positive sign, indicating effective cost management strategies. The increase in gross margins from 57.9% to 59.3% suggests that the company has improved its profitability per unit of product sold.From a financial perspective, the rise in net income is a strong indicator of improved operational efficiency. However, the decline in revenues could be a concern for future growth prospects, especially if it reflects a decrease in market demand or competitive pressures. The increase in cash and cash equivalents to $12.2 million provides the company with a solid liquidity position to manage short-term obligations and potentially invest in growth opportunities.Investors should note that while the earnings per share increased to $0.23, up from $0.06, this is based on a backdrop of lower sales. The challenge for the company will be to maintain profitability if sales continue to decline. Additionally, the inventory level remaining nearly constant suggests that the company did not significantly overproduce or underproduce, which is a good sign of inventory management aligning with sales expectations. Market Research Analyst The retail environment in 2023 posed challenges for Tandy Leather Factory, as indicated by the CEO's statement regarding 'weaker retail sales and continued high inflation'. It's important to assess the broader market conditions and consumer behavior to understand the potential impact on Tandy's business. The leather goods market is influenced by factors such as fashion trends, consumer spending power and input costs. High inflation can squeeze consumer budgets and reduce discretionary spending, which may have contributed to the decline in Tandy's sales.Furthermore, Tandy's focus on growing profits and cash amidst declining sales suggests a strategic pivot towards operational efficiency and financial health rather than aggressive expansion. This could be a response to the uncertain economic climate, where maintaining a strong balance sheet is important for weathering potential downturns. However, for sustained long-term growth, the company will need to address the causes of declining sales, whether through product innovation, market expansion, or enhanced marketing efforts.Understanding consumer preferences and the competitive landscape is essential for Tandy to adapt its product offerings and marketing strategies. The company's performance relative to its competitors will also be a key determinant of its market position and stock performance. Investors should keep an eye on industry trends and Tandy's strategic initiatives to increase sales while maintaining its improved profit margins. 03/22/2024 - 04:30 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tandy Leather Factory, Inc.

Net income was $3.8 million in 2023, compared to $1.2 million in 2022. Additional details regarding the Company’s 2023 results can be found in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.

Our total sales did decline, by about 5% including 6 stores closed in 2022 and 2023. However, we grew our operating income by more than $3 million versus 2022 driven by disciplined management of operating expenses and some capitalizable costs like freight. Operating expenses declined by nearly 10% over 2022, as we established a new baseline cost structure. Our year-end cash also grew by $4.2 million to $12.2 million. For 2024, we will continue to manage costs while putting renewed focus on sales with selective new stores and continued improvement in the customer experience.” The Company will host an investor presentation online (via Zoom) and by phone on Tuesday March 26, at 9:00 am CDT to discuss the Company’s first quarter operating results.

Provides February 2024 Production and Operation Updates Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Sphere 3D Corp. reports mining 40.3 Bitcoin in February 2024, a 15% YoY increase. Operating hash rate remains steady at 1.2 EH/s. Revenue at $1.9 million. CEO discusses fleet refresh and potential mergers. Legal action taken against Gryphon for return of Bitcoin holdings. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Bitcoin mining output by Sphere 3D Corp. is a positive development, with a 15% year-over-year growth indicating improved operational efficiency or increased capacity. However, the flat month-end operating hash rate suggests a potential plateau in the company's expansion or technological upgrades. The decrease in Bitcoin mined from January to February raises questions about the consistency of production, which could be a red flag for investors looking for steady growth.The termination of the Master Services Agreement with Gryphon Digital Mining and the subsequent legal actions to recover assets may have implications for the company's liquidity and operational costs. The potential 22.5% increase in gross profit post-termination is significant, but it hinges on the successful resolution of the dispute. Investors should monitor the situation closely as it unfolds, considering both the potential recovery of assets and the costs associated with legal proceedings. Cryptocurrency Market Analyst Sphere 3D's decision to refresh part of its mining fleet and engage in merger discussions could be indicative of a strategic pivot to maintain competitiveness in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency mining industry. The collaboration with Fabiano Consulting could bring valuable expertise, potentially enhancing the company's strategic planning and execution.The company's Bitcoin holdings and the strategy to sell a portion of its mined Bitcoin to fund operations is a common practice in the industry, balancing revenue generation with asset accumulation. The reported uptime of 60% is suboptimal, as it could significantly affect mining efficiency and profitability. This metric, along with the company's future plans to improve operational uptime, should be closely watched by stakeholders. Legal Expert The ongoing legal dispute with Gryphon Digital Mining highlights the risks associated with partnerships and contractual agreements in the cryptocurrency mining sector. The return of cash to Sphere 3D is a positive step, but the decision to continue with the conversion action will depend on a cost-benefit analysis of potential recoveries versus legal expenses. This case exemplifies the importance of due diligence and robust legal frameworks in protecting a company's assets and interests. 03/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Stamford, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - March 22, 2024) - Sphere 3D Corp.

The offering details are yet to be finalized, with major investment banks involved in the process.","Southwest Gas Announces that Centuri Files Public Registration Statement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. plans to list its subsidiary, Centuri Group, on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'CTRI' through an initial public offering. The offering details are yet to be finalized, with major investment banks involved in the process. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The intention to list Centuri Group on the NYSE under 'CTRI' signifies a strategic move by Southwest Gas Holdings to separate its utility infrastructure business. This decision to file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for an initial public offering (IPO) could indicate a corporate restructuring aimed at unlocking shareholder value and focusing on core competencies.Market analysts might assess the potential market capitalization of Centuri based on its business model, the competitive landscape within the utility infrastructure sector and comparable companies. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers and co-managers suggests confidence in the offering's success, potentially attracting institutional investors and positively influencing the stock's performance post-IPO.Investors will likely monitor the subsequent announcements regarding the timing, number of shares and price range, as these factors will directly affect the valuation and market dynamics. This listing could also be a bellwether for other companies considering similar strategic separations. Financial Analyst The forthcoming IPO of Centuri Group represents a significant financial event that requires careful consideration of the capital allocation and the effects on Southwest Gas Holdings' balance sheet. Analysts will dissect the financial health of both entities, scrutinizing Centuri's revenue streams, profitability and growth prospects. They will also evaluate whether the separation could lead to improved operational efficiencies and cost savings.Given the nature of the utility infrastructure industry, which often requires substantial capital investment, the IPO could provide Centuri with the necessary funds to invest in infrastructure projects, technology upgrades, or potential acquisitions. The move might also be indicative of Southwest Gas Holdings' desire to reduce debt or reallocate capital towards its primary natural gas operations.Investors should consider the short-term and long-term financial implications of the IPO, including potential impacts on earnings per share and dividend policies for both Southwest Gas Holdings and the newly public Centuri. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 is a critical step in the IPO process, as it requires the disclosure of financial data, business strategies and risk factors to potential investors. Legal professionals will scrutinize the document for compliance with SEC regulations and the Securities Act of 1933.The role of the underwriting banks is also of legal importance, as they are responsible for due diligence and ensuring the accuracy of the information presented in the prospectus. Any discrepancies or omissions could lead to legal complications or delays in the IPO timeline.Investors should be aware that until the SEC declares the registration statement effective, no sales can take place and any premature offering could result in legal penalties. The legal framework surrounding this IPO is designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. 03/22/2024 - 04:16 PM Intends to List Centuri Group under 'CTRI' on the NYSE LAS VEGAS, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.

The test can help identify high-risk patients who may benefit from more intensive treatment pathways, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy and imaging surveillance. Positive DecisionDx-Melanoma test showcased its clinical use value in identifying high-risk patients with cutaneous melanoma. Study of 979 patients showed the test's ability to predict risk of sentinel lymph node positivity. Patients with low-risk results had excellent outcomes after avoiding sentinel lymph node biopsy. DecisionDx-Melanoma has been validated in over 10,000 patient samples and supported by 50 peer-reviewed publications. Test designed to inform patient's risk of melanoma recurrence, metastasis, and individual risk of sentinel lymph node positivity. Study data presented at SSO 2024 highlights the test's role in guiding accurate, risk-aligned clinical decision-making. DecisionDx-Melanoma can reduce unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsies by approximately 25% in patients with T1-T2 tumors. Test can help identify patients at high risk of sentinel lymph node positivity and recurrence, guiding more intensive management strategies for improved patient outcomes. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from Castle Biosciences regarding their DecisionDx-Melanoma test are a significant development in the management of cutaneous melanoma (CM). The test's ability to predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity with high accuracy has implications for both patient care and healthcare economics. By stratifying patients based on their risk of SLN positivity, the test can potentially reduce the number of unnecessary SLNB procedures, which are invasive and carry a risk of complications. This not only improves patient quality of life by avoiding unnecessary surgery but also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs significantly.From a medical research perspective, the robust dataset supporting the DecisionDx-Melanoma test, which includes over 10,000 patient samples, provides a strong foundation for its clinical utility. The 100% recurrence-free survival rate at three years for patients classified as low risk by the test is a remarkable statistic, suggesting that the test could be a reliable tool for guiding treatment decisions. However, it's important to consider the long-term implications of forgoing SLNB, as the study currently reports three-year outcomes. Further longitudinal studies would be beneficial to confirm the test's predictive value over a longer period. Health Economist From a health economics standpoint, the adoption of DecisionDx-Melanoma has potential cost-saving implications for the healthcare system. The test's ability to reduce the number of SLNBs by 25% in patients with T1-T2 tumors represents a direct cost-saving measure. SLNB procedures are not only costly but also resource-intensive, involving surgical teams, pathology services and postoperative care. By minimizing these procedures, there could be a significant reduction in the overall burden on healthcare resources.Moreover, the test may lead to more personalized healthcare, with high-risk patients receiving more intensive treatment pathways and surveillance, potentially leading to earlier detection of metastasis and improved survival rates. However, the cost-effectiveness of the test would need to be evaluated against the standard care to determine its value proposition. It would be interesting to analyze the long-term financial impact, considering both direct medical costs and indirect costs such as patient recovery time and quality of life. Oncology Doctor In the field of oncology, the ability to accurately assess a patient's risk of recurrence and metastasis is paramount. The DecisionDx-Melanoma test's performance in predicting SLN positivity is a game-changer for clinicians. By incorporating tumor biology with clinical and pathologic risk factors, the test provides a nuanced risk assessment that can tailor patient management plans. This personalized approach to oncology not only has the potential to improve patient outcomes but also aligns with the broader trend towards precision medicine in cancer care.While the data is promising, it's important for clinicians to balance the benefits of reducing unnecessary procedures with the need to ensure that high-risk patients are not undertreated. The DecisionDx-Melanoma test appears to be a valuable tool in this regard, but it should be integrated into a comprehensive treatment plan that considers all aspects of patient care, including psychosocial support and long-term monitoring. 03/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Castle’s second presentation at SSO 2024 shows that in a study of 979 patients, DecisionDx-Melanoma demonstrated clinical use value in patients with TI cutaneous melanoma (CM), identifying high-risk patients who could consider a more intensive treatment pathway, such as a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and imaging surveillance FRIENDSWOOD, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Castle Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, today announced that new data highlighting the performance of its DecisionDx-Melanoma test in predicting risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in patients with CM is being presented at the Society of Surgical Oncology 2024 (SSO 2024) Annual Meeting, being held March 20-23 in Atlanta. “We have previously demonstrated that our DecisionDx-Melanoma test identifies patients who are eligible for an SLNB but have less than a 5% likelihood of being SLN positive, and could therefore consider avoiding the procedure,” said Derek Maetzold, president and chief executive officer of Castle Biosciences. “We have also demonstrated that our test is a strong and independent predictor of metastasis. The study that was orally presented at SSO 2024 demonstrates that patients who did avoid an SLNB procedure had excellent outcomes to date. This demonstration is highly important as it showed that our test can help patients avoid an unnecessary procedure.” DecisionDx-Melanoma is supported by 50 peer-reviewed publications involving more than 10,000 patient samples, demonstrating its robust value in guiding risk-aligned patient care. The test has been designed and validated to inform two clinical questions in the management of melanoma: a patient’s risk of melanoma recurrence and metastasis, and their individual risk of SLN positivity, as highlighted in Castle’s SSO 2024 abstracts outlined below. DecisionDx®-Melanoma Oral Presentation Number and Title: 62: Prospective validation of the i31-gene expression profile test for cutaneous melanoma to select patients who may consider foregoing sentinel lymph node biopsy Session: Melanoma Parallel Session Presenter and Lead Author: J. Michael Guenther, M.D., St. Elizabeth Physicians, Edgewood, Kentucky Summary: This study shares three-year outcomes data from Castle’s prospective, multicenter study of patients with CM who were being considered for an SLNB (n=322). SLNB is an invasive surgical procedure used to determine whether a patient’s cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes; the procedure returns a surgical result that is negative for metastasis in approximately 88% of patients. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network® guidelines use a 5% likelihood of SLN positivity as the threshold to avoid versus consider/recommend an SLNB due to an increased risk of metastasis. DecisionDx-Melanoma has been validated to provide a patient’s individualized risk of SLN positivity (i31-GEP for SLNB) by integrating clinical and pathologic risk factors with the patient’s tumor biology. In the study, no patients with a DecisionDx-Melanoma predicted risk of SLN positivity less than 5% had a positive SLN (among all tumor stages studied). If DecisionDx-Melanoma was used to inform management decisions, the test’s results could have further reduced the number of patients with T1-T2 tumors who could have avoided SLNB by 25%. Additionally, at three years, all patients with a low-risk DecisionDx-Melanoma test result were recurrence free (recurrence free survival of 100%). These data demonstrate that use of DecisionDx-Melanoma test results can guide accurate, risk-aligned clinical decision-making regarding the SLNB surgical procedure, within current guidelines. Further, the test can identify low-risk patients who can safely consider foregoing SLNB, thereby reducing unnecessary SLNB procedures (by approximately 25% in this study alone) and the associated costs and risks of complications that accompany them. ePoster Number and Title: E309: Utility of 31-gene expression profile test in identifying patients with T1 cutaneous melanoma at high risk of SLN positivity and recurrence Session: Melanoma Parallel Session Summary: In a pooled cohort of 979 patients with thin (T1) tumors, a DecisionDx-Melanoma Class 2B result was the strongest predictor of a positive SLN, among other risk factors that included patient age, tumor location, Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration and more. While the study outlined above demonstrates the ability of the test to identify patients at low risk of SLN positivity who can safely forgo SLNB, this study shows that it can also identify patients at high risk who should consider it. By identifying patients who have a higher risk of SLNB positivity and recurrence, DecisionDx-Melanoma can help determine which patients should be considered for more intensive management, such as SLNB, increased follow-up frequency and imaging surveillance, to improve patient outcomes. ePosters are available for conference attendees in the ePoster Online Gallery.

The company aims to meet financial obligations through the sale of 10,127,132 ordinary shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital increase and subsequent share issuance by Alvotech represent a strategic financial maneuver aimed at maintaining the company's equity structure and fulfilling financial commitments. The issuance of 13 million shares at USD 15.98 per share, subscribed by its own subsidiary, is a transaction that can be seen as a preparatory step for future financial flexibility. This move allows the company to manage its treasury shares effectively, ensuring that it has a sufficient number of shares available for potential conversion of financial instruments and for fulfilling share-based employee compensation schemes.From an investor's perspective, the dilution effect of increasing the total number of shares might raise concerns about potential earnings per share (EPS) reduction. However, this should be weighed against the company's ability to meet its financial obligations without resorting to external financing, which could be more costly. Furthermore, the fact that the subsidiary holds these shares as treasury shares means they will not have voting rights or dividend entitlement, which minimizes the impact on existing shareholders' control and profit-sharing. Market Research Analyst Biosimilar medicines are increasingly important in the pharmaceutical industry due to their potential to reduce healthcare costs while increasing access to vital treatments. Alvotech's focus on this sector places it in a competitive position within a growing market. The capital increase can be interpreted as a signal of the company's intent to sustain its growth and market presence. It is important to monitor how Alvotech deploys the capital raised through this share issuance, as it could be invested in R&D, expanding production capabilities, or other strategic initiatives that could enhance its market position.Moreover, the sale of over 10 million ordinary shares previously held by the subsidiary to investors indicates active market interest in Alvotech's equity. This interest could be a positive sign of market confidence in the company's long-term strategy and its pipeline of biosimilar products. Stakeholders should pay attention to the company's forthcoming financial reports and any announcements regarding product development milestones, as these will provide further insights into the efficacy of the capital utilization. Legal Expert The legal implications of Alvotech's share capital increase and the handling of treasury shares require careful consideration. The structure of the transaction, where a subsidiary subscribes to the newly issued shares, is a common practice that must comply with corporate governance rules and securities regulations. The company must ensure that all actions are transparent and provide fair treatment to all shareholders.It's also important to note that the shares held by the subsidiary are treated as treasury shares, which typically means they are not included in the calculation of earnings per share or voting rights. This arrangement should be clearly communicated to shareholders to prevent any misunderstanding. The company's adherence to these legal standards will be important in maintaining shareholder trust and avoiding regulatory scrutiny. 03/22/2024 - 04:15 PM Alvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO) (the “Company”), a global biotech company specializing in the development and manufacture of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide, has increased the Company´s share capital by an amount of one hundred and thirty thousand (USD 130,000) by issuing thirteen million (13,000,000) ordinary shares.

Decreased clinical study expenses for Phase 2b viral challenge clinical study and Phase 1b allergen challenge study. Change in fair value of the warrant liability creating a $8.3 million gain. Financial Analyst Revelation Biosciences' financial results indicate a strategic shift towards advancing their clinical programs, particularly Gemini. The completion of a $6.2 million public offering is a significant liquidity event that has bolstered the company's cash position to $12.0 million. This positions the company to fund operations through 2024, which is vital for investor confidence in the company's ability to continue its clinical trials without the immediate need for additional capital raises that could dilute existing shareholders.The reported reduction in net loss from $10.8 million to $0.1 million year-over-year is a positive indicator of the company's improved financial management and the impact of non-operational factors such as the change in fair value of the warrant liability. However, investors should remain cautious as the company is still operating at a loss and the gain from the warrant liability is non-cash and may not be indicative of operational efficiency improvements. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of the Phase 1 clinical study for Gemini signifies a critical step in Revelation Biosciences' product pipeline. The positive preclinical acute kidney injury (AKI) results suggest potential for Gemini, which could address a significant unmet medical need if the clinical data aligns with preclinical findings. The focus on trained immunity is a novel approach in the biopharmaceutical industry and could potentially lead to a new class of therapeutics.From a research perspective, the transition from preclinical to clinical phases is fraught with uncertainties and the success of Gemini in human trials is not guaranteed. Investors should be aware of the risks inherent in clinical development, particularly for early-stage biotechnology companies. The company's ability to advance Gemini through clinical trials will be a key determinant of its future valuation and potential revenue streams. 03/22/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Revelation Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: REVB) (the “Company” or “Revelation”), a clinical-stage life sciences company that is focused on harnessing the power of trained immunity for the prevention and treatment of disease, today reported its three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 financial results. Corporate Highlights Completed a $6.2 million public offering. Commencement of first in human Phase 1 clinical study of Gemini at the beginning of March. Oral presentation and poster of nonclinical data demonstrating Gemini reduces the severity and duration of acute kidney injury in an ischemia reperfusion model at the 29th International Conference on Advances in Critical Care Nephrology this month. “The Revelation team has worked hard over 2023 to build the foundation for successful advancement of Gemini and we are delighted with being able to share the positive preclinical AKI results and the start of our Phase 1 study,” said James Rolke, Chief Executive Officer of Revelation. “During 2024, we look forward to building on this momentum and advancing evaluation of Gemini into patients.” Results of Operations As of December 31, 2023, Revelation had $12.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $5.3 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to net cash received from financing activities, offset primarily by cash used for operating activities. Based on current operating plans and projections, Revelation believes that its current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations through 2024. Revelation’s net cash used for operating activities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $2.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, compared to net cash used for operating activities of $0.9 million and $11.2 million for the same periods in 2022, respectively. Revelation’s net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2 million and $0.1 million, or $8.33 and $0.53 basic and diluted net loss per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million and $10.8 million, or $15.61 and $149.20 basic and diluted net loss per share for the same period in 2022, respectively. The changes in net cash used for operating activities and the increase in net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to pre-clinical costs and clinical preparation costs primarily for programs GEM-SSI and GEM-AKI. The changes in net cash used for operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 were primarily due to decreased clinical study expenses associated with our Phase 2b viral challenge clinical study (REVTx-99a) and our Phase 1b allergen challenge study (REVTx-99b), legal fees, professional consulting service fees and public company directors and officers insurance policy. The decrease in net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 were primarily due to the change in fair value of the warrant liability creating a $8.3 million gain.

The redemption will take place on April 25, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bank of America's decision to redeem its 2.932% Fixed/Floating Rate Senior Notes ahead of maturity indicates a strategic move to manage its debt portfolio. By redeeming these notes at 100% of the principal amount, the bank is likely taking advantage of current market conditions to refinance its debt at a potentially lower interest rate, which could reduce interest expenses and improve net interest margins. This is a common practice among large financial institutions to maintain an optimal capital structure and minimize cost of capital.Investors should note that the early redemption of debt could imply that the bank has a strong liquidity position, reflecting positively on its balance sheet. However, it is also important to consider the opportunity cost for note holders who will be paid back their principal but might find it challenging to reinvest at similar returns given the current interest rate environment. This action might be perceived as a signal of confidence from the bank's management regarding their financial stability and future earnings potential. Debt Market Analyst From a debt market perspective, the redemption of Bank of America's Senior Notes can influence the supply and demand dynamics within the fixed income market. The removal of CAD1,000,000,000 from the market will reduce the available high-grade investment options for investors, potentially driving demand for remaining securities. This could have a slight tightening effect on credit spreads for similar instruments.Furthermore, the bank's choice to redeem at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest is standard, yet it reaffirms the bank's commitment to fulfilling its obligations, potentially reinforcing investor confidence in future debt issuances by Bank of America. The involvement of reputable institutions such as The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and BNY Trust Company of Canada as trustee and paying agent, respectively, ensures a smooth transaction process, which is a positive reflection on the bank's operational efficiency. 03/22/2024 - 04:15 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation announced today that it will redeem on April 25, 2024 all CAD1,000,000,000 principal amount outstanding of its 2.932% Fixed/Floating Rate Senior Notes, due April 2025 (CUSIP No. 060505FM1, ISIN: CA060505FM13) (the ""Notes""), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date of April 25, 2024.

Financial results show increased R&D expenses but decreased G&A expenses. The company closed a direct offering and private placement, extending cash runway into Q4 2024. Positive Positive clinical data for Annamycin supporting advancement into a pivotal study for AML. Closed a direct offering and private placement, raising gross proceeds of $4.5 million. Net loss for 2023 was $29.8 million, with cash and cash equivalents of $23.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative Increase in R&D expenses from the previous year due to WPD sublicense termination. Non-cash loss of $1.0 million on warrants in 2023. Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.0 million in 2023. Oncology Drug Development Expert Annamycin's progression to a pivotal study for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) signifies a critical juncture in oncology drug development, particularly for treatments targeting hard-to-treat cancers. The data indicating non-cardiotoxicity is notable, as cardiotoxicity is a significant concern with current anthracyclines used in chemotherapy. The implications for patients could be profound, potentially offering a safer treatment alternative. For investors, the transition of Annamycin into late-stage trials is a key indicator of Moleculin's pipeline maturity and could influence the company's valuation. The financial commitment to R&D, despite a modest increase, reflects a strategic focus on advancing their lead compounds. However, the net loss and cash runway projections warrant attention, as they suggest a potential need for additional capital in the near future, which could lead to dilution for current shareholders. Biotech Financial Analyst The direct offering priced at-the-market, involving institutional and executive participation, provides a short-term cash infusion and demonstrates a degree of confidence in Moleculin's prospects. However, the $4.5 million raised extends the cash runway only into Q4 2024, suggesting a limited financial cushion. This could potentially pressure the stock if the market anticipates further capital raises. The reported net loss is also a concern, though not uncommon for clinical-stage biotech firms. The decrease in G&A expenses is a positive sign of cost management, but the R&D expenses will likely increase as the company approaches pivotal trials. The cash position of $23.6 million, while sufficient for the near term, needs to be considered in the context of future clinical trial costs and potential commercialization expenses. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The market for AML treatments is competitive, with several players working on new therapies. Annamycin's potential non-cardiotoxic profile could differentiate it in the marketplace and offer a competitive advantage. The presentation of interim data at the ASH meeting is a strategic move to garner interest among key opinion leaders, which could facilitate future adoption and partnerships. The biotech sector is driven by data and multiple data readouts in 2024 will likely be pivotal for Moleculin's stock performance. The company’s strategic focus on advancing Annamycin is clear, but the market will closely watch the data readouts for efficacy and safety to assess the drug's commercial potential and impact on Moleculin's long-term growth. 03/22/2024 - 04:05 PM – Year marked by growing body of positive Annamycin efficacy and safety clinical data expected to support advancement into a pivotal study for AML – Company to host conference call and webcast Monday, March 25th at 8:30 AM ET – Company to issue separate clinical trial update press release Monday prior to the conference call HOUSTON, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Moleculin Biotech, Inc., (Nasdaq: MBRX) (""Moleculin"" or the ""Company""), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a broad portfolio of drug candidates targeting hard-to-treat tumors and viruses, today reported its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast, Monday, March 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM ET (details below), issuing a separate clinical trial update press release just prior. ""Over the course of 2023 we established a significant growing body of positive clinical and encouraging safety data for Annamycin that continues to strengthen our confidence in the potential of our next generation, non-cardiotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment landscape for hard-to-treat cancers and viruses,"" commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. ""Building off of our momentum, we are laser focused on driving our priority pipeline programs toward key data milestones in the near term and believe we are well-positioned to achieve clinical and regulatory milestones that will translate into significant value creation for all of our stakeholders."" Recent Highlights Announced 2023 year-end Annamycin clinical trials preliminary data and 2024 expectations for multiple data readouts and transition to pivotal Phase 2B/3;Closed a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules with a single healthcare-focused institutional investor and certain of the Company's executive officers, a board member and concurrent private placement for gross proceeds of $4.5 million before deducting the placement agent's fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company pushing the Company's cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2024; andPresented positive interim data from the Company's ongoing European Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating Annamycin for the treatment of AML (MB-106) to key opinion leaders and current investigators at a meeting held in conjunction with the 65th American Society of Hematology Meeting and Exposition (ASH) in San Diego, CA.Summary of Financial Results for the Full Year 2023 Research and development (R&D) expenses were $19.5 million and $19.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in R&D of $0.5 million is mainly related to the $1.5 million WPD sublicense termination, which enabled the reacquisition of the Company's intellectual property rights in certain territories, including parts of the European Union. This was offset by $1.0 million in costs related to the timing of costs incurred for clinical trials and sponsored research. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $10.0 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in G&A of $1.5 million was mainly attributable to a decrease in regulatory and legal services, and consulting & advisory fees. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $29.8 million, which included a non-cash loss of $1.0 million on warrants in 2023 as compared to a gain of $1.3 million in the prior year and approximately $2.0 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2023 as compared to $2.3 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $23.6 million. The Company believes that this cash is sufficient to meet its projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of 2024.

Announce Receipt of Shareholder Approval for Merger Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Peoples Financial Services Corp. (PFIS) and FNCB Bancorp, Inc. shareholders approve merger, with PFIS as the surviving , subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the merger between Peoples Financial Services Corp. and FNCB Bancorp by their respective shareholders represents a significant consolidation within the regional banking sector. This move is likely to create operational synergies, potentially leading to cost savings and increased market share. The merger could also result in a more diverse loan portfolio and deposit base, which might mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations. However, it is essential to consider the execution risks and the potential for cultural clashes that can affect the anticipated benefits of such a merger.From a financial perspective, the key metrics to watch post-merger will be the cost-income ratio, return on equity and loan-to-deposit ratios. These will indicate the efficiency and profitability of the newly combined entity. Additionally, the impact on the stock price will depend on the market's perception of the merger's success in achieving its stated goals and the realization of projected synergies. Market Research Analyst Market concentration is a critical factor to consider in the aftermath of the Peoples and FNCB merger. The combined entity's market power in their regional banking market could shift competitive dynamics, potentially affecting smaller players. It will be interesting to monitor how this consolidation influences lending rates, deposit rates and the availability of banking services to consumers and businesses in the region.Furthermore, the response of competitors, whether through strategic partnerships, technological innovation, or enhanced customer service offerings, will be vital to observe. These reactions could either validate or challenge the strategic rationale behind the merger. The long-term success of the merger will be measured not just by internal performance metrics but also by the ability to maintain or grow customer loyalty in a changing competitive landscape. Legal Expert The shareholder approval is only one step in the merger process, with regulatory approvals still pending. The scrutiny from regulatory bodies will ensure that the merger does not violate antitrust laws and does not lead to an unfair concentration of market power. The outcome of this regulatory process is crucial, as it may impose conditions or even block the merger if it's deemed to compromise fair competition.Moreover, the legal complexities of merging two separate entities involve harmonizing policies, contracts and regulatory compliance protocols. The legal teams of Peoples and FNCB will need to navigate these intricacies carefully to avoid future litigation or regulatory penalties that could undermine the benefits of the merger. 03/22/2024 - 04:10 PM SCRANTON, Pa. and DUNMORE, Pa., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Peoples Financial Services Corp.

(GNPX) successfully closed a registered direct offering, raising approximately $6.5 million through the sale of 1,542,112 shares of common stock and warrants. The company intends to utilize the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. H.C. Wainwright & Co. served as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Genprex's registered direct offering is a strategic financial move, likely aiming to bolster the company's balance sheet. With a gross proceed of approximately $6.5 million before expenses, the infusion of capital is modest for a clinical-stage company. The pricing strategy, at $4.215 per share and warrants exercisable at $4.09, suggests a confidence in maintaining stock value above the exercise price, which could be indicative of the company's positive outlook on their pipeline's potential.However, the amendment of existing warrants with a significant reduction in exercise price from $44.00 and $35.40 to $4.09 might raise concerns about previous overvaluation or a strategic adjustment to facilitate the exercise of these warrants. This could potentially dilute existing shareholders but also reflects a more accessible price point for warrant holders to invest further in the company.Investors should monitor how the capital is allocated towards working capital and general corporate purposes, as it may influence the company's ability to reach significant clinical milestones, which in turn could affect the stock's performance. Biotech Market Analyst Genprex's direct offering is a common practice within the biotech industry, particularly for clinical-stage companies that often require substantial funding to advance their research and development. The decision to use net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes is typical, as liquidity is important for ongoing trials and operations.However, the impact on the stock market will likely depend on how investors perceive the company's current valuation and the potential of its gene therapy treatments. Given the competitive nature of the biotech sector, Genprex's ability to differentiate its therapies and show progress in clinical trials will be key factors in maintaining investor interest and stock stability.Considering the exercise price of the warrants is close to the offering price, it suggests a calculated risk on behalf of the investors, anticipating that the stock value will not depreciate significantly in the near term. This could be seen as a vote of confidence in Genprex's strategic direction and future announcements regarding their therapies. Securities Legal Expert Genprex adhered to regulatory requirements by filing the necessary registration statement with the SEC and ensuring the offering was conducted via a prospectus. This is a standard procedure to ensure transparency and compliance with securities laws. The amendment of existing warrants is also a legal maneuver that requires careful disclosure, as it alters the terms under which the securities were initially sold.While the legal framework appears to have been followed correctly, investors should be aware of the implications of such amendments, as they can affect the rights and potential returns of both current and future security holders. The reduction in exercise price for the amended warrants is a notable change that could influence investor sentiment and the perceived value of the company's stock.It is also important to note that the press release's disclaimer about the offering not constituting an offer to sell securities in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful is a standard protective statement to prevent legal disputes related to the sale of securities. 03/22/2024 - 04:10 PM AUSTIN, Texas, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Genprex, Inc. (""Genprex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: GNPX), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes, today announced the closing on March 21, 2024 of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under the Nasdaq rules for the sale and issuance of 1,542,112 shares of common stock (or prefunded warrants in lieu thereof) of the Company and warrants to purchase up to 1,542,112 shares of common stock at a combined offering price of $4.215 per share of common stock (or per prefunded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrant.

About Genprex, Inc. Genprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes. Genprex's technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for large patient populations with cancer and diabetes who currently have limited treatment options. Genprex works with world-class institutions and collaborators to develop drug candidates to further its pipeline of gene therapies in order to provide novel treatment approaches. Genprex's oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex® Delivery System which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid nanoparticles. The resultant product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. The Company's lead product candidate, Reqorsa® Immunogene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in three clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Each of Genprex's three lung cancer clinical programs has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and Genprex's SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. Genprex's diabetes gene therapy approach is comprised of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body's immune system.

Rubicon Receives Notice of Non-Compliance with NYSE Trading Share Price and Market Capitalization Listing Rules,2024-03-22T20:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Rubicon Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE: RBT) received a notice from the NYSE for non-compliance with market cap and share price requirements. The company has a market cap and stock price lower than specified thresholds. Rubicon has a 6-month Share Price Cure Period to meet the $1.00 stock price requirement and an 18-month Market Cap Cure Period to address the global market capitalization deficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The situation with Rubicon Technologies indicates a significant concern for investors and stakeholders, as the company's failure to meet the NYSE's market capitalization and share price requirements could signal underlying financial or operational weaknesses. The Market Cap Deficiency points to a valuation issue, which can be an indicator of reduced investor confidence or a reaction to competitive pressures, management decisions, or industry downturns.From a financial perspective, the company's plan to regain compliance will be critical to observe. The submission of a business plan within 45 days to address the Market Cap Deficiency will be a key document for assessing the company's strategic direction and operational adjustments. If the NYSE accepts the plan, it implies a level of confidence in the company's potential to recover, which could stabilize or even improve investor sentiment.However, if the company fails to regain compliance within the 18-month Market Cap Cure Period, the risk of delisting grows, which could lead to further erosion of stock value and investor trust. Moreover, the Share Price Deficiency and the six-month cure period to address it add another layer of urgency for the company to act. A share price below $1.00 is often viewed unfavorably by the market and can trigger sell-offs. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market context is essential when analyzing Rubicon Technologies' current compliance issue with the NYSE. The company operates in the waste and recycling sector, which is increasingly influenced by environmental policies and technological advancements. The market's response to Rubicon's notice from the NYSE will depend on the perceived effectiveness of their recovery plan and their ability to adapt to market demands.Investors will be closely monitoring Rubicon's strategic moves, such as potential cost-cutting measures, investment in technology, partnerships, or market expansion plans, to assess their viability. Market sentiment can shift quickly and the company's ability to communicate a clear and actionable plan to the public is important for maintaining stakeholder trust.Moreover, the industry's competitive landscape will play a role in the company's recovery. If competitors are gaining market share or innovating at a faster pace, Rubicon will need to demonstrate a competitive edge or unique value proposition to regain investor confidence and market capitalization. Corporate Governance Expert Corporate governance plays a pivotal role in how a company addresses compliance issues and communicates with its shareholders. Rubicon Technologies' management must act transparently and decisively to restore confidence. The governance structure will be scrutinized for its effectiveness in crisis management and its ability to implement the necessary changes to meet the NYSE's standards.Shareholder engagement is also a critical factor. The company's intention to consider available alternatives to cure the stock price non-compliance, potentially during the annual meeting of stockholders, suggests that shareholder voting may play a role in the company's strategy. This could involve measures such as reverse stock splits or other corporate actions that require shareholder approval.Effective governance will be essential not only for navigating the current deficiencies but also for setting a precedent for how the company anticipates and responds to future challenges. The company's approach to addressing the Market Cap and Share Price Deficiencies will be indicative of the management's capability to steer the company back to a stable trajectory. 03/22/2024 - 04:10 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rubicon Technologies, Inc. (“Rubicon” or the “Company”) (NYSE: RBT), a leading provider of technology solutions for waste, recycling, and fleet operations, today announced that on March 18, 2024 it received a notice (the “Notice”) from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) informing the Company that it is no longer in compliance with Sections 802.01B and 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Company was notified by the NYSE that it was not in compliance with Section 802.01B (the “Market Cap Deficiency”) because it had an average global market capitalization, over a consecutive 30 trading-day period, that is less than $50,000,000 and, at the same time, its stockholders’ equity is less than $50,000,000. The Company was concurrently notified by the NYSE that it was also not in compliance with Section 802.01C (the “Share Price Deficiency”, together with the Market Cap Deficiency, the “Deficiencies”) because the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The Notice does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company’s Class A common stock from the NYSE. The Company plans to notify the NYSE by no later than April 1, 2024 (ten business days after receipt of the Notice) that it intends to cure the Deficiencies and return to compliance with the NYSE continued listing standard. Share Price Deficiency The NYSE provides a period of six months (the “Share Price Cure Period”) following receipt of the Notice to regain compliance with the minimum stock price requirement for continued listing on the NYSE. Rubicon can regain compliance at any time during the Share Price Cure Period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the Share Price Cure Period, Rubicon has: (i) a closing stock price of at least $1.00 and (ii) an average closing stock price of at least $1.00 over the 30-day trading period ending on the last trading day of that month. The Company intends to consider available alternatives no later than at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, if necessary, to cure the stock price non-compliance. Under the NYSE’s rules, if the Company determines that it will cure the Share Price Deficiency by taking an action that will require stockholder approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders, the price condition will be deemed cured if the price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share, and the price remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. Market Cap Deficiency In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, the Company has 45 days from receipt of the Notice to submit a business plan advising the NYSE of the definitive action(s) the Company has taken, or is taking, that would bring it into compliance with continued listing standards within 18 months of receipt of the Notice (the “Market Cap Cure Period,” together with the Share Price Cure Period, the “Cure Periods”). The NYSE will review the plan and, within 45 days of its receipt, determine whether the Company has made a reasonable demonstration of an ability to conform to the relevant standards in the 18-month period. If the NYSE accepts the plan, the Company's Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 18-month period, subject to the Company's compliance with the other continued listing standards of the NYSE and continued periodic review by the NYSE of the Company's progress with respect to its plan. Rubicon is currently evaluating its available options and developing a plan to regain compliance with the minimum global market capitalization requirement. The Company’s Class A common stock will continue to be listed and trade on the NYSE during the Cure Periods, subject to the Company’s compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards.

The company anticipates significant growth in the German medical cannabis market.","InterCure Congratulates Germany on Cannabis Reform, Expanding its Global Footprint Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary InterCure (INCR) expects to launch products in Germany following the passing of the 'CannG' Cannabis Act, which will make prescribing medical cannabis easier and more cost-effective. The company anticipates significant growth in the German medical cannabis market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent legislative change in Germany, known as the 'CannG' Cannabis Act, is a pivotal moment for the medical cannabis industry. It is expected to broaden the market by simplifying the prescription process and reducing costs. This, in turn, could lead to increased demand for medical cannabis products. Companies like InterCure, which are poised to enter the German market, could benefit significantly from this expanded customer base. However, it's essential to monitor how this change will affect the competitive landscape, as new and existing players may adjust their strategies to capitalize on the growing market. The impact on InterCure's stock will largely depend on their ability to effectively penetrate the market and maintain a competitive edge. Healthcare Policy Expert The deregulation of medical cannabis in Germany represents a major shift in healthcare policy that could serve as a model for other countries considering similar reforms. The removal of cannabis from the list of prohibited substances under the German Narcotics Act eases the burden on healthcare providers and patients, potentially improving the quality of life for those with chronic conditions. It's important to consider the long-term implications of such a policy shift, including the need for robust regulatory frameworks to ensure product safety and consistency. The success of medical cannabis companies in this new environment will hinge on their ability to navigate these regulations while meeting the increased demand. Financial Analyst Investors should pay attention to the financial implications of Germany's cannabis reform for companies like InterCure. The anticipation of entering the German market may already be factored into InterCure's current valuation, but actual performance post-launch will be the true test. Key financial metrics to watch include revenue growth, market share and profit margins post-expansion. Additionally, the company's ability to scale operations and manage supply chain logistics in a new market environment will be critical for long-term profitability. While the reform presents a significant opportunity, it also comes with the risk of increased operational costs and potential price competition as the market matures. 03/22/2024 - 11:58 AM InterCure provides an update following recent Cannabis Reform in Germany Expects to launch its first products in Germany in the coming months The Company continues to closely watch developments surrounding Cannabis rescheduling in the U.S. NEW YORK & HERZLIYA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- InterCure Ltd. (NASDAQ: INCR) (TASE: INCR) (dba Canndoc) (""InterCure"" or the ""Company""), the leading medical cannabis company outside of North America, is thrilled to congratulate The Federal Republic of Germany for the passing of the “CannG” Cannabis Act, which is expected to take effect on April 1, 2024. On the backdrop of this monumental development, InterCure expects to launch a series of products in Germany in the coming months. While the Cannabis Act deals with all types of cannabis, it is poised to have a uniquely significant impact on the medical cannabis sector. By excising cannabis from the list of prohibited substances in the German Narcotics Act, the reform makes prescribing medical cannabis to patients substantially easier and more cost-effective for doctors at greater scale and not only as a last resort. Thus, this reform is set to dismantle major barriers that have historically hindered patient access to cannabis-based treatments. This sets the stage for expected significant expansion of the medical cannabis market in Germany. Alexander Rabinovitch, CEO of InterCure, expressed his excitement about the legislative changes in Germany, stating, ""We are thrilled by the recent reform passed in Germany and are optimistic about the global shift that is taking place. As a leader in pharmaceutical Cannabis, we are closely watching these developments including the potential rescheduling of Cannabis in the United States, and plan to advance our global footprint, expecting to launch our products in Germany in the coming months. The strong foundation we have built over the past 15 years serves us today as we continuously execute our mission of providing high-quality, pharma-grade medical cannabis products to patients around the world."" About InterCure (dba Canndoc) InterCure (dba Canndoc) (NASDAQ: INCR) (TASE: INCR) is the leading, profitable, and fastest growing cannabis company outside of North America. Canndoc, a wholly owned subsidiary of InterCure, is Israel’s largest licensed cannabis producer and one of the first to offer Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certified and pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis products.

Auna is the first Latin American healthcare company listed in the US and marks the first healthcare IPO in Spanish Speaking Latin America since 2018. The company's mission is to transform healthcare in Latin America by providing integrated healthcare services in Spanish-speaking countries. Auna's focus on prevention and high complexity diseases aligns with the region's healthcare needs. The healthcare market in Spanish Speaking Latin America is estimated to reach US$469 billion by 2028, providing a significant opportunity for Auna. Negative None. Financial Analyst The IPO of Auna S.A. and its subsequent listing on the New York Stock Exchange is a significant event for the company and the broader healthcare sector in Latin America. The financial figures reported, with revenues surging to US$1.05 billion and Adjusted EBITDA to US$223 million, indicate robust growth, reflecting a 58% and 90% increase respectively. The expansion of the Adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.3% is particularly notable, suggesting improved operational efficiency and profitability. This performance could attract investor interest in Auna, as margin expansion is often a key indicator of a company's ability to scale effectively while maintaining cost controls.Moreover, the healthcare market in Latin America is poised for growth, with estimates indicating a potential increase from US$313 billion to US$469 billion by 2028. Auna's IPO could provide the necessary capital to capitalize on this growth, potentially funding expansion and the enhancement of its service offerings. Investors would do well to monitor Auna's execution of its growth strategy and its impact on future financial performance, especially in the context of the nearshoring economy of Mexico and the overall healthcare demand in the region. Healthcare Market Analyst Auna's integrated healthcare model, which combines a network of 31 facilities with a portfolio of oncological and health plans, addresses a critical gap in Latin America's healthcare infrastructure. The focus on high complexity diseases and prevention is strategically aligned with global healthcare trends toward value-based care. By prioritizing patient-centered approaches and quality, Auna is positioning itself to take advantage of the under-served healthcare markets in the region.The company's successful IPO not only reflects confidence in its business model but also underscores the attractiveness of the Latin American healthcare sector to global investors. The fact that Auna is the first healthcare services company from Spanish-speaking Latin America listed in the US since 2018 is indicative of the market's potential for disruption and growth. Stakeholders should consider the scalability of Auna's model, the regulatory environment and the competitive landscape as these factors will influence the company's ability to leverage its IPO proceeds to capture market share and deliver sustained growth. Economist The healthcare sector in Latin America is at an inflection point, driven by demographic shifts and economic developments such as nearshoring. Auna's IPO injects not only capital but also confidence into the region's healthcare ecosystem. The increased access to integrated healthcare services can have a multiplier effect on the economy, potentially improving workforce productivity and attracting further investment into the sector.However, it is essential to consider the broader economic context. While the nearshoring economy of Mexico presents opportunities, it also comes with challenges such as currency fluctuations, political instability and varying healthcare regulations across countries. These factors can affect Auna's expansion plans and operational costs. Investors should weigh these macroeconomic considerations alongside the company's financials to assess the potential risks and rewards of investing in Auna's growth trajectory. 03/22/2024 - 11:06 AM Auna’s mission is to transform healthcare in Latin America, providing access to a highly integrated offering of quality healthcare services in Spanish-speaking Americas.

Halloum joins other authors in the series, including tennis great Billie Jean King, actor LeVar Burton and former NFL coach Daron K. Roberts. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240322948275/en/AZVA Teacher Tasneem Halloum and her book, A Kids Book About Courage (Photo: Business Wire) “Over the years, I’ve taught children with varied backgrounds and abilities, and I’ve seen the life challenges they face,” Halloum said. “Many students who have made the switch to AZVA include those in military families that make frequent moves, those who have health issues that don’t allow for in-class attendance, and those who are refugees. Sadly, some transfer to AZVA because they’ve been bullied. The courage AZVA students and all the students I have worked with over the years express daily is what inspired this book.” “A Kids Book About Courage” describes courage and its different forms and shares how all children have courage within themselves. While courage can be internal or external, big or small, children can learn to recognize it and be proud of it. Halloum’s book is part of a children’s book series that explains the big issues young people face and how they can deal with them. The book is meant to be read by children with their parents and to foster conversations about important topics. As such, Halloum considers “A Kids Book About Courage” to be a good pick for children and parents in March, which has been designated as National Reading Month, a month to get parents and kids motivated about reading. “We fully support our teachers like Tasneem by encouraging them to pursue their passions — in this case, writing a book — and share them with others to foster confidence and growth,” said AZVA Executive Director Charles Woods Jr. Halloum has been with AZVA for seven years and has taught abroad and in brick-and-mortar schools. More information on her book can be found here. It is available on Amazon. About the Author Tasneem Halloum is a devoted mother and dedicated educator who has a passion for inspiring young minds.

The multi-modality showcase will feature innovations focused on precision care delivery for a wide range of vascular diseases and health conditions. In today’s practice of interventional radiology, clinicians use image guiding technologies to deliver targeted, minimally invasive treatments to help treat a wide range of medical conditions – from cancer care and vascular disease to common health concerns that affect quality of life for both men and women alike. Among the emerging treatments in interventional radiology today, prostatic artery embolization (PAE) has been shown to be an effective treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate - the most common prostate condition for men older than age 50.1 The procedure involves targeted release of microscopic particles into the arteries that feed the prostate. The particles stop blood flow into the gland helping to decrease its size and relieve troubling BPH symptoms without any cutting, use of laser or tissue removal. In order for the PAE procedure to be successful, clinicians need to be able to identify the correct arteries and vascular anatomy feeding the prostate in order to deliver precise and targeted treatment. As GE HealthCare continues to advance the Allia IGS platform and interventional innovation, Embo ASSIST AI is the latest addition to the company's ASSIST imaging software. Embo ASSIST AI builds on Embo ASSIST software with AI-based automation designed to automatically segment vascular structures to facilitate embolization workflow planning, as well as help clinicians visualize and anticipate the destination of potential injections. Scientific studies have shown that the use of Embo ASSIST enables users performing PAE to: Reduce patient dose by 44% (Air Kerma) and 58% (Peak Skin Dose);2 Reduce fluoroscopy time by 27% and overall procedure time by 21 minutes (20%);2 Improve anatomy understanding in 46% of cases versus raw cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), with four times more secondary branches found versus digital subtraction angiography (DSA);3 and Reduce PAE patient dose (DAP) by 70% and improved PAE technical success from 70% without software to 90% with software.4 Embo ASSIST has also been shown to support the development of emerging procedures including rectal artery embolization for hemorrhoidal disease5 as well as intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion in patients with skull base tumors.6 “With GE HealthCare’s Allia IGS platform and innovative solutions like Embo ASSIST, we’re able to bring the best possible care to the patients we serve,” says Dr. Jafar Golzarian of North Star Vascular and Interventional who was part of the first team in the United States to perform a PAE procedure.7 8 “This technology gives us real-time image guidance to deliver precise, targeted and more complete treatments for a wide range of complex diseases and conditions. As an interventionalist who performs a number of different procedures in my daily practice, including PAE, the system is incredibly flexible and provides a number of workflow efficiencies that can be personalized to address my specific needs and preferences around patient positioning and access to help achieve enhanced patient comfort, as well as improved clinical and operational outcomes in my practice.” GE HealthCare designed the Allia IGS Platform to provide workflow efficiency, functionality, and versatility that interventional radiologists require in order to meet the needs of their patients: “As a leader in the interventional space,” said Arnaud Marie – Global General Manager for Image Guiding Solutions at GE HealthCare, “these latest innovations show just what’s possible in the delivery of precision care and demonstrates our commitment to advancing the practice of image guided therapy with artificial intelligence and digitization for clinicians and their patients.” As part of this year’s showcase, GE HealthCare will be exhibiting the following medical devices and digital solutions at SIR 2024 (Booth 520): Image guiding solutions including the Allia IGS platform designed to be a trusted assistant for image guided therapies with features to enhance user experience and improve workflow integration and efficiency; and ASSIST solutions that leverage advanced digitization and AI to help clinicians precisely plan, guide and assess interventional procedures with greater precision and dose efficiency.

The European Commission is expected to make a decision in 1H 2024. The opinions are based on Phase 3 CLEAR Outcomes trial, showing a 13% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events. Positive Positive CHMP opinions for bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid / ezetimibe FDC. Recommendation for label updates to reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. European Commission decision expected in 1H 2024. Opinions based on Phase 3 CLEAR Outcomes trial with 13% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events. Support from Daiichi Sankyo and Esperion Therapeutics for improved cardiovascular care in Europe. Negative None. Cardiovascular Medical Expert The recommendation by the CHMP to expand the indications for bempedoic acid and its fixed dose combination with ezetimibe is a significant development in cardiovascular therapeutics. The focus on patients with established or high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) reflects a growing trend in personalized medicine, targeting those who are either statin-intolerant or have contraindications to statins.Bempedoic acid functions as an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, a different mechanism from statins, which inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. This offers an alternative pathway to reduce LDL-C, which is important for patients who cannot tolerate statins. The CLEAR Outcomes trial's results showing a 13% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-4) is noteworthy, as it provides evidence for bempedoic acid's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk beyond cholesterol management alone.While the potential benefits are clear, it's important to consider the safety profile. The drug's association with increased uric acid levels and risk of tendon rupture must be weighed against its cardiovascular benefits. Physicians should monitor patients for these adverse effects, particularly in those with a history of gout or tendon disorders. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The positive CHMP opinion is likely to influence Daiichi Sankyo and Esperion Therapeutics' market performance positively. The expanded indication could potentially increase the patient population eligible for treatment with bempedoic acid, thus broadening the market reach of NILEMDO® and NUSTENDI®. Considering the high prevalence of statin intolerance and the importance of managing LDL-C levels in cardiovascular risk reduction, there is a substantial market opportunity for these therapies.However, market uptake will depend on several factors, including reimbursement decisions, physician prescribing habits and competition from other lipid-lowering therapies. It's also worth noting that the European Commission's decision is expected in the first half of 2024, which means that any potential market impact won't be immediate. Companies and investors will be closely monitoring the EC's final decision as it will have direct implications for sales projections and market strategies. Healthcare Policy Expert The CHMP's endorsement for label expansion signifies a step forward in public health policy, particularly in the realm of preventive cardiovascular care. It underscores the importance of addressing the needs of patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events and who have limited treatment options due to statin intolerance.From a policy perspective, the availability of alternative treatments like bempedoic acid is instrumental in achieving broader public health goals, such as reducing the incidence of heart attacks and strokes. This aligns with healthcare systems' objectives to improve outcomes and reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. It will be important for healthcare systems to integrate these new treatment options into clinical guidelines and ensure that they are accessible to the appropriate patient populations. 03/22/2024 - 11:04 AM – Positive CHMP Opinions Are Based On The Analyses Of The Phase 3 Of The CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL)-Inhibiting Regimen) Outcomes Trial1 – – European Commission Decision On Label Update Authorization Applications Are Expected To Be Made In 1H 2024 – ANN ARBOR, Mich. and MUNICH, Germany, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH (hereafter, ‘Daiichi Sankyo’) and Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. jointly announced today, that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted positive opinions for the label update of both bempedoic acid (marketed as NILEMDO®▼) and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination (FDC) (marketed as NUSTENDI®▼ ), recommending their approval as treatments to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk.2 The existing label of bempedoic acid (NILEMDO®▼) provides authorisation for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet:2 in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or2alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated.2 The CHMP recommended adopting an update to this label, with which bempedoic acid is also indicated in adults with established or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:2 in patients on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without ezetimibe, or2alone or in combination with ezetimibe in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated.2 The existing label of bempedoic acid / ezetimibe FDC tablet (NUSTENDI®▼) provides authorisation of its use in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet:2 in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin in addition to ezetimibe2, oralone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, and are unable to reach LDL-C goals with ezetimibe alone2,in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as separate tablets with or without statin2. Additionally, the CHMP recommends an update of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe label to amend its indication in adults with established or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors2: in patients on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and not adequately controlled with additional ezetimibe treatment2 or,in patients who are either statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated, and not adequately controlled with ezetimibe treatment2 or ,in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as separate tablets2. “The positive CHMP opinion is a crucial milestone towards improved treatment outcomes, as we are now able to address even better the unmet needs of cardiovascular care and prevention among patients in Europe. This first-in-class medicine with proven efficacy in reducing hypercholesterolaemia and preventing cardiovascular risks, is a testament to our tireless efforts to help improve the cardiovascular treatment landscape. The opinion further reinforces our confidence towards continued commitment of supporting clinical communities and healthcare ecosystems across Europe,” said Oliver Appelhans, Head of Europe Specialty Division, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH. “We are thrilled with the positive CHMP opinion, which reflects the significant cardiovascular risk reduction benefit that the bempedoic acid global franchise brings to patients worldwide,” said Sheldon Koenig, President and CEO, Esperion. “This latest regulatory milestone further bolsters our efforts to work towards delivering innovative treatment options to manage cardiovascular risk for patients with elevated LDL-C.” The CHMP positive opinions are based on analysis from the Phase 3 CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ATP citrate lyase (ACL)-Inhibiting Regimen) Outcomes trial1. The study enrolled a total of 13,970 patients aged 18-85 years old, and took place at 1,250 sites in 32 countries, including 485 sites across Europe1. Results from the Phase 3 CLEAR Outcomes trial demonstrated: a 13% reduction in the relative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events defined as a four-component composite of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or coronary revascularisation (MACE-4)1.Results of the key secondary endpoints and subgroup analyses have been published1. The CHMP is a scientific committee of the EMA that reviews medical product applications on their scientific and clinical merit. The European Commission will review the CHMP opinions and is expected to deliver its final decision in the mid of the year 2024. INDICATIONNEXLETOL® (bempedoic acid) Tablet/NEXLIZET® (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL-C. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONNEXLIZET is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to ezetimibe tablets. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported with ezetimibe, a component of NEXLIZET. Hyperuricemia: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, may increase blood uric acid levels which may lead to gout. Hyperuricemia may occur early in treatment and persist throughout treatment, and may lead to the development of gout, especially in patients with a history of gout. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. Tendon Rupture: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, is associated with an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. Tendon rupture occurred within weeks to months of starting NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL. Tendon rupture may occur more frequently in patients over 60 years of age, patients taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, patients with renal failure, and patients with previous tendon disorders. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL at the first sign of tendon rupture. Avoid NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of bempedoic acid (a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL) in ≥2% of patients and greater than placebo, were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with ezetimibe (a component of NEXLIZET) and at an incidence greater than placebo in clinical trials were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis, pain in extremity fatigue, and influenza. In clinical trials of NEXLIZET, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and greater than placebo) observed that not observed in clinical trials of bempedoic acid or ezetimibe, were urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and constipation. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL when pregnancy is recognized unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breast-fed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL. Report pregnancies to the Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. Adverse Event reporting line at 1-833-377-7633.

The system provides improved visibility in all weather conditions, reduced blind spots, and enhanced night vision. The company's commitment to safety is evident through this milestone. Positive Adoption of cutting-edge MirrorEye® Camera Monitor System by Cargo Transporters, Inc. Enhanced road safety and operational efficiency with improved visibility and reduced blind spots Significant advancement in the company's commitment to safety and efficiency Positive driver feedback and reported improvements in situational awareness and comfort Negative None. Transportation Safety Expert The integration of the MirrorEye Camera Monitor System by Cargo Transporters signifies a notable step in the pursuit of heightened road safety within the trucking industry. The primary benefits of such a system include the potential to minimize vehicular accidents due to blind spots and poor visibility, factors that have been historical contributors to on-road incidents. From a safety perspective, the installation of this technology is anticipated to lower insurance claims and associated costs, which can be a substantial financial burden for transportation companies.Furthermore, the reduction in mirror size could lead to improved fuel efficiency due to decreased aerodynamic drag, although the extent of such savings would require empirical analysis over time. The long-term implications could be significant, potentially setting a new standard for safety equipment in commercial vehicles, which may influence regulatory requirements and competitive dynamics within the sector. Automotive Industry Analyst From an industry standpoint, Cargo Transporters' adoption of the MirrorEye system is an indicator of broader trends in the commercial vehicle market towards increased digitization and use of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). As other players observe the benefits accrued by early adopters, it is likely to spur further investments in similar technologies, thus expanding the market for suppliers like Stoneridge, Inc.This move could also be a strategic play by Cargo Transporters to enhance its competitive edge, potentially attracting more business through a reputation for safety and innovation. For Stoneridge, Inc., the partnership with Cargo Transporters serves as a valuable case study to demonstrate the efficacy of their product, potentially boosting sales and positively impacting stock performance if the tech becomes an industry standard. Financial Analyst For investors, the key interest lies in the financial implications of such an adoption. The initial cost of retrofitting existing vehicles and equipping new ones with the MirrorEye system may be substantial, but it should be weighed against the potential for reduced long-term operational costs and enhanced safety records. Improved safety can lead to lower insurance premiums and possibly a reduction in costly litigation from accidents.Additionally, if Cargo Transporters can leverage this technology to improve efficiency and safety, it may see a positive impact on its profit margins. Investors should keep an eye on the company's quarterly financial reports to gauge the return on investment from this technology integration, which could serve as a benchmark for similar investments in the sector. 03/22/2024 - 11:00 AM CLAREMONT, N.C., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cargo Transporters, Inc., a truckload, dry van carrier is proud to announce the adoption of Stoneridge, Inc.'s (NYSE: SRI) MirrorEye® Camera Monitor System (CMS), a cutting-edge system designed to provide the driver with a more complete view of operating conditions over traditional truck mirrors.

Provides Update on Germany's Cannabis Legalization Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Flora Growth Corp. (NASDAQ: FLGC) applauds Germany's upper house lawmakers for passing the recreational cannabis legalization bill, making Germany one of the most progressive countries in terms of cannabis laws. Flora's subsidiaries have been active in Germany since 2017, positioning the company well in this lucrative market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The legalization of recreational cannabis in Germany represents a pivotal shift not only in policy but also in the potential for market expansion for companies like Flora Growth Corp. With Germany set to become the largest federally legal recreational and medicinal cannabis market globally, this move could trigger a domino effect in the European Union, possibly leading to increased liberalization across the continent. The expansion of legal markets often correlates with increased investment and consumer spending in the sector.For Flora Growth Corp., which has established operations in Germany since 2017, this development could mean accelerated growth and market penetration. The company's early presence and experience in the German market could provide a competitive edge over late entrants. However, investors should monitor how Flora adapts to the new regulatory environment and whether it can scale operations to meet the anticipated surge in demand without compromising on product quality or operational efficiency. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the legalization in Germany may significantly impact Flora Growth Corp.'s revenue streams and profitability. The company's stock performance could see positive movement as the market anticipates the expansion of their consumer base. However, it is essential to consider the costs associated with scaling up operations, potential competition from both local and international players and the regulatory compliance costs.Investors should look at the company's balance sheets and cash flow statements in subsequent quarters post-legalization to assess the financial health and the effectiveness of their strategy in capitalizing on the new market opportunity. It's also prudent to consider the broader economic implications, such as how the influx of legal cannabis might affect pharmaceutical sales and alcohol and tobacco industries, potentially influencing market dynamics and Flora's strategic positioning. Legal Expert The legal landscape for cannabis is complex and constantly evolving. Germany's decision to legalize recreational cannabis use and cultivation will require companies like Flora Growth Corp. to navigate a new set of laws and regulations. Understanding these legal frameworks is essential for maintaining compliance and avoiding potential fines or legal challenges.Furthermore, the declassification of cannabis as a narcotic and the easing of prescription requirements could have broader legal implications, potentially affecting international treaties and trade agreements. Companies operating in this space will need to stay informed about these changes to adapt their business models accordingly.

(NASDAQ: FLGC) (""Flora"" or the ""Company""), a cannabis focused consumer-packaged goods leader and pharmaceutical distributor serving all 50 states and 28 countries with 20,000+ points of distribution around the world, commends Germany's upper house lawmakers for passing the recreational cannabis legalization bill, after it was approved by the lower house last month. The law is now expected to come into effect on April 1, 2024. The law cleared its final hurdle, making German laws on cannabis use among the most progressive in the world. Flora's wholly-owned subsidiaries have been active in Germany since 2017, obtained the first medical cannabis license in Germany and are responsible for selling the first gram of medical cannabis in the country. The law, initially passed on Germany's lower house and subsequently ratified by the upper house, legalizes cultivating up to three plants for private consumption, the possession of 50 grams of cannabis at one time at home, and 25 grams in public. Possession and cultivation are expected to be permitted by April 1, 2024, and not-for-profit social clubs to begin operation on July 1, 2024. The German parliament has also voted to declassify cannabis as a narcotic, ease narcotic prescription requirements and make patient access easier. The decision makes Germany the largest federally legal recreational and medicinal cannabis market in the world. ""We welcome Germany's definitive legalization of recreational cannabis. Our German business represents a significant component of Flora's global operations and a strategic growth market for the Company. We are excited about the potential of the new legislation on our company,"" said Clifford Starke, Chief Executive Officer.### About Flora Growth Corp.

""And we work with many organizations across our 15-state footprint to help address those needs. Frankly, we only have so much time and money to share. But at Regions we have an unlimited supply of knowledge, skill and experience.""And during times like this, with economic and market volatility, geopolitical and political uncertainty, operational challenges as well as labor market and workforce issues - we've found that technical support can be extremely beneficial to our community partners.""We see a lot of need in our communities. And we work with many organizations across our 15-state footprint to help address those needs.Leroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs at RegionsThe team put some of that know-how to work recently by hosting an Important Insights seminar at Regions Center in Birmingham, Alabama, for local community partners. Leaders from 25 organizations gathered for a half-day session to engage with Regions specialists on topics that are top of mind for nonprofits.Regions Chief Investment Officer Alan McKnight spoke to the group about the state of the economy, reporting that inflation is coming down, unemployment is staying relatively low and balance sheets are basically healthy. But he acknowledged that consumers are paying significantly more for food and those prices ""stay sticky.""McKnight also discussed increased housing costs and shortages. Like any business, those economic factors have a big impact on a nonprofit's funding and the needs of their clients.In this presidential election year, politics and legislative agendas are on the forefront for everyone, including community organizations. Jason Isbell, head of State Government Affairs and Economic Development at Regions, spoke to the group about current issues being debated, including economic development, education, workforce development, childcare, housing and healthcare.Workforce matters were a common thread with all the speakers and a topic that received a lot of engagement from the participants. Dwight Julbert, head of Human Resources Operations at Regions, led a panel of human resources specialists to discuss issues around many aspects of human capital management.""The topic of hiring, training, retaining, as well as managing performance of employees was especially relevant to me as a nonprofit director,"" said Jennifer Sumner, executive director of Pathways, an organization that serves homeless women and children.The meeting wrapped up with a cautionary presentation about about fraud - another subject that affects businesses large and small. According to Jeff Taylor, head of Commercial Fraud Forensics and Payment Strategy at Regions, fraud is a pervasive threat for individuals, families, governments and businesses. Nonprofits are particularly vulnerable due to ""limited resources for combating fraud and an unwavering focus on their mission to do good,"" Taylor said.Taylor spoke about the dangers of insider fraud, payment fraud, check fraud, ransomware and business email compromise. He shared tips and strategies to stop the bad guys, including a very simple reminder: Stop, Call and Confirm. Taylor advised the group, ""Before proceeding with a suspicious transaction, stop what you're doing, call a number you already know to verify the request and confirm with a person that the transaction is legit.""Wendi Boyen, Community Development Lending and Investment leader at Regions, organized the event, which expanded on a concept she put in place recently with Regions' support of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs).I feel that Regions did an excellent job addressing the issues that nonprofits face each day.Jennifer Sumner, executive director of PathwaysIn June, Boyen and Abrahams hosted a CDFI Convening where bank leaders engaged with CDFI and MDI executives on timely topics such as risk management, balance sheet management, economic and market conditions, consumer lending, deposit pricing, strategic planning, liquidity and technology.""We're pleased to provide financial support to all these organizations, but we're hearing from them that brainstorming with bankers and networking with each other can be just as helpful, if not more so, as they navigate challenging economic and operational issues,"" Boyen said.Based on their feedback, the participants of the Important Insights seminar agreed.""I feel that Regions did an excellent job addressing the issues that nonprofits face each day, from political impact to human relations, and the need to protect our organizations against the threats of accessing secure information that could impact lives,"" Sumner said.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 10:10 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2024 / Eaton: Karina Rigby, president, Critical Systems, Electrical Sector, EMEA, EatonData centers have an eco-unfriendly reputation, but they will actually be powerhouses for change in the race to a more sustainable future. Read on to see how they're helping to enable a new power paradigm built on clean energy-and how we're supporting them at Eaton.Written by Dr Karina Rigby, 03/04/2024Amid the push to net zero, data centers are coming under increasing scrutiny. With a reputation as energy devouring carbon culprits, these facilities are firmly in the sights of environmental groups and governments-but they actually have a vital role to play in the green revolution.The World Economic Forum suggests that around 60% of global gross domestic product is now somehow digital, putting data centers firmly at the heart of economic growth for the foreseeable future. As unstoppable digitalization accelerates worldwide, there are now as many data centers planned as already exist-and that's before powerful trends like artificial intelligence have fully impacted the market. Indeed, entire regions like the Middle East are beginning to refocus from an oil-based to a digital-based economy, which can only be a good thing.However, while data centers are vital to economic prosperity, they are also often regarded as digitalization's dirty secret. Headlines claiming data centers out-pollute airlines are easy to find, causing many leaders to worry about the dramatic rise in their numbers. But is this eco-unfriendly reputation fair?Accounting for about 1.5% of global energy consumption, data centers have long been striving to raise efficiency and reduce emissions. It's a testament to the success of these efforts that, as the IEA reports, data center emissions ""have grown only modestly despite rapidly growing demand for digital services"".From our customer conversations, sustainability is now one of the core imperatives for data center operators alongside speed and cost. We have a broad range of products and services that are supporting this push, for example optimizing energy efficiency or enabling local renewable generation.Emerging technology trends will only accelerate this process-for instance, switching to hydrogen rather than diesel for back up power, or enabling more efficient cooling. Over the coming years, these innovations will further drive down data center costs, energy consumption and carbon emissions.Yet, such greener operations are just the beginning of the data center sustainability journey. Our market position puts us in the ideal place to survey the energy ecosystem as a whole, and it's increasingly clear that a symbiotic relationship is emerging between data centers, utilities and grid operators that will be good for everyone.It's increasingly clear that a symbiotic relationship is emerging between data centers, utilities and grid operators that will be good for everyone.Karina Rigby, president, Critical Systems, Electrical Sector, EMEAThe rise of energy prosumersThe olden days of top-down power generation, transmission and distribution are gone. Grids are becoming extremely complex and now demand much more flexibility and intelligence. Electricity no longer just flows one-way to assets hanging on the grid, but back and forth in a much more decentralized ecosystem.As utilities bring more and more renewable generation online-potentially meeting around 60% of total European electricity demand by 2030-grid volatility is becoming a pressing issue. The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow, but expecting utilities or governments to build out huge amounts of back-up power generation to balance the grid isn't financially feasible, especially with energy demands rising fast as industry electrification and the electric vehicle revolution gather pace.The answer lies in greater demand-side flexibility driven by a new breed of energy prosumers-entities with the ability to generate and store power locally, then feed it back into the grid. Data centers are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, because each facility already has an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that ensures normal operations can continue in the event of an electricity outage. With the right infrastructure and intelligent management capabilities, these battery backup systems can return energy to the grid to help balance demand and enable vital flexibility for the renewable revolution.For utilities and grid operators, this two-way power flow with energy prosumers helps to address flexibility challenges while also providing a route to harness more renewables. Equally, data center operators, who already prioritize the best grid access, can monetize otherwise underused assets, create new revenue streams, and strengthen their net zero credentials.Awareness of this symbiotic win-win is growing fast. We're proud to be enabling customers from all sides to embrace it, helping energy consumers become energy prosumers through our medium and low voltage solutions, battery technology, digital grid balancing capabilities, consulting services, and more. For instance, we're already working with major hyperscale and colocation data center players to enable grid stabilization through their UPS systems with our EnergyAware solution.Expecting utilities or governments to build out huge amounts of back-up power generation to balance the grid isn't financially feasible.Karina Rigby, president, Critical Systems, Electrical Sector, EMEANurturing a new energy ecosystemFrom our conversations with customers and partners on the ground, it's clear that a combination of powerful trends is driving the development of a new energy ecosystem where data centers will play an important role.The rapid growth of digitalization, the energy transition to renewables, data center sustainability improvements, the rising complexity of grids, and the need for intelligent power management-all of these trends are moving at slightly different speeds, but they are all going in the same direction.The economic case is strong. The sustainability argument is compelling. And the necessary technologies are coming online. The key challenge is now one of culture. Grid operators and data center energy prosumers need to align in their thinking-and that is steadily happening with more and more organizations trying to understand how they can support a net-zero playing field.Government has an important role to play here in setting the right policy framework and financial incentives to drive cultural change. Demand-side players weren't previously involved in the grid, so policymakers need to incentivize data center operators to sell flexibility services. That means building the business case, clarifying the current rules, and making participation easier with advances like smart billing. Legislation like REPowerEU is a good step, helping different market players come together to fast forward the clean energy revolution.Now is the time for everyone in this ecosystem to move things forward by collaborating, breaking down siloes, learning, and sharing best practices. Most importantly, we need to advance the conversation about the environmental impact of data centers and shake off their high-carbon reputation. Data centers aren't holding back a sustainable future-in fact, they're helping us get there faster.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/eatonEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EatonView the original press release on accesswire.com How are data centers contributing to a more sustainable future according to Eaton's President, Karina Rigby?

Around 60% of global GDP is now digital, positioning data centers at the core of economic growth, especially with the ongoing digitalization worldwide.

Data centers are often criticized for their energy consumption and environmental impact, with claims of out-polluting airlines. How is the Middle East transitioning its economy according to the PR?

U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agrees that digital facial images may be used for age verification,2024-03-22T14:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Trust Stamp (Nasdaq: IDAI) receives positive legal validation for its AI-Powered Age Verification technology in Texas. The U.S. Court of Appeals approves the use of Trust Stamp's technology to meet age verification requirements for accessing pornography.,"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agrees that digital facial images may be used for age verification Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trust Stamp (Nasdaq: IDAI) receives positive legal validation for its AI-Powered Age Verification technology in Texas. The U.S. Court of Appeals approves the use of Trust Stamp's technology to meet age verification requirements for accessing pornography. Positive Trust Stamp's AI-Powered Age Verification technology is deemed commercially reasonable by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit under Texas law. The court ruling overturns an injunction on Texas House Bill 1181, allowing age verification for accessing pornography without violating the First Amendment. Biometric age estimation using facial images is considered acceptable under the legislation, with Trust Stamp's technology ensuring no storage of biometric data. The decision highlights the market potential and importance of AI-based age estimation services in various online and in-person scenarios. Trust Stamp anticipates a surge in compliance with the law, presenting significant opportunities for its privacy-focused technology. Negative None. Legal Expert The recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has significant implications for companies operating in the digital identity and age verification space. The ruling essentially validates the use of AI-powered technologies for age verification purposes under Texas law, which could set a precedent for other jurisdictions. The court's emphasis on the rational basis for age verification aligns with the government's interest in protecting minors and the acceptance of biometric age estimation tools like those offered by Trust Stamp indicates a growing legal acceptance of advanced technological solutions in regulatory frameworks.For stakeholders, this decision may lead to a surge in demand for Trust Stamp's services, particularly as non-compliance carries substantial penalties. However, it's important to monitor the balance between privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, as the adoption of such technologies could raise questions about data protection and the ethical use of biometric data, despite Trust Stamp's assurances of not storing biometric information. Market Research Analyst The endorsement of AI-powered age verification technology by a federal appeals court represents a potential catalyst for market growth in the digital identity sector. Trust Stamp's positioning as a provider of privacy-first identity solutions positions the company to capitalize on this regulatory tailwind. The market for online age verification is expanding, not only due to regulatory compliance but also as a value-added service for businesses seeking to protect their platforms from underage access.Investors should note that Trust Stamp's technology addresses a critical need for non-intrusive yet effective age verification, which could lead to partnerships or client acquisitions, particularly among websites that are now under pressure to comply with HB 1181. It's also worth considering the broader applications of such technology beyond the immediate context of the pornography industry, including online sales of age-restricted products and services, which could further drive the company's growth. Data Privacy Analyst The court's ruling underscores the growing importance of privacy in the digital age, especially when it comes to sensitive processes like age verification. Trust Stamp's claim that their AI-powered solution does not store biometric data could be a significant competitive advantage, as it addresses one of the main consumer concerns regarding biometric identification technologies. The ability to verify age without storing personal biometric data could become a key factor for companies when choosing an age verification provider.As the market for age verification technologies grows, Trust Stamp's approach may set a new standard for privacy preservation. It's important for investors to understand the potential impact of data privacy regulations on the adoption of these technologies and to assess Trust Stamp's capability to navigate the complex landscape of data protection laws while scaling their operations. 03/22/2024 - 10:00 AM A decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit applying Texas law agrees that commercially reasonable technologies for digital age verification, such as Trust Stamp's new AI-Powered Age Verification, may be used to satisfy Texas' age verification requirements for access to pornography.Atlanta, GA, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trust Stamp (Nasdaq: IDAI), the Privacy-First Identity CompanyTM: In a decision delivered on March 7th, 2023, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that imposing age verification for access to pornography does not violate the First Amendment, partially overturning an injunction placed on the Texas House Bill 1181 by a District court in August of 2023. The appeals court found that the appropriate standard for review should have been a rational-basis and that age verification requirements can rationally be considered part of the legitimate interest the government has in restricting minors from accessing pornography. The court also found that biometric age estimation based on a facial image is allowable under the legislation and does not present a greater privacy risk than in-person age verification. Trust Stamp President Andrew Gowasack commented, “This decision is a major affirmation of the urgent need and market potential for AI-based age estimation services. The Texas statute recognizes the risk of personal information being stored in potentially insecure environments and with Trust Stamp’s age estimation technology, no biometric data is ever stored. HB 1181 imposes substantial penalties on non-compliant sites and we believe that there will now be a rush to comply with the law. That aside, there are countless online and in-person use cases for age estimation services both to limit access by minors and to protect sites designed for use by minors from misuse by adults, and we believe that they all create substantial opportunities for our privacy-protecting AI-Powered solution.” Enquiries: Trust Stamp Andrew Gowasack, President: agowasack@truststamp.ai Investors: shareholders@truststamp.ai About Trust Stamp Trust Stamp the Privacy-First Identity CompanyTM, is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors, including banking and finance, regulatory compliance, government, real estate, communications, and humanitarian services.

(""BlackStar"") (OTC PINK:BEGI) BlackStar received a ‘Notice of Allowance' from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), for a patent application titled ""System and Method for Preparing for a SEC Financial Statement Audit by Recording Corporate Governance Information on an Immutable Blockchain."" The technology claimed in the patent, which generally relates to recording corporate governance information on a blockchain, helps with the organization of public and private companies preparing for a financial audit, assists with compliance with rules and regulations of various regulatory authorities (e.g. Securities and Exchange Commission) and is compatible with use through any U.S. brokerage firm. The audit platform, which is nearing completion of the development phase, may become a catalyst in the transparency of internal corporate governance and controls, contributing to the corporate accountability movement.When asked for comment, BlackStar's CEO Joseph E Kurczodyna said, ""We are elated to hear the company will be receiving this patent. Our first blockchain trading patent was issued in late 2023 and now our corporate governance blockchain-related patent is expected to officially be issued by the USPTO in May of 2024; these pieces of intellectual property will become an integral part of BlackStar's business model.""""This year, we look forward to releasing the audit platform on a blockchain for subscription to exchange-listed Nasdaq and OTC public companies, with later integration of our revolutionized blockchain trading of digital securities,"" states Mr. Kurczodyna.When the audit platform was first conceptualized in 2018 by the Company's CEO, he felt it could be a white-label process for all organizations with government contracts, individuals, new corporations, and elected government employers, all of whom solicit money from the public. BlackStar's Corporate Governance Blockchain could enable a risk-based regulation approach in the U.S. securities market in transition from the rule-based regime embedded in the Securities Act 1934. The elements of a risk-based approach entail the evaluation of how companies identify, measure, control, and monitor diverse types of risk. Regulators with immutable blockchain technology could focus resources on entities that pose a higher risk. Mr. Kurczodyna looks forward to the evolution of securities regulations and hopes that BlackStar's Corporate Governance Blockchain plays a role in any changes.Other Info:BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc.

(LUMN) successfully completes transactions under the amended TSA, reducing debt maturities and strengthening liquidity. The Company achieved significant creditor participation, signaling confidence in its turnaround plan and growth strategy. The completion of the TSA transactions enhances Lumen's financial flexibility and positions it for future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Lumen Technologies' restructuring of its debt through the TSA transactions indicates a proactive approach to managing its balance sheet. The high participation rates in the term loan transactions reflect a strong creditor endorsement, which often correlates with improved investor sentiment and could potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating. The reduction in near-term debt maturities from $2.1 billion to $600 million for 2025-2026 and from $9.5 billion to $800 million for 2027, considerably alleviates short-term liquidity pressures. This strategic move provides Lumen with a more manageable debt profile, allowing for operational flexibility and the opportunity to invest in growth initiatives.However, the issuance of $1.325 billion in senior secured notes, while bolstering liquidity, adds to long-term obligations and could be a concern if the company's turnaround plan does not yield the expected results. The new revolving credit facility further enhances liquidity but must be monitored for its potential impact on the company's leverage ratios. Investors should consider the implications of these financial maneuvers on the company's future interest expenses and overall financial health. Market Research Analyst The digital solutions sector is fiercely competitive and Lumen's pivot to a growth strategy is critical in maintaining its market position. Lumen's successful restructuring efforts may signal to competitors and customers alike that the company is stabilizing and preparing for aggressive market re-entry. The confidence expressed by creditors could serve as a positive signal to the market, potentially impacting Lumen's stock performance as investors react to the news of improved financial flexibility.However, it is important to monitor the company's execution of its business transformation plans. The success of these plans is essential for long-term sustainability and will determine the effectiveness of the debt restructuring in the context of business growth. Market analysts should track Lumen's operational metrics and market share post-restructuring to gauge the true impact of these financial changes on the company's competitive stance. Economist The restructuring of debt by Lumen Technologies can be seen as a microcosmic reflection of broader economic trends, where companies are seeking to optimize their capital structures amid fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty. The reduction in near-term debt maturities can be economically advantageous, as it may reduce the risk of default during uncertain economic times and provide a buffer to withstand potential market downturns.Furthermore, the shift in the company's debt maturity profile could indicate a strategic anticipation of future economic conditions, potentially allowing Lumen to capitalize on lower interest rates before any anticipated hikes. From an economic standpoint, the company's ability to secure such a substantial commitment from creditors suggests a level of confidence in the firm's fundamentals and the broader industry's growth prospects. Economists would be interested in evaluating the potential ripple effects of Lumen's strengthened liquidity position on its investment in innovation and employment within the tech sector. 03/22/2024 - 09:29 AM Moves Forward as a Stronger Company with Increased Financial Flexibility Primed to Execute on Business Transformation Plans DENVER, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LUMN) (""Lumen"" or the ""Company""), a global integrated network solutions provider that unleashes the world's digital potential, today announced the successful completion of the transactions contemplated by the previously announced amended and restated transaction support agreement (the ""TSA"") that the Company, Level 3 Financing, Inc. (""Level 3"") and Qwest Corporation entered into with certain of the Company's creditors. Lumen achieved participation in the TSA transactions of over $15 billion of outstanding indebtedness and commitments of the Company and its subsidiaries. With respect to the term loan transactions open to all lenders, the Company achieved 94.4% participation for the Lumen TLA/A-1 term loans, 98.5% for the Lumen TLB term loans and 99.5% for the Level 3 TLB term loans. The broad support for the TSA transactions across the Company's capital structure demonstrates creditors' and stakeholders' belief in Lumen's turnaround plan and pivot to growth strategy. Following the closing of the TSA transactions, Lumen is in a strengthened liquidity position, including as a result of closing a new approximately $1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2028 and completing the private placement of $1.325 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due November 2029. ""This is a significant milestone that clears the runway for our transformation and signals confidence in our strategy and progress,"" said Kate Johnson, president and CEO of Lumen. ""The transaction provides the time and capital to fuel our return to growth."" ""This process over the last several months could not have been possible without the support of many stakeholders. We sincerely thank the Lumen team for their dedication and continued commitment to the Company during this process,"" said Chris Stansbury, Chief Financial Officer of Lumen. ""We also thank our customers, vendors and partners for their unwavering trust in the business and our future."" Debt Maturity Profile Following Consummation of TSA TransactionsLumen's near-term debt maturity profile has significantly improved, with the amount of maturities outstanding for 2025 to 2026 reduced from approximately $2.1 billion to approximately $600 million and total maturities outstanding for 2027 reduced from approximately $9.5 billion to approximately $800 million. Following the completion of the TSA transactions, the debt maturity profile of the Company and its subsidiaries will be as follows: Additional information can be found in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC.

The company aims to attract an oncology R&D partner leveraging its SORT1+ Technology platform. Theratechnologies also shared preclinical data at the AACR annual meeting and initiated the next cohort of patients in the Phase 1 trial. The restructuring will incur cash and non-cash charges to optimize the organizational cost structure. Positive None. Negative The restructuring charges of approximately $625,000 in cash and $770,000 in non-cash charges may impact the company's financials negatively in the short term. Biopharmaceutical Industry Analyst The decision by Theratechnologies to scale back preclinical oncology research signifies a strategic pivot towards commercialization, particularly in the advancement of its Phase 1 clinical trial for sudocetaxel zendusortide in advanced ovarian cancer. This move likely reflects an assessment of the resource allocation that prioritizes near-term revenue generation over longer-term research endeavors. The biopharmaceutical industry often faces such crossroads, where the balance between R&D investment and the pursuit of commercial success must be carefully managed.By seeking R&D partners, Theratechnologies aims to mitigate the financial risks associated with drug development while potentially accelerating the commercialization process through strategic collaborations. This could be an attractive proposition for investors, as it may improve the company's financial health and focus resources on areas with a clearer path to market. However, it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of their innovation pipeline and dependence on external partnerships for future R&D. Financial Analyst The projected restructuring charge, including both cash and non-cash components, is a critical financial consideration. The anticipated $625,000 in cash charges and $770,000 in non-cash charges will have a tangible impact on the company's short-term financial statements. Investors should note that while these charges are designed to streamline operations and potentially lead to positive Adjusted EBITDA, they also represent a reallocation of resources that could affect the company's liquidity and cash flow in the immediate future.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS measure, excludes items considered non-recurring or non-operational in nature and its improvement is often viewed favorably as an indicator of operational efficiency and profitability. However, stakeholders should approach such non-IFRS measures with caution, as they do not always provide a complete picture of a company's financial health and the impact of such restructuring on the company's long-term profitability remains to be seen. Oncology Clinical Research Analyst The emphasis on the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of sudocetaxel zendusortide represents a significant milestone for Theratechnologies. The peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) being trialed is part of a new wave of targeted therapies that aim to deliver cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells, potentially reducing side effects and improving efficacy. The progression to higher dosing cohorts and expanded recruitment are positive indicators of the trial's momentum.However, the phasing down of preclinical research activities could be a double-edged sword. While it may help concentrate resources on immediate clinical goals, it also suggests a narrowing of the company's research scope, which may limit future drug candidates in the pipeline. For stakeholders, the success of current clinical trials becomes even more critical, as the company's prospects may become closely tied to the outcomes of these trials. 03/22/2024 - 09:36 AM Company continues to shift to commercial focus as it seeks partners to advance R&D MONTREAL, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, today announced that it will phase down its preclinical oncology research activities. The Company will continue to prioritize its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of sudocetaxel zendusortide (TH1902), a novel peptide-drug conjugate (PDC), in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. All figures below are in U.S. dollars. “I am very proud of our exceptional research team, whose work has contributed greatly to the scientific discourse and understanding of advanced cancers,” said Paul Lévesque, President and CEO at Theratechnologies. “Our investment in the SORT1+ Technology™ platform over the past five years has generated important evidence on multiple peptide-drug conjugates with different payloads. Now that we have significantly advanced our preclinical program, we are well-positioned to leverage this wealth of data and insights to attract an oncology R&D partner.” The Company will continue to share accumulated preclinical data, including the presentation of two separate posters at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting, to be held April 5-9 in San Diego, Calif., one of which features data from new PDCs. Theratechnologies recently announced the initiation of the next cohort of patients in Part 3 of its Phase 1 trial of sudocetaxel zendusortide, in which the first patient has already received treatment at a higher dose. Recruitment has been ramped up at the six trial sites across North America. To date, more than 40 individuals with various types of cancer have been treated with sudocetaxel zendusortide. The phasing down of research activities is aligned with the Company’s focus on its commercial business and will further optimize its organizational cost structure, pursuant to the goal of generating positive Adjusted EBITDAi. These changes are expected to result in a restructuring charge of approximately $625,000 in cash charges related to severance and other expenses and approximately $770,000 in non-cash charges. The company anticipates all charges to be fully taken during 2024. ___________________ i Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS Measure About Sudocetaxel Zendusortide (TH1902) and SORT1+ Technology™ Sudocetaxel zendusortide is a first-of-its-kind sortilin receptor (SORT1)-targeting PDC, and the first compound to emerge from the Company’s broader licensed oncology platform. A new chemical entity, sudocetaxel zendusortide employs a cleavable linker to conjugate (attach) a proprietary peptide to docetaxel, a well-established cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many cancers. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to sudocetaxel zendusortide as a single agent for the treatment of all sortilin-positive recurrent advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy. Sudocetaxel zendusortide is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Theratechnologies has established the SORT1+ TechnologyTM platform as an engine for the development of PDCs that target SORT1, which is expressed in multiple tumor types. SORT1 is a “scavenger” receptor that plays a significant role in protein internalization, sorting, and trafficking. Expression of SORT1 is associated with aggressive disease, poor prognosis, and decreased survival. It is estimated that SORT1 is expressed in 40% to 90% of endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, triple-negative breast (TNBC), and pancreatic cancers, making this receptor an attractive target for anticancer drug development.

The transaction's success hinges on several factors, including regulatory clearance and shareholder approval, but it also signals potential for enhanced operational efficiency and cost savings, particularly with Revelyst's GEAR Up program targeting $100 million in savings by 2027. Investors should monitor the upcoming special meeting outcomes and subsequent financial performance indicators to assess the transaction's impact on Vista Outdoor's market position and shareholder returns. Market Research Analyst The proposed sale of The Kinetic Group to CSG represents a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the ammunition and outdoor sports industries. By divesting non-core assets, Vista Outdoor can potentially allocate resources more effectively and sharpen its strategic focus. The mention of a 'brand-led consumer obsessed and maker-fueled culture' suggests an emphasis on brand equity and innovation, which could resonate with consumers and drive market share. Additionally, the alignment with CSG's global presence may offer The Kinetic Group expanded distribution networks and enhanced market penetration. Stakeholders should consider the long-term market dynamics and competitive advantages that may arise from this realignment. Legal Expert The SEC's approval of the S-4 registration is a legal prerequisite for the transaction, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance. However, the deal's finalization is contingent upon further regulatory approvals, including CFIUS clearance, which assesses the national security implications of foreign investments. The successful navigation of this complex regulatory environment is important for the deal's completion. Investors should remain aware of the legal intricacies that could affect the timeline and viability of the transaction, including potential antitrust considerations and international investment regulations that can influence the strategic direction of both Vista Outdoor and The Kinetic Group post-transaction. 03/22/2024 - 09:26 AM The SEC has declared effective Revelyst’s registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with Vista Outdoor’s sale of The Kinetic Group business to Czechoslovak Group Transaction will unlock stockholder value and support long-term growth of Revelyst and The Kinetic Group Vista Outdoor to hold a special meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the transaction on May 16, 2024 ANOKA, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vista Outdoor Inc. (“Vista Outdoor”) (NYSE: VSTO) announced today that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has declared effective the registration statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) filed by its subsidiary Revelyst, Inc. (“Revelyst”), in connection with the proposed acquisition by Czechoslovak Group a.s. (“CSG”) of Vista Outdoor’s The Kinetic Group business (the “Transaction”). The announcement is a key achievement in Vista Outdoor’s strategic plan to unlock value by separating its Revelyst and The Kinetic Group segments into separate companies. “We are excited to reach this important milestone as we position The Kinetic Group and Revelyst for long-term success,” said Michael Callahan, Chairman of the Vista Outdoor Board of Directors. “We believe the proposed sale provides is the best strategic alternative to maximize value for stockholders. Callahan continued, “The Board remains steadfast in our support for the proposed transaction and the value it will create for our stockholders. CSG’s ownership of our American-based ammunition brands will provide the communities where our plants are located and our 4,000 workers here in the United States and The Kinetic Group’s experienced US-based executive management team with a steady, long-term owner that is fully committed to investing in the American workforce, American hunters and domestic and allied military and law enforcement partners. On the Revelyst side, with an energized senior management team, the GEAR Up transformation plan ensures that the segment is well-positioned to thrive as a standalone public company and deliver greater value for our stockholders. “Our teams have dedicated significant time and energy preparing to transform Revelyst into a standalone publicly traded company, and we are excited for our brands, our employees and our stockholders to realize the benefits,” said Eric Nyman, CEO of Revelyst. “We have a clear line of sight to a solid foundation through the GEAR Up transformation program, which is expected to drive $100 million of run rate cost savings by fiscal year 2027. As we look ahead to Revelyst being a standalone company post-separation, our brand-led consumer obsessed and maker-fueled culture is coming into shape. We are positioned well with winning brands, an efficient structure, a strong balance sheet post-separation and the right people to drive stockholder value.” Vista Outdoor also announced today that it has established the record date and meeting date for the special meeting of its stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to approve the Transaction. The Special Meeting will be held virtually on May 16, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Vista Outdoor’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2024, will be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC and the scheduling of the Special Meeting build on the progress made with respect to completing the Transaction. On December 11, 2023, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or the HSR Act, expired. On January 5, 2024, the UK Investment Security Unit approved the Transaction under the United Kingdom National Security and Investment Act of 2021. CSG and Vista Outdoor have filed a joint voluntary notice with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, with respect to the Transaction, and the teams continue to work with CFIUS to obtain its clearance. “Revelyst’s registration statement being declared effective by the SEC moves The Kinetic Group one step closer to beginning our new chapter as part of CSG, which solidifies our strategic direction and will underpin investments in our employees, brands and local communities,” said Jason Vanderbrink, CEO of The Kinetic Group. “CSG is a strategic, long-term owner that is fully committed to our iconic American brands, our hunting and recreational shooting heritage and supporting our American and allied law enforcement and military partners. They are a highly successful global company with experience in our industry and are uniquely positioned to create and enhance American jobs by expanding our domestic production capabilities and global distribution network. We are excited for the opportunities that the CSG transaction will bring to our company and employees.” The Transaction remains subject to receipt of the remaining required regulatory approvals, the approval of Vista Outdoor’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

Jensen leads the RFA process for a gaming license in Downstate New York. Positive None. Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 09:15 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2024 / Las Vegas SandsLas Vegas SandsAs part of Women's History Month 2024, Sands is featuring women who help drive the company's success and exemplify its culture of professional growth and advancement. Lipika Jensen is vice president of predevelopment and currently leading the request for application (RFA) process for Sands' goal to win a Downstate New York gaming license and build its next world-class integrated resort on Long Island, New York.Tell us about your career path and current role with Sands.""My bachelor's degree is in mathematics and economics, but I always wanted to be an architect because I like the idea of having a vision and seeing it become something tangible. I earned my master's degree in architecture and worked at various architecture firms for about 13 years in Atlanta and New York, focusing primarily on hospitality projects. My career eventually took me to Las Vegas where I started working on Sands projects starting in 2008, and I was part of the design team for The Parisian Macao.""While working on the Parisian Macao as an architect, I was offered a job at Sands in 2013. I started in a design and planning role, but then shifted to predevelopment, business development and analysis. This role brought me back to where I started out, studying math and economics, and I've always found those topics interesting. So, shifting to predevelopment was really coming full circle for me.""In my current role, my focus is on business opportunities in new and existing markets, which includes market analysis, due diligence, research and planning for other developmental aspects, such as real estate and construction, to assess the new markets and their potential. I was involved in the transformation of the Sands Cotai Central to The Londoner Macao, which was a repositioning of an existing asset.""Now, I'm coordinating the comprehensive facets of our Downstate New York RFA process. I'm working with leaders in all areas of our business to develop and execute our approach and response to the RFA, which has been a tremendous opportunity to gain understanding of the sides of business that I had not previously been exposed to. These are the types of projects that challenge you and they are definitely ones to strive for in your career.""What skills, trainings, mentors or experiences have helped you build a successful career?""The first thing that comes to mind is hard work. I was 19 when I left Nepal, and when I came to the United States for higher education, I didn't have family nearby. The one thing I knew I could do was work hard, first in school and then in the workplace. So, I would say it's important to have a dream, have the drive, work hard, always be curious and always be learning. The drive to strive and thrive is important.""Having mentors is also critical. I was very fortunate - when I finished my bachelor's degree, I met a woman who had followed a similar education and career as me. She was very supportive and showed me the path forward. She helped me get my first internship and provided me with guidance as I was switching to architecture. Seeing her do what I was trying to do and her being successful in this path was very inspirational. She was a mentor and a role model.""At Sands, I have had the opportunity to work under great leaders, and I still think of them at times when I run into challenging situations. I draw on how they would tackle them. Having a role model in your supervisor is another great opportunity - it's important to have people around you who are strong leaders, because you can learn from them just by watching. I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by people who I could learn from and emulate.""What are your ideas for evolving the workplace to better support and empower women?""Having what I had - role models both within and outside of your company - is helpful for anyone, not just women. I really do believe that when you see someone like you achieving and advancing, it gives you the confidence that you can do it too.""Having women as role models is so important, and that's why I think EmpowHER, our Team Member resource group for women, is so powerful. We get to hear from women leaders, and that normalizes women in leadership roles. Also, the mentoring through EmpowHER and mentorship in general is critical - we can help women rise in their careers by boosting their confidence and creating an inclusive environment that's free from biases.""What advice do you have for women or anyone who wants to advance in their careers?""I would say be yourself. You have to find what works for you, within who you are, and be objective about who you are. Be the best at what you do and strive for excellence. Be curious and learn more skills. These concepts are important for anyone, not just women.""But for women specifically, we need to remind ourselves to be confident. Believe in yourself and your abilities and be confident in yourself.""While working hard is important, you need to be strategic about what you want. Working hard is not enough; you need to have a plan for where you want your career to go and how you're going to get there. It's your roadmap - you can adjust if you need to, but it keeps you on track.""Finally, work-life balance is important for women, so focus on balance and not giving up too much in either area - your career or your personal life.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Las Vegas Sands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Las Vegas SandsWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/las-vegas-sandsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Las Vegas SandsView the original press release on accesswire.com Who is featured in Las Vegas Sands' Women's History Month 2024 celebration?

Non-IFRS Measures and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures The information presented includes certain financial measures such as ""EBITDA"" (see below for definition), which are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation.

Total occupancy was 77%, with positive financial highlights in rental revenues but a decrease in net operating income.

Net income attributable to common shares decreased by $45.6 million. Decrease in gain on sale or write down of assets. Increase in property operating and depreciation expenses. Increase in general administrative and advisory expenses. Real Estate Investment Analyst The reported net loss of $2.1 million by American Realty Investors, Inc. for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, marks a significant shift from the net income of $43.4 million in the same period the previous year. This reversal from profit to loss is a red flag for investors, particularly given the substantial decrease in gain on sale, remeasurement, or write down of assets. The real estate market is known for its cyclical nature and such downturns in profitability can be indicative of broader market trends or company-specific issues.Another point of interest is the occupancy rates, with multifamily properties performing well at 92%, while commercial properties lag at 49%. This disparity may reflect changing market dynamics, such as a trend towards remote working impacting commercial real estate demand. The construction loans for new multifamily properties in Texas suggest a strategic focus on residential real estate, which may be an attempt to capitalize on a more stable demand compared to commercial spaces.Investors would also note the increase in property operating and depreciation expenses alongside general administrative and advisory expenses. These rising costs could be squeezing the company's margins, which is concerning when paired with a decrease in net operating income. It's essential to monitor these trends to understand whether they are temporary fluctuations or signs of a more persistent issue. Financial Analyst The decrease in net income for American Realty Investors, Inc. is primarily attributed to a significant decrease in gain on sale, remeasurement, or write down of assets, which is a stark contrast to the previous year's performance. The financial health of a company is often reflected in its ability to maintain or increase its net income and such a drastic decrease could potentially impact the company's stock price and investor confidence.The extension of the maturity of the loan on Windmill Farms with a 7.50% interest rate is another critical aspect. This extension could be seen as a strategic move to manage cash flow and debt obligations more effectively. However, the interest rate is relatively high, which could lead to increased financial burden over time.From an investment perspective, the increased rental revenues are a positive sign, indicating potential growth areas for the company. However, the increase is modest compared to the overall decrease in net operating income, which suggests that the company may need to further optimize its operations and cost management strategies to improve its financial standing in the long term. Market Research Analyst The real estate sector is heavily influenced by economic conditions, interest rates and consumer behavior. The report from American Realty Investors, Inc. provides valuable insights into the current state of the market. The contrast between occupancy rates in multifamily and commercial properties could indicate a shift in the real estate market, where residential demand remains robust while commercial spaces face challenges.Understanding the underlying factors that contribute to these occupancy rates is important for predicting future market trends. For instance, the high occupancy in multifamily units could be driven by demographic shifts or housing shortages in certain regions. Conversely, the low occupancy in commercial properties might be a result of ongoing changes in the workplace, such as the rise of remote work and e-commerce, which reduce the need for physical office and retail spaces.These trends have significant implications for real estate investment strategies. Investors and stakeholders should pay close attention to how American Realty Investors, Inc. navigates these market shifts and whether their focus on developing new multifamily properties aligns with long-term market demands. 03/22/2024 - 09:11 AM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE:ARL) is reporting its results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we reported net loss attributable to common shares of $2.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shares of $43.4 million or $2.69 per diluted share for the same period in 2022. Financial Highlights Total occupancy was 77% at December 31, 2023, which includes 92% at our multifamily properties and 49% at our commercial properties. On November 6, 2023, we entered into a $25.4 million construction loan to construct a 216 unit multifamily property in McKinney, Texas (""Merano"") that bears interest at prime plus 0.25% and matures on November 6, 2028. Merano is expected to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately $51.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred a total of $7.2 million in development costs. On December 15, 2023, we entered into a $23.5 million construction loan to construct a 216 unit multifamily property in Temple, Texas (""Bandera Ridge"") that bears interest at SOFR plus 3% and matures on December 15, 2028. Bandera Ridge is expected to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately $49.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred a total of $3.1 million in development costs. On February 8, 2024, we extended the maturity of our loan on Windmill Farms to February 28, 2026 at an interest rate of 7.50%. Financial Results Rental revenues increased $1.0 million from $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to $12.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in rental revenue is primarily due to a $0.9 million increase at our multifamily properties and an increase of $0.1 million from the commercial properties. The increase in revenue from the multifamily properties is primarily due to the acquisition of the VAA Holdback Portfolio in 2022. Net operating income decreased $3.6 million from net operating income of $1.4 million for three months ended December 31, 2022 to net operating loss of $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net operating income is primarily due to an increase of $2.7 million in property operating and depreciation expenses and an increase of $1.7 million in general administrative and advisory expenses offset in part by the $1.0 million increase in rental revenue as noted above. Net income attributable to common shares decreased $45.6 million from net income of $43.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to a net loss of $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to the $72.6 million decrease in gain on sale, remeasurement or write down of assets offset in part by a $17.5 million decrease in tax provision. The decrease in gain on our sale or write down of assets and tax provision is due to the remeasurement of the VAA Holdback Portfolio that was acquired in 2022. About American Realty Investors, Inc.

The transaction reduces Gilead's 2024 EPS by approximately $3.10 - $3.20 due to acquisition costs and operating expenses. Positive Gilead acquires CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. for $4.3 billion in total equity value. The acquisition includes CymaBay's lead product candidate, seladelpar, for treating primary biliary cholangitis. The transaction aligns with Gilead's commitment to developing innovative therapies for liver diseases. The merger agreement involved a tender offer of $32.50 per share for all outstanding shares of CymaBay. Gilead successfully completed the tender offer, acquiring approximately 77.3% of CymaBay's outstanding shares. CymaBay has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead, leading to the delisting of its common stock from Nasdaq. The acquisition is expected to reduce Gilead's GAAP and non-GAAP 2024 EPS by $3.10 - $3.20 due to associated costs. Seladelpar is still an investigational product with no approved use globally, and its safety and efficacy are yet to be established. Negative The acquisition will reduce Gilead's 2024 EPS by approximately $3.35 - $3.45 compared to the previous guidance shared. Seladelpar's safety and efficacy are not confirmed, posing a risk until further clinical data is available. Financial Analyst The acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics by Gilead Sciences represents a strategic consolidation in the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly in the liver disease treatment sector. From a financial perspective, the transaction's size, at approximately $4.3 billion, is significant and reflects Gilead's investment in expanding its portfolio in liver diseases. The tender offer price of $32.50 per share needs to be contextualized against CymaBay's pre-acquisition stock performance and the premium Gilead is willing to pay to acquire a company with a promising lead product candidate, seladelpar. Investors should note the immediate impact on Gilead's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, which is projected to decrease by $3.10 to $3.45 for the fiscal year 2024.It is important for investors to consider the long-term revenue potential of seladelpar against the short-term earnings dilution. The acquisition's success hinges on the clinical and commercial performance of seladelpar, which, if approved, could offer a new treatment option for primary biliary cholangitis. The market's response to the acquisition will be influenced by the perceived value of seladelpar and Gilead's ability to integrate CymaBay's assets effectively. Additionally, the removal of CymaBay's shares from Nasdaq trading eliminates a potential investment target, consolidating market opportunities within Gilead's stock. Medical Research Analyst Seladelpar's role as a potential treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a key factor in the acquisition's potential impact on Gilead's business. PBC is a chronic liver disease and the addition of seladelpar could strengthen Gilead's position as a leader in liver therapeutics. The drug's mechanism of action, as well as its efficacy and safety profile, will be under intense scrutiny as it progresses through clinical trials. The market for PBC treatments is competitive and seladelpar's success will depend on its differentiation from existing therapies and its ability to address unmet medical needs, such as pruritus associated with PBC.It is also important to understand the regulatory hurdles that seladelpar must clear before reaching the market. The drug's approval process will involve rigorous assessment by health authorities and any setbacks could affect Gilead's projected timelines and financial outcomes. The therapeutic's value proposition, in terms of patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness, will be critical in securing payer coverage and achieving market penetration. Stakeholders should monitor the clinical development milestones and regulatory decisions to gauge the acquisition's long-term impact on Gilead's business. Healthcare Economist The acquisition of CymaBay by Gilead Sciences can be examined through the lens of healthcare economics, specifically the cost-benefit analysis of developing treatments for challenging liver diseases like PBC. The financial outlay for the acquisition and the subsequent R&D investment in seladelpar must be weighed against the potential market size for PBC treatments and the healthcare cost savings associated with effective management of the disease. The pricing strategy for seladelpar, should it gain approval, will be influenced by factors such as the cost of alternative treatments, the economic burden of PBC and the willingness-to-pay of healthcare systems for an innovative therapy.Moreover, the acquisition may have implications for competitive dynamics in the liver disease market, potentially influencing drug pricing and access. If seladelpar proves to be a superior treatment option, it could shift the standard of care and exert pricing pressure on competitors. Conversely, the increased concentration in the market could raise antitrust concerns and necessitate regulatory scrutiny. The broader economic impact of the acquisition, including its effect on healthcare expenditure and patient access to novel therapies, will unfold as seladelpar advances through the development pipeline. 03/22/2024 - 09:18 AM Acquisition Reinforces Gilead’s Leadership in Developing Innovative Therapies For Challenging Liver Diseases FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced the completion of the previously announced transaction to acquire CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBAY) for approximately $4.3 billion in total equity value. The addition of CymaBay’s investigational lead product candidate, seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) including pruritus, complements Gilead’s existing liver portfolio and aligns with its long-standing commitment to bringing transformational medicines to patients. “The acquisition of CymaBay brings us a potential best in disease therapy that could transform the treatment landscape for people with primary biliary cholangitis,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “I want to thank the CymaBay team for their efforts and commitment to addressing this high unmet need. We look forward to advancing seladelpar and building on Gilead’s more than 20-year legacy of treating and curing liver disease on a global scale.” On February 12, 2024, Gilead and CymaBay announced that CymaBay, Gilead and Pacific Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead (“Purchaser”), had signed a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which a tender offer would be made. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Gilead and Purchaser commenced a tender offer on February 23, 2024, to acquire all outstanding shares of CymaBay at a price of $32.50 per share. On March 22, 2024, Gilead successfully completed the tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of CymaBay and accepted for payment all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration time of the tender offer, and Gilead will promptly pay for such shares, which shares represented approximately 77.3% of CymaBay’s outstanding shares (not including 5,095,996 shares delivered through Notices of Guaranteed Delivery, representing approximately 4.2% of the shares outstanding). Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Purchaser merged with and into CymaBay on March 22, 2024. All outstanding shares of common stock of CymaBay, other than (i) shares owned by Gilead, Purchaser or any of Gilead’s direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (ii) shares owned by CymaBay, (iii) shares irrevocably accepted by Purchaser for purchase pursuant to the tender offer and (iv) shares held by CymaBay stockholders who properly demand appraisal for their shares under Delaware law, were cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash equal to the $32.50 price per share. As a result of the completion of the merger, CymaBay has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead and the common stock of CymaBay will no longer be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is expected to take effect as of the close of market on March 22, 2024. This transaction is expected to be accounted for as an asset acquisition and reduce Gilead’s GAAP and non-GAAP 2024 EPS by approximately $3.10 - $3.20. Reflecting acquisition costs, associated operating expenses and lower interest income, we expect this transaction to reduce Gilead’s GAAP and non-GAAP 2024 EPS by approximately $3.35 - $3.45 relative to the full year 2024 guidance shared on February 6, 2024. Seladelpar is an investigational product that has not been approved for use anywhere globally, and its safety and efficacy have not been established.

The school serves more than 330 students in the nearby village of Gummipoondi, which has a population of more than 2,000 people. The new water filtration system can produce 1,000 liters of clean drinking water per hour and doubles as a handwashing station for students, caregivers and family members.""Most of our students belong to low-income families, making it a challenge for them to purchase bottled water,"" said Indumati G., the principal of the school. ""We needed an AquaTower urgently to combat diseases among these children.""According to the World Bank, India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. It is home to roughly 18 percent of the world's population but only four percent of its water resources. Those who live in rural communities are at even greater risk of water scarcity due to the long distances they must travel to find water.When clean water is scarce, as it was in Gummipoondi, residents are forced to drink contaminated water, which can carry diseases and lead to frequent illness. When students and their families are sick, they miss school and work and incur higher healthcare costs. The AquaTower not only reduces the spread of disease, but also helps students attend school more regularly, supporting the overall growth of the community.The project is one of many that Planet Water Foundation has planned for World Water Day. The organization has reached more than four million people in impoverished communities across 28 countries through the installation of community-based water filtration systems and implementation of hygiene education programs.Our work with Planet Water Foundation is part of our efforts to do our part to protect the planet and to enable our employees to take an active role in caring for the environment.

(NYSE American:IOR) reports a significant rise in net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, attributing it to higher interest income from increased interest rates. Positive IOR reports a notable increase in net income for Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 Net income attributable to common shares stands at $2.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share for Q4 2023 The increase in net income is credited to a surge in interest income driven by higher interest rates in 2023 Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net income for Income Opportunity Realty Investors is a significant indicator of the company's financial health. The doubling of earnings per share (EPS) from $0.30 to $0.60 suggests a robust performance, particularly in a market where interest rate fluctuations can have a profound effect on income from interest-sensitive assets. Investors should note that the rise in interest rates in 2023 likely expanded the interest margins for the company, which in turn boosted their interest income.While the short-term benefits are evident in the increased net income, there is a need to analyze the sustainability of this income source. Should interest rates stabilize or decline, the company's interest income could be affected. Additionally, the dependency on interest rates points to potential risks in the company's revenue model that stakeholders should monitor. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the performance of Income Opportunity Realty Investors provides insights into the real estate investment sector's adaptability to changing economic conditions. The increase in net income during a period of rising interest rates may indicate that the company has effectively capitalized on the interest rate environment or has a diversified portfolio that mitigates risk.It's important to consider how this performance compares with industry benchmarks and competitors. If Income Opportunity Realty Investors is outperforming its peers, it could suggest strategic management or a more favorable asset mix. However, if the industry as a whole is benefiting from similar conditions, the company's results may not be as exceptional as they appear in isolation. Economist The relationship between interest rate hikes and Income Opportunity Realty Investors' increased net income is a textbook example of the impact of monetary policy on real estate investment trusts (REITs). Higher interest rates can lead to greater yields on interest-bearing assets, which seems to be the case here. However, this environment can also increase borrowing costs and potentially depress property values, affecting future profitability.Investors should be cognizant of the economic cycle and its implications. If the central bank's policy tightens further, the cost of capital could rise, potentially offsetting the benefits seen in interest income. Conversely, if the economy shows signs of slowing down, we might see a pivot to lower rates, which could reduce the company's interest earnings. 03/22/2024 - 09:10 AM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc.

Total occupancy was 77%, with positive developments in rental revenues and construction loans for multifamily properties in Texas.","Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. reports Earnings for Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE:TCI) reported a net loss of $2.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net income of $58.9 million for the same period in 2022. Total occupancy was 77%, with positive developments in rental revenues and construction loans for multifamily properties in Texas. Positive Positive financial highlights include a $1.0 million increase in rental revenues from $11.8 million in 2022 to $12.8 million in 2023, primarily driven by multifamily property acquisitions. Transcontinental Realty Investors secured construction loans for the Merano and Bandera Ridge multifamily properties in Texas, with expected total costs of $51.9 million and $49.6 million, respectively. Extension of the maturity of the loan on Windmill Farms to February 28, 2026, at an interest rate of 7.50%. Total occupancy was 77% at December 31, 2023, with 92% at multifamily properties and 49% at commercial properties. Negative Net operating income decreased from $0.5 million in 2022 to a net operating loss of $2.1 million in 2023, primarily due to increased property operating and depreciation expenses. Net income attributable to the Company decreased from $58.9 million in 2022 to a net loss of $2.6 million in 2023, mainly due to a $74.7 million decrease in gain on sale or write down of assets and a $15.8 million increase in the tax provision. Real Estate Financial Analyst The report from Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (TCI) indicates a notable shift from a substantial net income in the previous year to a net loss in the current quarter. A key factor in this reversal appears to be the significant decrease in gain on sale, remeasurement, or write down of assets. This is a common occurrence in real estate when the market valuation of properties changes, impacting the balance sheet and income statements.While the increase in rental revenue suggests growth in operational income, it is overshadowed by the rise in property operating and depreciation expenses. This could be indicative of a strategic expansion, as seen with the acquisition of the VAA Holdback Portfolio, which although may promise future income potential, currently weighs on profitability due to associated costs.The engagement in new construction projects, such as Merano and Bandera Ridge, reflects a forward-looking growth strategy. However, the financing terms with interest rates pegged to prime and SOFR plus a margin, combined with the current economic environment of rising interest rates, could pose a risk to future cash flows. Investors should monitor these developments closely as they could affect the company's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst TCI's occupancy rates present a mixed picture, with a strong performance in multifamily properties but less so in commercial properties. The high occupancy in multifamily units is consistent with a broader trend where demand for residential spaces remains robust, especially in growing regions like Texas. However, the underperformance in commercial real estate could be a concern, reflecting broader market challenges such as shifts in work patterns and retail behavior.The company's strategic decisions, such as extending the maturity of the loan on Windmill Farms, indicate an effort to manage debt obligations amidst a challenging interest rate environment. This move could be seen as a proactive approach to financial management, potentially providing more flexibility in the short term.Investors should consider the regional focus of TCI's projects. The Texas real estate market has been experiencing growth, but it is also subject to economic cycles and regional policy changes. As such, TCI's performance is not only a reflection of company-specific actions but also of the health of the local economy and real estate market dynamics. Tax Advisor The reported decrease in tax provision, despite a net loss, is an interesting aspect of TCI's financial results. This could be due to the remeasurement of the VAA Holdback Portfolio acquired in 2022, which might have provided some tax benefits. Tax provisions are influenced by various factors including asset valuations, depreciation and potential tax credits or incentives. Companies often adjust these provisions in response to changes in their asset portfolio and tax legislation.For stakeholders, understanding the tax implications of real estate transactions and revaluations is crucial. These can have a significant impact on the reported earnings and cash flows. It is also important to note that while tax provisions can offer short-term relief, they do not necessarily reflect the long-term profitability or operational efficiency of a company. 03/22/2024 - 09:11 AM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE:TCI) is reporting its results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.

Financial Highlights Total occupancy was 77% at December 31, 2023, which includes 92% at our multifamily properties and 49% at our commercial properties. On November 6, 2023, we entered into a $25.4 million construction loan to construct a 216 unit multifamily property in McKinney, Texas (""Merano"") that bears interest at prime plus 0.25% and matures on November 6, 2028.

Financial Results Rental revenues increased $1.0 million from $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to $12.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in rental revenue is primarily due to $0.9 million increase at our multifamily properties and $0.1 million at the commercial properties. The increase in revenue from the multifamily properties is primarily due to the acquisition of the VAA Holdback Portfolio in 2022. Net operating income decreased $2.6 million from net operating income of $0.5 million for three months ended December 31, 2022 to net operating loss of $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net operating income is primarily due to an increase of $2.7 million in property operating and depreciation expenses offset in part by the $1.0 million increase in rental revenue as noted above and a decrease of $0.6 million in general administrative and advisory expenses. The increase in property and depreciation expenses is due to the acquisition of the VAA Holdback Portfolio. Net income attributable to the Company decreased $61.5 million from net income of $58.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to net loss of $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease in gain on our sale or write down of assets and our tax provision is due to the remeasurement of the VAA Holdback Portfolio that was acquired in 2022.

Three Patients with Invasive Fusarium Infection in Matinas BioPharma’s Oral MAT2203 Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program Achieve Complete Clinical Response,2024-03-22T13:15:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Matinas BioPharma announces complete clinical response in patients with invasive fusarium infection treated with MAT2203, showing promising results in difficult-to-treat cases. The oral formulation of amphotericin B demonstrated effectiveness in patients with  treatment options, paving the way for the upcoming Phase 3 trial for invasive aspergillosis.","Three Patients with Invasive Fusarium Infection in Matinas BioPharma’s Oral MAT2203 Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program Achieve Complete Clinical Response Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Matinas BioPharma announces complete clinical response in patients with invasive fusarium infection treated with MAT2203, showing promising results in difficult-to-treat cases. The oral formulation of amphotericin B demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment options, paving the way for the upcoming Phase 3 trial for invasive aspergillosis. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The announcement by Matinas BioPharma regarding the complete clinical response in patients treated with MAT2203 is significant for the infectious disease sector, particularly for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. The lipid nanocrystal (LNC) platform delivery technology represents an innovative approach to drug delivery, potentially improving the bioavailability and reducing the toxicity of drugs like amphotericin B, which is known for its nephrotoxicity when administered intravenously.From a medical research perspective, the reported success of MAT2203 in treating patients with limited options due to resistance to other antifungals is promising. It suggests that MAT2203 could fill a critical gap in the treatment landscape. However, the data is currently limited to compassionate use cases, which are not as rigorous as randomized clinical trials. The upcoming ORALTO Phase 3 trial will be important to ascertain the efficacy and safety of MAT2203 in a controlled environment, which, if positive, could lead to a paradigm shift in how invasive fungal infections are treated.For stakeholders, this news could indicate potential for growth in Matinas BioPharma's stock, especially if the Phase 3 trials are successful and lead to FDA approval. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, as the path to drug approval is often long and uncertain. Financial Analyst The clinical outcomes reported by Matinas BioPharma could have a significant impact on the company's financial health and stock performance. The success of MAT2203 in treating invasive fusarium infections, a condition with limited treatment options, positions the company to potentially capture a niche market. This is particularly relevant given the increasing incidence of antifungal resistance.While the market for antifungal treatments is not as large as other sectors, such as oncology, the lack of effective treatment options for resistant fungal infections presents an opportunity for Matinas BioPharma to establish itself as a leader in this space. The financial implications of this could be substantial, particularly if MAT2203 is approved and becomes a standard of care for these difficult-to-treat infections.Investors should note that the company's valuation could increase as it progresses through clinical trials and approaches potential commercialization. However, it is essential to monitor the outcomes of the Phase 3 trials and the regulatory review process, as any setbacks could adversely affect the company's financial prospects. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst Matinas BioPharma's announcement concerning MAT2203, an oral formulation of amphotericin B, is highly relevant in the context of the pharmaceutical market for antifungal agents. The development of oral formulations for drugs traditionally administered intravenously can significantly enhance patient compliance and expand the use of the drug to outpatient settings.The pharmaceutical market for antifungals is currently dominated by a few key players and resistance to existing treatments is a growing concern. The introduction of a new, effective oral agent could disrupt the market dynamics. MAT2203's potential to treat azole-resistant fusarium infections could make it an essential option in the antifungal arsenal.From a market perspective, the success of MAT2203 could lead to strategic partnerships, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to strengthen their infectious disease portfolios. The long-term market potential of MAT2203 will depend on the clinical trial results, pricing, insurance coverage and the ability of Matinas BioPharma to effectively market and distribute the drug, should it gain approval. 03/22/2024 - 09:15 AM BEDMINSTER, N.J., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: MTNB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering groundbreaking therapies using its lipid nanocrystal (LNC) platform delivery technology, announces complete clinical response in three patients with serious invasive fusarium infection following treatment with MAT2203, Matinas’ oral formulation of the potent antifungal amphotericin B. All three patients were enrolled in the Company’s Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program and were treated by Marisa H. Miceli, MD, Professor of Medicine, Specializing in Fungal Infections and Transplant Diseases, Division of Infectious Diseases, Internal Medicine, at the University of Michigan. “Invasive fusarium infection is often difficult to treat as clinically relevant fusarium species are resistant to almost all currently used antifungals including azoles and echinocandins, making it highly gratifying to announce the complete clinical response following treatment with oral MAT2203 for these seriously ill patients with limited treatment options,” said Theresa Matkovits, PhD, Chief Development Officer of Matinas. “While we don’t have the exact isolates and corresponding minimum inhibitory concentrations for all these patients, we do know that effective treatment of fusarium generally requires higher concentrations of amphotericin B than invasive aspergillosis, for example. The successful MAT2203 treatment outcome in these patients therefore adds to our confidence for the upcoming ORALTO Phase 3 trial in patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis with limited treatment options. We are grateful to these patients for participating in our program.” A 40-year-old female patient with extensive burns on more than 34% of her body developed complications of a urinary tract infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and C. difficile colitis. Her treatment required multiple surgical operations for debridement of wounds and skin grafting and she developed a soft tissue fusarium infection of the left foot at a skin grafting site, which was resistant to voriconazole. Treatment with IV-amphotericin B led to nephrotoxicity and her fusarium infection showed resistance to all other antifungals. She was transitioned to oral MAT2203 for two weeks, which led to clinical resolution of her fungal infection. A 48-year-old female renal transplant recipient with a weakened immune system developed chronic non-healing leg wounds. A fungal skin lesion culture was positive for an azole-resistant fusarium infection, which was only susceptible to amphotericin B. The patient was unable to receive long-term treatment with IV-amphotericin B due to her underlying condition, including risk for development of nephrotoxicity, and was transitioned to oral MAT2203. She began to show clinical improvement following two weeks of oral MAT2203 treatment and her skin wounds completely healed following six months of MAT2203 treatment. A 69-year-old man with coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, emphysema, aortic valve replacement, with small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy, developed fever. CT scans exhibited a left upper lobe consolidation of the lung with a culture showing positive for an azole-resistant fusarium species. The patient was treated with oral MAT2203 on an out-patient basis for six months. Repeat CT scan following MAT2203 treatment showed improvement in fungal infection, with some new nodules due to progression of malignancy. These three patients with fusarium infection are included in the 19 total patients discussed in Matinas’ recently announced update to the MAT2203 Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program; however, two of the three patients had not yet achieved complete clinical resolution at the time of that report. “MAT2203 continues to demonstrate its potential to effectively treat invasive fungal infections and help patients achieve complete clinical resolution. These very sick patients unfortunately are faced with a variety of complex medical challenges in addition to their fungal disease. MAT2203 has demonstrated the ability to resolve these deadly infections, allowing physicians to concentrate their efforts on the patients’ other underlying conditions,” said Jerome D. Jabbour, Chief Executive Officer of Matinas. “If approved, an oral, effective and safe MAT2203 could represent a new treatment paradigm for the unmet medical need in the treatment of invasive fungal infections.” MAT2203 is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally. About MAT2203Matinas BioPharma is developing MAT2203 as a potential oral broad-spectrum treatment for invasive deadly fungal infections. Although amphotericin B is a fungicidal agent, it is currently only available through an intravenous route of administration, which is known to be associated with several significant safety issues such as renal toxicity and anemia due to very high circulating levels of amphotericin B. MAT2203 has the potential to overcome the significant limitations of the currently available amphotericin B products due to its targeted oral delivery. Combining comparable fungicidal activity with targeted delivery results in a lower risk of toxicity and potentially creates the ideal antifungal agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. MAT2203 was successfully evaluated in the completed Phase 2 EnACT study in HIV patients suffering from cryptococcal meningitis, meeting its primary endpoint, and achieving robust survival. MAT2203 will be further evaluated in a single Phase 3 registration trial (the “ORALTO” trial) as an oral step-down monotherapy following treatment with AmBisome® (liposomal amphotericin B) compared with the standard of care in patients with invasive aspergillosis who have limited treatment options. About Matinas BioPharmaMatinas BioPharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering groundbreaking therapies using its lipid nanocrystal (LNC) platform delivery technology. Matinas’ lead LNC-based therapy is MAT2203, an oral formulation of the broad-spectrum antifungal drug amphotericin B. In addition to MAT2203, preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated that this novel technology can provide solutions to many challenges of achieving safe and effective intracellular delivery of both small molecules and larger, more complex molecular cargos including small oligonucleotides such as ASOs and siRNA. The combination of its unique mechanism of action and flexibility with routes of administration (including oral) positions Matinas’ LNC technology to potentially become a preferred next-generation orally available intracellular drug delivery platform.

The deal includes significant wage increases, modified duty rig, designated Holiday pay, retirement benefits enhancements, and more for Allegiant's 1,700+ flight attendants. The agreement aims to improve the quality of life for flight attendants and recognize their crucial role in Allegiant's operations. Positive None. Negative None. Labor Relations Expert The tentative agreement between Allegiant and the Transport Workers Union is a significant development, particularly in the context of labor relations within the airline industry. Often, negotiations can be protracted and contentious, leading to operational disruptions. However, the expeditious resolution of just over a year and a half suggests a strong, collaborative relationship between the union and management. This is noteworthy as it may set a positive precedent for future negotiations, not only for Allegiant but potentially as a benchmark in the industry.The agreement's terms, which include wage increases, improved compensation structures and quality of life enhancements, indicate a commitment to addressing flight attendant concerns. This could lead to increased job satisfaction and retention rates, which are important for maintaining operational efficiency and customer service standards. From a labor relations perspective, such improvements may also reduce the likelihood of industrial action, which can be costly for airlines both in terms of direct financial impact and reputational damage. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the enhancements to wages and benefits represent an increase in operating expenses for Allegiant. While this may initially seem like a negative development for the company's bottom line, it is important to consider the potential long-term financial benefits. Improved employee compensation packages can lead to better performance and reduced turnover, which can decrease costs associated with hiring and training new employees.Investors should note that such agreements can also have a positive impact on the company's brand reputation, potentially leading to increased customer loyalty and revenue. It is essential to monitor the subsequent ratification vote by the union's full membership, as its outcome will confirm whether these changes will be implemented. The market's reaction to this news will likely hinge on the perceived balance between increased costs and the anticipated benefits of a more satisfied and stable workforce. Market Research Analyst Considering the competitive landscape of the airline industry, where customer experience can be a differentiator, the improvements in flight attendants' work conditions could enhance Allegiant's service quality. A better-compensated and happier workforce is often more engaged, which can translate to improved customer interactions. Market research indicates that airlines that invest in their employees tend to perform better in terms of customer satisfaction metrics.The introduction of a minimum trip pairing pay is an interesting addition, as it ensures a baseline compensation regardless of trip length, which may be an attractive feature for current and prospective employees. This could potentially position Allegiant as an employer of choice in the industry, helping to attract top talent and possibly affecting market share positively if it leads to higher service standards. 03/22/2024 - 09:00 AM LAS VEGAS, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant (NASDAQ: ALGT) and The Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO Local 577 announce they have reached a tentative agreement on all remaining open issues for the successor to the parties' first collective bargaining agreement.

The company's strategic move aligns with its Ambition 2025 plan, focusing on growth and customer service.","Beacon Announces Three New Locations Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Beacon (Nasdaq: BECN) expands its presence by opening new branches in Florida and Michigan to cater to building and roofing contractors. The company's strategic move aligns with its Ambition 2025 plan, focusing on growth and customer service. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Expansion of business operations, such as the opening of new branches, typically indicates a strategic move to capture increased market share and improve service delivery. In the case of Beacon's new locations in Florida and Michigan, this move can be interpreted as a response to identified market demand in these regions. The Fort Myers and Milton branches in Florida target a growing market with specific needs due to its coastal geography, which suggests a tailored approach to product offerings, such as waterproofing solutions for buildings.Furthermore, the establishment of the 12th branch in Saginaw, Michigan, signifies a deepening of market penetration in a state where the company already has a presence. This suggests a confidence in the regional market's potential and a commitment to consolidating market position. Additionally, the mention of Beacon PRO+, an industry-leading app, indicates an investment in digital tools to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.The company's performance, having exceeded its Ambition 2025 revenue and shareholder return targets ahead of schedule, reflects a positive trajectory and operational excellence. This can be appealing to investors as it demonstrates the company's ability to not only set ambitious goals but also to achieve them ahead of time, potentially signaling strong management and a robust business model. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the opening of new branches can have several implications for a company's performance. It involves capital expenditure, which can impact short-term profitability due to the costs associated with establishing new locations. However, Beacon's early achievement of its Ambition 2025 targets suggests that the company has managed its capital effectively and has the financial strength to support its expansion strategy.Investors often view footprint expansion in profitable markets as a positive sign, anticipating future revenue growth from the new branches. The fact that Beacon has already exceeded its revenue and shareholder return targets adds credibility to the potential success of these new branches. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor how these expansions contribute to the company's financials in the coming quarters, as the true impact on revenue and profitability will become more apparent over time.It is also worth noting that the company's strategy aligns with industry trends towards consolidation and improving customer proximity. By expanding its physical presence, Beacon is likely aiming to enhance its competitive edge and customer service capabilities, which could translate into stronger customer loyalty and increased sales. Construction Industry Analyst The construction industry, particularly the roofing segment, is highly sensitive to regional economic conditions and the real estate market.

The plans for the Opening Ceremony are unlike any other. The first-ever Summer Olympic opening ceremony not held in a stadium, the organizers are turning one of the world's most famous waterways, the River Seine, into the world's biggest theatrical stage. Instead of walking into a stadium, a four-mile-long flotilla of nearly 100 boats will carry thousands of athletes from more than 200 countries past hundreds of thousands of spectators seated on the banks of the Seine. The river parade will follow the course of the Seine past the iconic sites of Paris, from Austerlitz Bridge, beside the Jardin des Plantes, crossing through central Paris and finishing in front of the Trocadéro, where the final elements of the show and ceremony will take place. IMAX will present NBC's live coverage of this summer's Opening Ceremony to more than 150 IMAX locations throughout the United States, providing fans with a unique and immersive theatre experience to enjoy what promises to be one of the most spectacular Opening Ceremonies in Olympic history. Last week, it was announced that Emmy Award-winning talk show host and Grammy Award-winning artist Kelly Clarkson and Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback and two-time Super Bowl champion Peyton Manning will join two-time Sports Emmy Award-winner and NBC Olympics primetime host Mike Tirico to host NBCUniversal's coverage of the Opening Ceremony. ""We look forward to providing our Opening Ceremony coverage to audiences at IMAX locations across the country, sharing in this historic moment as the world regathers to witness the spectacular beginning of 16 days of athletic greatness against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful cities in the world,"" said Gary Zenkel, President, NBC Olympics. ""We are excited to extend NBC's coverage of the Opening Ceremony to IMAX theatres across the U.S., allowing fans to gather and watch the highly-anticipated and awe-inspiring start to the Paris Olympic Games this July,"" said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX. On March 29, an NBCUniversal promotional trailer for its coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics will begin to run in IMAX theatres nationwide. Tickets will be available for purchase at local IMAX locations and on Fandango this summer. In Paris this summer, the world's greatest athletes will compete against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful cities in the world where the modern Olympic Games were conceived 130 years ago. This will be the third time Paris has hosted the Olympics (1900 and 1924), tying London for the most as a Summer Games host. Los Angeles (1932, 1984) will tie those two cities when it hosts the first Summer Games in the U.S. in 32 years in 2028. NBCUniversal previously announced that the NBC broadcast network and streaming service Peacock will be the company's primary platforms for its coverage of the Olympic Games Paris 2024, scheduled for July 26-Aug. 11, 2024.

The company's cash balance was $5.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Recent presentations included participation in investor conferences and updates on radiation sensitizer portfolio and diagnostic subsidiary. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval for Shuttle Pharma to proceed with a Phase 2 Clinical Trial for Ropidoxuridine is a pivotal step for the company. This drug, aimed at treating glioblastoma, addresses a significant unmet medical need due to the aggressive nature of this brain cancer and the limited efficacy of current treatments. The trial's outcome could have profound implications for patient survival rates and quality of life, potentially leading to increased investment in the company if the results are positive.Furthermore, the creation of Shuttle Diagnostics, Inc. signifies a strategic move into the companion diagnostics market, which is becoming increasingly important in personalized medicine. By developing a predictive diagnostic test for prostate cancer patients considering radiation therapy, Shuttle Pharma is not only broadening its portfolio but also tapping into a growing market segment that values precision in cancer treatment. Financial Analyst The announcement of Shuttle Pharma's Rights Offering to raise up to $4.5 million is a critical financial maneuver that reflects the company's proactive approach to funding its ambitious projects. With a cash balance of $5.5 million at the end of 2023, the additional funds could significantly bolster the company's ability to advance its diagnostic subsidiary and fund ongoing clinical trials.Investors should note, however, that such offerings can dilute existing shares, potentially impacting share value. The success of the Rights Offering and subsequent deployment of capital will be key factors in assessing the company's financial health and growth prospects. Market Research Analyst The estimated global prostate cancer diagnostic market was valued at $2.83 billion in 2019 and Shuttle Pharma's entry into this space with a predictive diagnostic test could capture a notable market share, especially considering the current gap in predictive tests for radiation therapy success. The licensing of intellectual property from Georgetown University and the exclusive license for PSMA-B intellectual property suggest strategic moves to secure a competitive edge in the market.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Shuttle Pharma's diagnostic tests upon commercialization, as this will be a critical indicator of the company's potential to secure a foothold in the diagnostics market. Additionally, the company's focus on leveraging radiation sensitizers to improve cancer treatment outcomes could position it favorably in the oncology market, pending the results of the clinical trials. 03/22/2024 - 09:00 AM GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: SHPH) (""Shuttle Pharma""), a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), today provided a corporate update in connection with the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Highlights Received FDA approval to proceed with the Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Ropidoxuridine for treatment of patients with glioblastoma, a deadly malignancy of the brain with no known cure.Finalizing site enrollment with 'first patient, first dose' expected in the second quarter of 2024.Created Shuttle Diagnostics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Shuttle Pharma, focused on developing a diagnostics laboratory to develop its metabolite discovery platform technology and to perform multi-institutional clinical trials.Entered into an exclusive agreement to license certain intellectual property from Georgetown University to advance the Company's predictive biomarker program focused on developing a predictive diagnostic test for prostate cancer patients who are considering elective radiation therapy.Obtained an exclusive license for PSMA-B intellectual property for advancing research into diagnostic and therapeutic applications of metastatic prostate cancer. Announced intent to commence a Rights Offering where it plans to raise up to $4.5 million through the distribution of subscription rights and the exercise thereof to advance Shuttle Diagnostics, Inc. Details of the Rights Offering can be found here.At December 31, 2023, Shuttle Pharma's cash balance was $5.5 million (including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities).Recent Presentations Anatoly Dritschilo, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Shuttle Pharma, participated in a fireside chat at the Lytham Partners 2024 Investor Select Conference.

A webcast link of the presentation can be found on the investor relations page of Shuttle Pharma's website or accessed HERE.Updated corporate slide presentation to highlight the opportunity for both Shuttle Pharma's radiation sensitizer portfolio as well as the diagnostic subsidiary.""We achieved a significant milestone in January 2024 with the receipt of the 'Safe to Proceed' letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to commence Ropidoxuridine's Phase 2 clinical trial,"" stated Shuttle Pharma's Chairman and CEO, Anatoly Dritschilo, M.D. ""We are currently finalizing site enrollment with 'first patient, first dose' expected in the second quarter of 2024. The results of this Phase 2 clinical trial will be important as we look to leverage radiation sensitizers to increase cancer cure rates, prolong patient survival, and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from glioblastoma. ""Beyond our focus on radiation sensitizers through both our Ropidoxuridine and HDAC6 development, we also announced the formation of Shuttle Diagnostics, which is focused on developing pretreatment predictive blood tests for prostate cancer patients. These tests will allow for the assessment of risk for cancer treatment success or failure, while informing therapeutic decision making and follow-up management. In 2019, the estimated global prostate cancer diagnostic market was $2.83 billion, however, none of the currently available tests are predictive of success of a specific treatment. We aim to meet this key unmet need for a minimally invasive diagnostic test that provides the clinician and patient with a measurement of the potential success of RT for their cancer treatment. ""We expect the coming few months will be filled with key developments and milestones, including the commencement of our Phase 2 clinical trial for Ropidoxuridine for treatment of patients with glioblastoma and the advancement of our opportunity within diagnostics. Our team is laser-focused on execution of the key deliverables that we believe will drive value for both patients and shareholders,"" Dr. Dritschilo concluded. About Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Founded in 2012 by faculty members of the Georgetown University Medical Center, Shuttle Pharma is a discovery and development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving the outcomes for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT). Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing therapies that are designed to maximize the effectiveness of RT while limiting the side effects of radiation in cancer treatment. Although RT is a proven modality for treating cancers, by developing radiation sensitizers, we aim to increase cancer cure rates, prolong patient survival and improve quality of life when used as a primary treatment or in combination with surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

(CSE: MAXX; OTC: MAXXF; FRANKFURT: 89N) (“MAX Power” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide the following corporate update: Willcox Lithium Project Initial assays are expected shortly from first-ever diamond drilling at the Willcox Playa in southeast Arizona with MAX Power having completed a Phase 1, 5-hole program consisting of 6,062 feet (1,848 metres) on state ground;Wide-spacing drilling encountered lithium-rich clays in a predominantly hectorite-saponite mix along with fluid sequences of non-potable liquids;Drill permits have recently been received from the Bureau of Land Management for the next immediate exploration priority - a large area of extreme low resistivity at the southern end of a 10-km-long corridor on MAX’s property;Based on all information to date, including an initial assessment of favorable mineralogy, the Company considers the 50 sq. mile Willcox Playa to be highly prospective for a large near-surface lithium claystone deposit surrounded by excellent infrastructure including roads, rail, power and services located immediately off Interstate 10 in southeast Arizona, leading to Tucson and Phoenix. Mr. Peter Lauder, Senior Geologist and Exploration Manager for MAX Power, commented: “The first five diamond drill holes at Willcox have supported initial theories regarding prospectivity of intense resistivity and gravimetric low anomalies at the Playa. The southern block on BLM ground features the largest and most extreme anomalies on MAX Power’s property. This bodes very well for extending the discovery of clay-rich sediments with high lithium values. We’re very pleased to receive these drill permits.” New Direct Lithium Extraction Innovation MAX Power is pleased to report that Dr. Dimitrius Khaladj presented key innovations related to brine pre-treatment and lithium concentration at the recent American Physics Association (APA) conference in Minneapolis, MN.

This is a California-based U.S. Department of Energy laboratory managed by the University of California. The Berkeley Lab, including pre-eminent American research scientists Dr. Brett Helms and Dr. Michael Whittaker, is working with MAX Power to develop state-of-the-art direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies for brine resources under a co-operative research and development agreement (CRADA). Dr. Khaladj presented a new concept for direct lithium extraction based on far-from-equilibrium transport of lithium through colloidal graphene oxide percolating networks formed with alternating current electric fields. The technology related to this novel concept could significantly improve the ability of lithium miners to selectively and actively transport lithium in brine without requiring extensive pre-treatment.

Announces the Completion of the Sale of the M/V Magic Orion Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Castor Maritime Inc. completes the sale of M/V Magic Orion for $17.4 million, expecting a net gain of $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The disposal of the M/V Magic Orion by Castor Maritime Inc. represents a strategic move within the shipping industry, often indicative of a company's asset reallocation or capital raising efforts. The sale price of $17.4 million and the expected net gain of $2.0 million, excluding transaction-related costs, signals an effective capital management strategy. It's essential to assess the vessel's book value prior to the sale to understand the impact on the company's balance sheet.Additionally, the timing of this sale within the first quarter could suggest Castor's intent to strengthen its financial position early in the fiscal year. Investors should consider how this sale aligns with the company's long-term asset portfolio strategy and whether it may be a precursor to fleet modernization or diversification efforts. Financial Analyst The reported net gain of $2.0 million from the sale of the M/V Magic Orion is a positive development for Castor Maritime's financials. This gain will likely contribute to the company's earnings per share (EPS) in the short term, which could be viewed favorably by investors and potentially influence the company's stock price. However, it's important to consider the operational implications of the vessel's removal from the fleet, such as potential capacity reduction and its effect on revenue streams.Furthermore, the allocation of the proceeds from this sale will be a focal point for shareholders. If the funds are used for debt reduction, fleet expansion, or other value-adding activities, it could enhance investor confidence in the company's strategic direction. Maritime Industry Expert The sale of a Capesize bulk carrier, such as the M/V Magic Orion, could reflect broader trends in the maritime industry, such as shifts in demand for bulk transportation or changes in global trade patterns. The age of the vessel, being a 2006-built carrier, is also a factor to consider, as older vessels may incur higher maintenance costs and face stricter environmental regulations.It's pertinent to analyze industry data to see if this sale is consistent with current market values for similar vessels and to evaluate Castor's fleet age profile compared to industry peers. The strategic divestment of older assets can be a sign of a company proactively managing its fleet to remain competitive and compliant with evolving maritime regulations. 03/22/2024 - 09:00 AM LIMASSOL, Cyprus, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRM), (“Castor” or the “Company”), a diversified global shipping company, announces that on March 22, 2024, it completed the previously announced sale of the M/V Magic Orion, a 2006-built Capesize bulk carrier vessel, for a price of $17.4 million, by delivering the vessel to its new owner. The Company expects to record a net gain of approximately $2.0 million from the above-mentioned sale, excluding any transaction-related costs during the first quarter of 2024.

Tender Offer Expiring on April 1, 2024 at 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary SuRo Capital Corp. announces a modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer to repurchase up to 2 million shares at a price per share between $4.00 and $5.00, aiming to purchase approximately 7.9% of the outstanding shares. The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire on April 1, 2024, with the company using available cash for the repurchase. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The tender offer by SuRo Capital Corp. to repurchase up to 2 million shares represents a strategic move to manage their equity structure and potentially increase shareholder value. By offering a price range between $4.00 and $5.00, the company is giving shareholders an opportunity to sell back shares at a potentially attractive premium, depending on the recent market price. This could indicate that the company believes its stock is undervalued or it wishes to return capital to shareholders in an efficient manner.From a market perspective, such buybacks can be a double-edged sword; they can lead to a temporary increase in stock price due to reduced supply and perceived company confidence, but they also may signal that the company lacks better investment opportunities. Moreover, using available cash for buybacks decreases the cash reserves, which could be used for other value-creating opportunities or as a cushion for future downturns. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the tender offer, if fully subscribed, the buyback would constitute approximately 7.9% of SuRo Capital's outstanding shares. This repurchase could be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which may make the company more attractive to investors seeking earnings growth. However, investors should consider the company's net asset value and the opportunity cost of the cash used for the buyback.It is also important to note that the tender offer is not contingent on a minimum number of shares being tendered, which provides flexibility for the company but adds uncertainty for the shareholders. The conditions disclosed in the tender offer documents should be scrutinized to understand potential implications on the company's financial health and strategic direction. Corporate Governance Advisor The board's decision not to make a recommendation to shareholders on whether to tender their shares suggests a neutral stance, leaving the decision to the discretion of the shareholders. This could be seen as a move to ensure fairness and avoid influencing the market. However, it also places the onus on shareholders to conduct their due diligence and decide if the tender price aligns with their valuation of the company.Future considerations of additional tender offers or measures to enhance shareholder value indicate that the company is actively seeking ways to manage its stock price and shareholder returns. Shareholders should evaluate such statements in the context of the company's long-term strategy and financial performance. 03/22/2024 - 09:00 AM Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer to Repurchase up to 2 Million Shares at a Price per Share Between $4.00 and $5.00NEW YORK, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SuRo Capital Corp.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 08:46 AM Fresh research reveals the power individuals have over policymaking STAMFORD, CT--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Individuals now wield substantial influence over the decision-making process of established institutions. Philip Morris International (PMI) (NYSE: PM) examined this topic in a white paper and an international survey recently released that discusses how individuals are leveraging the power of the “Fifth Estate” to transform public dialogue, influence policymaking, and challenge traditional institutions of authority. By leveraging the positive aspects of this emerging influence, society can drive meaningful action on the world’s critical issues. “The world’s hierarchical structure is flattening,” said Marian Salzman, PMI’s Senior Vice President & Chief Corporate Citizenship Officer. “New digital platforms are democratizing power. Ordinary people can shape public discourse, promote the causes that matter to them, and influence policymaking.” Salzman added, “Understanding this information revolution is more important than ever for companies, governments, and society. Leaders must not underestimate the impact of the Fifth Estate phenomena nor dismiss its potential to disrupt corporate power structures. A thorough examination of this emerging force is essential to understand how this power can be harnessed for the betterment of society.” The international survey, commissioned by PMI and conducted by independent research firm Povaddo in six countries, including the United States, revealed several insights that showcase the current information revolution. Most notably, it showed that most Americans (55 percent) believe most people now get their information from individual and community-based online platforms rather than traditional news sources, highlighting the waning influence of traditional media. Other key takeaways of the survey include: 1. Americans are skeptical of social media but increasingly influenced by it: Although just 22 percent of Americans trust the information they receive via their social media feeds, compared with 53 percent who trust newspapers, 61 percent say they have changed their views on a topic based on information from individuals or community-based forums online. Despite increasing reliance on online information sources, most Americans surveyed believe these sources spread misinformation (56 percent) and offer opinions without evidence (52 percent). Moreover, 48 percent believe they enable the spread of radical ideologies, and 45 percent worry that these sources exacerbate societal divisions. “There is no question that a growing number of people—in the U.S. and elsewhere—are turning to nontraditional news and information sources, not least because of ease of access and a chance to feel part of a community,” said Dr. Moira Gilchrist, PMI’s Chief Communications Officer. 2. Americans want their fellow citizens to take more responsibility when accessing online sources: 62 percent say people should only share content after verifying its authenticity. 57 percent want people to insist on sources that fact-check information. 52 percent want people to seek various opinions to inform their views. 3. Support for enhanced intervention by governments, regulators, and platform owners is less strong among Americans compared with the global sample: 55 percent of Americans support efforts to improve transparency (e.g., providing information on sourcing and the authors), compared with 62 percent of the global sample who said the same. 55 percent of Americans favor initiatives to combat the generation and spread of misinformation (vs. 61 percent). 51 percent of Americans want law enforcement to have a stronger ability to investigate and hold to account those who misuse online platforms (vs. 63 percent). “What we must now grapple with as a society is how to ensure this new realm of influence is channeled for the greater good,” said Dr. Gilchrist. “On the one hand, the Fifth Estate is a force that can drive broad societal action on critical issues facing our world. On the other hand, it too often favors emotion and ideology over facts, perpetuating polarization, sectarianism, and misinformation. Businesses, policymakers, and civil society must find ways to help ensure this emerging force moves society in a positive direction.” Read PMI’s latest white paper here. About the Povaddo Survey Povaddo conducted the online survey on behalf of PMI between December 6 and 13, 2023. The survey was fielded among 6,048 general population adults aged 21 and older in six countries: Brazil, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Approximately 1,000 interviews were administered in each country. Data were collected in a balanced way to reflect national population statistics and were not weighted. Results are accurate to a margin of error of ±1 percent overall. Philip Morris International, U.S.: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI), U.S. is working to deliver a smoke-free future. Since 2008, PMI has invested $12.5 billion globally to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match—a leader in oral nicotine delivery—creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as modified risk tobacco products.

The company plans to resubmit a Biologics License Application for cosibelimab by mid-year for potential approval before 2024 end. Checkpoint remains confident in the clinical data and safety package. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Checkpoint Therapeutics regarding their full-year financial results and the status of their Biologics License Application (BLA) for cosibelimab is a significant event for investors and stakeholders. The submission and acceptance of a BLA are critical steps in bringing a new drug to market and the resolution of issues outlined in the complete response letter (CRL) is essential for the company's future revenue streams.From a financial perspective, the ability to resolve manufacturing deficiencies and resubmit the BLA within the targeted timeline is key for maintaining investor confidence and minimizing time to market, which can have a substantial impact on the company's valuation. The emphasis on the clinical data and safety package supporting cosibelimab suggests a strong foundation for eventual approval, which could lead to a competitive edge in the immunotherapy space.However, the reliance on third-party manufacturing organizations introduces an element of risk, as any delays or further deficiencies can adversely affect the stock performance. Investors should monitor the company's progress closely, particularly the updates promised in the second quarter, as they will provide critical information on the likelihood of meeting the targeted approval timeline. Medical Research Analyst Checkpoint's focus on the development of cosibelimab, an immunotherapy drug, is indicative of the growing trend in personalized medicine and targeted treatments in oncology. The fact that the FDA accepted the BLA for filing signifies that Checkpoint's submission was sufficiently complete to warrant a substantive review. This is a positive step forward for the company's pipeline.However, the issuance of a CRL based on third-party manufacturing deficiencies is a reminder of the stringent regulatory environment in which biopharmaceutical companies operate. It's important to note that the CRL did not raise concerns with the clinical data itself, which suggests that the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of cosibelimab may not be in question.For stakeholders, the resubmission of the BLA and potential approval represent both an opportunity and a risk. If Checkpoint successfully addresses the FDA's concerns, cosibelimab could become a significant player in the immunotherapy market. Conversely, any setbacks in the resubmission process could delay market entry and impact projected earnings. Market Research Analyst Checkpoint Therapeutics' update on their commercial launch preparation activities indicates a strategic approach to market entry. By engaging in long lead time activities, they aim to reduce the time between potential approval and product availability, which can be a decisive factor for capturing market share in the competitive oncology sector.The immunotherapy market is rapidly evolving, with high demand for new and effective treatments. A successful launch of cosibelimab could allow Checkpoint to capitalize on this demand. However, the market dynamics also mean that any delays could result in competitors gaining an advantage. Stakeholders should consider the broader market trends, such as the adoption rates of new immunotherapies and the positioning of cosibelimab among existing treatment options, to assess the potential impact on Checkpoint's business performance post-approval.Overall, the company's confidence in their BLA resubmission and the market potential for cosibelimab are positives, but the actual impact on the business will depend on the successful navigation of the regulatory landscape and effective execution of their commercial strategy. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM WALTHAM, Mass., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the full-year ended December 31, 2023, and recent corporate highlights. James F. Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint, said, “We continue to work closely with our third-party contract manufacturing organization to expeditiously resolve the deficiencies noted in the complete response letter (“CRL”) we received last December, and are targeting a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab by mid-year to potentially obtain marketing approval before the end of 2024. Simultaneously, we continue to execute on a select number of key long lead time commercial launch preparation activities to shorten our launch timeline in anticipation of a potential approval. We remain highly confident in the clinical data and safety package in support of cosibelimab. We look forward to providing additional updates in the second quarter.” 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights: Checkpoint submitted a BLA to the FDA seeking approval of cosibelimab in January 2023 and the FDA accepted the BLA for filing in March 2023. In December 2023, the FDA issued a CRL for the cosibelimab BLA. The CRL only cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of Checkpoint’s third-party contract manufacturing organization as approvability issues to address in a resubmission. The CRL did not state any concerns about the clinical data package, safety, or labeling for the approvability of cosibelimab. Checkpoint intends to address the feedback in a BLA resubmission to potentially enable marketing approval in 2024.In December 2023, Checkpoint announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a new patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,834,505) covering a method of treating various cancers, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”), through the administration of cosibelimab. Checkpoint secured U.S. patent protection for cosibelimab through at least May 2038.In October 2023, Checkpoint announced the publication of results from the multicenter, multiregional, pivotal trial evaluating cosibelimab in patients with metastatic cSCC in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC), the peer-reviewed, online journal of the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer. The paper, entitled, “Efficacy and Safety of Cosibelimab, an Anti–PD-L1 Antibody, in Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma”, describes safety and efficacy results from 78 patients with metastatic cSCC enrolled at clinical sites in eight countries.In July 2023, Checkpoint announced new, longer-term data for cosibelimab from its pivotal studies in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC. These results demonstrate a deepening of response over time, resulting in higher complete response rates than previously reported (55% objective response rate; 26% complete response rate in locally advanced cSCC and 50% objective response rate; 13% complete response rate in metastatic cSCC). Furthermore, responses continue to remain durable over time.In June 2023, Checkpoint announced that new pharmacokinetic (“PK”) modeling data on cosibelimab supporting the extension to an every-three-week dosing regimen were presented at the Population Approach Group Europe 2023 Annual Meeting. Results support comparability of the cosibelimab 800 mg every-two-week and 1200 mg every-three-week dosing regimens.Throughout 2023 and in January 2024, Checkpoint completed multiple registered direct offerings priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and concurrent private placements of two series of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $47.6 million. Additionally, in October 2023, Checkpoint announced entry into a definitive agreement for the immediate exercise of warrants for $11.1 million in gross proceeds.In March 2024, Checkpoint announced the appointment of accomplished life sciences executive, Amit Sharma, M.D., FACP, FASN, FNKF, currently Vice President of Clinical Development and Therapeutic Head for Nephrology and Hematology at Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, as a non-executive director to Checkpoint’s Board of Directors. Financial Results: Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.9 million, compared to $12.1 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.2 million. This cash position is not reflective of the registered direct offering that closed in January 2024 for total gross proceeds of approximately $14.0 million.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $43.6 million, compared to $49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $6.2 million. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $4.6 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $2.8 million in non-cash stock expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were $8.7 million. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $2.7 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $2.5 million in non-cash stock expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $51.8 million, or $3.17 per share, compared to a net loss of $62.6 million, or $7.09 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

United-Guardian Reports 2023 Financial Results,2024-03-22T13:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"United-Guardian, Inc. reports a relatively flat net income for FY 2023 compared to FY 2022, with a 14% decrease in net sales.

Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic for 2024 with new orders of Renacidin and ongoing distributor negotiations.","United-Guardian Reports 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary United-Guardian, Inc. reports a relatively flat net income for FY 2023 compared to FY 2022, with a 14% decrease in net sales. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower sales of cosmetic ingredients and a supply disruption for their main pharmaceutical product, Renacidin, in 2023. Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic for 2024 with new orders of Renacidin and ongoing distributor negotiations. Positive None. Negative Net sales decreased by 14% from $12,698,503 in 2022 to $10,885,154 in 2023. The supply disruption for Renacidin in 2023 impacted production and sales. Lower sales of cosmetic ingredients contributed to the decrease in net sales. Financial Analyst The financial performance of United-Guardian, Inc. reflects a resilience in net income despite a significant drop in net sales. The stability of net income, in the face of a 14% sales decline, suggests effective cost management. However, investors should be aware that a persistent decline in sales can eventually erode profitability if not offset by further cost reductions or a sales rebound. The flat earnings per share (EPS) indicate that the company has not diluted shareholder value, which is a positive sign for investors.Looking at the industry context, the decrease in cosmetic ingredient sales aligns with broader market trends. The shift towards just-in-time inventory practices by customers can impact sales volatility and cash flow predictability. The resumption of Renacidin production is positive, but investors should monitor the company's ability to recover from supply disruptions and capitalize on the resumed operations. The optimistic outlook for 2024 should be weighed against the actual order flow and the company's ability to negotiate favorable terms with distributors. Market Research Analyst The dynamics within the cosmetic ingredients sector are indicative of a larger industry shift. The destocking trend and move to just-in-time ordering by customers can be seen as a response to market uncertainties or a strategic shift in inventory management. This trend may have implications beyond United-Guardian, potentially affecting suppliers and competitors alike. The ability to adapt to these changes, such as through flexible manufacturing and supply chain agility, will likely be key determinants of future success.For United-Guardian, the reliance on a single large distributor for a significant portion of sales is a notable risk factor. Diversification of distribution channels could mitigate this risk. Additionally, the supply disruption of Renacidin, while resolved, highlights the importance of robust supply chain management. The company's proactive measures and successful validation activities are reassuring, but it's important to evaluate their long-term supply chain strategy to prevent similar issues. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst Renacidin's supply disruption is a critical event for United-Guardian, given its status as the company's main pharmaceutical product. The resumption of production is certainly a relief, but it's important to examine the underlying causes of the disruption and assess the company's risk mitigation strategies. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly sensitive to supply chain issues and such disruptions can have lasting effects on customer trust and market share. Vigilance in ensuring production stability and quality control is paramount.The company's optimism for 2024 should be tempered by an understanding of the regulatory environment and competitive landscape. Any changes in FDA policies, patent expirations, or new market entrants could significantly impact United-Guardian's pharmaceutical segment. Investors should look for evidence of strategic planning in these areas to gauge the company's potential for growth and resilience against industry headwinds. 03/22/2024 - 09:00 AM HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United-Guardian, Inc. (NASDAQ:UG) reported that net income for FY 2023 remained relatively flat compared to FY 2022. Net sales for the year decreased by 14% from $12,698,503 in 2022 to $10,885,154 in 2023, generating net income of $2,581,370 ($0.56 per share) in 2023 compared to $2,569,512 ($0.56 per share) in 2022. Donna Vigilante, President of United-Guardian, stated, “While net income remained flat from 2022 to 2023, we did experience a decrease in net sales this year compared to last year. The main cause of the decrease came from lower sales of our cosmetic ingredients, with the greatest decrease coming from our largest distributor. Based on conversations with our distributors, the decrease in sales was consistent with the overall performance of the industry, as many customers destocked their inventories and moved to just-in-time order patterns. We also experienced a supply disruption for Renacidin, our main pharmaceutical product, at the end of 2023. We have been working closely with our contract manufacturer over the past several months and we are happy to report that all validation activities have been completed and production has resumed. While 2023 presented challenges, our outlook for 2024 is looking brighter. With new orders of Renacidin starting to arrive at our facility, customers beginning to restock, and ongoing distributor negotiations we are hopeful that 2024 will position our product lines for enhanced growth.” United-Guardian is a manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients, sexual wellness ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and medical lubricants.

CorpAcq Group Plc plans to implement an annual dividend policy supported by strong free cash flow. The Board recommends voting 'FOR' all proposals in the Proxy Statement for both stockholders and warrant holders. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The scheduled special meeting for Churchill Capital Corp VII's stockholders and warrant holders to vote on the proposed business combination with CorpAcq Holdings Limited represents a pivotal moment in the lifecycle of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The market often reacts to such announcements with speculative trading, as the future growth prospects and free cash flow generation capabilities of the combined entity are evaluated. CorpAcq's intention to implement an annual dividend policy post-closing could be particularly attractive to investors seeking income-generating investments, potentially influencing the stock's attractiveness in the dividend stock market segment.Moreover, the emphasis on a portfolio with strong asset bases and high barriers to entry suggests a strategic approach to sustainable long-term growth, which could reassure investors looking for stability. However, the actual impact on the stock market will largely depend on the perceived value of the 42 businesses within CorpAcq's portfolio and the execution of post-merger integration strategies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transparency of the business combination's terms and the financial health of CorpAcq are crucial. The inclusion of financial statements in the post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement will allow investors to scrutinize CorpAcq's fiscal performance. This level of disclosure is essential for assessing the valuation of the combined company and the potential return on investment. The market will closely monitor key financial metrics such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and return on equity (ROE) to gauge the financial synergy of the merger.Furthermore, the move to list on the Nasdaq Global Market under a new ticker symbol post-merger will enhance visibility and could potentially increase liquidity for the combined entity's shares. Investors will need to consider the timing of the merger's completion and the integration process, as these factors can significantly affect the stock's short-term volatility and long-term performance. Legal Expert The legal aspects surrounding the business combination, such as the unanimous recommendation by the board of directors and the amendment to the existing warrant agreement, are indicative of a structured and well-governed process. The involvement of reputable legal counsel firms on both sides of the deal provides an additional layer of due diligence, potentially mitigating legal risks associated with such transactions.The virtual nature of the meetings, while increasingly common in today's corporate environment, also highlights the need for clear communication channels and adherence to SEC regulations and proxy solicitation norms. The legal framework underpinning the business combination, including compliance with SEC filing requirements and the legal structure of the post-merger entity, will be instrumental in ensuring a smooth transition to public company status for CorpAcq Group Plc. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM Board of Directors Recommends Stockholders and Warrant Holders Vote ""FOR"" All Proposals NEW YORK and ALTRINCHAM, England, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Churchill Capital Corp VII (""Churchill VII"") (Nasdaq: CVII), a special purpose acquisition company, announced today that it has scheduled a special meeting of Churchill VII stockholders and a meeting of Churchill VII warrant holders for May 21, 2024 in connection with the proposed business combination between CorpAcq Holdings Limited (""CorpAcq""), a corporate compounder with a proven track record of acquiring and supporting founder-led businesses, and Churchill VII (the ""Business Combination"").

The transaction is structured as a purchase agreement with Harborstone Credit Union purchasing substantially all assets and assuming substantially all liabilities of SaviBank. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions. Following the completion of the transaction, Savi Financial will liquidate and dissolve and distribute its remaining assets to its stockholders. The transaction is Harborstone Credit Union’s second announced bank purchase, with its pending acquisition of Seattle, Washington-based First Sound Bank, which was entered into on August 1, 2023. The First Sound Bank transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. When finalized, the combined institution will have, including with the acquisition of First Sound Bank, approximately $2.7 billion in assets, $2.0 billion in loans, $2.3 billion in shares and deposits and will have 27 branches throughout Skagit, Whatcom, Island, San Juan, King, Pierce, and Thurston counties. The effective price per share cannot be determined precisely prior to the closing date and will depend, among other things, on the financial performance and market conditions affecting SaviBank during the period between signing and closing. However, management currently estimates that the price per share on a pre-tax basis will fall within a range of $16 to $17 per share of Savi Financial Corporation common stock. SaviBank customers will become members of Harborstone Credit Union with full access to Harborstone’s expansive product and service offerings. The acquisition helps Harborstone Credit Union grow its presence in the Skagit County-area marketplace, diversify its assets, and add superior talent and expertise. “We look forward to working with Harborstone Credit Union to continue our tradition of fostering meaningful customer relationships while having a positive impact in our local communities,” said Michal D. Cann, Chairman and President of Savi Financial. “We are deeply focused on providing resources and services for our customers to succeed, and believe that the additional services, products and locations Harborstone Credit Union provides will help us continue to meet the financial needs of our customers. Through the unique structure of this acquisition by Harborstone Credit Union, we believe we are maximizing value to our shareholders who have supported us over the years.” Geoff Bullock, President & CEO of Harborstone Credit Union, commented, “As a member-owned financial institution, the request from our members for more access and ever-improving technology has been at the forefront of our minds. This acquisition achieves that and more. The wisdom of Harborstone Credit Union’s leadership over the past decade has enabled us to both purchase SaviBank with cash that we have saved just for this purpose and to remain very well capitalized. Mike Cann and the Savi team have been building something special up north, and we believe the best is yet to come for both organizations as we come together.” The transaction is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 subject to receiving all regulatory approvals, approval by the stockholders of Savi Financial, and other customary closing conditions. Harborstone Credit Union was advised in the transaction by McQueen Financial Advisors, as exclusive financial advisor, and Luse Gorman, PC, as legal counsel.

Positive Launch of ScanUp program by Desktop Health to simplify adoption of digital technologies in dentistry. Program includes iTero Element Flex scanner and support for digital dentistry ecosystem. Total contract value of dentists signed up for ScanUp program surpasses $32 million. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of ScanUp by Desktop Health represents a strategic move in the dental industry, aiming to lower the barrier of entry for digital dentistry. The program's subscription-based model aligns with current business trends towards 'as-a-service' offerings, which are designed to provide predictable revenue streams and enhance customer retention. With a contract value exceeding $32 million, this initiative could signal a significant revenue driver for Desktop Metal, Inc.The inclusion of prominent Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) such as Western Dental and Smile Brands suggests an endorsement of the program's utility and potential for widespread industry adoption. The move to include certified pre-owned equipment in the subscription is a cost-effective strategy that could appeal to a broad segment of the market, particularly smaller practices seeking to modernize without incurring prohibitive upfront costs. Financial Analyst Desktop Metal, Inc.'s launch of ScanUp is a noteworthy development for investors to monitor. The $32 million in contract value not only reflects the initial success of the program but also serves as an indicator of its potential impact on the company's financials. The recurring revenue model inherent to subscriptions could contribute to stable, long-term income for Desktop Metal, which may be reflected in future earnings reports and could positively influence the stock's performance.However, investors should also consider the costs associated with deploying such a program, including the expenses of refurbishing pre-owned scanners, providing ongoing support and managing partnerships with dental labs. The program's success will hinge on its ability to scale and maintain quality service as adoption grows. Healthcare Industry Analyst The ScanUp program's ecosystem approach, encompassing equipment, education, training and support, is indicative of a holistic strategy in healthcare technology adoption. By targeting both digital and analog case support, Desktop Health is catering to a transitional market, recognizing that not all practices are ready to fully convert to digital workflows. The program's emphasis on education and training is important for ensuring that the technology is effectively integrated into practices, which could lead to improved patient outcomes and practice efficiencies.For the broader healthcare sector, such models could become benchmarks for technology adoption, potentially influencing how other medical specialties approach the integration of innovative technologies. The success of ScanUp could inspire similar programs across different healthcare verticals, ultimately shaping the future of medical technology adoption. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM ScanUp launches with hundreds of dentist members nationwide using the program, including practices at several major DSOs Dentists who subscribe to ScanUp pay for the 36-month program with their routine dental lab expenses through work sent to member dental labs Members receive an iTero Element™ Flex certified pre-owned (CPO) intraoral scanner with access to a complete digital dentistry ecosystem with education, training, and support ScanUp member dental labs are experienced, full-service labs capable of supporting digital cases as well as analog cases ScanUp is more than an intraoral subscription program – it’s a complete ecosystem to help dentists adopt digital dentistry with ease The total contract value of dentists signed up for the ScanUp program now exceeds $32 million BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Desktop Health – the trusted production-grade medical 3D printing brand of Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE: DM) – today announced the launch of ScanUp, a new program for dentists designed to help simplify adoption of digital technologies to improve practice efficiency and patient care. The ScanUp program has been in development through a beta rollout since November 2022 and already has hundreds of members, including several DSOs such as Western Dental and Smile Brands. Now, the program is being rolled out to the general dental marketplace. Members of the program receive an iTero Element Flex certified pre-owned (CPO) scanner from Desktop Health as part of a subscription program for lab services. “ScanUp solves a real challenge for dentists struggling to adopt digital dentistry with a streamlined, easy-to-access solution,” said Lou Azzara, president of Desktop Health and Desktop Labs. “We are proud to launch the ScanUp program to support the digital dentistry journey of general practitioner and family dentists for improved practice efficiencies and enhanced patient experiences.” “The iTero™ scanner can be an indispensable tool for efficiently transforming practices from analog to digital, helping doctors drive practice efficiencies, deliver exceptional patient outcomes and provide their patients with outstanding experiences,” said Matt Miller, vice president and general manager US, Align Technology. “We’re excited about the opportunity for Desktop Health to bring the benefits of the iTero Element Flex scanner to Desktop Lab's GP dentists across the U.S.” ScanUp is a Simple and Complete Solution ScanUp solves several challenges faced by clinicians looking to adopt digital dentistry. About half of the dentists in the United States have not yet adopted intraoral scanning, the first step in the digital dentistry journey, because of perceived and real challenges1, such as the complexity of stitching together a digital workflow to deliver final restorations and other dental products. Dentists can participate in the ScanUp ecosystem at any stage in their digital journey with an affordable subscription program that is paid for with routine lab services. The Desktop Health subscription provides an Align iTero Element™ Flex CPO intraoral scanner, which serves as the gateway to digital dentistry. In addition, the subscription includes certified training and education which doctors and practices can complete at their own pace. Digital and analog lab services and support are also provided by ScanUp member labs, which are owned by or affiliated with Desktop Health. Member labs already serve more than 12,000 dentists nationwide through well-known community labs such as Dental Arts Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois; May Dental Arts in Fenton, Missouri; and Brewer Dental Lab in Tulsa, Oklahoma. All ScanUp member labs are full-service digital + analog labs that are capable of 3D printing products such as Flexcera™ restorations and SmileGuard™ bite splints, along with other digital products. Flexcera and SmileGuard are materials developed and sold by Desktop Health, and they are qualified for 3D printing on Einstein family 3D printers, as well as Carbon 3D systems. When dentists using intraoral scanners are ready to level up their digital dentistry practice, they can adopt 3D printing with Desktop Health Einstein™ printers, with digital design file support from ScanUp member labs. Or, they can design their own printable files with CAD/CAM design software through Align’s exocad™ ChairsideCAD platform. Dental practices can join the ScanUp ecosystem at any stage of their journey, regardless of scanner model. ScanUp supports the entire journey with education, training and support.

(NYSE: SRFM) partners with Auric Air Services to upgrade up to 12 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft with electrified powertrains, aiming to reduce emissions and lower operating costs. Surf Air targets significant cost and environmental benefits with up to 50% cost reduction and 100% carbon emissions reduction for fully-electric powertrains. Positive None. Negative None. Aerospace Engineer The partnership between Auric Air and Surf Air Mobility to electrify a portion of Auric Air's fleet represents a significant advancement in the aviation industry's move towards sustainable operations. The electrification of aircraft, particularly the popular Cessna Grand Caravan model, could lead to a notable shift in how regional air services manage their costs and environmental footprint.Electrified powertrains offer the potential to drastically reduce direct operating costs, as electric motors generally require less maintenance than traditional combustion engines. This could translate into lower ticket prices or higher profit margins for operators. The promise of up to a 50% reduction in operating costs is particularly notable, given that fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines.Moreover, the commitment to reduce carbon emissions aligns with global efforts to combat climate change. A fully-electric powertrain achieving a 100% reduction would be a groundbreaking achievement, though the actual performance would need to be evaluated under real-world conditions. The certification of such technology is also a critical step, as safety and reliability are paramount in aviation. Environmental Economist From an economic perspective, the introduction of electrified aircraft powertrains could have far-reaching implications for the regional aviation market. If Surf Air Mobility's technology delivers on its promises, it could incentivize a wave of retrofitting across the industry, potentially creating a new market for green aviation technology.The environmental benefits are twofold: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from one of the most carbon-intensive modes of transportation and possibly stimulating demand for renewable energy, as operators may seek to power their fleets with sustainably sourced electricity. The reduction in emissions is particularly relevant for East Africa, where tourism is a major industry and conservation is a key concern.However, the adoption of such technology will depend on factors such as the initial investment costs, the reliability of the powertrains and the infrastructure available for charging electric aircraft. Operators will need to weigh these considerations against the potential cost savings and environmental benefits. Market Research Analyst Surf Air Mobility's agreement with Auric Air and other operators in East Africa and Brazil indicates a growing interest in sustainable aviation solutions in emerging markets. This could set a precedent for other regions to follow, especially as the industry seeks to recover from the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic with an eye on sustainable growth.Market penetration, represented by the 13% of the Cessna Caravan market in Africa, showcases the potential for Surf Air's technology. The aviation industry is highly competitive and operators are always looking for an edge. The adoption of electrified powertrains could become a competitive advantage, especially if the technology becomes a consumer preference due to its environmental benefits.It's important to monitor the progress of the certification process, as it will be a significant indicator of the technology's viability and the timeline for its market introduction. The success of Surf Air's electrified powertrains could stimulate further investment and innovation in the sector, potentially leading to a broader transformation of the aviation industry. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM Auric Air to upgrade up to 12 of their Cessna Grand Caravan fleet with Surf Air’s electrified powertrains to lower emissions and reduce direct operating costs. LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Surf Air Mobility Inc. (NYSE: SRFM) (“Surf Air Mobility”, “Surf Air”), a leading regional air mobility platform, has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Auric Air Services Ltd. (“Auric Air”), a Tanzania-based regional air operator flying both scheduled and charter service across East Africa, to upgrade up to 12 of Auric Air’s Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft with Surf Air’s proprietary electrified powertrain technology once certified. Surf Air now has approximately 13% of the Cessna Caravan market in Africa under agreement to upgrade to its electrified powertrains, once certified. Surf Air is developing Supplemental Type Certifications for both hybrid and fully-electric variants of the Cessna Grand Caravan. With target reductions of up to 50% direct operating costs and 100% in carbon emissions for the fully-electric powertrain, Surf Air believes the impact for other air operators around the world will be profound as the cost and environmental impact of flying is significantly reduced. “It’s exciting to have Auric Air share our mission of reducing emissions through electrified aircraft,” said Stan Little, CEO of Surf Air Mobility. “Auric Air’s commitment secures their preferred delivery positions to upgrade their aircraft to our electrified powertrains once the technology is certified.” Surf Air recently announced similar electrified powertrain agreements with other large Cessna Caravan air operators including Safarilink, Yellow Wings, and Z.Boskovic in East Africa, and Azul Connecta in Brazil. About Surf Air Mobility Surf Air Mobility, headquartered in Los Angeles, is a pioneering regional air mobility platform dedicated to transforming regional air travel through electrification. As the largest commuter airline operator in the US, Surf Air Mobility partners with commercial leaders to develop innovative powertrain technology for smaller aircraft, facilitating the electrification of existing fleets and the widespread adoption of electric aircraft.

The innovative solution offers quick deployment, lower costs, and flexibility, making it ideal for various locations like apartment buildings, hotels, supermarkets, and fleet operators. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Industry Analyst The introduction of ADS-TEC Energy's ChargeBox at the EV Charging Summit & Expo represents a significant advancement in the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure sector. The ChargeBox's ability to deliver up to 320 kW of power even on grids with limited capacity addresses a critical bottleneck in the widespread adoption of EVs, which is the availability of fast-charging stations. This technology could potentially reduce the need for costly grid upgrades, which have been a major barrier to the deployment of ultra-fast charging stations.From an energy perspective, the scalability and flexibility of the ChargeBox system could facilitate a more rapid expansion of charging networks, thereby supporting the growth of the EV market. This is particularly relevant as governments and corporations commit to reducing carbon emissions. The adoption of such technologies could also influence energy demand patterns, leading to increased investments in renewable energy sources to meet the anticipated rise in electricity consumption by EVs. Financial Analyst ADS-TEC Energy's unveiling of the ChargeBox platform may have positive implications for the company's financial performance and stock valuation. The ability to deploy ultra-fast chargers at a lower cost and without extensive infrastructure upgrades could give ADS-TEC a competitive edge in the rapidly growing EV charging market. As the EV market continues to expand, driven by both consumer demand and regulatory pressures, the demand for efficient and cost-effective charging solutions is likely to grow.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of ChargeBox units, partnerships with residential complexes and the expansion into commercial venues like hotels and supermarkets. These factors could serve as indicators of the company's market penetration and revenue growth potential. Additionally, the company's stock may react positively to the successful deployment and operational efficiency of the ChargeBox, as it demonstrates the practical viability of the solution and could lead to increased sales and market share. Sustainability Consultant The deployment of ChargeBox technology has broader implications for sustainability in urban environments. By enabling ultra-fast charging in a compact form factor, ChargeBox can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. For large apartment buildings and offices, the installation of such charging stations can be a part of their sustainability initiatives, potentially improving their environmental credentials and attractiveness to environmentally conscious tenants and employees.Moreover, the transition to EVs supported by technologies like ChargeBox can lead to a decrease in urban air pollution. This is particularly important in densely populated areas where air quality is a significant public health concern. The utilization of ChargeBox in multi-family residential complexes also demonstrates a shift in the approach to EV charging infrastructure, promoting shared resources over individual charging points, which can lead to more efficient land use and energy consumption patterns. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM At the EV Charging Summit & Expo, ADS-TEC Energy is showcasing its battery-buffered, ultra-fast charging platform ChargeBox, which supports CCS1 today and will soon support NACS charging plugs ChargeBox charges ultra-fast even on a power-limited grid, enabling ultra-fast charging to become as ubiquitous as air conditioning and elevators for large apartment buildings and offices At the conference, the founder and CEO of ADS-TEC Energy, Thomas Speidel, highlighted how the company's unique business models will cut charging costs LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EV Charging Summit & Expo-- ADS-TEC Energy plc (NASDAQ: ADSE), a global leader in battery-buffered, ultra-fast charging technology, unveiled its innovative ChargeBox EV charging platform at the EV Charging Summit & Expo in Las Vegas, March 20-22, 2024. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240322683608/en/ADS-TEC Energy's Founder and CEO Thomas Speidel (second from right) with his team at EV Charging Summit & Expo (Photo: Business Wire) The ChargeBox has a charging capacity of up to 320 kW, even on power-limited grid connections. It currently supports CCSI charging plus and will soon support NACS charging plugs. This ultra-fast charging solution offers maximum setup flexibility and, compared to conventional DC chargers, can be deployed more quickly with lower cost as it requires no extensive construction or upgrades to high-powered electrical infrastructure. This week ADS-TEC Energy unveiled the first U.S. deployment of the ChargeBox at a multi-family residential complex in North Miami Beach. This deployment allows drivers at the 470-unit complex to charge their EVs in just minutes and requires only two parking spaces. The complex managers decided against equipping parking spaces at great expense with slower Level 2 chargers which would block the spaces for many hours and are destined to become obsolete in a couple of years. For comparison, 100 Level 2 chargers of 11 kW each have a connected load of 1.1 MW and yet would not charge quickly. Instead, they decided to install the ChargeBox and are demonstrating how quickly and easily ChargeBox can be used without requiring expensive grid expansion. A compact and efficient solution, ChargeBox is the ideal charging system for apartment buildings and hotels, supermarkets, filling stations, companies, car dealerships and fleet operators, who are increasingly switching to EVs. The founder and CEO of ADS-TEC Energy, Thomas Speidel, spoke at the EV Charging Summit & Expo conference about the importance of sustainable infrastructure. He noted ChargeBox’s unique business models will make an important contribution to the nationwide adoption of EVs. ""Our aim is to make ultra-fast charging accessible to as many EV drivers as possible,"" said Thomas Speidel. ""For residents of large apartment buildings, charging in just a few minutes with ChargeBox will become as common as air conditioning, valet parking or elevators. In city centers with limited space and in supermarket and office parking lots, ChargeBox will deliver ultra-fast charging even on power-limited networks. With this solution, we are boosting the U.S.’s EV charging infrastructure and doing our bit to encourage more people to opt for an electric vehicle.""

The dividend payout is scheduled for April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Cadiz Inc.'s cash dividend for its Series A Preferred Stock is a significant event for shareholders, particularly those invested in preferred shares. The declared dividend of $550.00 per whole share, or $0.55 per depositary share, is a substantial return on investment, especially when compared to the average dividend yield for preferred stocks in the market.From a financial perspective, the yield of 8.875% is notably higher than the current average for preferred stocks, which typically ranges between 5-7%. This high yield might suggest that the company is confident in its liquidity and cash flow management, as it's able to sustain such dividends. However, investors should also consider the company's long-term financial stability and its ability to maintain these payments, especially in volatile market conditions.For potential investors, the high dividend could be appealing, but it's essential to analyze the company's overall financial health. Factors such as revenue growth, debt levels and cash reserves should be examined to ensure that the dividend payments are not at the expense of the company's future growth or financial stability. Market Research Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend can often be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, indicating that the company is performing well enough to distribute profits to its shareholders. For Cadiz Inc., the payment of such a high dividend might reflect a strategic move to attract and retain investors, particularly in a competitive market where investors have numerous options.It's important to note that the preferred stock market is relatively niche, with a specific investor base that seeks stable income. The impact of this dividend declaration on Cadiz's stock price could be limited, as preferred shares typically experience less price volatility than common shares. However, the news might still have a positive effect on the company's reputation and perceived financial health.Investors may also interpret this dividend as a commitment to prioritizing shareholder returns over reinvestment in the company. This could lead to speculation about the company's future growth initiatives and whether they are being adequately funded. 03/22/2024 - 08:45 AM LOS ANGELES, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadiz, Inc.

Revenues and gross profit decreased in Q4 compared to 2022, while net income improved. The Construction division saw a decline in revenue but improved gross margins. Investments division revenue remained stable. Operating expenses varied, resulting in a net loss for FY 2023. Cash flow from operations turned positive, with a decrease in debt. The Company remains focused on strategic acquisitions and growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative Revenues and gross profit decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the prior year, impacting net income. FY 2023 ended with a net loss due to lower revenues and increased operating expenses. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA showed losses in Q4 and FY 2023, reflecting challenges in the Construction division. Operating cash flow improved in 2023, driven by stronger collections and lower working capital expenses. SG&A expenses increased in FY 2023, impacting the Company's financial performance. Financial Analyst The financial results for Star Equity Holdings, Inc. reflect a contraction in revenue and gross profit, with a 19.8% and 47.0% decrease respectively in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. This contraction is indicative of the challenges faced by the Construction division due to economic headwinds such as higher interest rates. However, the improvement in gross margins from 21.6% to 26.0% for the full year 2023 suggests effective cost management and pricing strategies that have partially mitigated the impact of these headwinds.The reduction in debt from $3.4 million to $2.0 million and the increase in cash and cash equivalents to $18.9 million are positive signs of financial health and liquidity. These metrics are critical for investors as they assess the company's ability to fund operations and growth initiatives without excessive leverage. The positive cash flow from operations of $2.7 million in 2023, a significant improvement from the outflow of $3.9 million in 2022, indicates improved operational efficiency and cash management.While the net loss figures may raise concerns, the narrowed loss from $5.8 million in FY 2022 to $1.9 million in FY 2023 demonstrates progress towards profitability. The use of non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which shows a loss of $0.2 million compared to a loss of $0.1 million in FY 2022, provides additional context by excluding certain non-cash and irregular expenses and offers a different perspective on the company's operating performance. Market Research Analyst Star Equity Holdings' performance highlights the broader economic challenges impacting the construction industry, particularly the tightening credit conditions that have delayed commercial projects. These conditions have had a direct impact on the company's revenue, yet the robustness of the single-family residential sector and the company's backlog and sales pipeline suggest resilience and potential for recovery as market conditions improve.The strategic acquisition of Big Lake Lumber is a noteworthy development, potentially offering synergies and market expansion that could enhance future revenue streams. The focus on niche markets where Star Equity has built expertise and reputation could provide a competitive advantage and drive organic growth despite current economic pressures.Investors may find the proactive management measures, such as the emphasis on pricing discipline and business mix optimization, reassuring. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions by exploring acquisitions and opportunities in new industries and the Investments division, demonstrates a forward-looking approach that could be pivotal for long-term growth. Economist The reported financials of Star Equity Holdings serve as a microcosm of the broader economic environment, particularly the construction sector's sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations and economic cycles. The company's experience of delayed projects due to credit tightening reflects a common challenge in capital-intensive industries during periods of monetary contraction.The company's strategic response to these macroeconomic factors, including improved pricing discipline and cost management, are essential for maintaining profitability in a high-interest rate environment. The improved cash position and reduced debt load enhance the company's financial flexibility, which is particularly valuable in uncertain economic times as it provides a buffer against potential downturns.Investors should be cognizant of the cyclical nature of the construction industry and the potential for a rebound as economic conditions stabilize. The company's focus on niche markets and strategic acquisitions could position it well for capitalizing on such a rebound, but it is also important to monitor the sustainability of the company's financial improvements and the execution of its growth strategy. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM Ended 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million Generated positive cash flow from operations of $2.7 million in 2023 OLD GREENWICH, Conn., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Star Equity Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: STRR; STRRP) (“Star Equity” or the “Company”), a diversified holding company, reported today its financial results for the fourth quarter (Q4) and fiscal year (FY) ended December 31, 2023. All 2023 and 2022 amounts in this release are unaudited. Following the sale of our Digirad Health business on May 4, 2023, all financial results for the 2023 and 2022 reporting periods, unless stated otherwise, relate to continuing operations, which currently include two divisions: Construction and Investments. Q4 2023 Financial Highlights vs. Q4 2022 (unaudited) Revenues decreased by 19.8% to $14.1 million from $17.6 million.Gross profit decreased by 47.0% to $2.9 million from $5.4 million.Net income from continuing operations was $1.8 million (or $0.11 income per basic and diluted share) compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.9 million (or $0.06 income per basic and diluted share).Non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $0.4 million (or $0.02 loss per basic and diluted share), as compared to adjusted net income of $0.5 million (or $0.03 income per basic and diluted share).Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $0.1 million versus a gain of $0.9 million. FY 2023 Financial Highlights vs. FY 2022 (unaudited) Revenues decreased by 19.9% to $45.8 million from $57.1 million.Gross profit decreased by 3.6% to $11.9 million from $12.4 million.Net loss from continuing operations was $1.9 million (or $0.12 loss per basic and diluted share) compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $5.8 million (or $0.40 loss per basic and $0.39 loss per diluted share).Non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million (or $0.10 loss per basic and diluted share) compared to net loss of $2.5 million (or $0.17 loss per basic and diluted share).Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a loss of $0.2 million compared to a loss of $0.1 million.As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents increased to $18.9 million versus $4.5 million at December 31, 2022.Generated a positive cash inflow from continuing operations of $2.7 million versus an outflow of $3.9 million.Debt decreased to $2.0 million at December 31, 2023 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2022. Rick Coleman, Chief Executive Officer, noted, “In the fourth quarter of 2023, Construction revenue and gross profit declined versus the fourth quarter of 2022. However, for the full year 2023, we significantly improved Construction gross margins from 21.6% to 26.0% due to strong pricing discipline and an improved business mix. Credit tightening in the second half of 2023 caused delays in some commercial projects pushing revenue into 2024. However, single-family residential activity and our overall backlog and sales pipeline remained robust due to our focus on select niche markets where we’ve built significant expertise and a strong reputation.” Mr. Coleman continued, “In addition, we closed the accretive Big Lake Lumber bolt-on acquisition in the fourth quarter and have integrated it into our Glenbrook operation. During the coming quarters we will continue to evaluate Construction division acquisition opportunities to augment our organic growth strategy, and will also explore potential acquisitions in new industries, and opportunities in our Investments division.” Revenues The Company’s Q4 2023 revenues decreased 19.8% to $14.1 million from $17.6 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year due primarily to Construction division project delays. Revenues in $ thousands (Unaudited) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 % change FY 2023 FY 2022 % changeConstruction $14,111 $17,605 (19.8)% $45,785 $57,149 (19.9)%Investments 159 158 0.6% 564 633 (10.9)%Intersegment elimination (159) (158) 0.6% (564) (633) —%Total Revenues $14,111 $17,605 (19.8)% $45,785 $57,149 (19.9)% Construction Q4 2023 and FY 2023 revenues decreased 19.8% and 19.9%, respectively, versus the prior year periods. The decrease in revenues reflects lower revenues at KBS and EBGL related to slower business activity due to economic headwinds such as higher interest rates. We believe these economic effects are temporary and our backlog and sales pipeline remain strong. Gross Profit The Company’s consolidated Q4 2023 gross profit decreased 47.0% to $2.9 million from $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year due to lower revenues in the Construction division.

FY 2023 Construction gross profit decreased 4.0% from the prior year period also due to lower revenue. However, we have significantly increased prices to offset higher input costs and have seen an improvement in our gross margin percentage in 2023. Our backlog and sales pipeline remain strong despite economic headwinds. Operating Expenses Q4 2023 sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $1.0 million versus Q4 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased in Q4 2023 to 22.8% versus 23.9% in Q4 2022. FY 2023 SG&A expenses increased $0.3 million or 2.4%, versus the prior year, primarily due to increased legal and outside services expenses related to the sale of Digirad Health, the acquisition of Big Lake Lumber, and our Investments division-related activities. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased in FY 2023 to 31.8% versus 24.8% in FY 2022 as operating expenses were higher on a lower revenue base. Net Income/Loss Q4 2023 net income from continuing operations was $1.8 million, or $0.11 income per basic and diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.9 million, or $0.06 income per basic and diluted share, in the same period of the prior year. Q4 2023 non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $0.4 million, or $0.02 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.5 million, or $0.03 income per basic and diluted share, in the same period of the prior year. FY 2023 net loss from continuing operations was $1.9 million, or $0.12 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $5.8 million, or $0.40 loss per basic and diluted share in FY 2022. FY 2023 non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million, or $0.10 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to an adjusted non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $2.5 million, or $0.17 loss per basic and diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA Q4 2023 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $0.1 million from a gain of $0.9 million in the same quarter of the prior year due to decreased gross profit at our Construction division. FY 2023 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $0.2 million, compared to a loss of $0.1 million in FY 2022, primarily due to decreased gross profit at our Construction division resulting from slower business activity, which we believe is temporary. Operating Cash Flow Q4 2023 cash flow from consolidated operations was an inflow of $0.0 million, compared to an outflow of $3.6 million for the same period in the prior year. FY 2023 cash flow from operations was an inflow of $2.7 million, compared to an outflow of $3.9 million for FY 2022. The improvement in cash flow from operating activities is attributable to strong collections at our Construction division and lower cash expenditure for working capital. Preferred Stock In each quarter of 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to holders of the Company’s 10% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, representing $1.00 per share on an annual basis.

Financial Analyst The report from BTCS Inc. highlights a remarkable turnaround with a net income of $7.8 million in 2023, in contrast to a net loss in the previous year. This pivot to profitability is a positive signal for investors, reflecting the company's ability to adapt to new accounting standards and manage its finances amidst the volatile cryptocurrency market. The increase in cash and crypto value further underlines the company's financial health and provides a cushion against market fluctuations.However, the decrease in revenue raises questions about the company's operational efficiency and market strategy. While the surge in crypto market prices has benefited the fourth quarter, it's important to assess the sustainability of this growth. Investors should monitor the company's ability to leverage its technological advancements, like StakeSeeker and Builder+ and whether these can translate into consistent revenue streams independent of market volatility. Blockchain Technology Expert BTCS Inc.'s strategic focus on blockchain infrastructure and the launch of innovative products like StakeSeeker and Builder+ reflect a commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain technology. The company's in-house management of validator nodes is a strategic move to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. The development of ChainQ, an AI-enhanced data analytics platform, indicates BTCS's dedication to providing value-added services in the blockchain space.While these initiatives are promising, the real test lies in their market adoption and ability to generate revenue. As the blockchain industry continues to mature, BTCS's emphasis on non-custodial staking and block optimization could position it well within the competitive landscape. However, the long-term success of these services will depend on user adoption, network effects and the company's ability to maintain a technological edge. Market Research Analyst The approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the anticipation of Ethereum ETFs have a profound impact on market dynamics, potentially increasing the liquidity and accessibility of cryptocurrencies for a broader range of investors. BTCS's financial success and strategic initiatives could be further bolstered by these developments. The Dencun Hardfork of the Ethereum network, which aims to improve functionality and efficiency, is particularly relevant to BTCS's operations, as the company is actively engaged in Ethereum blockchain infrastructure.Investors should consider the potential for these market dynamics to drive growth in the blockchain sector and how companies like BTCS can capitalize on them. While the current outlook appears optimistic, investors must also remain cautious of the inherent risks associated with the rapidly evolving blockchain technology landscape and regulatory environment. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM 2023 Record Net Income of $7.8m or $0.55 per share Silver Spring, MD, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) (“BTCS” or the “Company”), a blockchain technology-focused company, announced its results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023”). 2023 Financial Highlights & 2024 Preliminary Insights Revenue: $1.3 million in 2023 revenue, down 20% from $1.7 million in 2022.

The ongoing rally in crypto prices through early 2024 has further elevated the value of our crypto assets. Management Commentary In 2023, our strategic initiatives delivered strong results, culminating in significant momentum as we moved into 2024. The fair market value of our cryptocurrency assets saw a remarkable doubling over the past year, with an additional increase of 42% to $35.7 million by March 19, 2024. This growth not only demonstrates our adeptness at navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market but also sets the stage for enhanced revenue prospects in 2024, bolstering our financial strength and future growth. StakeSeeker: In January 2023 we launched StakeSeeker (beta), our crypto analytics and non-custodial staking-as-a-service platform. Our strategy aims to increase our fee-based revenue from rewards earned on assets delegated to our nodes. Moreover, we’re exploring the introduction of Ethereum non-custodial staking to StakeSeeker in 2024, aiming to diversify and scale our revenue streams further. Builder+: In February 2024, we introduced “Builder+”, our innovative Ethereum block builder. Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, Builder+ optimizes block construction for on-chain validation, designed to enhance validator earnings and compete in a market for transaction gas fees. Builder+ represents an extension of our core Ethereum blockchain infrastructure operations, aimed at driving scalable revenue growth. ChainQ: Recognizing the demand for accessible on-chain data, we announced the development of “ChainQ”, an AI-enhanced blockchain data and analytics platform which we plan to launch in 2024. Through comprehensive indexing of public blockchain data from our Blockchain Infrastructure operations, ChainQ is intended to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use platform for accessing on-chain information. We continue to dedicate efforts towards the research and development of ChainQ. Blockchain Infrastructure: Efficiency enhancement in our blockchain infrastructure operations was a key focus in 2023. By bringing the full monitoring and maintenance of our validator nodes in-house, we’ve reduced our dependency on external service providers, thereby cutting costs and paving the way for new value-added initiatives such as Builder+ and ChainQ. At BTCS, we firmly believe in the transformative potential of blockchain technologies, and we’re dedicated to being at the forefront of its advancement. Our belief in blockchain's revolutionary impact is steadfast, and we are advocates for its expanded adoption in both the public and private spheres. We are filled with optimism for what the future holds and are eager to spearhead innovations that bolster the value we deliver to our shareholders. Industry Highlights Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum ETFs Impact on Market DynamicsIn 2023, the crypto industry experienced a pivotal moment with the SEC’s long-awaited approval of Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), marking a significant step towards blending digital currencies with mainstream financial mechanisms. This development, alongside the anticipation for Ethereum (ETH) ETFs in 2024, has ignited a bullish momentum across the cryptocurrency markets, showcasing a robust wave of optimism among investors. These ETFs serve as crucial bridges, connecting the traditional financial world with the crypto ecosystem, thereby facilitating a smoother entry for conventional investors into crypto assets. The positive nature of Bitcoin ETF approvals have uplifted the broader crypto market and spurred a wave of innovation and investment in alternative Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols. This domino effect is catalyzing growth throughout the blockchain space, as the influx of traditional investment encourages the development of new technologies and solutions. The crypto ecosystem stands at the brink of accelerated expansion, promising an era of heightened accessibility, innovation, and opportunity, driven by the symbiotic relationship between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. Ethereum’s Evolution: Network Upgrades Fuelling Future AdoptionThe Ethereum network successfully completed major and transformative upgrade on March 13 with the “Dencun Hardfork”. The upgrade should improve network functionality and bolster the efficiency of Layer-2 blockchain infrastructures, particularly by enhancing data storage capabilities. Such improvements are expected to facilitate a more streamlined and cost-effective environment for handling layer-2 transaction fees, signifying a leap forward in Ethereum’s technological evolution. Moreover, Ethereum’s ecosystem is demonstrating remarkable growth and security through its staking mechanism, with a current staking ratio of 26%. This translates into 31.4 million ETH staked out of all eligible tokens, underscoring a robust validator market. The active participation of the community in staking not only underscores their commitment to the network's security and decentralization but also highlights the thriving nature of Ethereum's validator market. This engagement is pivotal in bolstering the network's security and fostering a more decentralized ecosystem. Additionally, Ethereum is experiencing a noteworthy phase of deflation, further testament to its evolving economic model and its implications for value creation within the network. This deflationary trend is indicative of a maturing ecosystem that is not only attracting investment and participation but is also setting a precedent for sustainable growth and adoption in the broader blockchain community. These developments collectively signal Ethereum's continued expansion and its role in driving innovation, adoption, and value creation in the digital asset space. Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-08 Impact: The early adoption of ASU No. 2023-08 brought about a fundamental shift in how we account for our crypto assets on our financial statements, allowing us to now recognize them at their fair market value compared to previously recording them at their lowest post-acquisition price. This change enables the inclusion of unrealized gains or losses on crypto assets directly in our financial results, offering a more accurate representation of our operational health. We believe that the specified changes in financial reporting stemming from the new accounting guidance better reflect the economic realities of the Company’s business model and the value of the crypto assets held, enhancing the transparency and accuracy of the financial statements.

Market Research Analyst The partnership between Foresight Autonomous Holdings Ltd. and SoftBank, marked by the successful completion of the proof of concept (POC) for Eye-Net's products, signifies a strategic move into the Japanese market. This collaboration aligns with the growing demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the integration of 5G technology which is pivotal for real-time data transmission in autonomous vehicles. The focus on collision prevention technology is timely, considering the increasing vehicle automation levels and Japan's commitment to reducing road traffic accidents.Eye-Net's foray, supported by SoftBank's robust network and business partners, could potentially disrupt the ADAS market in Japan.

Financial Analyst The announcement of the commercial validation phase for Eye-Net's technology in collaboration with SoftBank can be seen as a positive signal for investors in Foresight Autonomous Holdings. The ability of Eye-Net's technology to meet predefined key performance indicators and its compatibility with both LTE and 5G networks are critical factors that could influence the adoption rate of their collision prevention solutions.

Automotive Technology Expert The integration of Eye-Net's location services into SoftBank's multi-access edge computing (MEC) infrastructure is a significant technical achievement. MEC allows for low-latency applications which are essential for the real-time functionality required in collision prevention systems.

The Notes are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are offered to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Hilton's decision to issue $1.0 billion in Senior Notes is a strategic move to optimize its capital structure. By earmarking funds for the repayment of existing debt and potential investments and acquisitions, the company is positioning itself to maintain a healthy liquidity profile while pursuing growth opportunities. The use of the proceeds indicates a proactive approach to managing its debt obligations and a focus on strategic expansion, which are key factors in assessing a company's financial health and future prospects.Investors should note that the issuance of unregistered securities limits the potential buyer pool to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons, which may impact the liquidity and marketability of these notes. However, this approach allows Hilton to access capital more quickly and with potentially lower costs than a public offering, reflecting a savvy use of regulatory exemptions to benefit its financial strategy.

Hilton's move to issue Senior Notes suggests anticipation of favorable market conditions and a readiness to capitalize on strategic opportunities. It is indicative of the company's confidence in its ability to generate future revenue streams capable of servicing this new debt.From a market perspective, this issuance could signal Hilton's assessment that the cost of borrowing is attractive relative to the potential return on investments made with the proceeds. This can be seen as a positive sign of the company's growth trajectory and operational efficiency, which could influence investor sentiment and the stock's performance in the hospitality sector. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the issuance of the Senior Notes by Hilton is complex, involving exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S indicates a targeted approach to fundraising, which is tailored to sophisticated investors capable of evaluating the risks associated with unregistered securities.For stakeholders, it's important to understand the legal implications of such a financial instrument. The limited disclosure requirements for private placements compared to public offerings can result in less transparency for investors. However, the compliance with Rule 135c for this announcement helps ensure that the company is adhering to the legal standards for communication about unregistered securities offerings. 03/22/2024 - 08:26 AM MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) (“Hilton”) announced today that its indirect subsidiary Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc. (the “Issuer”) intends to offer $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s Senior Notes due 2029 and Senior Notes due 2032 (collectively, the “Notes”).

Servotronics Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results,2024-03-22T12:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Servotronics, Inc. (SVT) reports robust financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, showcasing a 46.1% increase in revenues and a significant improvement in gross profit margins.

Despite challenges, Servotronics aims for further financial improvements in the upcoming year.","Servotronics Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Servotronics, Inc. (SVT) reports robust financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, showcasing a 46.1% increase in revenues and a significant improvement in gross profit margins. The company's focus on core aerospace markets has led to increased production output, cost control, and margin enhancement. Despite challenges, Servotronics aims for further financial improvements in the upcoming year. Positive Revenue surged by 46.1% to $12.3 million in Q4 2023 compared to $8.4 million in Q4 2022. Gross profit rose by 326.1% to $2.7 million, with a gross margin of 22.2% in Q4 2023. Operating income increased by $2.0 million, driven by revenue and gross profit growth. Net income from continuing operations was $0.4 million in Q4 2023 compared to a loss of $(1.2) million in Q4 2022. Full-year sales grew by 24.0% to $43.6 million in 2023, with improved gross margins and reduced operating losses. SG&A costs increased due to one-time expenses related to corporate restructuring and consulting costs. Servotronics' CFO highlighted the focus on strengthening the financial position post divestiture of the CPG segment. The company aims for strong year-over-year revenue growth and a return to annual profitability in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 46% top-line growth in the fourth quarter for Servotronics is a robust indicator of demand for the company's products, particularly in the aerospace sector. A 1700 basis point increase in gross margin is a significant improvement, showing enhanced operational efficiencies and a successful shift in the company's strategy post the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group. The consistent SG&A costs despite the increase in revenue suggest disciplined cost management. However, the increase in interest expense by 566.7% is a red flag that may indicate higher debt levels or borrowing costs, which could impact future profitability.Investors should note the operational pivot towards the core aerospace market, which appears to have paid dividends in the short term. The reported net income from continuing operations contrasts positively with the net loss from the previous year, suggesting a turnaround in financial health. However, the increase in working capital driven by accounts receivable growth could be a double-edged sword, potentially reflecting either efficient sales growth or a lag in cash collections, which needs careful monitoring. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Servotronics' focus on the commercial aerospace market taps into an industry on the rebound as global travel recovers post-pandemic. Long-term contracts with key customers provide a stable revenue base and visibility into future sales, which is attractive for investors. The company's ability to increase production output to meet customer demands is a competitive advantage that could lead to market share gains.However, the increased R&D costs, while potentially beneficial for future innovation, might pressure short-term margins if not managed effectively. Investors should weigh the potential for innovation-driven growth against the immediate financial impact. The company's optimism for steady improvements in quarterly revenue throughout 2024 suggests confidence in sustained market demand, which could be a positive signal for future performance. Tax Analyst The reported income tax expense in 2023, as opposed to a tax benefit in 2022, is indicative of the changes in the company's taxable income situation. The valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets suggest a conservative approach to tax asset recognition, possibly reflecting management's uncertainty about future profitability. If these allowances reverse, it could provide a future tax shield, benefiting net income. Investors should be aware of the potential impact of these tax positions on future earnings.Moreover, the mention of expected reversal of these allowances to offset future taxable income implies management's confidence in returning to profitability. This tax strategy could be a lever for enhancing future earnings, yet it's contingent on the company's ability to generate consistent taxable income. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM -- Continued robust market demand results in 46% top-line growth in the fourth quarter ---- Gross margin rose 1700 basis points compared to prior-year quarter driven by higher volumes -- ELMA, N.Y., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Servotronics, Inc. (NYSE American – SVT), a designer and manufacturer of servo-control components and other advanced technology products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. As previously announced, during the third quarter, the Company sold the assets of The Ontario Knife Company and divested the Consumer Products Group (CPG) business segment. Accordingly, the financial results of the CPG segment have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all financial results are based on the results from continuing operations, comprised of the Company's servo-control business. Highlights for the fourth quarter financial results include: Revenues of $12.3 million, up 46.1% from $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by significantly higher volumes, as units shipped increased by 49.5%.Gross profit improved 326.1% to $2.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in the fourth quarter, up significantly from $0.6 million, or 7.6% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was the result of increased volumes and improved operational efficiencies.Operating income improved by $2.0 million, or 136.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by revenue and gross profit growth, as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs remained consistent.Net income from continuing operations was $0.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $(1.2) million, or ($0.48) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022.Servotronics has continued to operate in line with its long-term strategy of increasing sales volumes in key end markets, developing its people, improving operational efficiencies, and assuring quality products and services. These efforts have resulted in strong performance for the second half of 2023 consistent with management expectations as previously communicated. ""2023 was a year of transformation and stabilization for Servotronics, as our team overcame challenges and reshaped the Company with a focus on our core aerospace markets,"" said Chief Executive Officer Bill Farrell. ""We have been able to significantly increase our production output to meet customer demands while controlling costs and improving margins. I am incredibly proud of the team's accomplishments in 2023 and we aim for further improvements in our financial results in the coming year."" Fourth Quarter Business Results (from Continuing Operations): 000's Three Months Ended Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Change Revenue $ 12,338 $ 8,446 $ 3,892 46.1 % Cost of goods sold 9,594 7,802 1,792 23.0 % Gross Profit 2,744 644 2,100 326.1 % Gross Margin 22.2 % 7.6 % 14.6 % SG&A Expenses 2,209 2,129 80 3.8 % as a % of Revenue 17.9 % 25.2 % -7.3 % Operating Income (Loss) 535 (1,485) 2,020 136.0 % Operating Margin 4.3 % -17.6 % 21.9 % Interest Expense (120) (18) (102) 566.7 % Tax (Expense)/Benefit (36) 336 (372) -110.7 % Net Income (Loss) $ 379 $ (1,167) $ 1,546 Highlights for the full-year financial results from Continuing Operations include the following: Sequentially higher quarterly sales resulting in annual sales growth of 24.0% to $43.6 million for 2023, from $35.2 million in 2022 driven by strong demand in the commercial aerospace market, with continued benefits of long-term contracts with key customers and recovering production volumes.Consolidated gross profit was $7.8 million, or 17.9% of revenue in 2023, compared with $5.6 million, or 15.8% for 2022. Gross margins were driven by significant increases in volume and increased production output, partially offset by customer and product mix.SG&A costs increased to $9.9 million, or 22.7% in 2023, from $8.1 million, or 22.9% for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by significant one-time costs of approximately of $1.2 million relating to the proxy contest, corporate restructuring and consulting costs, and liquidity/refinancing costs that did not occur in 2022, along with higher research and development costs driven by increased customer project activity.Operating loss improved 15.4% to a loss of ($2.1) million from a loss of ($2.5) million in 2022. The reduction in operating loss was driven by the sales growth and higher gross profit, mostly offset by an increase in one-time SG&A costs.Income tax expense was ($1.1) million compared to a benefit of $0.6 million in 2022, due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in 2023. These allowances are expected to reverse and result in the deferred tax assets offsetting future taxable income.Net loss for the year was $3.5 million, or a loss of ($1.44) per diluted share in 2023, compared to net loss of $2.1 million, or a loss of ($0.87) per diluted share, in 2022.Servotronics' Chief Financial Officer Rob Fraass commented, ""The Company is focused on strengthening our financial position post divestiture of the CPG business segment, as evidenced by improvements in our working capital during the second half of 2023, and the new asset-based credit facility we secured earlier this year. We believe our liquidity is adequate to support our strategic growth."" Servotronics negative cash flow from operations of ($3.8) million for 2023 was driven primarily by higher accounts receivable resulting from the significant sales growth during the second half of 2023, compared to ($0.3) million for 2022. Working capital (excluding cash and discontinued operation) in 2023 increased $1.2 million compared to 2022, driven by accounts receivable growth as inventory remained consistent. Mr. Farrell concluded, ""Our fourth quarter performance is a testament to our commitment to executing on our strategic objectives and creating value for all our stakeholders. As we look ahead to 2024, we are optimistic for a strong year-over-year revenue growth each quarter and a return to annual profitability. Similar to 2023, we expect quarterly revenue to see steady improvements as the year unfolds.""

The Board of Directors approved the transaction after a comprehensive review to maximize value for unitholders. Additionally, Summit plans to seek approval from unitholders to convert to a C-Corp, aiming to enhance trading liquidity and attract more investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of Summit Midstream Utica, LLC's assets to MPLX LP for $625 million represents a significant liquidity event for Summit Midstream Partners, LP. This transaction, resulting from a strategic review, indicates a proactive approach by Summit's Board to optimize asset value and streamline operations. The cash influx from the sale could be used to reduce debt, reinvest in core operations, or distribute to unitholders, each of which could have varying implications for the company's financial health and stock valuation.Furthermore, the transition from a limited partnership to a C-Corporation is a strategic move that could broaden the appeal to a wider range of investors, particularly those who are averse to the tax complexities associated with partnerships. This could potentially enhance trading liquidity and market capitalization. However, the impact on the stock will depend on the market's perception of the long-term benefits of this structural change versus the immediate dilutive effects of potential tax consequences. Market Research Analyst The sale of assets to MPLX and the subsequent corporate restructuring reflect a broader industry trend where energy companies are simplifying their business models to attract investment. This move by Summit is likely to be well-received by the market, as it suggests a clear strategy focused on maximizing shareholder value. The expanded investor base due to the C-Corp conversion could lead to increased demand for Summit's shares.It is important to monitor how the market responds to Summit's strategic decisions. If seen as a positive step towards a more focused business model, it could encourage similar transactions within the industry, potentially leading to consolidation. However, the actual impact on Summit's market position will depend on the execution of these strategic changes and the company's ability to effectively communicate the long-term benefits to its current and prospective investors. Energy Sector Analyst The divestiture of Summit's interests in Ohio Gathering aligns with a trend in the energy sector towards consolidation and optimization of assets. MPLX's acquisition of these assets could lead to operational synergies and enhance MPLX's position in the Utica region. For Summit, the strategic focus post-divestiture will likely shift towards maximizing the performance of its remaining assets.The energy sector is sensitive to changes in market dynamics, regulatory environments and commodity prices. Summit's decision to convert to a C-Corp could be seen as an attempt to mitigate some of these risks by attracting a more stable investor base. The outcome of this decision will be critical for Summit's long-term strategy, particularly in how it manages the balance between capital discipline and growth opportunities in a volatile energy market. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM Concludes Strategic Alternatives Process; Plans to Seek Approval from Unitholders to Convert to a C-Corp HOUSTON, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: SMLP) (""Summit"", ""SMLP"" or the ""Partnership"") announced today the sale of Summit Midstream Utica, LLC, which includes its approximately 36% interest in Ohio Gathering Company, LLC (""OGC""), approximately 38% interest in Ohio Condensate Company, LLC (""OCC"", collectively with OGC, ""Ohio Gathering"") and wholly owned Utica assets (collectively, ""Utica Position"") to a subsidiary of MPLX LP (""MPLX"") for $625 million in cash (the ""Utica Divestiture""). This transaction is the culmination of the comprehensive strategic review process undertaken by the Summit Board of Directors (the ""Board""), in consultation with external advisors, that was publicly announced on October 3, 2023. As part of this process, the Board considered a wide range of opportunities to maximize value for unitholders, including an outright sale of Summit and other divestiture and partnership-level transactions. The Utica Divestiture and conclusion of the strategic review were unanimously approved by the Board. The Board and management team have completed their active process, but will remain open to all potential value-enhancing transactions. In connection with the Company's strategic review, the Board also evaluated various corporate structures to determine how to drive the greatest long-term value for unitholders. The Board believes converting to a C-Corp positions the Company to maximize value by enhancing trading liquidity, greatly expanding the universe of potential investors and optimizing the long-term tax consequences to unitholders. The Board and management plan to seek approval from Summit unitholders to convert the Partnership to a C-Corp at a Special Meeting later this year. Summit expects to file a proxy statement to provide unitholders with additional information about the rationale and benefits of the C-Corp conversion in advance of the Special Meeting. Transaction Highlights Delivers significant value and dramatically improves credit profile and financial flexibilityReduces Summit's current net leverage by 1.5x to sub-4.0x, furthering progress toward achieving 3.5x net leverage targetIncreases liquidity with undrawn $400 million credit facility and more than $325 million of unrestricted cashShifts Summit's portfolio to approximately 55% crude oil-oriented basinsAccelerates timing of potential preferred equity and common equity distributionsPositions Summit to continue to fund and execute on organic growth projects including further commercialization of Double E and potential synergistic bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in its Rockies segmentEnables Summit to further reduce cost of capital in elevated interest rate environmentRevised pro forma 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $185 million to $220 million1Management Commentary Heath Deneke, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, commented, ""We are pleased to announce this compelling transaction with MPLX, which is the result of a thorough strategic review, and generates substantial value creation opportunities for our unitholders. MPLX has been a great joint venture partner and operator of the OGC and OCC assets since Summit entered the Utica Shale in 2014 and we thank both MPLX and our valued Summit employees for their hard work and dedication to the partnership and producer customers in the region. As we evaluate the strategic and commercial opportunities for our existing assets, we believe there are several value optimizing strategies to pursue to further build scale, particularly in our Permian and Rockies segments. We continue to believe in the sizeable growth potential of the Delaware Basin and expect to further commercialize Double E's available pipeline capacity. We are confident there are additional commercial opportunities, similar to the recently announced Janus Processing Plant connection, that will continue to drive incremental free cash flow and the value of the pipeline. Further, we believe the DJ Basin and Williston Basin remain fragmented with a sizeable opportunity to pursue value-accretive and synergistic bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. With a more focused portfolio and improved credit profile following completion of the transaction, we will be even better positioned to pursue those opportunities, expanding our footprint and service offerings in those regions. We also believe the transaction accelerates our ability to potentially resume preferred and common equity distributions in the near future as we rebuild scale and achieve our longer-term net leverage targets.""

Advisors RBC Capital Markets, LLC served as financial advisor for the Utica Transaction and Locke Lord L.L.P. served as legal advisor to Summit. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures SMLP reports financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). SMLP also presents Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA SMLP defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, SMLP's proportional Adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees, adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, unit-based and noncash compensation, impairments, items of income or loss that SMLP characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations and other noncash expenses or losses, income tax benefit, income (loss) from equity method investees and other noncash income or gains. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other entities in SMLP's industry, SMLP's definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby diminishing its utility. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating SMLP's financial performance. Furthermore, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA may provide external users of SMLP's financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of SMLP's core ongoing business. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure to assess: the ability of SMLP's assets to generate cash sufficient to make future potential cash distributions and support SMLP's indebtedness;the financial performance of SMLP's assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;SMLP's operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure;the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; andthe financial performance of SMLP's assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under SMLP's gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other income or expense items that SMLP characterizes as unrepresentative of SMLP's ongoing operations.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of SMLP's results as reported under GAAP. For example: certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as an entity's cost of capital and tax structure;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect SMLP's cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, SMLP's working capital needs; andalthough depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.SMLP compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measures, understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into SMLP's decision-making process. SMLP does not provide the GAAP financial measure of net income or loss on a forward-looking basis because SMLP is unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including, but not limited to, (i) income or loss from equity method investees and (ii) asset impairments. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond SMLP's control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on SMLP's GAAP performance could vary materially based on a variety of acceptable management assumptions. About Summit Midstream Partners, LP SMLP is a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States.

The company aims to showcase its research at the Global Longevity Federation Conference, highlighting positive data on telomere extensions in human cell lines. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The pre-clinical results of Telomir Pharmaceuticals' lead product, Telomir-1, suggest a potential breakthrough in the field of age-related disease treatment. By targeting the elongation of telomeres, the company is tapping into a critical aspect of cellular aging. Telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, naturally shorten as cells divide and their length is a biomarker of cellular aging. The ability to elongate these telomeres could theoretically delay senescence, the process that leads to the deterioration of cell function.From a medical research perspective, the implications are significant. If Telomir-1 can indeed stimulate stem cell renewal and treat conditions like osteoarthritis, it would mark a substantial advancement in regenerative medicine. However, it is essential to approach these results with cautious optimism. The transition from pre-clinical to clinical efficacy is fraught with challenges and many compounds fail to demonstrate the same promise in humans as they do in cell lines. Furthermore, the long-term effects of artificially elongating telomeres are not yet fully understood and could pose unforeseen risks. Biotech Financial Analyst Investors in the biotechnology sector pay close attention to pre-clinical trial results, such as those reported by Telomir Pharmaceuticals, because they can significantly impact a company's valuation. The positive results surrounding Telomir-1 have the potential to generate investor interest and raise the stock's profile. However, it is important to note that the company is still in the pre-clinical stage and the road to commercialization is long and uncertain. The costs of advancing to clinical trials can be substantial and there is no guarantee of a successful outcome.Moreover, the market for anti-aging treatments is both highly lucrative and extremely competitive. A successful entry by Telomir-1 could capture a significant share of this market, but until more definitive clinical data is available, the financial implications remain speculative. Investors should monitor subsequent trial phases closely, as these will provide more concrete evidence of the drug's potential and its impact on Telomir's financial future. Regulatory Affairs Specialist The journey from pre-clinical research to a marketable pharmaceutical product is heavily regulated to ensure safety and efficacy. For Telomir-1 to reach the market, it must pass through a series of clinical trials and receive approval from regulatory bodies such as the FDA. The process is designed to protect patients from potential adverse effects and to ensure that any marketed drug provides the claimed benefits.While the pre-clinical data is promising, Telomir Pharmaceuticals will need to demonstrate consistent results in human trials. Regulatory bodies will scrutinize the data for statistical significance, safety and the balance of risks versus benefits. Given the novelty of telomere extension as a therapeutic approach, the regulatory pathway may be particularly stringent. The company must be prepared for a rigorous examination of their data and possibly additional studies to explore long-term effects and potential risks associated with telomere elongation. 03/22/2024 - 08:30 AM Poster presentation delivers pre-clinical results that demonstrate that its lead development product, Telomir-1, elongates telomere caps on human normal embryonic fibroblast cells The New York Times reports telomere shortening a major contributor to aging BALTIMORE, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:TELO) (“Telomir” or the “Company”), a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Telomir-1 as the first novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps in order to potentially address age-related conditions, today announced that Telomir and Danielle R. Baker, Ph.D., of Frontage Laboratories will present a scientific poster presentation at the Global Longevity Federation Conference in Las Vegas on March 26th at 2 pm EDT. The poster will present new data regarding the effect of Telomir-1 on telomere length in three human cell lines. The basic theory behind Telomir’s research is the concept that elongating telomeres, which are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that protect chromosomes from becoming frayed or tangled, could result in stimulating stem cell renewal and thus the treatment of age-related conditions like osteoarthritis. This presentation builds on the data that was presented at the National University Health System of Singapore (NUHS) Centre for Healthy Longevity Conference 2024 in February. The poster, titled “Telomir-1 Induces Telomere Extensions in Primary Human Cell Strains,” will be presented by Dr. Baker and will include new data that further demonstrates that total telomere length was augmented following various Telomir-1 treatments, supporting the hypothesis that Telomir-1 elongates telomeres. Telomir believes this research is important and timely as society looks to deal with the challenges associated with aging. As reported in a March 20, 2024, article in The New York Times, titled “Why Do We Age?,” “as we age, telomere shortening becomes a problem, particularly in stem cells, which the body uses to replenish skin, blood and other tissue.” Telomir is working to develop and commercialize Telomir-1 which it believes will elongate telomeres and potentially reversing age-related conditions. “Presenting our poster at the Global Longevity Federation conference offers a significant opportunity for our team to showcase the potential for Telomir-1. Our poster will include new data that demonstrates the results we have had with our lead development product which supports that Telomir-1 may potentially treat age-related conditions and prolong human life,” stated Chris Chapman, MD, Co-founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Telomir Pharmaceuticals. “Our pre-clinical results thus far have been extremely encouraging and by presenting our data at the conference we are putting ourselves at the forefront of the longevity community.” Dr. Michael Roizen, Special Advisor to Telomir Pharmaceuticals, added, “As we continue to present new and promising data, we are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about the opportunity that Telomir-1 may have in combating the diseases of aging. With the prospect for additional studies with Telomir-1 in the near future, we are optimistic that we will continue to provide encouraging insights to the longevity and aging community.” Stephen Gacheru, Vice President, cell & gene therapy operations BGCT at Frontage Laboratories, added, “The team is elated to contribute to the revelation that Telomir-1 modulates telomerase activity, leading to the extension of telomeres. This discovery unveils Telomir-1's steadfast promise in aging and the therapeutic intervention of telomere-associated diseases."" The conference will be hosted by the Academy for Health and Lifespan Research, a distinguished entity devoted to targeting aging as a root cause of all age-related disorders, supporting basic and translational research, while driving change and educating the public. Through research and strategic implementations, the Academy strives to expedite collaboration between top scientists, laboratories, academic institutions and drug companies in order to realize breakthroughs in longevity research and be accessible to all.

(Nasdaq:TELO) is a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Telomir-1 as the first novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps in order to potentially reverse age-related conditions. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents us with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop and commercialize Telomir-1 (which is proposed to be dosed orally) for hemochromatosis (iron overload) and ultimately post-chemotherapy recovery and a broader range of other age-related inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis. Individuals with elongated telomeres eat healthier, meditate, participate in more social activities with friends, exercise moderately, have sex regularly, and sleep 6-8 hours a night. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute (Sweden) awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.

The warrants will become exercisable after six months, with an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent move by Sangamo Therapeutics to raise capital through a securities purchase agreement is a strategic financial decision that can have notable implications for the company's liquidity and future growth initiatives. The sale of common stock and warrants is a common method for biotech firms to secure funding without taking on debt. However, the offering price at $0.84 for each share and warrant, which is priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules, signals a potential dilutive effect for current shareholders. The exercise price of $1.00 for the warrants, which is above the offering price, could be seen as an incentive for investors, but also suggests a management expectation of stock price appreciation.From a financial perspective, the gross proceeds of approximately $24 million, before fees and expenses, provide a cash infusion that could support Sangamo's R&D efforts, particularly in the costly field of genomic medicine. Investors will be keen to monitor how effectively this capital is deployed, as it could lead to advancements in the company's pipeline or strategic partnerships. It is important to note that while such capital raises are essential for biotech companies, they also increase the company's outstanding shares, potentially diluting the value for existing shareholders in the short term. Long-term benefits, however, could materialize if the funds lead to successful product development and commercialization. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive, with companies like Sangamo Therapeutics often requiring substantial funding to advance their research and clinical trials. The decision to issue new shares and warrants is reflective of the ongoing need for liquidity to sustain operations and invest in innovation. The market's reaction to such offerings can vary, with immediate impacts on stock price and investor sentiment often hinging on the perceived value of the investment and confidence in the company's future prospects.Given the exercise price is set at a modest premium to the offering price, this could be interpreted as a cautious yet optimistic valuation by the company. Investors typically look for a balance between the immediate dilution of their holdings and the potential for long-term growth fueled by the capital raised. The ability of Sangamo to translate these funds into tangible progress in their genomic medicine programs will be critical in maintaining investor confidence and justifying the dilution. Market analysts will closely follow Sangamo's subsequent performance metrics and pipeline updates to assess the impact of this capital raise on the company's market position. Biotech Industry Analyst For companies operating in the genomic medicine space, like Sangamo Therapeutics, funding is a lifeline that enables continued research and development in a field characterized by high costs and extended timelines. The issuance of warrants, alongside common stock, is a strategic move that not only provides immediate funding but also aligns investor interests with the company's success. The warrants' six-month lock-up period before becoming exercisable and the five-and-a-half-year expiration term offer insights into the company's operational horizon and expected timeline for achieving significant milestones.Investors with an interest in the biotech sector often evaluate the potential risks and rewards of such investments. The specific terms of the warrants, including the exercise price, can be viewed as a gauge for future expectations. In Sangamo's case, the exercise price set at $1.00 may reflect a conservative but hopeful outlook on the company's ability to grow its stock value. The capital raised is likely earmarked for advancing their therapeutic pipeline, which could include preclinical studies, clinical trials, or scaling up manufacturing capabilities. The success of these endeavors will ultimately dictate the impact of this funding round on the company's valuation and its position within the genomic medicine industry. 03/22/2024 - 08:05 AM RICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

(CSE: RCHR) (OTCQB: RCHRF) (FSE: 6YR0) (the ""Company"" or ""Archer"") is pleased to announce the results of its 2024 Winter Exploration Program at the 100% owned Grasset Nickel Project (""Grasset"") in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt of Quebec, Canada. HighlightsDrill hole GR24-10A intersected the newly discovered H1X Zone at 400 metres below surface:2.67% Ni, 0.44% Cu, 2.32 g/t Pt-Pd over 2.90 metresIncluding 4.08% Ni, 0.98% Cu, 4.57 g/t Pt-Pd over 0.85 metresWithin a larger zone grading 1.19% Ni, 0.17% Cu, 0.99 g/t Pt-Pd over 8.20 metresThe H1X Discovery Zone, discovered in 2023, is a high-grade south-eastern extension of the H1 Zone, as seen by:GR23-03 : 1.55% Ni, 0.18% Cu, 1.2 g/t Pt-Pd over 5.80 metresGR23-07 : 2.97% Ni, 0.10% Cu, 4.1 g/t Pt-Pd over 0.44 metres GR23-08 : 1.06% Ni, 0.14% Cu, 0.7 g/t Pt-Pd over 5.60 metres""Today's assay results further reinforce our confidence in the presence of a robust mineralizing system that we can't fully appreciate yet,"" said Tom Meyer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Archer. ""As our technical team persists in exploring and defining the boundaries of the Grasset Deposit, we remain highly encouraged from the successes of our fall and winter drilling campaigns. We are particularly enthusiastic about future drilling as we focus on the H1X Discovery Zone at depth and towards the southeast, an area devoid of any historical drilling or exploration along the Sunday Lake Fault."" Winter 2024 Drill ProgramThe 2024 Winter Program consisted of three diamond drill holes totaling 1,323 metres of drilling. The primary objective of the program was to test the new geophysical anomaly, N9, approximately two kilometres northeast of the Grasset Deposit and to further explore the high-grade H1X Discovery Zone. H1X Discovery Zone Drilling ResultsHoles GR23-07 and GR23-08, drilled in December 2023, confirmed the extension of mineralization in the H1X Zone to a depth of approximately 430 metres, approximately 100 metres below the discovery hole, GR23-03, which intersected 0.30 metres of massive sulphides at a depth of 330 metres. Hole GR24-10A intersected the H1X Zone 50 metres above and 50 metres southeast of hole GR23-08. The mineralized zone is located on the northern contact at the bottom of the main ultramafic sequence. Hole GR24-10A intersected 2.67% Ni, 0.44% Cu, 2.32 g/t Pt-Pd over 2.90 metres, including a subinterval of 4.08% Ni, 0.98% Cu, 4.57 g/t Pt-Pd over 0.85 metres within a broader zone grading 1.19% Ni, 0.17% Cu, 0.99 g/t Pt-Pd over 8.20 metres. The mineralization is comprised of two zones of massive sulphides, (pyrrhotine and pentlandite) 0.25 and 0.35 cm thick, within a 2.90 metre section of net-texture mineralization. This is the first intersection demonstrating large, high-grade net-texture thickness within the H1X Zone.Hole GR24-11 was targeting the up-dip extension of the trend defined through the intersections of holes GR23-08 and GR23-03. Unfortunately, due to strong deviation, the hole interested the H1 Horizon 50 metres west of the target and intersected 0.41% Ni over 0.70 metres. As with hole GR23-07, the bottom contact of the ultramafic was strongly sheared with a small zone of disseminated sulphides.Holes GR23-03, GR23-08 and GR24-10A, which now define the newly discovered H1X Zone, clearly demonstrate the presence of a strong mineralizing system that remains open in all directions below 250 metres in the southeast portion of the H1 Horizon (Figure 1). Grades and textures, observed at the bottom of the main ultramafic package, indicate the potential for recent intersections to be at the fringe of a new high-grade-hosting ultramafic conduit. All four drill holes in the H1X Discovery Zone intersected nickel grades higher than the Indicated Resources average grade of the H1 Horizon of 0.82% (Tables 1 and 2). N9 Target DrillingThe N9 electromagnetic conductive plate (Figure 1) was interpreted from a high-power, large loop InfiniTEM-XL surface survey conducted in 2023. The N9 plate ranges from a depth of 300 to 700 metres and occupies an area of approximately 400 by 400 metres. The anomaly is located at the northern contact of an ultramafic sequence (interpreted from magnetic surveys) similar in nature to the H1 Zone.Hole GR24-09 was designed to intersect the center of the conductive plate, at a depth of about 400 metres below surface. Due to technical difficulties, hole GR23-09 was unable to reach its target and following an unsuccessful attempt to wedge the hole a depth of 336 metres, the decision was made to abandon the hole and move the drill rig to the Grasset Deposit for continued drilling of the H1X Discovery Zone. Notwithstanding the technical challenges, the N9 target remains a priority as it presents very similar characteristics to the S6 plate (Figure 1) that overlays the H1X Discovery Zone.Figure 1: Grasset Geological Surface PlanTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10057/202720_e1be655f940e6bc2_001full.jpgFigure 2: H1 Horizon Metal Factor Vertical Longitudinal SectionTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10057/202720_e1be655f940e6bc2_002full.jpgTable 1: Assay Highlights from the Winter 2024 Drilling Program at H1X ZoneHole IDFrom (m)To (m)Length (m)Ni (%)Cu (%)Co (%)Pt (g/t)Pd (g/t)GR24-10A439.7447.98.201.190.170.030.270.72Including445.0447.92.902.670.440.060.621.70Including447.0447.90.854.080.980.090.913.67GR24-11290.6291.30.700.410.050.010.100.21 All lengths are downhole lengths and true widths are expected to be greater than or equal to 50-70% of downhole lengths.Table 2: Assay Highlights from the 2023 Drilling Program at H1X ZoneHole IDFrom (m)To (m)Length (m)Ni (%)Cu (%)Co (%)Pt (g/t)Pd (g/t)GR23-03403.0408.85.801.550.180.040.350.82Including404.2408.84.601.820.220.040.400.95Including408.2408.80.605.750.240.131.683.85GR23-07516.2516.60.442.970.100.071.142.96GR23-08490.5496.15.601.060.140.030.230.51Including493.6496.12.501.610.240.050.340.75 All lengths are downhole lengths and true widths are expected to be greater than or equal to 50-70% of downhole lengths.Table 3: Drillhole Collar CoordinatesHole IDEasting (UTM)Northing (UTM)Elevation (m)Azimuth (°)Dip (°)Hole Length (m)GR23-01679759553987629121-90446GR23-026798595539783291322-88759GR23-02W16798595539783291322-88874GR23-03679939553949129130-60576GR23-04679374553768329145-55885GR23-05679323553953829150-701,152GR23-06679020553977629145-621,104GR23-07679850553947028939-62567GR23-08679890553944428945-65565GR24-09681459554070230920-70.6366GR24-09W1681459554070230920-70.612GR24-10679945553949029146-67.7120GR24-10A679941553948729150-68468GR24-11679878553959229152-61357 Collar coordinates are UTM Zone 17N.Azimuths and dips are taken from survey record at collar unless otherwise noted.ErratumArcher would like to make a correction to a previously published assay result in the press release ""Archer Exploration Extends Mineralization to Depth in H1 Discovery Zone of Grasset Nickel Project' dated January 17, 2024. An inversion of two sample tags at the lab produced an error in our database resulting in an incorrect assay for one sample.

The Board of Directors wishes to thank Mr. Konnert for his contributions to the Company as a director and wish him the best in his future endeavours.The Grasset ProjectThe Grasset Deposit, discovered in 2012 and located at the southern end of the Grasset Ultramafic Complex, comprises two subparallel, and sub-vertically dipping zones (H1 and H3 horizons) of disseminated to locally semi-massive sulphides mineralization. The H1 and H3 horizons each remain open at depth and along strike to the northwest.In 2021, an updated mineral resource estimate, using a 2016 drilling cutoff, was completed with an Indicated Mineral Resource Estimate of 5.5 Mt grading 1.53% nickel equivalent (""NiEq"") and an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 217,000 tonnes grading 1.01% NiEq. For additional information regarding Archer's Grasset Project please refer to the Technical Report entitled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report for the Grasset Property, Quebec, Canada"" dated effective September 2, 2022, prepared by Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., available under Archer's profile on www.sedarplus.ca. The vast majority of the Grasset Ultramafic Complex is underexplored and limited exploration prior to 2016 resulted in the discovery of several significant nickel sulphides showings along the entire 23-kilometre-long belt. Most notable is the GUC Central discovery, 7 kilometres northwest of the Grasset Deposit, which hosts a 950-metre-thick ultramafic sequence with several mineralized horizons of nickel sulphides and a best mineralized intercept of 4.14% Ni over 0.65 metres, within 7.58 metres of 1.05% Ni.The Grasset Deposit is one of the largest nickel sulphides deposits in Canada's Abitibi region and the only North American nickel sulphides deposit, with an Indicated Mineral Resource Estimate of more than 50,000 contained tonnes of nickel and an average NiEq grade of over 1.5%, not controlled by a major mining company.Quality Assurance and Quality ControlArcher implements high-quality industry-standard quality assurance and quality control (""QA/QC"") procedures for its diamond drill programs. Archer's geologists insert alternating blanks and standards approximately one per every 10 samples collected. Moreover, a blank is added after logged, potentially high-grade mineralized zones with standards additionally inserted within such mineralized zones. Overall, blanks and standards account for approximately 12% of the samples submitted to the lab. All samples are being assayed at ALS's Val d'Or laboratory where duplicates are inserted in the sample sequence at a rate of 1 in 40 samples sequence alternating with standards and blanks to result in a QA/QC insertion rate of about 1 in 10 samples. All drill core samples are analyzed using a 4-Acid digestion followed by 33 element ICP-AES analyses (ALS's Code ME-ICP61). Over limit Ni results are further analyzed by 4-Acid ore grade elements ICP-AES process (Code ICP-81 or ME-OG62). Analyses for Au, Pd and Pt are done using the ore grade ICP-AES procedure (Code PGM-ICP23). Gold only assays are performed with Au-ICP21 or AU-GRA21 if any visible gold. ALS is an accredited laboratory (SCC - CAN-P-1579 and CAN-P-4E ISO/IEC 17025) and is independent of the Company.Qualified PersonThe scientific and technical content of this press release has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Jacquelin Gauthier, P.Geo, Vice President, Exploration, who is a ""Qualified Person"" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Gauthier is satisfied that the analytical and testing procedures used are standard industry operating procedures and methodologies, including sampling, analytical and test data underlying the technical information disclosed in this news release.

The company ended the year with $9.0 million in cash to fund operations.","Xenetic Biosciences, Inc. Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Xenetic Biosciences (XBIO) reports financial results for 2023, highlighting progress in its DNase-based oncology program towards a Phase 1 clinical study for treating pancreatic carcinoma and other solid tumors. The company ended the year with $9.0 million in cash to fund operations. Positive Xenetic Biosciences is focusing on advancing innovative immune-oncology technologies targeting hard-to-treat cancers. The company entered into agreements with the University of Virginia to further develop its DNase program. Positive preclinical data is guiding the approach towards a first-in-human trial for the DNase-based oncology platform. Xenetic Biosciences' CEO, Jeffrey Eisenberg, expressed optimism about the potential of the DNase platform to provide therapies for pancreatic carcinoma and other solid tumors. The company reported a net loss of approximately $4.1 million for the fiscal year 2023. Research and development expenses decreased by 26.7% to $3.5 million, primarily due to the absence of in-process R&D expenses related to the DNase platform licensing in 2022. Royalty payments from a sublicense with Takeda Pharmaceuticals increased by 48.8% to approximately $2.5 million in 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $3.6 million, with a decrease in employee-related costs offset by higher consulting and legal costs. Xenetic Biosciences ended the year with around $9.0 million in cash. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Xenetic Biosciences, Inc. for the fiscal year 2023 appear to show a strategic focus on their DNase-based oncology program, which is a significant move considering the high unmet need in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma and other challenging solid tumors. The net loss of $4.1 million, while substantial, is not uncommon for a biopharmaceutical firm at this stage of development, where investment in R&D is pivotal. The decrease in R&D expenses, primarily due to the absence of a one-time in-process R&D expense from the previous year, indicates a streamlined focus on their current projects. The increase in royalty payments from Takeda Pharmaceuticals suggests a growing revenue stream, which is a positive indicator for investors. The cash position of $9.0 million provides the company with a runway to fund operations, but it is critical to monitor the burn rate and future financing needs. Medical Research Analyst The progression of Xenetic's DNase-based oncology program towards a Phase 1 clinical study is a noteworthy development in the field of immune-oncology. DNase therapies are designed to target and dismantle the protective barrier around cancer cells, potentially enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments. The preclinical data that has been characterized as 'encouraging' suggests that the company is on the right track with its research and development. However, it's important to recognize that the transition from preclinical to clinical stages is fraught with risk and many compounds fail to demonstrate efficacy or safety in humans. The strategic partnerships, like the one with UVA, are essential in bolstering the research momentum and can be a signal of credibility to stakeholders. The impact on the stock market will hinge on the outcomes of the Phase 1 trials and subsequent clinical milestones. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Xenetic Biosciences' focus on hard-to-treat cancers such as pancreatic carcinoma addresses a significant market gap. Pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates among major cancers and new treatment modalities are in high demand. The DNase platform's multiple treatment modalities could position Xenetic as a potential leader in a niche market. However, the competitive landscape in oncology is intense and investor sentiment often fluctuates with clinical trial results. The company's ability to maintain its financial health while advancing its clinical programs will be important for sustaining investor confidence. Additionally, the biopharmaceutical sector is highly sensitive to regulatory news and any updates from the FDA regarding the DNase program will likely have a direct impact on the company's stock performance. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM Continued advancement of DNase-based oncology program towards Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma and other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumorsEnded the year with $9.0 million of cash to fund operationsFRAMINGHAM, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2024 / Xenetic Biosciences, Inc.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM Smartkem project funded by Innovate UK as part of Taiwan-UK Research & Development Collaboration. MANCHESTER, England, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Smartkem (OTCQB: SMTK), the developer of a disruptive type of organic transistor that has the potential to drive a new generation of displays, today announced that it has entered into a collaboration agreement with RiTdisplay Corp. (RiTdisplay), a leading developer of optoelectronic solutions, visual displays and passive-matrix OLED (PMOLED) displays, for the manufacture of a new type of active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) display. The Taiwanese Ministry of Economic Affairs and Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), announced that they are investing a total of NT $650 million (approx. USD $20 million) to support both Taiwan and UK companies as part of the Taiwan-UK Research & Development Collaboration. As part of the collaboration, UKRI has committed £418.8K (approx. USD $530K) in grant funding to the Smartkem project with RiTdisplay. Pursuant to the Smartkem and RiTdisplay collaboration, Smartkem will provide its proprietary OTFT materials to RiTdisplay to integrate with its frontplanes (OLED). If successful, the project will create the world's first commercially ready AMOLED display made using organic transistors, with properties of higher brightness, lower power consumption and higher dots per inch (DPI) when compared with existing PMOLED displays. Smartkem's OTFT materials are developed to be coated on standard display process equipment sets, such as spin-coaters, and can be processed at temperatures as low as 80°C. Consequently, this reduces energy usage and associated costs compared with processing inorganic transistor backplanes. If successful, the project is intended to demonstrate that high performance and stable display backplane technology is accessible to display manufacturers at a lower capital and operational cost compared to inorganic TFT technology as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) tools are not required. The project is expected to be complete in 2026.Smartkem Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ian Jenks comments, ""This project follows up on our 2021 joint development agreement with RiTdisplay. If successful, we believe the integration of our materials will result in the development of the world's first commercially ready full color demonstration AMOLED display using OTFT backplanes."" Smartkem intends to engage the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan to develop a Gen2.5 (370mm x 470mm) backplane process using Smartkem's materials, which it believes will enable faster transfer to manufacturing equipment for commercial production after the project is completed in 2026.

(OTCQB: SOWG) (“Sow Good” or “the Company”), a trailblazer in the freeze dried candy and treat industry, is reporting financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Our strong 2023 results reflect our swift momentum and progress as a first mover in the freeze dried candy space,” said Claudia Goldfarb, CEO of Sow Good. “We achieved fourth quarter revenue of $9.5 million, marking a new quarterly record and an 89% sequential increase relative to the third quarter of 2023. Customer demand for our products has continued to accelerate, and our SKUs have consistently outperformed our retailers’ sales forecasts as we advance our B2B strategy. Having successfully pioneered this new candy and treats category in 2023, we aim to maintain and enhance our market leadership position in the year ahead. “With demand surpassing our current production capacity, we are focused on rapidly expanding our manufacturing footprint. We are in the early stages of ramping our co-manufacturing partnerships in China and Colombia, having now completed successful initial shipments from both regions. In-house, our fourth freeze drier is now completed and operational, and construction on our fifth and sixth freeze driers remains ongoing. We are also evaluating additional international possibilities with respect to manufacturing facilities. We expect our progress on these fronts to further increase production and facilitate our strong commercial momentum. “Expanding our production capacity enables us to diversify both our SKU portfolio and our customer base. After pausing new customer onboarding between the third quarter of 2023 and the middle of the first quarter of 2024, we have now increased our SKUs and store counts for key partners such as Five Below, Target, Circle K, and Cracker Barrel. We have broadly maintained a strong pipeline of both additional expansions with current partners and new partnership launches. Further, we continue to launch SKUs with new flavors, textures, and sizes, broadening the innovation and consumer appeal of our products. Our work to grow the depth and breadth of our novel product offerings remains a core competitive advantage. “Over the past year, we have laid a robust foundation to strengthen the Sow Good brand and capitalize on the ramping demand for freeze dried treats. Thus far in the first quarter of 2024, we have focused on growing and scaling our production infrastructure to support further growth opportunities throughout the year. As we move further into this year, our focus remains on accelerating our production capacity to expand our retail partnerships and product portfolio. I am proud of our significant success to date, and we look forward to building upon these early chapters of the Sow Good story.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased significantly to $9.5 million compared to $47.1 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven to the Company’s pivot to selling freeze dried candy in the first quarter of 2023 and the growing market for freeze dried candy. The increase also reflects the benefits of the Company’s expanded production capacity after the addition of two new freeze driers in the second quarter of 2023 and the first of its co-manufacturing arrangements coming online.Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased significantly to $3.4 million compared to $2.1 thousand in the previous year’s quarter. Gross margin increased to 35% compared to 4% in the prior year period. The increased gross margin was attributable to the higher margin profile of the Company’s candy products relative to the original food product lines sold in the year-ago quarter, which have since been discontinued.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.6 million compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Full Year 2023 Highlights vs. 2022 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased significantly to $16.1 million compared to $428.1 thousand in 2022. The increase primarily reflects the Company’s transition to selling freeze dried candy in the first quarter of 2023, the growing market for freeze dried candy and its expanded production capacity after adding two new freeze driers in the second quarter of 2023 and activating the first of its co-manufacturing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2023.Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased significantly to $4.9 million compared to $119.8 thousand in 2022.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” that are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted EBITDA.” Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this prospectus as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, interest expense, net and income tax benefit, adjusted to eliminate non-cash intangible asset impairment, goodwill impairment, inventory write-down and stock-based compensation. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. We present this non-GAAP measure because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense as it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring non-cash expense for our business;Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest on our debt which affects the cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the monies earned from our investments since it does not reflect our core operations;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect change in fair value of financial instruments since it does not reflect our core operations and is a non-cash expense;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense that affects cash available to us; andthe expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 08:07 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 22, 2024) - Founders Metals Inc. (TSXV: FDR) (OTCQX: FDMIF) (FSE: 9DL0) (""Founders"" or the ""Company"") announces drill core assay results from its fully-funded 2024 drill program at the Antino Gold Project in southeastern Suriname. The Company reports 38.0 metres of 10.90 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) from its furthest northwest Froyo drillhole to date, 24GG04. The interval contains the previously released gold vein photos (March 4th release; Figure 2 below) and is one of Antino's best gold intercepts at over 410 gram-metres per tonne (gm/t). Due to the abundance of coarse gold, samples have been resubmitted for metallic screening.HighlightsHole 24GG04 intercepts 38.0 m of 10.90 g/t Au from 149.0 m down hole, with metallic screening results pending (Table 1, Figures 1&2)Results are from Founders' furthest northwest drilling at the Froyo Gold Zone Gold mineralization remains open toward high-grade historical auger sampling results (Figure 1) * Intervals are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au using 5 metres minimum length and 5 metres maximum internal dilution.Figure 1: Upper Antino plan map centred on the Froyo Gold Zone.

Additionally, we have submitted samples for metallic screening to determine gold concentrations using a much larger sample volume. This method can capture coarser gold than fire assay. We expect the result soon. We are also pleased to report that our primary assay lab in Paramaribo has renewed its commitment of two-to-three-week turnaround times on assays. Though assays have often come back much faster, we recognize that with additional drilling, more surface sampling, targeted multi-element geochemistry, and metallic screening of select drill core, we can more reasonably expect two-to-three-week timelines.""Figure 2: A-A' Cross-section through latest Froyo Gold Zone drill results.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7574/202777_589341ce54ea8885_002full.jpgTable 1: Drilling Results and Highlights.

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Naoki Okamura, ""Astellas"") today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of XTANDI™ (enzalutamide) as monotherapy or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with high risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) who are unsuitable for salvage radiotherapy.1 Ahsan Arozullah, MD, MPH, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development, Astellas""Men with nmHSPC with high-risk biochemical recurrence are very likely to experience disease progression. With approximately 9 out of 10 of these men developing metastatic disease, the need for new and effective treatment options is critical. Today's positive opinion from the Committee is an important step forward for providing an additional treatment option for these patients and complements the existing efficacy and safety data supporting the use of XTANDI across the prostate cancer disease continuum. We look forward to XTANDI being potentially the first and only androgen receptor signaling inhibitor approved for this patient population in the European Union."" The positive CHMP opinion is based on the results from the Phase 3 EMBARK trial, which were presented as a plenary session during the 2023 American Urological Association Annual Meeting and subsequently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines in all 27 European Union (EU) member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.2 XTANDI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC; also known as nmHSPC) with BCR at high risk for metastasis in November 2023. Astellas is also discussing the EMBARK data with other regulatory authorities to support additional license applications for XTANDI in this indication in 2024 and beyond. Astellas has already reflected the impact from this result in its financial forecast for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. For more information, please see the press release ""European Medicines Agency Validates Type II Variation for Astellas' XTANDI® (enzalutamide) for Treatment of Non-Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with High-Risk Biochemical Recurrence"" issued on September 12, 2023. About EMBARKThe Astellas- and Pfizer-led Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,068 patients with nonmetastatic hormone- (or castration-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC or nmCSPC) with high-risk BCR at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients who were considered to experience high-risk BCR had a prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 9 months; serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L); and screening PSA by the central laboratory ≥ 1 ng/mL if they had a radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as primary treatment for prostate cancer, or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had radiotherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Patients in the EMBARK trial were randomized to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus leuprolide (n=355), enzalutamide 160 mg as a single agent (n=355), or placebo plus leuprolide (n=358). Leuprolide 22.5 mg was administered every 12 weeks. EMBARK met its primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS) for the XTANDI plus leuprolide arm, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the risk of metastasis or death over placebo plus leuprolide. MFS is defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. The study also met a key secondary endpoint, by demonstrating that patients treated with XTANDI (single agent) had a statistically significant reduction in the risk of metastasis or death versus placebo plus leuprolide, meeting its MFS endpoint. In EMBARK, Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were reported in 46% of XTANDI plus leuprolide patients, 50% of patients treated with XTANDI (single agent), and 43% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 21% of XTANDI plus leuprolide patients, 18% in XTANDI (single agent) patients, and 10% in placebo plus leuprolide patients. For more information on the EMBARK trial (NCT02319837) go to www.clinicaltrials.gov. About High Risk Biochemical Recurrent Non-Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer In non-metastatic hormone (or castration-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC or nmCSPC), no evidence of the cancer spreading to distant parts of the body (metastases) is detectable with conventional radiological methods (CT/MRI), and the cancer still responds to medical or surgical treatment designed to lower testosterone levels.3,4 Of men who have undergone definitive prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or both, an estimated 20-40% will experience a BCR within 10 years.5 About 9 out of 10 men with high-risk BCR will develop metastatic disease, and 1 in 3 will die as a result of their metastatic prostate cancer.3 The EMBARK trial focused on men with high-risk BCR. Per the EMBARK protocol, patients with nmHSPC and high-risk BCR are those initially treated by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, or both, with a PSA-DT ≤ 9 months. High-risk BCR patients with a PSA-DT of ≤ 9 months have a higher risk of metastases and death.6 About XTANDI™ (enzalutamide)XTANDI™ (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. XTANDI is a standard of care and has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR). XTANDI is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 90 countries, including in the United States, European Union and Japan. Over one million patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.7 About XTANDI™ (enzalutamide) in the E.U.Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor indicated in the E.U. for the treatment of adult men with: Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC, also known as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or mCSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).High-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. It is also indicated in adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.Important Safety InformationFor important Safety Information for enzalutamide please see the full Summary of Product Characteristics at: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/xtandi-epar-product-information_en.pdf.

They condemn the violation of constitutional freedoms and advocate for privacy-centric financial solutions. Positive None. Negative Major credit card companies prioritize regulatory compliance over consumer rights, potentially violating constitutional freedoms. California law mandates tracking and coding of firearm transactions by payment card networks, a move opposed by Credova. Financial service providers are shifting towards compliance with overreaching regulations, compromising consumer privacy and free commerce. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM Amidst a worrying trend of prioritizing ‘regulatory compliance’ over individual liberty by major credit card companies, Credova reaffirms its commitment to safeguarding constitutional freedoms and developing privacy-centric financial solutions. BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Credova—a leading Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) provider in the outdoor recreation and firearms sector and a wholly owned subsidiary of PSQ Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PSQH) (“PublicSquare”) a leading marketplace of patriotic businesses and consumers — is speaking out against the willingness of major credit card companies to comply and so blatantly violate consumer sovereignty. California recently passed a controversial law that mandates the tracking and coding of firearm transactions by payment card networks. Last month, these companies confirmed their intention to meet the May 2025 deadline for implementing the required codes. Credova condemns these flagrant violations of consumer’s constitutional rights in the strongest possible terms. Historically, financial service providers have resisted such overreach, holding sacred their obligation to safeguard consumer privacy and the principles of free commerce. The recent shift by the major credit card companies represents an alarming willingness to become active participants and enforcers of practices that undermine fundamental American liberties, including the right to privacy, the Fourth Amendment, and certainly the Second Amendment. Dusty Wunderlich, President of Credova, expressed strong opposition to this development, stating, ""These financial behemoths’ ready embrace of California AB 1587 demonstrates a disturbing trend of capitulation to regulatory overreach. This is a clear violation of the trust that consumers place in these companies to protect their rights. At Credova, we condemn these acts of cowardice and remain unwavering in our mission to continue developing financial technology solutions that uphold individual privacy and constitutional freedoms, without apology. We call on all major financial companies to put the protection of our founding principles over politics, and never waiver from the commitment to consumer sovereignty."" Founded on the premise of supporting secure, private financial transactions, Credova is resolute in its mission to empower Americans to make purchases without compromising their rights. In contrast to the actions of the major credit card companies, Credova offers solutions that respect and protect individual liberty, reinforcing its stance as a defender of constitutional rights in the financial sector. About Credova Credova, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PublicSquare, is a leading BNPL platform that offers flexible payment options, promoting financial accessibility and growth for merchants. With a specialization in the outdoor recreation and firearms industries, Credova is committed to supporting Americans' constitutional rights through secure, private financial transactions.

About PublicSquare PublicSquare is an app and website that connects patriotic Americans to high-quality businesses that share their values, both online and in their local communities. The primary mission of the platform is to help consumers “shop their values” and put purpose behind their purchases. In just over one and a half years since its nationwide launch, PublicSquare has seen tremendous growth and proven to the nation that the parallel, “patriotic” economy can be a major force in commerce. The platform has over 75,000 businesses from a variety of different industries and over 1.6 million consumer members. Additionally, PublicSquare leverages data and insights from the platform to assess its members’ needs and provide wholly-owned quality financing products, such as Credova, D2C products, such as EveryLife diapers and wipes, and B2B products, such as PSQLink, to fill those needs.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM HORMEL® Ribbon Pepperoni steals the show, debuting to wide acclaim at the 40th anniversary of the famous pizza trade show AUSTIN, Minn., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fresh off yet another showstopping display at the International Pizza Expo in Las Vegas, Hormel Foods, the maker of the best-selling retail pepperoni in the United States and a market leader in foodservice pizza toppings, is again driving the conversation on what's trending in the pizza-topping industry. Pizza expert Colby Strilaeff, brand manager of Foodservice at Hormel Foods, helps the company keep its proverbial finger on the pulse of the pizza-topping needs of foodservice operators, and after experiencing the annual Las Vegas trade show, Strilaeff identified the top-five pizza trends to watch out for in 2024: Ribbon pepperoni: This topping needs no introduction in Canada, where shredded pepperoni is a staple, but Strilaeff expects the same trend to take off in the United States. Inspired by the pizza stylings of Windsor, Ontario, the introduction of HORMEL® Ribbon Pepperoni is already a game-changer for American foodservice operators, allowing for quicker pizza preparation with pepperoni that spreads as easily as shredded mozzarella. Ribbon pepperoni is also a foodservice-friendly option for non-pizza applications like pastas, subs and calzones.Giardiniera: A condiment with deep Chicago roots, giardiniera is a celebrated tradition in many Italian American households. Giardiniera, which means ""from the garden"" in English, is a pickled assortment of vegetables like peppers, olives and cauliflower, submerged in a tangy mixture of vinegar and oil. The result? A flavorful medley that perfectly complements a variety of dishes, especially pizza. Italian sausage and giardiniera is a particularly delicious and increasingly popular flavor pairing on pizza.Global flavors: Culture continues to reveal itself in pizza. ""New international flavors are always being introduced in pizzerias across the country,"" Strilaeff said. ""It's one of the fastest growing trends in the industry."" Flavor profiles from far and wide are featured on menus across the United States, with familiar profiles like Mexican, Cuban and Indian flavors emerging as commonly sought-after favorites. Global ingredients like chimichurri, gochujang and miso are also adding a flavor twist to popular slices.Post-bake creativity: Cooking a pizza isn't the final step of the pizza-making process, especially these days. ""We're seeing a lot more people get creative with what goes on pizza after it is taken out of the oven,"" Strilaeff said. Ingredients like chili-infused oils and hot honeys have emerged as popular post-bake pizza toppings. Shaved Parmesan is another commonly applied accompaniment, as are basil and other leafy greens; rocket, arugula, etc.Sesame seed crust: While not a traditional ingredient in pizza-making, sesame seeds are an increasingly popular addition for those craving an extra crunch in their pizza crust. ""It adds a delicious, nutty undertone, which people really enjoy,"" Strilaeff said. Whether garnished over a glistening, buttery crust or folded into the entire dough ball, look for the trend of sesame-seed crust to take off.Hormel Foods has a long-standing reputation for creating innovative and delicious products for foodservice operators, including ROSA GRANDE® Cup & Char Pepperoni and FONTANINI® Cup & Char Sausage, both of which were successfully debuted during last year's International Pizza Expo.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM BEDMINSTER, N.J. , March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Retrieve Medical Holdings, Inc. (RMHI), the developer of Retrieve Dx, a real-time, cloud-based CDI (Clinical Documentation Integrity) application that improves physician documentation, today announced a study showing a substantial increase in documented diagnoses using the Retrieve software. In this updated study, 10,542 patient charts were analyzed, and 12,506 additional comorbidities and diagnoses were identified using the Retrieve Dx software solution. With the simple push of a button, Retrieve Dx presents comorbidities to the physician's computer screen for validation and potential inclusion in the patient's record (if deemed necessary by the attending physician) for more complete medical documentation of the patient. The significance of these results is two-fold. Firstly, an increased number of documented comorbidities (comorbidity capture rate) positively influences the Case Mix Index (CMI), a critical measure that reflects the complexity of cases treated at the institution. This index directly impacts reimbursement levels. Secondly, Retrieve saw a substantial reduction in physician queries.

The game offers exciting new mechanics like multipliers and jackpots, aiming to attract new lottery players and drive revenue growth. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of End Zone Cash by Inspired Entertainment in collaboration with the NFL Alumni could potentially open up new revenue streams for both organizations. The game's integration into the Pennsylvania Lottery's offerings is particularly notable due to its wide accessibility in over 10,000 retail locations. This strategic move taps into the existing lottery infrastructure, leveraging the popularity of football and the allure of NFL legends to attract a diverse demographic of players.From a market research perspective, the use of multipliers and jackpots aligns with current gaming trends that emphasize interactive and rewarding experiences. The appeal of these game mechanics may enhance player engagement and retention, contributing to increased sales and, by extension, higher commission revenues for retailers. The game's frequent play cycle, with matches every four minutes, creates a consistent and compelling reason for repeat visits to retail locations, driving foot traffic and ancillary sales.However, the long-term success of End Zone Cash will depend on its ability to maintain player interest amidst a competitive landscape of gaming options. The novelty of using NFL Alumni could wear off if not supported by continuous marketing efforts and game updates to keep the experience fresh and exciting for players. Financial Analyst The launch of End Zone Cash signifies a strategic expansion for Inspired Entertainment into the North American virtual sports market. Financially, this move represents an investment in product diversification and market penetration. The partnership with VEEPIO grants exclusive rights to NFL Alumni likenesses, which could be a strong differentiator in the virtual gaming space and may contribute to brand loyalty and recognition.For investors, the key metrics to watch following this launch will be the quarterly revenue growth from the virtual sports segment, the performance of the Pennsylvania Lottery's Xpress Virtual Sports lineup and any subsequent market share gains within the virtual sports domain. Additionally, it will be important to monitor customer acquisition costs and the return on investment from marketing campaigns associated with the launch.While the immediate revenue impact may be modest relative to the company's overall financials, the strategic implications are significant. The success of End Zone Cash could pave the way for further expansion into other states and lotteries, potentially leading to a sizable cumulative effect on Inspired's revenue stream over time. Gaming Industry Analyst The partnership between Inspired Entertainment and the NFL Alumni through VEEPIO's technology represents a fusion of sports entertainment and gaming industries. This collaboration allows Inspired to leverage the NFLA's brand equity and fan base, which can be a powerful catalyst for user acquisition and engagement within the gaming sector.In the context of the broader gaming industry, the integration of real-life sports elements into virtual gaming is a burgeoning trend, as it provides a familiar touchpoint for sports fans who may be new to gaming. The game's availability across a vast retail network could position it as a leader in the virtual sports niche, potentially influencing competitors to seek similar partnerships or innovate in their own product offerings.However, the sustainability of such a game will hinge on its ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. The company will need to ensure that the game mechanics and technological infrastructure can support a high-quality and uninterrupted gaming experience to meet the expectations of a discerning customer base. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM NEW YORK, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inspired Entertainment, Inc.

Positive Positive results from a Phase 2 trial of Tinlarebant in treating Stargardt Disease and Geographic Atrophy. Sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in Tinlarebant-treated subjects compared to ProgStar participants. 42% of Tinlarebant-treated subjects did not develop atrophic retinal lesions during the 24-month treatment period. Completion of enrollment in a pivotal global Phase 3 trial ('DRAGON') with interim data expected in 4Q 2024. Orphan Drug Designation granted in Japan for Tinlarebant in the treatment of Stargardt Disease. Ongoing global Phase 3 trial ('PHOENIX') for Tinlarebant in Geographic Atrophy. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent developments in Belite Bio's Tinlarebant trials are noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, the statistically significant results from the Phase 2 trial in slowing lesion growth in STGD1 patients are a positive indication for the drug's efficacy. This is particularly significant given the current lack of FDA-approved treatments for Stargardt Disease, which can lead to severe vision loss. The potential market for an effective treatment is substantial, as STGD1 is one of the most common forms of inherited juvenile macular degeneration.Furthermore, the completion of enrollment for the DRAGON Phase 3 trial and the initiation of the DRAGON II trial in Japan signal a strategic move to expand the drug's global reach and address regulatory requirements for different regions. The Orphan Drug Designation in Japan for STGD1 treatment could offer Belite Bio certain benefits, such as reduced fees and additional market exclusivity, which would enhance the drug's commercial potential upon approval. The interim data expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be a critical milestone for investors, as it will provide further evidence of the drug's potential impact on disease progression. Financial Analyst Belite Bio’s announcement regarding the progress of Tinlarebant's clinical trials could potentially affect the company's stock market performance. The positive Phase 2 trial results and the progression to a pivotal Phase 3 trial are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, as they reduce the risk profile of the drug's development pathway. The market for treatments in degenerative retinal diseases such as STGD1 and GA is largely untapped, offering a significant opportunity for revenue growth should Tinlarebant gain market approval.However, it's important to note that the biopharmaceutical industry is highly volatile, with stock prices being particularly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes. While the current news is positive, the ultimate impact on Belite Bio's financial health will depend on the completion of the Phase 3 trials, regulatory approvals and the drug's market performance if approved. Given the long-term nature of drug development, investors should consider both the potential for considerable returns and the inherent risks associated with the clinical trial process. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The landscape for treatments in degenerative retinal diseases is competitive, with several companies aiming to bring novel therapies to market. Tinlarebant's sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in treated subjects positions it as a strong candidate in this space. The drug's performance in the Phase 2 trial suggests it could meet a significant unmet medical need for patients with STGD1 and GA, potentially disrupting the current treatment paradigm.Belite Bio's strategy to conduct trials across multiple countries, including Japan, indicates an understanding of the importance of a diversified market approach. The designation of Tinlarebant as an Orphan Drug in Japan also points to the company's strategic regulatory planning, which could facilitate a smoother pathway to potential approval and commercialization in a key market. The implications for stakeholders are multifaceted, with potential benefits including increased treatment options for patients and potential drawbacks such as the high costs associated with bringing a new drug to market. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM Tinlarebant is Belite Bio’s orally administered tablet intended to slow disease progression in patients affected with Stargardt Disease (STGD1) and Geographic Atrophy (GA) in advanced Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)Data from a 24-month Phase 2 trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects showed a sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in Tinlarebant-treated subjects compared to ProgStar participants possessing similar baseline characteristics (aged ≤18 years) (p<0.001)In the Phase 2 trial, 42% of Tinlarebant-treated subjects (5 out of 12) did not develop atrophic retinal lesions during the 24-month treatment periodEnrollment of a pivotal global Phase 3 trial of Tinlarebant in adolescent STGD1 subjects (“DRAGON”) has been completed with 104 subjects across 11 countries with interim data expected in 4Q 2024Tinlarebant has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in Japan for the treatment of STGD1A global Phase 3 trial in GA (“PHOENIX”) is ongoing SAN DIEGO, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Belite Bio, Inc (NASDAQ: BLTE) (“Belite Bio” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting degenerative retinal diseases that have significant unmet medical needs, today announces its submission to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) to initiate a clinical trial of Tinlarebant in adolescent STGD1 in Japan (“DRAGON II”). The DRAGON II trial is a combination of Phase 1b open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Tinlarebant in Japanese adolescent STGD1 subjects and a Phase 2/3, global, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Tinlarebant in adolescent STGD1 subjects. Approximately 60 subjects, aged 12 to 20 years old, including approximately 10 Japanese subjects, are targeted for enrollment in the Phase 2/3 portion of the trial with a 1:1 randomization (tinlarebant:placebo). The data from Japanese subjects is intended to facilitate future NDA applications in Japan. About Tinlarebant (a/k/a LBS-008) Tinlarebant is a novel oral therapy that is intended to reduce the accumulation of vitamin A-based toxins (known as bisretinoids) that cause retinal disease in STGD1 and also contribute to disease progression in GA, or advanced Dry AMD. Bisretinoids are by-products of the visual cycle, which is dependent on the supply of vitamin A (retinol) to the eye. Tinlarebant works by reducing and maintaining levels of serum retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), the sole carrier protein for retinol transport from the liver to the eye. By modulating the amount of retinol entering the eye, Tinlarebant reduces the formation of bisretinoids. Tinlarebant has been granted Fast Track Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease designation in the U.S., and Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of STGD1. Stargardt Disease (STGD1) STGD1 is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy (causing blurring or loss of central vision) in both adults and children. The disease is caused by mutations in a retina-specific gene (ABCA4), which results in progressive accumulation of bisretinoids leading to retinal cell death and progressive loss of central vision. The fluorescent properties of bisretinoids and the development of retinal imaging systems have helped ophthalmologists identify and monitor disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments for STGD1. Importantly, STGD1 and GA, or advanced Dry AMD, share a similar pathophysiology, which is characterized by the excessive accumulation of bisretinoids, retinal cell death, and progressive loss of vision. Vision loss occurs slowly, despite peripheral expansion of “dead retina,” until the disease reaches the center of the eye (the macula). Therefore, Belite Bio is evaluating safety and efficacy of Tinlarebant in GA patients in a 2-year Phase 3 study (PHOENIX). GA in advanced Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD) Dry AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. Geographic Atrophy, or GA, is the advanced stage of AMD. Currently, there are no FDA approved orally administered treatments for GA and no FDA approved therapies for the other stages of Dry AMD other than GA. There are an estimated 20 million AMD patients in the U.S. and over 196 million patients worldwide with an estimated global direct healthcare cost of US$255 billion. About Belite Bio Belite Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting retinal degenerative eye diseases which have significant unmet medical needs such as (i) atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), commonly known as Geographic Atrophy (GA) in advanced dry AMD, and (ii) autosomal recessive Stargardt disease type 1, or STGD1, in addition to specific metabolic diseases.

Failure to do so may lead to delisting proceedings.,"3D Systems Receives NYSE Notice Regarding Late Form 10-K Filing Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary 3D Systems (DDD) received a notice from the NYSE stating non-compliance with timely filing requirements for its Form 10-K. The company has six months to regain compliance by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC. Failure to do so may lead to delisting proceedings. Positive None. Negative Non-compliance with NYSE filing requirements for Form 10-K may impact the company's stock listing on the NYSE, potentially leading to delisting proceedings. Financial Analyst When a company fails to meet the NYSE's timely filing requirements, it raises concerns about the efficiency of its financial reporting processes and internal controls. While the delay in filing the Form 10-K does not directly affect the company's stock listing immediately, it can lead to a negative perception among investors and analysts, potentially impacting the stock's performance. It is important to consider the company's track record with filings and any previous instances of similar issues. Investors should monitor the situation closely for any updates on the completion of the audit procedures and the eventual filing of the Form 10-K. The statement that there are no expected material changes to the financial results compared to preliminary reports is intended to provide reassurance, but until the actual filing, uncertainty will remain. Risk Management Expert The notice from the NYSE is a red flag for risk management concerns. The inability to file required financial reports on time could be indicative of deeper issues within the company, such as inadequate financial oversight or potential accounting complexities that require additional scrutiny. Stakeholders should be aware of the risks associated with extended filing delays, including the potential for future restatements or discoveries of material misstatements. The company's assurance of no expected material changes is positive; however, the risk of unforeseen adjustments or findings cannot be completely disregarded. The six-month period to regain compliance provides a buffer, but the company's risk profile may change if the filing is not completed within this timeframe or if the NYSE decides to take action sooner. Corporate Governance Expert Adherence to filing deadlines is a key aspect of good corporate governance. The delay in filing the Form 10-K suggests potential weaknesses in corporate governance structures and practices. While the NYSE Notice offers a grace period, it is important for the company to address the underlying issues that led to the delay to restore confidence among shareholders and the market. The governance implications extend beyond the immediate filing concerns, as they may affect investor trust and the company's reputation in the long run. It is essential for the company to communicate transparently with its stakeholders about the reasons for the delay and the steps being taken to prevent future occurrences. 03/22/2024 - 08:00 AM ROCK HILL, South Carolina, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) (“the Company”) today announced that, on March 18, 2024, it received a notice (the “NYSE Notice”) from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria established in Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, because the Company has not timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The NYSE Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE. The NYSE Notice informed the Company that, under NYSE rules, the Company has six months from March 15, 2024 to regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC. The NYSE further noted that, if the Company fails to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period, the NYSE may grant, at its sole discretion, an extension of up to six additional months for the Company to regain compliance, depending on the specific circumstances. The NYSE Notice also notes that the NYSE may nevertheless commence delisting proceedings at any time if it deems that the circumstances warrant. As previously reported in the Company’s Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (the “Form 12b-25”), the Company was unable to file the Form 10-K within the prescribed period because additional time, resources and effort are required to complete work related to its financial reporting and close procedures. Subsequent to filing the Form 12b-25, the Company continued to dedicate significant resources to the completion of such procedures but was unable to file the Form 10-K by March 15, 2024, the end of the extension period provided by the Form 12b-25. The Company requires additional time to complete such procedures for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Based on currently available information and subject to the completion of the audit procedures, the Company does not expect any material change to the financial results to be included in the Form 10-K compared to the financial information reported in the earnings release the Company furnished to the SEC on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 28, 2024. The Company is working diligently to complete the necessary work to file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable and currently expects to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period granted by the NYSE Notice; however, there can be no assurance that the Form 10-K will be filed within such period.

(AGMH) announces the establishment of a subsidiary in Canada to focus on energy development, data center construction, and mining operations in North America. The move aims to capitalize on the region's abundant energy resources and strategic position in the cryptocurrency market.","AGM Announces Establishment of Canadian Subsidiary, Accelerating Global Business Expansion Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AGM Group Holdings Inc. (AGMH) announces the establishment of a subsidiary in Canada to focus on energy development, data center construction, and mining operations in North America. The move aims to capitalize on the region's abundant energy resources and strategic position in the cryptocurrency market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The establishment of a subsidiary in Canada by AGM Group Holdings Inc. represents a strategic move aimed at capitalizing on the growing North American market. This expansion can be seen as a response to the increasing demand for high-performance computing equipment, which is critical for cryptocurrency mining operations. By positioning itself in a country with abundant energy resources, AGM Group is likely trying to mitigate one of the significant costs associated with mining—energy consumption.For investors, this move signals AGM Group's commitment to growth and expansion, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue. However, it's essential to monitor how this expansion will affect the company's operational costs and whether the expected increase in revenue will offset these costs. The success of this initiative will also depend on the regulatory environment in Canada, which is known for its supportive stance on cryptocurrency but also for its strict regulations on energy use and environmental protection. Energy Sector Analyst AGM Group's focus on energy development and data center construction in Canada is a significant indicator of the company's strategy to align with the country's energy landscape. Canada's commitment to renewable energy sources could provide AGM Group with a competitive advantage in the cryptocurrency sector, where sustainable energy use is becoming increasingly important.Investors should consider the long-term implications of this move, as the shift towards sustainable energy sources in the cryptocurrency industry could lead to more stable and predictable operating expenses for AGM Group. This stability can be a key factor in the company's profitability and resilience against market volatility. The collaboration with local energy suppliers may also lead to strategic partnerships that could further enhance the company's market position. Cryptocurrency Analyst The strategic initiative by AGM Group to deepen its engagement in the cryptocurrency sector through its Canadian subsidiary is indicative of the company's recognition of the sector's potential. Given Canada's strategic significance in the cryptocurrency market, this move could provide AGM Group with access to a more favorable mining environment, which is a critical factor for success in this industry.For stakeholders, the key considerations will be how effectively AGM Group can leverage Canada's energy resources and regulatory framework to optimize mining operations. The expansion could lead to improved efficiency and reduced costs, which in turn could enhance profitability. However, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market means that investors should be cautious and consider the potential risks associated with such investments, including regulatory changes and fluctuating cryptocurrency prices. 03/22/2024 - 07:57 AM BEIJING, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AGM Group Holdings Inc.

Outlook Therapeutics® Receives European Union Positive CHMP Opinion for ONS-5010 as a Treatment for Wet AMD,2024-03-22T11:35:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Outlook Therapeutics (OTLK) receives positive opinion from CHMP for ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ in the EU, a significant milestone in treating wet AMD.","Outlook Therapeutics® Receives European Union Positive CHMP Opinion for ONS-5010 as a Treatment for Wet AMD Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Outlook Therapeutics (OTLK) receives positive opinion from CHMP for ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ in the EU, a significant milestone in treating wet AMD. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The positive opinion from CHMP for Outlook Therapeutics' ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is a pivotal development in the company's trajectory, particularly considering the potential market exclusivity for a decade upon approval. This exclusivity could provide a significant competitive edge in the EU market for the treatment of wet AMD, a condition that is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. The anticipation of EC's decision within the stipulated 67 days could lead to increased investor interest, with potential impacts on the company's stock valuation.Market exclusivity is a key driver for biopharmaceutical companies as it protects their investment in drug development and allows them to set prices without immediate generic competition. Given the prevalence of wet AMD and the aging population in Europe, the market potential for ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is substantial. However, the success of the product will also depend on the pricing strategy, reimbursement policies and the ability of the company to effectively commercialize the product, either directly or through partnerships. Medical Research Analyst Bevacizumab is already used off-label for the treatment of wet AMD, but ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ represents the first ophthalmic formulation potentially approved for this indication, which may improve safety and efficacy profiles for patients. The clinical program's data, including the three registration trials, will have been rigorously evaluated by CHMP, indicating a strong scientific basis for the positive opinion.It is important to note that while the positive opinion is a strong indicator of potential approval, the EC's final decision is pending. The approval would not only validate the efficacy and safety of the drug but also the robustness of the clinical program. The success of this drug could set a precedent for future ophthalmic drugs and influence research and development trends within the biopharmaceutical industry. Financial Analyst The financial implications for Outlook Therapeutics are multifaceted. The EC's impending decision could act as a catalyst for the company's stock, with positive investor sentiment potentially driving up the share price in the short term. Long-term financial success, however, hinges on the execution of a successful commercialization strategy and the ability to navigate the complex reimbursement landscape in Europe.Investors should monitor the company's announcements regarding commercial partnerships, which could provide insight into the potential revenue streams and market penetration strategies. Additionally, the cost associated with the commercialization and any updates on projected sales figures will be critical for evaluating the company's future financial health and return on investment for shareholders. 03/22/2024 - 07:35 AM Positive opinion serves as a basis for final decision for potential authorization from the European Commission (EC), expected within 67 days ISELIN, N.J., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: OTLK), a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve the first approval for an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of retinal diseases in the US and the EU, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion concerning the authorization of ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma), an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) in the EU. Outlook Therapeutics is assessing both direct commercialization of the product and partnering in Europe on a country-by-country basis. “The CHMP positive opinion for ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ represents a significant milestone for Outlook Therapeutics and advancement in the treatment of wet AMD in the EU. We are proud to be one step closer to bringing to the EU market the first and only on-label, ophthalmic bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD, if approved,” commented Russell Trenary, President and Chief Executive Officer. The CHMP positive opinion was based on results from Outlook Therapeutics’ wet AMD clinical program for ONS-5010, which consists of three completed registration clinical trials - NORSE ONE, NORSE TWO and NORSE THREE, as well as studies and bibliographic literature substituting or supporting certain tests and studies. If approved, an initial ten years of market exclusivity in the European Union (EU) is expected for ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™. The CHMP’s positive opinion supports the grant of marketing authorization by the European Commission (EC) for Outlook Therapeutics’ application for ONS-5010. The EC is expected to make a decision within approximately 67 days following the CHMP opinion. The decision will apply automatically in all 27 EU Member States, and, within 30 days, also to Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. About ONS-5010 / LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. Because no FDA or European Commission approved ophthalmic formulations of bevacizumab are available currently, clinicians wishing to treat retinal patients with bevacizumab have had to use repackaged IV bevacizumab provided by compounding pharmacies—products that have known risks of contamination and inconsistent potency and availability. If approved, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ would provide an approved option for physicians to treat wet AMD. Bevacizumab-vikg/bevacizumab gamma is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively binds with high affinity to all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of the binding of VEGF to its receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Following intravitreal injection, the binding of bevacizumab-vikg to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation in the retina. About Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Outlook Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve FDA and European Commission approval for the launch of ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg or bevacizumab gamma) as the first approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications, including wet AMD, DME and BRVO. If ONS-5010 ophthalmic bevacizumab is approved, Outlook Therapeutics expects to commercialize it as the first and only FDA and/or EC approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in treating retinal diseases in the United States, EU, United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, and other markets. As part of the Outlook Therapeutics' multi-year commercial planning process, Outlook Therapeutics and Cencora entered into a strategic commercialization agreement to expand the Outlook Therapeutics’ reach for connecting to retina specialists and their patients. Cencora will provide third-party logistics (3PL) services and distribution, as well as pharmacovigilance services and other services in the United States.

The company generated full-year adjusted EBITDA of $14.4 million. AstroNova provides FY 2025 financial targets with mid-single digit revenue growth expectations. Q4 FY 2024 results show positive revenue and operating income for AstroNova. Product Identification segment revenue increased, and Test & Measurement segment benefited from commercial aviation market recovery. AstroNova focuses on sustained product innovation and operational efficiencies for future growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for AstroNova, Inc. indicate a positive trajectory in operating and net income, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The distinction between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, often used to eliminate the effects of one-time events and provide a clearer picture of ongoing operations, suggests that the company is actively managing its cost structure and possibly benefiting from strategic initiatives such as the retrofit program of PI printers and realignment strategies.From a financial perspective, the increase in operating margin and net income per common share is indicative of operational efficiency and profitability enhancement. The reported growth in Adjusted EBITDA, particularly when excluding restructuring and retrofit-related items, further underscores the company's ability to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a key metric for assessing a company's operating performance.However, a slight decrease in revenue alongside an increase in bookings suggests a potential lag in revenue recognition, which could be due to longer sales cycles or deferred revenue. Additionally, the backlog reduction from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 might raise questions regarding future revenue streams, although this could also be a result of improved delivery and execution capabilities. Market Research Analyst The segment results reveal significant developments that could influence investor sentiment. The Test & Measurement (T&M) segment's operating profit margin of 28.2% and its positive revenue growth reflect strong demand, likely driven by the rebound in airline passenger traffic and favorable commercial aircraft trends. This is a positive indicator for investors, as it suggests resilience in the face of industry-wide challenges and potential for sustained growth.On the other hand, the Product Identification (PI) segment shows a decrease in revenue, yet an improvement in operating profit margin. This dichotomy suggests a strategic shift towards higher-margin products or services, which can be a double-edged sword. While it may lead to improved profitability, reliance on fewer, higher-margin products could also increase vulnerability to market fluctuations or competitive pressures.Investors should note the company's forward-looking statements, including expected organic revenue growth and margin improvements. These projections are based on current market conditions and the company's strategic initiatives but are subject to change due to external factors such as economic shifts or technological advancements in data visualization technologies. Economist The financial targets and outlook for fiscal 2025, projecting organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, suggest that AstroNova is anticipating continued economic stability and demand in its markets. The commitment to improve margins by 100 basis points per year could be reflective of a broader industry trend towards operational excellence and cost optimization.However, it's important to contextualize these targets within the current macroeconomic environment. Factors such as inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions could impact the cost of sales and operational expenses, potentially affecting the company's ability to meet these targets. Investors should monitor these external factors closely, as they could have a material impact on the company's financial performance.The company's reliance on non-GAAP measures, while providing additional insight into its operations, should be evaluated critically, as these measures exclude certain costs that are real and can affect the overall financial health of the company. While non-GAAP measures can be useful for comparisons and understanding core operations, they should not be viewed in isolation but rather alongside GAAP measures for a comprehensive financial analysis. 03/22/2024 - 07:30 AM Posts Company Record Full-Year GAAP Operating Income of $8.8 Million; Non-GAAP Operating Income of $12.0 Million Delivers Full-Year GAAP Net Income of $4.7 Million, or $0.63 Per Diluted Share; Non-GAAP Net Income of $7.2 Million, or $0.97 Per Diluted Share Generates Full-Year Adjusted EBITDA of $14.4 Million, or $17.6 Million Excluding Restructuring and Retrofit-Related Items Provides FY 2025 Financial Targets and Outlook Hosts Earnings Conference Call at 9:00 a.m. ET Today WEST WARWICK, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AstroNova, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALOT), a global leader in data visualization technologies, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year ended January 31, 2024. CEO Commentary “We capped a year of solid growth in fiscal 2024 with a strong fourth quarter that highlighted our strategic focus on enhancing margins and maintaining disciplined cost management, while continuing to invest for the future,” said Greg Woods, AstroNova’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our fourth-quarter operating income of $3.9 million joined our third quarter as the two best quarters in our history, and reflected contributions from both our Product Identification (PI) and Test & Measurement (T&M) segments. “T&M generated a 28% segment operating profit for the quarter on 10% top-line growth, driven primarily by the continued momentum of our Aerospace product line. The rebound in airline passenger traffic toward pre-pandemic levels, the increasing number of daily flights and favorable commercial aircraft order and delivery trends provide a favorable growth runway for our business. The data acquisition product line within our T&M segment also performed well in the quarter. “Our PI segment delivered strong year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. Segment operating profit increased a healthy 560 basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in part reflecting the success of the strategic realignment announced last summer,” Woods said. “Additionally, at the end of the quarter we completed the previously discussed retrofit program of certain PI printers affected by faulty ink provided by one of our larger suppliers. On the innovation front, our PI development teams recently launched new digital printers and accessories under both our flagship QuickLabel and TrojanLabel brands. “Looking ahead, we see several growth opportunities for our business,” Woods said. “We are focused on applying the tools of the AstroNova Operating System to drive sustained product innovation, operating efficiencies and margin improvement.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release contains the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per common share. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. We define non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per common share, as the respective GAAP measure, excluding the impact of acquisition-related costs and restructuring and retrofit-related items. AstroNova believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of changes in the Company’s core operating results and can help investors who wish to make comparisons between AstroNova and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. AstroNova’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring its core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of its competitors. These measures are also used by the Company’s management to assist with their financial and operating decision-making. Please refer to the financial reconciliation tables included in this news release for a reconciliation of GAAP measures to the most directly comparable non-GAAP measures for the three and 12 months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023. AstroNova has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA growth percentage included in its 2025 financial targets and outlook to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the lack of predictability regarding cost of sales, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. The impact of any of these items, individually or in the aggregate, may be significant.

(ISPR) announces a public offering of 2,050,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share, generating $12.3 million in gross proceeds. The offering aims to fund the company's research, development, and commercialization efforts in the e-cigarettes and cannabis vaping products market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The offering of 2,050,000 shares by Ispire Technology Inc. at $6.00 per share is a strategic move to raise capital, amounting to $12.3 million in gross proceeds. This influx of capital can significantly impact the company's ability to scale operations, invest in R&D and potentially reduce debt. From an investment perspective, the pricing of the shares is pivotal. At $6.00, it reflects the market's current valuation of the company, which investors will scrutinize in relation to its peers and the broader industry performance.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of the new shares on existing shareholders. While dilution can be a concern, the capital raised may lead to growth that could offset the potential negative impact on the stock price. The use of proceeds is another critical factor. If the capital is allocated towards high-growth initiatives, it could lead to an increase in shareholder value over time. Market Research Analyst The e-cigarette and cannabis vaping markets are rapidly evolving with changing regulations and consumer preferences. Ispire Technology's public offering suggests a bullish stance on their market position and future growth prospects. The capital raised could enable the company to adapt to regulatory changes, expand into new markets, or enhance its product portfolio to meet consumer demands.However, the market's response to such an offering will depend on the perceived value of the investment and the company's execution of its growth strategies. Competitive analysis and consumer trends will be essential in assessing the potential returns from this capital raise. Investors will be keen to monitor the company's performance metrics post-offering to gauge the effectiveness of their investment strategies. Legal Expert For Ispire Technology, navigating the legal landscape is as important as the financial implications of the public offering. The e-cigarette and cannabis sectors are subject to stringent regulations that can affect business operations. The company's compliance with these regulations and its ability to manage legal risks will be critical in determining its long-term success.Investors should be aware of the potential legal costs associated with this industry. The capital raised may need to be partially allocated to legal defenses or compliance measures, which could impact the return on investment. The company's legal track record and its strategies for managing regulatory challenges should be carefully evaluated when considering the implications of this public offering. 03/22/2024 - 07:30 AM LOS ANGELES, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ispire Technology Inc.

The company deployed 19 vehicles globally in 2023, including the delivery of four fuel cell electric vehicles to Performance Food Group and a trial deployment of a fuel cell electric waste collection truck with REMONDIS Australia. Hyzon also entered into various commercial agreements and advanced its single stack 200kW fuel cell technology to the C-sample development phase. Positive Hyzon successfully delivered its first commercial fuel cell electric truck in the U.S. The company deployed 19 vehicles globally in 2023, meeting the upper end of its annual guidance range. Hyzon entered into multiple commercial agreements with key partners like Performance Food Group and TR Group. The single stack 200kW fuel cell technology advanced to the C-sample development phase. Hyzon appointed Dr. Christian Mohrdieck as Chief Technology Officer. The company reported a net cash burn of $25.5 million in Q4 2023, the lowest in the last nine quarters. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The recent announcement by Hyzon regarding the delivery of its first commercial fuel cell electric truck (FCEV) in the U.S. and the overall progress in their fuel cell technology marks a significant milestone in the automotive industry, particularly within the niche of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The transition from B-sample to C-sample in their 200kW fuel cell technology development indicates maturation of their product, potentially leading to increased reliability and customer trust. As the industry moves towards decarbonization, such advancements could position Hyzon as a frontrunner in the market, especially given the rising demand for sustainable transportation solutions.Moreover, the strategic partnerships and trial deployments with companies like Performance Food Group (PFG) and REMONDIS Australia could pave the way for larger orders and long-term contracts, which are critical for Hyzon's revenue growth and market penetration. The specifics of these partnerships, such as the contingent agreement for additional FCEVs with PFG, suggest a growing confidence in FCEVs' operational capabilities and cost-effectiveness. However, the capital expenditures required to reach the Start of Production (SOP) and the capacity at SOP need to be monitored closely, as they will impact Hyzon's financial health and its ability to scale operations efficiently. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Hyzon's fourth quarter updates reflect both strengths and challenges. The decline in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from $137.8 million to $112.3 million indicates significant cash burn, which is a concern for investors. However, the reported reduction in the quarterly net cash burn rate for the fourth consecutive quarter demonstrates management's commitment to improving operational efficiencies and cost management.Investors should consider the implications of these financials in both the short and long term. While the reduced cash burn rate is a positive sign, the company's ability to sustain this trend and reach profitability is crucial. The anticipated capital expenditures of less than $5 million to reach SOP is relatively modest, which could be favorable for the company's financial outlook, provided that the market adoption of their FCEVs meets expectations. The planned capacity of 700 200kW fuel cell systems over three shifts suggests an aggressive production target, which needs to be matched with market demand to avoid overcapacity and inventory issues. Energy Sector Analyst The progression of Hyzon's fuel cell technology and its initial commercial deliveries are of significant interest within the energy sector. The company's focus on high-performance hydrogen fuel cells for decarbonizing demanding industries aligns with global trends towards cleaner energy sources. The operational success of their FCEVs in trials and commercial settings could catalyze further adoption of hydrogen as a viable alternative to fossil fuels in heavy-duty transportation.However, the broader impact of these developments hinges on the scalability of hydrogen infrastructure and the cost competitiveness of hydrogen fuel compared to other zero-emission alternatives. While the advancement of fuel cell technology is promising, the practicality and economics of hydrogen production, storage and distribution remain key challenges. The energy sector will need to closely monitor the evolution of these factors to gauge the long-term viability of hydrogen-powered transportation solutions and their potential impact on the energy market dynamics. 03/22/2024 - 07:15 AM Announces first commercial delivery of fuel cell electric truck in the U.S. BOLINGBROOK, Ill., March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyzon (NASDAQ: HYZN) (Hyzon or the Company), a U.S.-based manufacturer and global supplier of high-performance hydrogen fuel cell systems focused on providing zero-emission power to decarbonize the most demanding industries, today announced its fourth quarter 2023 financial and operational results: Recent Highlights Advanced single stack 200kW fuel cell technology from B-sample to C-sample development phaseCompleted first deliveries in the United States, including four fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to Performance Food Group (PFG) at its Vistar facility in Fontana, CaliforniaCommenced trial deployment of a fuel cell electric waste collection truck with REMONDIS Australia, a global recycling, service, and water companyDeployed 19 FCEVs in 2023 at the high-end of 15-20 FCEV guidance range, including PFG deliveries and REMONDIS commercial trial vehicleAccelerated refuse program in North America through a recently announced Joint Development Agreement with New Way Trucks, the largest private refuse equipment manufacturer in North AmericaUnrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $112.3 million as of December 31, 2023, from $137.8 million as of September 30, 2023""2023 was an inflection point for Hyzon from a commercial and operational standpoint. We deployed 19 vehicles globally, including to both large fleet and drayage customers and our first heavy-duty fuel cell electric truck in the United States. Additionally, we advanced our industry-leading single stack 200kW fuel cell technology from B-sample to C-sample development by completing manufacturing and factory acceptance testing, full design verification, and certain durability testing of 25 200kW fuel cell system B-samples. Operationally, we took steps to drive efficiencies and significantly reduce our monthly cash burn rate while accelerating our leading 200kW fuel cell system technology and FCEV commercialization,"" said Hyzon Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Parker Meeks. Fourth Quarter 2023 Business Highlights Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Deployments As of December 31, 2023, Hyzon deployed 19 vehicles under commercial agreements to customers in 2023, towards the upper end of its annual guidance range of 15-20 vehicles. Of those vehicles, five were deployed in the U.S. to both drayage and large fleet customers, three in Europe, and 11 in Australia. In Q4 2023, as a part of the 19 deployments, the Company also announced the commercial trial deployment of its first fuel cell electric waste collection truck to REMONDIS Australia. The four month trial completed successfully, and Hyzon is working with REMONDIS to transfer ownership of the truck to REMONDIS under the existing commercial agreement. Commercial Progress The Company announced sale and delivery of a heavy-duty FCEV in the United States to a U.S. drayage customer operating at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, marking Hyzon's entry into the U.S. drayage market in Q4 2023. Hyzon also delivered four FCEVs to leading food distributor and supplier, PFG, in December 2023. Contingent upon a successful trial with Hyzon's 200kW FCEV, Hyzon and PFG plan to collaborate on an agreement for 15 200kW FCEVs, with an option for an additional 30 FCEVs. Hyzon entered into a revised commercial agreement with TR Group, New Zealand's largest heavy-duty truck fleet owner, for up to 20 FCEVs upfit with Hyzon's single stack 200kW fuel cell system. Following the initial commercial trial, TR Group has an option to purchase the two trial trucks as well as to upfit another 18 trucks with Hyzon's 200kW fuel cell systems. Single Stack 200kW Fuel Cell System Advances to C-Sample Development Phase Hyzon completed its B-sample development phase of the 200kW Fuel Cell System (FCS) in Q4 2023, and advanced to C-sample development phase. In Hyzon's C-sample phase, FCSs are built with production tooling to meet all technical requirements. This step precedes Start of Production (SOP), which is currently on track for the second half of 2024. The Company develops and builds key components for its 200kW FCSs in-house at its fuel cell production facility in Bolingbrook, Ill., including proprietary electrode formulations and Hyzon's roll-to-roll, Membrane Electrode Assembly manufacturing line. Hyzon has less than $5 million in estimated remaining capital expenditures to reach SOP, with an expected capacity at SOP of 700 200kW fuel cell systems over three shifts. Newly Appointed Chief Technology Officer In December 2023, Hyzon announced the appointment of Dr. Christian Mohrdieck as Chief Technology Officer. Mohrdieck joins Hyzon with extensive C-Suite experience, most recently serving as Chief Commercial Officer of cellcentric GmbH & Co. KG, a joint venture between Daimler Truck AG and the Volvo Group AB. Prior to his role at cellcentric, Mohrdieck was Chief Executive Officer of Mercedes-Benz Fuel Cell GmbH since 2015, before it merged into Daimler Truck Fuel Cell GmbH & Co. KG. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Updates As of December 31, 2023, unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $112.3 million, approximately $25.5 million lower than the September 30, 2023 balance of $137.8 million. Net cash burn of $25.5 million during the quarter represented the lowest quarterly net cash burn over the last nine quarters and the fourth consecutive quarter of declining net cash burn. ""We are pleased with the continued progress we have made on reducing our net cash burn through focused operational efficiencies, cash management, lower legal and professional services expenses, and strategic focus. Our quarterly net cash burn in Q4 came to $25.5 million representing a fourth consecutive quarter of declining burn, showing our continued focus on prudent cash and capital management while driving our technology and commercialization progress forward,"" said Hyzon Chief Financial Officer Stephen Weiland.

Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 07:30 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 22, 2024) - Sanu Gold Corporation (CSE: SANU) (OTCQB: SNGCF) (""Sanu Gold"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce positive results from the recent ground geophysics program completed on the Company's Daina Gold Exploration Permit (""Daina""), located in the prolific Siguiri Basin of Guinea, West Africa.HighlightsTargets Ready to Drill: There are large targets highlighted at Daina 1 South and Daina 6 targets.Gold at Surface: Past drilling, recent trenching and rock chip sampling demonstrate high-grade gold mineralization at these targets:9 m of 7.97 g/t Au in trench DAI-TR-007 at Daina 1 South, Rock chip samples as high as 61.6 g/t Au, 22.3 g/t Au and 20 g/t Au across the Daina 1 South and Daina 6 target areas. 1m of 36.2 g/t Au from drill hole DAI-RC-021 at Daina 6 Size and Scale: The geophysical surveys have identified significant trends of chargeability and resistivity in the areas of known gold mineralization and along the trend of the surface gold anomalies which extend for over 1 km at both the Daina 1 and Daina 6 targets. Martin Pawlitschek, President, and CEO of Sanu Gold commented: ""The relatively small programs of induced polarization (IP) over some of our key targets at Daina extensive strike lengths of highly interesting suggest chargeability and resistivity trends, in many cases aligned with our surface gold geochemistry. These initial surveys and their results demonstrate that this type of survey also adds value at the Daina permit. While in the near term Bantabaye remains the main focus, the survey results confirm that significant strike length of mineralized structures remain untested.""Program SummaryThe ground geophysical survey program consisted of 21 line-km of 200m spaced and east-west oriented Gradient Induced Polarization (IP) lines. Four blocks have been completed covering all priority targets including the Daina 1 South, Daina 1 North, Daina 2 Main Zone, and Daina 6 target areas within the Daina Project. The survey was completed by SAGAX Afrique of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso using the IP method. SAGAX is well experienced in these types of surveys over many other deposits in the region. This release reports on the results from the Daina 1 South and Daina 6 targets. Compilation of results from Daina 2 and Daina 1 North are still ongoing. The objective of this ground geophysical survey program was the detection and delineation of geophysical features (chargeability and resistivity) and structures which may indicate favorable zones for gold mineralization in the covered targets and to help further with assessing the potential of the targets for future drill testing. The results of this program show that the IP surveys delineate distinct features that help map the mineralized zones and that there is significant undrilled strike potential at Daina 1 South and Daina 6. Daina 1 SouthThe Program consists of six east-west oriented lines, totaling 6.3 line Km of 200m spaced of Gradient Array IP/Resistivity (Figure 1). The survey identified the presence of a large zone of high chargeability trending NNW, following the main trend of the gold anomalies defined by auger sampling and surface geochemistry. This area of elevated chargeability extends for at least 1.2 km and is open to the south. The trend of high chargeability is close to recent results obtained at Daina 1 South (Figure 1):Trench DAI-TR-007: 9 m of 7.97 g/t Au, including 3 m of 21.75 g/t Au and Auger hole: 3 m of 6.59 g/t Au, including 2 m of 6.48 g/t Au (DAI-AUG-1250) and 9 m of 2.26 g/t Au, including 2 m of 9.78 g/t Au (DAI-AUG-1246) from the 2021/2022 auger programsHigh-grade gold in rock chip samples including 61.6 g/t Au, 16.2 g/t Au and 12.8 g/t Au (Figure 1).Daina 6 TargetThe geophysics survey consisted of four east-west oriented lines, totaling 5.5 line Km of 200m spaced of Gradient Array IP/Resistivity (Figure 2). The results from this survey indicate that the Daina 6 target sits in an extensive zone of high chargeability trending NNW (Figure 2). This area of elevated chargeability is open to the south and the north and is consistent with observations of rock chips in auger, RC holes and exposed saprolite in artisanal working pits that consist of strongly hydrothermally altered coarse-grained greywacke invaded by zones of quartz vein stockwork and breccia with high-sulphide content (Pyrite and arsenopyrite) and boxwork after oxidized, disseminated sulphide in fractures and breccia zones that contain the high-grade gold mineralization.Previous results at Daina 6 include 8 m of 1.97 g/t Au, including 2 m of 7.36 g/t Au (DAI-AUG-1164) (see Sanu Gold news release dated July 29, 2022), 9 m of 1.2 g/t Au (DAI-TR-015) and 3 m of 4.66 g/t Au, including 1 m of 12.6 g/t Au (DAI-TR-016) and high grades in rock chips samples collected in working pits including 10.6 g/t, 9.11 g/t, 7.02 g/t, 6.56 g/t, 6 g/t, 3.47 g/t, 3.09 g/t, and 2.79 g/t Au (Figure 2). These rock chips samples consisted of strongly hydrothermally altered coarse-grained greywacke invaded by zones of quartz vein stockwork and boxwork that contain high gold mineralization (see Sanu Gold news release dated March 15, 2024.Next StepsWhile the Company is focused on preparing the for the drilling program at Bantabaye, it will in parallel evaluate and progress the key targets on its other properties for future drill testing. Additional data from Daina includes IP from targets Daina 1 North and Daina 2, where previous drilling returned very encouraging drill intercepts. The data from these two targets is still being processed and evaluated and will be released as soon as this is finalized.

TransAlta Corporation Enters into Automatic Share Purchase Plan,2024-03-22T11:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"TransAlta  (TAC) announces entering into an automatic share purchase plan to repurchase common shares under its normal course issuer bid. The company has purchased over 4 million common shares since May 2023, aiming to enhance shareholder returns through capital allocation strategies.","TransAlta Corporation Enters into Automatic Share Purchase Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TransAlta (TAC) announces entering into an automatic share purchase plan to repurchase common shares under its normal course issuer bid. The company has purchased over 4 million common shares since May 2023, aiming to enhance shareholder returns through capital allocation strategies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initiation of an automatic share purchase plan (ASPP) by TransAlta Corporation is a strategic financial maneuver that signals to the market a potential undervaluation of the company's common shares. The repurchase program under the normal course issuer bid (NCIB) suggests that management is confident in the intrinsic value of the company, which they believe is not currently reflected in the market price. The repurchase of shares can often be perceived as a positive signal by investors, as it may indicate a bullish outlook by the company's leadership on the future financial performance and prospects of the company.From a financial perspective, the reduction in the number of outstanding shares typically results in an increase in earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This could potentially lead to a higher stock price. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy depends on various factors including the overall market conditions, investor sentiment and the company's future performance. It is also important to consider the opportunity cost of the repurchase, as the funds used for the buyback could have been allocated to other investments or growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The implementation of the ASPP aligns with TransAlta's commitment to enhancing shareholder value, which is further supported by its strong free cash flow position. The market often reacts favorably to share buyback announcements as they can be interpreted as a company's self-assessment of being undervalued. Additionally, the ASPP allows for share repurchases during periods when insiders are typically restricted from trading, such as blackout periods surrounding earnings releases or other significant corporate events, thus providing a continuous mechanism for share repurchase without breaching insider trading regulations.It's important for investors to monitor the volume of shares repurchased and the prices paid, as these activities can provide insights into management's expectations and the company's capital allocation strategy. Moreover, the cancellation of repurchased shares will consolidate ownership among existing shareholders, potentially leading to a more favorable demand-supply dynamic for the stock. However, the market's response to such a program can vary and investors should consider the broader industry trends and macroeconomic factors that may impact the stock's performance in conjunction with the ASPP. Corporate Governance Expert The transparency and regulatory compliance of TransAlta's ASPP, as evidenced by its pre-clearance by the Toronto Stock Exchange, is a key aspect of good corporate governance. The ASPP is structured to adhere to TSX rules and applicable laws, which helps maintain investor confidence in the management's decision-making process. The company's statement that it is not in possession of any material undisclosed information prior to the initiation of the ASPP is important in maintaining the integrity of the program and avoiding potential conflicts of interest.Investors should appreciate the company's adherence to insider trading rules and the use of an ASPP to navigate around self-imposed trading restrictions. This level of corporate governance practice is reassuring for stakeholders and can contribute to a positive perception of the company's leadership and ethical standards. The predetermined nature of the ASPP provides a systematic approach to share repurchases, which reduces the potential for market manipulation or the perception of opportunistic timing based on insider information. 03/22/2024 - 07:00 AM CALGARY, AB, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - TransAlta Corporation (""TransAlta"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: TA) (NYSE: TAC) announced today that it has entered into an automatic share purchase plan (""ASPP"") with its broker in order to facilitate repurchases of TransAlta's common shares (""Common Shares"") under the Company's previously announced normal course issuer bid (""NCIB""). The Company previously announced that it had received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") to purchase up to 14,000,000 of its Common Shares during the 12-month period that commenced May 31, 2023 and terminates May 30, 2024. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through open market transactions on the TSX and any alternative Canadian trading systems on which the Common Shares are traded, based on the prevailing market price. Since January 1, 2024, the Company has purchased 2,710,300 Common Shares at a weighted average price per Common Share of $9.52 for an aggregate value of approximately $25.8 million. Since the beginning of the current NCIB on May 31, 2023, the Company has purchased 4,134,900 at a weighted average price per Common Share of $10.01 for an aggregate value of approximately $41.4 million. The Company believes that the prevailing price for the Common Shares may not, from time to time, reflect the underlying value of the Common Shares and that the purchase of Common Shares pursuant to the NCIB may be an attractive and appropriate use of available funds relative to other alternatives. The ASPP will facilitate purchases under the NCIB as it will allow for purchases of Common Shares to be made at times when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted to make purchases, whether due to regulatory restriction or customary self-imposed blackout periods. TransAlta is committed to enhancing shareholder returns through appropriate capital allocation such as a share buyback and its quarterly dividend, which are underpinned by the Company's strong free cash flow position. Under the ASPP, the Company's broker may purchase Common Shares from the effective date of the ASPP until the end of the NCIB. The ASPP will facilitate purchases of Common Shares under the NCIB by authorizing the Company's broker to make purchases at its sole discretion based on parameters set by the Company in accordance with TSX rules, applicable law and the terms of the ASPP. Outside of periods that the Company is restricted from purchasing Common Shares pursuant to insider trading rules or its own internal trading blackout policies, Common Shares may also be purchased based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules and applicable law. All purchases of Common Shares made under the ASPP will be included in determining the number of Common Shares purchased under the NCIB. Any Common Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. The Company is not currently in possession of any material undisclosed information in relation to the Company. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be effective on April 1, 2024. The ASPP will terminate on the earliest of the date on which: (a) the maximum purchase limits under the ASPP are reached; (b) May 3, 2024; or (c) the Company terminates the ASPP in accordance with its terms.

The closing share price for Aeva's common stock and the average closing share price over a 30-day period are now above $1.00, resolving the deficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement by Aeva regarding its regained compliance with the NYSE's continued listing minimum price criteria is a positive signal to the market and its investors. This development is indicative of a potential turnaround in investor confidence or operational performance. Typically, a stock price falling below the $1 threshold can trigger investor concerns about the company's stability and future prospects. The rebound above this level may suggest that Aeva has taken steps to address the underlying issues that led to the stock's previous decline.From a market perspective, the restoration of compliance could lead to increased trading volumes as institutional investors and funds that are restricted from holding non-compliant stocks may now re-enter the fray. Moreover, this event can act as a catalyst for the company to introduce new initiatives or capitalize on positive market sentiment to further improve its financial standing and market perception. Financial Analyst Regaining compliance with the NYSE's listing standards is a critical financial milestone for Aeva. It not only prevents potential delisting but also averts the negative financial implications associated with it, such as diminished liquidity and access to capital markets. For a company in the technology sector, where R&D and capital investments are substantial, maintaining a listing on a major exchange is vital for fundraising efforts.Investors should note, however, that while the share price recovery is a positive development, it is not necessarily indicative of the company's long-term financial health. It is essential to analyze Aeva's financial statements, future earnings guidance and market position within the sensing and perception systems industry to fully understand the implications of this news.

The trial demonstrated exceptional safety and tolerability with no serious adverse events. Key findings support the proposed mechanism-of-action, paving the way for Phase 3 development. Positive Statistically significant and durable improvements in ocular pain relief, conjunctival staining, tear film break-up time, burning/stinging, and blurred vision Exceptional safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events Support for the proposed mechanism-of-action of OK-101 Positive results enabling Phase 3 development Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from OKYO Pharma's Phase 2 trial for OK-101 are significant in the context of treating Dry Eye Disease (DED), particularly due to the dual focus on both signs and symptoms of the condition. From a medical research perspective, the robustness of the trial is notable, as it addresses both objective clinical outcomes, such as Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) and subjective patient-reported outcomes. The fact that OK-101 showed a statistically significant improvement in TFBUT, a measure that has historically been difficult to demonstrate in clinical trials, suggests a potential breakthrough in DED treatment.Furthermore, the trial's design, which includes a placebo run-in period, enhances the credibility of the results by minimizing the placebo effect, which is a common challenge in clinical trials. The favorable safety profile of OK-101, indicated by the low incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, is also a critical factor for patient compliance and long-term success of a new drug. The potential for OK-101 to become a market leader in DED therapeutics will depend on the outcomes of the forthcoming Phase 3 trials, which will further validate these results. Ophthalmology Expert The clinical data presented by OKYO Pharma for OK-101 in the treatment of Dry Eye Disease (DED) and anterior ocular segment diseases indicates a promising advance in ocular therapeutics. The improvements in ocular pain and other DED symptoms, such as burning and stinging, as well as blurred vision, are particularly noteworthy. These symptoms are not only discomforting for patients but can also significantly impact their quality of life and productivity.From an ophthalmological standpoint, the improvement in conjunctival staining and the increase in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) suggest that OK-101 may be influencing the underlying pathophysiology of DED by promoting a healthier ocular surface. The proposed mechanism of action, involving the normalization of goblet cell density and reduction of inflammatory activity, aligns with current understanding of DED pathogenesis. If these results are consistent in Phase 3 trials, OK-101 could represent an important addition to the limited options currently available for DED patients, especially those with neuropathic corneal pain for which there is no FDA approved therapy. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The data from OKYO Pharma's Phase 2 trial has significant implications for the pharmaceutical market, particularly within the multi-billion-dollar market for DED treatments. The durability and rapid onset of symptom relief reported for OK-101 could set it apart from existing treatments, which often have limitations in efficacy or onset of action. The potential market positioning of OK-101 as a novel therapeutic agent is bolstered by its favorable safety profile and the fact that it is comparable in comfort to artificial tears, a common over-the-counter remedy for DED.Given the reported efficacy and safety, OK-101 could capture a substantial share of the DED market if approved. The emphasis on patient-reported outcome data in the trial also aligns with a growing trend in drug development to focus on patient-centric measures. The upcoming Phase 3 trials will be critical in determining the drug's market viability. For investors, the progression of OK-101 into late-stage clinical development could be a catalyst for valuation changes for OKYO Pharma, contingent upon continued positive results. 03/22/2024 - 07:00 AM Ocular Pain Relief showed statistically significant improvement as early as day 15 and the benefit was durable throughout the trial.Conjunctival Staining improved as early as day 29 with a durable benefit throughout the trial.Tear Film Break-up Time showed statistically significant improvement as early as day 15 with the benefit durable for the remainder of the trial.Burning/Stinging, and Blurred Vision improved as early as day 15 and the benefit remained durable throughout the trial.Significant improvements were observed across multiple symptoms as measured in a daily symptom diary including pain, burning/stinging, eye dryness and itching within the first two weeks of treatment.OK-101 exhibited exceptional drop comfort, comparable to that of artificial tear, with very good ocular tolerability along with a favorable adverse event profile and no drug-related serious adverse events.These observed endpoints support the proposed mechanism-of-action of OK-101 as demonstrated in preclinical animal models. LONDON and NEW YORK, March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OKYO Pharma Limited (NASDAQ: OKYO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative ocular therapies for the treatment of inflammatory dry eye disease (DED), a multi-billion-dollar market, and anterior ocular segment diseases including neuropathic corneal pain (NCP), an ocular condition associated with pain but without an FDA approved therapy, announced today additional key findings from analyses of the clinical data set from the 240 patient Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of OK-101 (0.05%) ophthalmic solution in patients with DED. These new findings include: a statistically significant and durable reduction in ocular painstatistically significant improvement in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) throughout the study - a clinically important endpointmultiple symptomatic improvements as observed by both data obtained from patient clinic visits as well as data from patient daily symptom diaries These results complement the statistically significant effects reported earlier on sign and symptoms endpoints, enabling definitive Phase 3 development of OK-101; using FDA recognized endpoints per the Dry Eye: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry. https://www.fda.gov/media/144594/download. The Company previously reported statistically significant improvements in total conjunctival staining (a sign endpoint), as measured by the Ora Calibra© Staining Scale as early as Day 29 (p = 0.034) and burning/stinging and blurred vision (symptom endpoints) measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) as early as Day 15 for burning/stinging (p=0.03), and at Day 29 (p = 0.01) for blurred vision. This Phase 2 trial was conducted by our CRO partner Ora Inc. In this press release, the Company is reporting additional OK-101 data, including conjunctival staining measured at Day 85 (p=0.056) demonstrating durability in this sign endpoint. In addition, there were significant improvements in burning/stinging (p = 0.01, 0.006, 0.003 and 0.01 at Days 15, 29, 57 and 85, respectively) and in blurred vision (p = 0.09, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.06 at Days 15, 29, 57 and 85, respectively) which demonstrated sustained improvements throughout the trial. Additional data analyses also showed statistically significant improvement in ocular pain measured by VAS that was durable throughout the trial with p values = 0.03, 0.04 and 0.01 at Days 29, 57 and 85, respectively. Furthermore, OK-101 improved TFBUT as early as Day 15 and the improvement lasted throughout the trial with p values = 0.01, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.03 at Days 15, 29, 57 and 85, respectively. Notably, it has been difficult to demonstrate statistical significance for the measurement of increase in TFBUT in clinical trials of DED treatments, due mainly to patient-to-patient variability. The positive results observed in this trial carry particular significance as OK-101’s proposed MOA involves the normalization of goblet cell density as well as generating a healthier conjunctiva, a reduction of ocular pain and decreased inflammatory activity. An increase in goblet cell density should be expected to lead to an increase in mucin production, playing a key role in the physiology of the corneal tear film. Importantly, data obtained from daily symptom diaries maintained by patients during the trial, commonly referred to as patient-reported outcome data, confirmed several of the DED symptoms also measured in the clinic, exhibiting significant improvements as early as Day 1 through Day 15 for pain, burning/stinging, eye dryness and itching, with p values of 0.01, 0.06, 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. This observation of statistically significant improvements in multiple DED symptoms as measured both from clinic visits and as reported by patients at home is striking. Lastly, OK-101 was extremely well tolerated with a drop comfort score of 2.3 after 2 minutes post-instillation which is comparable to those of artificial tear results as measured by the Ora Calibra© Drop Comfort Scale1 of 0–10, with a value of 0 being most comfortable and 10 being least comfortable. Notably, OK-101 exhibited placebo-like tolerability with a very low adverse event profile and no drug-related serious adverse events. The number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed to be similar to that of the placebo-treated group. And no severe drug related ocular TEAEs were seen. Possible drug-related TEAEs were observed in one patient in the OK-101 0.05% treatment group (n=81) and 3 patients in the placebo-treated group (n=79), again highlighting the favorable safety profile of OK-101. “The positive impact of OK-101, in its capacity to rapidly and durably improve tear film break up time, is particularly relevant for so many dry eye patients who have reduced blink rate associated with extensive screen time, reading and driving,” said Jay Pepose, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and Medical Director of Pepose Vision Institute and Professor of Clinical Ophthalmology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “This improvement in tear film stability correlates well with the improvement of multiple dry-eye associated symptoms, such as blurred vision. A rapid tear film break-up time is observed in all forms of dry eye disease, including aqueous deficiency, evaporative and mixed.” “Our enthusiasm for the highly differentiated benefits of OK-101 in treating dry eye patients continues to build,” said Dr. Gary S. Jacob, CEO of OKYO. “OK-101 is the first investigational DED therapeutic, to our knowledge, to demonstrate statistically significant and durable improvements in both tear-film breakup time, and ocular pain. What is exciting to us is the totality of the data that we are seeing, including the improvement in conjunctival integrity, positive increase in tear-film breakup time, and improvements in the symptom endpoints of burning and stinging and blurry vision, all supporting the proposed MOA that we uncovered in preclinical animal models. Finally, OK-101 also appears to act quickly, displaying rapid reduction of ocular DED symptoms. These clinical benefits combined with OK-101’s exceptional tolerability profile make OK-101 a novel and promising therapeutic agent with the potential for a market leading position in DED.” The company will be hosting a Key Opinion Leader event featuring Jay Pepose, MD, PhD, and Anat Galor, MD, MSPH, who will discuss these significant findings in depth.

Clinical Ophthalmology 2017:11 1883–1889 OK-101 Phase 2 Trial in DED PatientsThe double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial was conducted at six sites in the U.S. and enrolled 240 subjects with DED dosed twice-daily (BID). Patients were randomly divided into 3 cohorts, with one of the cohorts dosed with 0.05% OK-101 (n=81), a second with 0.1% OK-101 (n=80), and the third cohort with vehicle (n=79). The duration of a patient’s treatment was 14 weeks, including a 2-week run-in period on placebo, to exclude placebo responders from the study, followed by 12 weeks in the randomized portion of the study. About OK-101OK-101 is a lipid conjugated chemerin peptide agonist of the ChemR23 G-protein coupled receptor which is typically found on immune cells of the eye responsible for the inflammatory response. OK-101 was developed using a membrane-anchored-peptide technology to produce a novel long-acting drug candidate for treating dry eye disease. OK-101 has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory and pain-reducing efficacy signals in mouse models of dry eye disease and corneal neuropathic pain (NCP), respectively, and is designed to combat washout through the inclusion of the lipid anchor built into the drug molecule to enhance the residence time of OK-101 within the ocular environment. OK-101 recently showed statistical significance in multiple endpoints in a recently completed Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of OK-101 to treat DED.
