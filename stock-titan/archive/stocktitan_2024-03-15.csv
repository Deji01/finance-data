Positive Impressive financial growth with a 260.9% YoY increase in quarterly revenues Maintained high gross margin and achieved positive operating cash flow Obtained world's first pilotless passenger-carrying eVTOL certificates Expanded to the UAE market and partnered with GAC Group for future production Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining EHang's financial performance, the reported 260.9% year-over-year revenue growth and 97.8% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth are striking indicators of the company's expanding market presence, particularly in the Urban Air Mobility sector. The reported positive operating cash flow in Q4 2023 is a pivotal achievement, as it suggests a transition towards sustainable financial operations. However, the reported operating and net losses, despite showing improvement, indicate that the company is still in a growth phase where expenses outpace revenues. The gross margin remains high at 64.7%, slightly lower than the previous year, which could be attributed to a change in revenue mix and increased production costs. Stakeholders should be aware that while the revenue growth is impressive, the path to profitability is still a work in progress and continued investment in R&D and market expansion could impact short-term financial performance. Market Research Analyst EHang's strategic initiatives, such as the obtaining of the world's first pilotless passenger-carrying eVTOL Type Certificate and Standard Airworthiness Certificate, signify a major advancement in the Urban Air Mobility industry. This development positions EHang as a pioneer in the sector, potentially accelerating the commercial adoption of eVTOLs. The expansion into new markets, like the UAE and partnerships with entities such as GAC Group and Wings Logistics Hub, are likely to enhance EHang's global footprint and diversify its revenue streams. The company's proactive engagement with public-private partnerships in several Chinese cities to foster a low-altitude economy is a strategic move that could lead to long-term benefits. However, investors should be cautious about the execution risks and regulatory hurdles that could affect the company's expansion and operations. Additionally, the competitive pricing strategy for the EH216-S could stimulate demand but may also compress margins if costs are not managed effectively. Aerospace Industry Analyst EHang's technological achievements in the eVTOL space, particularly the EH216-S's certification by the CAAC, are significant milestones for the aerospace industry. This certification not only validates the safety and airworthiness of EHang's UAVs but also sets a precedent for regulatory acceptance of autonomous passenger vehicles. The company's move towards mass production readiness, with the anticipated Production Certificate from the CAAC, indicates scalability in production capabilities. The focus on establishing UAM centers in Europe and strategic alliances for network connectivity solutions points to EHang's commitment to integrating its technology within global aviation infrastructure. The demand for 100 units of EH216-S from various partners underscores market confidence in EHang's products. However, the long-term success of EHang will depend on the continuous development of safe and reliable UAVs, the scalability of production and the ability to navigate the complex regulatory environments of different markets. 03/15/2024 - 04:02 AM Quarterly Revenues Increased by 260.9% YoY, 97.8% QoQ, Fiscal Year Revenues Increased by 165.0%Maintained Stable and High Gross MarginAchieved Positive Operating Cash Flow in the Fourth Quarter of 2023Obtained the World’s First Pilotless Passenger-Carrying eVTOL Type Certificate (“TC”) and Standard Airworthiness Certificate (“AC”) for EH216-S from the CAACMoved Forward eVTOL Sales and Operations Partnered with GAC Group to Strengthen Capability for Future Production Expanded to UAE Market GUANGZHOU, China, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EHang Holdings Limited (“EHang” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EH), the world’s leading Urban Air Mobility (“UAM”) technology platform company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

There was no income tax impact on the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments because the non-GAAP adjustments are usually recorded in entities located in tax-free jurisdictions, such as the Cayman Islands. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effects of items of (i) share-based compensation expenses and (ii) certain non-operational expenses, such as provisions for legal proceedings and amortization of debt discounts, which are included in their comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management members in their financial and operational decision-making. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using the Non-GAAP Financial Measures is that they do not reflect all items of expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Further, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. Each of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to its comparable GAAP measure or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s most directly comparable GAAP measures in conjunction with the Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information on the Non-GAAP Financial Measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.

The change is set to take effect on March 28, 2024, impacting the ADS trading price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The adjustment in the ADS ratio by DouYu International Holdings Limited represents a strategic move that could influence investor perception. Historically, reverse splits are often employed by companies to boost the stock price to meet exchange listing requirements or to appeal to a different class of investors. In this case, the one-for-ten reverse ADS split indicates a reduction in the number of ADSs available, which theoretically increases the price of each ADS. It's important to note that while the share price may increase, the market capitalization of the company remains unchanged, as this is purely a cosmetic alteration. Investors should be aware that the intrinsic value of their holdings does not increase as a result of this action. Furthermore, a higher share price can sometimes reduce liquidity, as each share becomes more expensive to purchase. This move could also be interpreted as an effort to convey a more stable and established company image, as higher-priced stocks are often perceived as less volatile. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the ADS Ratio Change for DouYu could affect the stock's volatility. Typically, stocks with higher per-share prices exhibit lower volatility, which might appeal to risk-averse investors. However, it's also essential to scrutinize the underlying reasons for the reverse split. If the company is struggling to maintain its listing status due to a low share price, this could be a red flag signaling deeper financial issues. Investors should closely monitor the company's performance indicators post-ADS Ratio Change, such as earnings, revenue growth and operational efficiency, to better understand the long-term implications. Moreover, the company's assurance that the post-change ADS price will be higher should be taken with caution, as market forces ultimately determine stock prices. Securities Legal Expert Legally, the ADS Ratio Change is a non-dilutive event that should not affect shareholders' equity. However, shareholders with fractional ADSs will be compensated with the sale proceeds, which could result in minor discrepancies between expected and actual values received. Shareholders should review the terms of the ADS Ratio Change to ensure they understand the implications, such as the potential tax consequences of receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares. It's also important for the company to comply with the regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when conducting such corporate actions. Proper disclosure and transparency with shareholders are essential to maintaining trust and avoiding legal complications. 03/15/2024 - 04:00 AM WUHAN, China, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DouYu International Holdings Limited (""DouYu"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: DOYU) today announced it plans to change the ratio of its American depositary shares (the ""ADSs"") to ordinary shares of the Company with a par value of US$0.0001 per ordinary share (each, an ""Ordinary Share,"" and collectively, the ""Ordinary Shares"") from ten (10) ADSs representing one (1) Ordinary Share to one (1) ADS representing one (1) Ordinary Share (such change, the ""ADS Ratio Change""). For DouYu's ADS holders, this ADS Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one-for-ten reverse ADS split. There will be no change to DouYu's Ordinary Shares. No action is required by holders of uncertificated ADSs to effect the ADS Ratio Change, as the change will be effected on the books of the ADS depositary. Any fractional ADSs will be sold, and the net proceeds from the sale of fractional ADSs will be distributed to the holders entitled thereto. The effect of the ADS Ratio Change on the ADS trading price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market is expected to take place at the open of business on March 28, 2024 (U.S. Eastern Time). As a result of the ADS Ratio Change, the ADS price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than ten times the ADS price before the change.

SAN DIEGO, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ResMed (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD), the global leader in digital health and cloud-connected medical devices that transform care for people with sleep apnea, COPD, and other chronic diseases, today announced the results of its 2024 Global Sleep Survey in conjunction with World Sleep Day (March 15), shedding light on the critical sleep challenges faced by people around the world. The survey uncovered a staggering number of people suffering from a chronic lack of good sleep, with nearly 40% of respondents getting no more than three nights of good sleep each week – and some individuals reporting just one. Respondents reported feeling excessive daytime sleepiness (50%), negative feelings in the morning (40%) and more irritable (39%). In its fourth year, the survey is core to ResMed’s Discover Your Sleep Superpowers campaign and this year’s findings are even more comprehensive, with 36,000 participants across 17 markets providing insights on the state of sleep around the world. A world in sleep crisis* Across the surveyed population, only 13% of respondents reported sleeping well every night. People in Japan (57%) topped the list for the number of poor nights’ sleep each week while people in India were the most rested with 27% saying they sleep well every night.Over half of our respondents used a digital device before going to bed, whether to scroll through social media (53%), watch TV (44%) or catch up on news (31%).When asked about what was keeping them awake, the top reasons that emerged were personal anxiety (36%), insomnia (25%), breathing difficulties (15%), and obesity (13%).Even after falling asleep, 3 in 10 respondents reported being unable to stay asleep without being woken up. People in the UK (44%) and France (42%) experienced the most disruption to their sleep while respondents from India (42%) and Thailand (41%) were most likely to fall and stay asleep the entire night.Among female respondents who are perimenopausal or menopausal, 56% suffer from disturbed sleep, with women in Ireland and Australia being the most affected. In both countries, 3 in 4 women that are perimenopausal or menopausal said they suffer from disturbed sleep. Discover your sleep superpowers The top three benefits experienced by respondents after a night of good sleep were improved concentration (50%), increased productivity (51%) and improved mental health (44%).Nearly 9 in 10 respondents also said that good sleep benefits them physically while 83% agree that good sleep enables them to be more creative.People are also becoming more curious about how they sleep, with 36% of respondents tracking their sleep either through a smartphone app (44%) or wearable (31%). “With sleep being the third pillar of health, alongside diet and exercise, prioritizing your sleep is one of the most effective ways to improve your overall health,” said Carlos, M. Nunez. M.D., ResMed Chief Medical Officer. “With over 936 million people around the world affected by sleep apnea1, it is concerning to learn that 40% of the people we surveyed get no more than three good nights of sleep a week. Poor sleep can be an indicator of conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea, so this World Sleep Day we want to empower people to take charge of their sleep health and have conversations with their healthcare provider.” Among survey respondents, 57% claim they are aware of sleep apnea, a chronic disease in which the muscles of the throat relax to the point of collapse, restricting airflow and causing the sufferer to stop breathing repeatedly throughout the night. Notably, however, only 26% of those respondents have been diagnosed.

The purchased shares will be canceled, leaving the Company with 164,314,223 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The company's recent share repurchase is a strategic financial maneuver that can have several implications for the stock's performance and the company's capital structure. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company is effectively increasing its earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This can make the stock more attractive to investors due to the perception of increased profitability and financial strength.Furthermore, the repurchase signals to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued, which can instill confidence among investors. It's also worth noting that the buyback can provide support for the share price in the open market, potentially stabilizing volatility. However, the use of capital for share repurchases as opposed to reinvestment in business operations or pursuing growth opportunities may be a point of contention among stakeholders focused on long-term value creation. Financial Analyst The execution of the share buyback at a volume-weighted average price provides insight into the company's approach to capital allocation. The cancellation of the purchased shares will result in a contraction of the equity base, which can lead to a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio, enhancing the company's financial leverage metrics.Investors should consider the timing and price range of the repurchase when evaluating the company's financial prudence. The disclosed prices and volumes provide transparency and can be used to assess the potential impact on market liquidity and shareholder value. It's critical to analyze the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements to understand the sustainability of such buybacks and to ensure that they do not compromise the company's financial health in the pursuit of short-term stock performance gains. Corporate Governance Expert A share repurchase program, while generally seen as beneficial for current shareholders, also raises questions about corporate governance and strategic priorities. The decision-making process behind the repurchase, including the role of the board and management's assessment of alternative uses of capital, is a critical aspect for investors to consider.Effective corporate governance would involve evaluating whether the repurchase aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and whether it serves the best interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers and shareholders. Additionally, the transparency and rationale provided by the company regarding the repurchase can be indicative of the management's communication with shareholders and their commitment to shareholder interests. 03/15/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / The Company announces that on 14 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

"Silvercorp Offer for OreCorp to Expire March 22, 2024",2024-03-15T06:39:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Silvercorp Metals Inc. reminds shareholders of its off-market takeover bid for OreCorp , offering a 9% premium over Perseus Mining 's offer. The bid closes on March 22, 2024, with an implied value of A$0.60 per OreCorp share.","Silvercorp Offer for OreCorp to Expire March 22, 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Silvercorp Metals Inc. reminds shareholders of its off-market takeover bid for OreCorp , offering a 9% premium over Perseus Mining 's offer. The bid closes on March 22, 2024, with an implied value of A$0.60 per OreCorp share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The off-market takeover bid by Silvercorp Metals Inc. for the outstanding shares of OreCorp Limited is a significant event that warrants financial analysis. The offer's implied value of A$0.60 per share is a 9% premium over the competing bid from Perseus Mining Limited. This premium is likely to influence OreCorp shareholders' decision-making process, as it represents a tangible financial incentive to tender their shares to Silvercorp. The minimum acceptance condition of 50.1% is a standard threshold in takeover bids, ensuring that the bidder obtains a controlling interest.Additionally, the fact that Silvercorp has already secured approval from the Tanzanian Fair Competition Commission, whereas Perseus has not, may sway shareholders towards accepting the Silvercorp offer. This element of regulatory certainty could be perceived as reducing the risk of deal failure, which is a critical consideration for shareholders. From a market perspective, the successful acquisition of OreCorp would expand Silvercorp's asset portfolio and could potentially lead to operational synergies and increased market share, which are factors that investors typically view favorably. Mergers & Acquisitions Legal Expert In the context of mergers and acquisitions, regulatory approval is a pivotal factor that can make or break a deal. Silvercorp's announcement that it has received the necessary approval from the Tanzanian Fair Competition Commission provides them with a strategic advantage over Perseus. This approval is indicative of due diligence and the ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, which is essential in cross-border transactions. The legal certainty attached to Silvercorp's bid may compel OreCorp shareholders to consider the legal risks associated with the Perseus bid.From a legal standpoint, the return of tendered shares in the event of the bid not meeting the minimum acceptance condition is a standard protective measure for shareholders. It ensures that they are not left in a disadvantaged position should the takeover not proceed. This detail, although minor, reflects a level of fiduciary responsibility by Silvercorp towards OreCorp shareholders. Market Research Analyst The dynamics of takeover bids can have a substantial impact on the market, particularly within the mining sector where consolidation is common. The premium offered by Silvercorp could set a precedent for future transactions in the industry, potentially leading to higher valuations for similar companies. It is important to monitor the response of OreCorp's share price to the offer, as it can serve as an indicator of the market's perception of the bid's fairness and likelihood of success.Furthermore, the outcome of this bid may influence investor sentiment towards both Silvercorp and Perseus. A successful acquisition could lead to a reevaluation of Silvercorp's growth prospects and risk profile. Conversely, if Perseus fails to secure the deal, it may prompt questions about their strategy and execution capabilities. The market's reaction to these developments will be telling of the perceived strategic value of OreCorp within the broader mining industry. 03/15/2024 - 02:39 AM Trading Symbol: TSX: SVM NYSE AMERICAN: SVM VANCOUVER, BC, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (""Silvercorp"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) reminds its shareholders, and shareholders of OreCorp Limited (""OreCorp"") (ASX:ORR), that its off-market takeover bid for all of the ordinary shares in OreCorp that it does not already own (""Silvercorp Offer"") will close at 7:00pm (Sydney time) on March 22, 2024.

Negative None. 03/15/2024 - 03:00 AM Thacker Pass Update: Conditional Commitment for $2.3 billion DoE LoanLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Trident Royalties Plc (AIM:TRR)(OTCQB:TDTRF), the diversified mining royalty company, is pleased to note recent positive announcements by Lithium Americas Corporation (""LAC"", NYSE: LAC) in relation to its Thacker Pass Lithium Project (""Thacker Pass""). Trident holds a net 1.05% gross revenue royalty over Thacker Pass (after expected exercise of a partial royalty buyback, which would see $13.2 million to Trident).U.S. Government Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan1LAC has received a conditional commitment (the ""Conditional Commitment"") from the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"") for a $2.26 billion loan under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (""ATVM"") Loan Program (the ""Loan"") for financing the construction of the processing facilities at Thacker Pass.The Loan is intended to help finance the construction of Thacker Pass, targeted to produce an initial 40,000 tonnes per year (""tpa"") of battery grade lithium carbonate (""Phase 1"").Thacker Pass supports the U.S. government's commitment to securing a domestic supply chain for critical minerals to reduce reliance on foreign materials. Phase 1 production could support lithium needs for up to 800,000 electric vehicles annually.Construction Update2Approximately US$194 million was spent on Thacker Pass in 2023, with site preparation for the first phase of major earthworks completed, including all site clearing, commissioning a water supply system, site access improvements and site infrastructure.General Motors released $320 million in funding in February 2023 in the largest investment publicly disclosed to date by an automaker in a company to produce battery raw materials, with the second tranche of $330 million expected before or in connection with closing of the DOE loan.Lithium Americas is currently focused on advancing detailed engineering, procurement and execution planning for the construction of Thacker Pass Phase 1. Detailed engineering is approximately 30% design complete to date. Lithium Americas plans to continue to increase the level of detailed engineering in advance of issuing full notice to proceed (""FNTP""), which is expected in the second half of 2024.Estimated total capital cost for Phase 1 construction has been revised to $2.93 billion to reflect updated quantities and execution planning tied to increased engineering progress, use of union labor through a PLA for construction of Thacker Pass, development of an all-inclusive housing facility for construction workers, updated equipment pricing and a larger project contingency.Mechanical completion of Thacker Pass Phase 1 is targeted for 2027 following a three-year construction period, with full capacity production targeted for 2028. Major construction is expected to commence in the second half of 2024 following the anticipated closing of the DOE Loan and issuance of FNTP.Jonathan Evans, President and CEO of LAC, commented for the purposes of their announcement1:""The United States has an incredible opportunity to lead the next chapter of global electrification in a way that both strengthens our battery supply chains and ensures that the economic benefits are directed toward American workers, companies and communities. The ATVM Loan Conditional Commitment announced today by the DOE is a significant milestone for Thacker Pass, which will help meet the growing domestic need for lithium chemicals and strengthen our nation's security.""We are pleased to have completed the rigorous DOE due diligence process. The Loan plus GM's strategic investment will provide the vast majority of the capital necessary to fund Phase 1. We deeply appreciate the U.S. government's support as we advance the responsible development of Thacker Pass, and we are excited to continue collaborating with all of our stakeholders to bring shared success for America.""Adam Davidson, Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented:""Thacker Pass is a high priority asset with considerable strategic value for the United States, and the commitment of a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy underscores the level of support to bring this asset to production. The DoE loan is expected to coincide with the release of the second tranche of funding from General Motors of $330 million, such that the capex for Phase 1 production is largely secured.""We anticipate first production from Thacker Pass within three years and the associated royalty payments thereafter. As previously disclosed, we expect Thacker Pass royalty receipts to have a dramatic impact on our revenue, with $10.5 million generated per year at Phase 1 production and a $25,000 lithium price, increasing to $21 million per year at Phase 2.""References1: Source: Lithium Americas Corp news release, 14 March 2024(https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Lithium-Americas-Receives-Conditional-Commitment-for-2.26-Billion-ATVM-Loan-from-the-U.S.-DOE-for-Construction-of-Thacker-Pass/default.aspx)2: Source: Lithium Americas Corp news release, 14 March 2024(https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Lithium-Americas-Provides-a-Thacker-Pass-Construction-Plan-Update/default.aspx)** Ends **Contact details:Trident Royalties PlcAdam Davidson / Richard Hugheswww.tridentroyalties.com+1 (757) 208-5171 / +44 7967 589997Grant Thornton (Nominated Adviser)Colin Aaronson / Samantha Harrison / Enzo Aliajwww.grantthornton.co.uk+44 020 7383 5100Liberum Capital Limited (Joint Broker)Scott Mathieson / Cara Murphywww.liberum.com+44 20 3100 2184Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Joint Broker)Callum Stewart / Ashton Clanfieldwww.stifelinstitutional.com+44 20 7710 7600Tamesis Partners LLP (Joint Broker)Richard Greenfieldwww.tamesispartners.com+44 20 3882 2868St Brides Partners Ltd (Financial PR & IR)Susie Geliherwww.stbridespartners.co.uk+44 20 7236 1177About TridentTrident is a growth-focused diversified mining royalty and streaming company, providing investors with exposure to a mix of base battery, precious, and bulk metals.Key highlights of Trident's strategy include:·Building upon a royalty and streaming portfolio which broadly mirrors the commodity exposure of the global mining sector (excluding fossil fuels) with a bias towards production or near-production assets, differentiating Trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively, or heavily weighted, to precious metals;·Acquiring royalties and streams in resource-friendly jurisdictions worldwide, while most competitors have portfolios focused on North and South America;·Targeting attractive small-to-mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players;·Active deal-sourcing which, in addition to writing new royalties and streams, will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers such as: closed-end funds, prospect generators, junior and mid-tier miners holding royalties as non-core assets, and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market;·Maintaining a low-overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs; and·Leveraging the experience of management, the board of directors, and Trident's adviser team, all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions.The acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified, larger scale portfolio. Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. Once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income.Forward-looking StatementsThis news release contains forward‐looking information.

The property attracted high-earning professionals due to its proximity to Price Corridor, Arizona's economic hub, resulting in robust leasing activity. IPA Capital Markets secured $52 million in acquisition financing, enhancing the property's value. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The sale of Alta Chandler at The Park for $94.5 million underscores the robust demand for multifamily properties in strategic locations. With a per-unit price of $324,742, this transaction is indicative of the premium investors are willing to pay for assets in affluent demographics with high occupancy rates. The property's proximity to major employers and retail spaces adds to its value proposition, potentially offering stable rental income streams for the new owner, Olympus Property.From an investment perspective, the acquisition financing of $52 million arranged by IPA Capital Markets, particularly with eight years of interest-only terms, may point towards favorable lending conditions in the real estate market. This could suggest a continued appetite for multifamily assets among lenders, as well as confidence in the economic stability of regions like Chandler, Arizona. However, investors should monitor market trends, as shifts in interest rates or employment patterns in the region could affect the long-term profitability of such investments. Market Research Analyst Alta Chandler at The Park's performance, with an average of 24 net leases per month since its opening, is a strong indicator of the property's market fit. The high-tech workforce within a 30-minute drive and the presence of significant employers like Intel and Northrop Grumman enhance the location's appeal. The tailored resident profile of high-earning professionals likely ensures a lower risk of default and vacancies, which is important for sustained revenue.Additionally, the emphasis on work-from-home friendly spaces within the units reflects a growing trend in residential real estate to accommodate the changing needs of professionals. This could be a differentiating factor that maintains high occupancy levels and justifies the premium price per unit. Investors should consider such demographic and lifestyle trends when evaluating similar real estate opportunities. Financial Analyst The transaction details provide a glimpse into the valuation metrics within the multifamily real estate segment. A price of $94.5 million for a 291-unit property sets a benchmark for similar assets in the area. Investors analyzing this deal would do well to compare the price per unit against other recent transactions to gauge market sentiment and pricing trends.Furthermore, the structured financing deal, with a substantial interest-only period, could impact cash flow management for the buyer. It allows for potentially higher initial returns on investment, which could be attractive to both the buyer and potential future investors. However, the long-term sustainability of such financial structures depends on the property's ability to generate consistent rental income and the broader economic environment influencing real estate values. 03/14/2024 - 07:17 PM CHANDLER, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Institutional Property Advisors (IPA), a division of Marcus & Millichap (NYSE: MMI), announced today the sale and financing of Alta Chandler at The Park, a 291-unit mid-rise multifamily asset in Chandler, Arizona. The property traded for $94.5 million, which represents $324,742 per unit. IPA Capital Markets arranged $52 million in acquisition financing. “Alta Chandler at The Park’s affluent demographic anchored a robust absorption story, obtaining an average of 24 net leases per month after opening in January 2023,” said Steve Gebing, IPA executive managing director. “The resident profile of high-earning professionals was drawn by the property’s physical characteristics and direct proximity to Price Corridor, Arizona’s most innovative economic hub.” Gebing and IPA executive managing director Cliff David represented the seller, Wood Partners, and procured the buyer, Olympus Property.

Announces Pricing of Upsized Senior Secured Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Encore Capital Group, Inc. announces the pricing of $500.0 million senior secured notes due 2029, upsized by $100.0 million, at an issue price of 100.000%. The notes will accrue interest at 9.250% per annum and mature on April 1, 2029. Proceeds will be used to repay drawings under the Global Senior Facility and pay transaction fees. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upsizing of Encore Capital Group's senior secured notes offering from $400 million to $500 million is a significant move, reflecting investor confidence and a robust demand for the company's debt instruments. The 9.250% interest rate is notably higher than current average corporate bond yields, suggesting that the market may perceive higher risk associated with this debt or that the company is willing to offer a premium to attract capital.Investors should note that the use of proceeds to repay existing credit facility drawings indicates a refinancing strategy, potentially improving the company's debt maturity profile and liquidity. However, the increase in total debt raises questions about the long-term debt management and the interest coverage ratio, which are important for assessing the company's financial health. Debt Market Analyst The choice of a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, as opposed to a public offering, could suggest a targeted strategy by Encore Capital Group to engage with a specific investor base that is comfortable with the company's risk profile. The fact that the notes are senior secured and guaranteed by material subsidiaries implies a lower risk compared to unsecured notes, which should be attractive to debt investors.However, the high interest rate of 9.250% in the current economic environment may indicate that investors are demanding a significant risk premium. This could be due to Encore's creditworthiness, the industry's outlook, or broader market conditions. The security of the notes by the company's assets also means that in case of default, these investors will have a claim over other creditors, which is an important consideration for risk assessment. Credit Risk Analyst Encore Capital Group's decision to secure the notes with the assets of the company and its guarantors is a common practice to provide assurance to the lenders. The full and unconditional guarantee by the material subsidiaries is a strong show of confidence in the company's operational stability and future cash flows, as it suggests that these entities are also performing well enough to back the debt.However, the high yield on the notes indicates that the market may have concerns about the company's credit risk. The intention to repay the revolving credit facility and pay transaction fees and expenses is a typical use of such proceeds, but it is essential to monitor the company's leverage ratios post-transaction to ensure that it maintains a healthy balance between debt and equity. 03/14/2024 - 08:00 PM SAN DIEGO, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Encore Capital Group, Inc.

Shareholders can access audited Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis. The Technical Report complies with NI 43-101 standards. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of B2Gold's Annual Report on Form 40-F with the SEC is a key disclosure that investors monitor closely. It provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and operational performance over the past fiscal year. The inclusion of audited financial statements and management's discussion offers a level of transparency that helps assess the company's profitability, liquidity and potential risks.From a financial perspective, the availability of a hard copy of the audited financial statements upon request is a testament to B2Gold's commitment to shareholder accessibility and corporate governance. However, the direct impact on the stock market is contingent on the details within those statements. Investors will scrutinize the cost of production, revenue generated from gold sales and any write-downs or impairments that could affect the company's bottom line.Moreover, the updated Technical Report for the Fekola Complex is significant. As a mining company, the valuation of B2Gold is intricately linked to its mineral reserves and resources. The NI 43-101 Technical Report provides a regulated and standardized disclosure of the Fekola Complex's mineral deposits. Changes in estimated reserves or production forecasts can lead to material adjustments in the company's market valuation. Mining Industry Analyst The Fekola Complex is a cornerstone asset for B2Gold and the updated Technical Report is important for stakeholders. The NI 43-101 is a Canadian mineral resource classification scheme used for the public disclosure of information relating to mineral properties. Compliance with NI 43-101 is mandatory for public companies in Canada and is a benchmark for reliability in the mining industry.Investors and analysts will dissect the Technical Report to gauge the Fekola Complex's life of mine, extraction costs and capital expenditure requirements. These factors directly influence B2Gold's operational strategy and future cash flow projections. For instance, an extension in mine life or discovery of additional resources at lower extraction costs could be a catalyst for the company's share price performance.Conversely, if the report indicates higher capital expenditures or declining ore grades, this could signal increased operational challenges and potentially dampen investor sentiment. The long-term implications of the Technical Report's findings will be a focal point for evaluating B2Gold's growth trajectory and investment appeal. 03/14/2024 - 10:00 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2Gold Corp.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Afya Limited indicate a strong performance with significant year-over-year growth in key financial metrics such as Adjusted Net Revenue, EBITDA and Net Income. This growth is largely attributed to strategic acquisitions and organic expansion within the company's various segments. The robust cash conversion rate above 90% suggests efficient management of cash flows, reinforcing the company's financial stability. Investors may view this positive cash flow as a sign of a healthy, growing company capable of sustaining investment and returning value to shareholders.Furthermore, the consistent growth in EPS reflects a company that is not only increasing its profitability but also efficiently managing its equity, which can be an attractive point for investors seeking companies with strong earnings potential. This is particularly noteworthy considering the EPS has more than doubled since the company's IPO in 2019. The management's confidence in meeting the targets for 2024, as indicated by the guidance provided, could also signal continued growth expectations, potentially influencing investor sentiment positively. Market Research Analyst Afya's performance within the Brazilian medical education and digital health services sector showcases a strategic emphasis on both organic growth and expansion through acquisitions. The company's success in the Continuing Education segment, which experienced the most significant revenue growth, indicates a rising demand for specialized medical education in Brazil. This could suggest a larger trend within the country's healthcare sector, where there is an increasing need for continuous medical education and specialization.Additionally, the growth in the Digital Services segment, particularly the B2B contracts with pharmaceutical industry leaders, demonstrates Afya's ability to diversify its revenue streams. The increase in active payers across various digital services suggests a growing acceptance and reliance on digital health solutions among medical professionals. For businesses operating in the digital health and education sectors, Afya's performance may serve as a benchmark for the potential growth and profitability within these markets. Economist The economic implications of Afya's reported financial results extend beyond the company's individual performance. The expansion of medical seats and the growth in student numbers reflect a broader investment in the healthcare education infrastructure, which can have long-term positive effects on the country's healthcare system. By increasing the number of trained medical professionals, Afya is contributing to the potential improvement of healthcare services in Brazil.The company's focus on sustainability and ESG initiatives aligns with global economic shifts towards responsible business practices. Investors and consumers alike are increasingly valuing companies that prioritize environmental, social and governance aspects, which can lead to a stronger corporate reputation and potentially higher market valuation over time. Afya's emphasis on ESG may also attract socially responsible investments, catering to a growing segment of the investment community. 03/14/2024 - 07:20 PM Another Year of Strong Performance Robust EPS Expansion Guidance Achievement NOVA LIMA, Brazil--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Afya Limited (Nasdaq: AFYA; B3: A2FY34) (“Afya” or the “Company”), the leading medical education group and digital health services provider in Brazil, reported today financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year period ended December 31, 2023.

The convergence of these elements has empowered us to meet our 2023 targets, and we are now looking ahead to the objectives set for 2024. For another year we are pleased to disclose that the most significant growth of the year, in terms of revenue, stemmed from our Continuing Education segment. Through a robust intake process, the establishment of three new campuses, and course maturation, we can see once more, our students, employees, and partners benefit from our constantly developing ecosystem. Our second most noteworthy growth originated from our undergrad business — our core business remains as robust as ever, with Medicine courses increasing tickets higher than inflation, maturation of medical seats and the completion of UNIMA and Faculdade de Ciências Médicas Jaboatão integration process in November, less than one year after its acquisition, proving our commitment to extract synergies within the operation. In our Digital Services Segment we are proud to see another year of organic growth, reaffirming the immense potential of the business. This surge can be attributed to the success of our B2B engagements, where we have secured new contracts with pharmaceutical industry leaders. Furthermore, the continuous growth in B2P subscribers reflects our unwavering dedication to expanding our reach. Afya´s 2023 Net Revenues was almost four times higher than in 2019, the year of our IPO. Furthermore, there has been a notable increase in cash generation. We have witnessed the cash conversion rate consistently above 90%, demonstrating our ability to achieve substantial growth while enhancing profitability and cash generation. Lastly, our earnings per share (EPS) have more than doubled since 2019 and is still growing, underscoring our capability to blend organic and inorganic growth with disciplined capital allocation, resulting in significant returns to propel our growth. Besides its results achievements, Afya also has been investing in building its sustainability strategy and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) vision to enhance value generation and impact for its stakeholders, as well as to contribute to the longevity of the business with socio-environmental responsibility. Aware of the role we play, ESG-related aspects permeate our strategies and routines. We aim to contribute to the social and economic development of the communities in which we operate and enable physicians to experience the best aspects of their profession.

Continuing Education revenues are related to monthly intakes and tuition fees and do not have a considerable concentration in any period. Digital Services is comprised mainly of Medcel, Pebmed, and iClinic revenues. While Pebmed and iClinic do not have significant fluctuation regarding seasonality, Medcel’s revenue is concentrated in the first and last quarter of the year due to the enrollments. In addition, the majority of Medcel’s revenues are derived from printed books and e-books, which are recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Consequently, the Digital Services segment generally has higher revenues and results of operations in the first and last quarters of the year than in the second and third quarters. Revenue Adjusted Net Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was R$729.5 million, an increase of 22.6% over the same period of the prior year, mainly due to UNIMA and FCM Jaboatão acquisition, higher net tickets in Medicine courses, maturation of medical seats and the growth of Continuing Education and Digital Services segments. Net Revenue of Continuing Education for the fourth quarter of 2023 was R$38.6 million, an increase of 16.0% YoY, boosted by the growth in the number of students. Digital services increased 17.1% YoY, totaling R$65.2 million for this quarter. The organic growth is a combination of (a) an increase in the B2B engagements, increasing B2B Net Revenue by 63.8%, and (b) the expansion of the active payers in the B2P, mainly in Whitebook, Medical Harbour, Shosp, IClinic, Cardiopapers and Além da Medicina. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, Adjusted Net Revenue was R$2,874.1 million, an increase of 23.9% over the same period of last year.

Forward – Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward looking, and include risks and uncertainties related to statements about our competition; our ability to attract, upsell and retain students; our ability to increase tuition prices and prep course fees; our ability to anticipate and meet the evolving needs of students and professors; our ability to source and successfully integrate acquisitions; general market, political, economic, and business conditions; and our financial targets such as revenue, share count and IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures including gross margin, operating margin, net income (loss) per diluted share, and free cash flow. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations, financial results and financial position and the Brazilian economy. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. The achievement or success of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. Readers should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company’s financial results are included in the filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from time to time, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in the most recent Rule 434(b) prospectus. These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the investor relations section of our website at: https://ir.afya.com.br/. 9. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board—IASB, Afya uses Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Cash Conversion Ratio information, which are non-GAAP financial measures, for the convenience of investors. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that intends to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be equally adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure. Afya calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus/minus net financial result plus income taxes expense plus depreciation and amortization plus interest received on late payments of monthly tuition fees, plus share-based compensation plus/minus share of income of associate plus/minus non-recurring expenses. The calculation of Adjusted Net Income is net income plus amortization of customer relationships and trademark, plus share-based compensation. We calculate Operating Cash Conversion Ratio as the Cash flow from operating activities, adjusted with income taxes paid divided by Adjusted EBITDA plus/minus non-recurring expenses. The calculation of Adjusted EPS is our Adjusted Net Income, minus the Minority Net Income divided by the Weighted average number of outstanding shares. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA, because it believes these measures provide investors with a supplemental measure of financial performance of the core operations that facilitates period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Afya also presents Operating Cash Conversion Ratio because it believes this measure provides investors with a measure of how efficiently the Company converts EBITDA into cash. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this prospectus are not a substitute for the IFRS measures of earnings. Additionally, calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Cash Conversion Ratio may be different from the calculations used by other companies, including competitors in the education services industry, and therefore, Afya’s measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. 10.

The therapy offers a one-time infusion with 20% of patients achieving a complete response in a pivotal trial. Breyanzi is now FDA approved for large B-cell lymphoma and CLL or SLL. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The FDA's accelerated approval of Breyanzi for relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL represents a significant advancement in the treatment landscape for these blood cancers. The decision is grounded in the promising data from the TRANSCEND CLL 004 trial, which indicated a 20% complete response rate in a patient population with limited treatment options. The durability of response, with a median duration not yet reached, suggests potential for long-term remission, a key goal in oncology. As an oncologist, the high rates of minimal residual disease negativity are particularly encouraging, indicating a profound depth of response that could translate into improved patient outcomes. The safety profile, with manageable cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events, is also noteworthy, as it suggests that Breyanzi can be administered with a reasonable expectation of patient tolerability. Healthcare Economist From a health economics perspective, the introduction of Breyanzi for CLL and SLL patients refractory to BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors could disrupt current treatment paradigms. The one-time infusion model contrasts with ongoing treatment regimens, potentially offering cost savings over the long term. However, CAR T-cell therapies are often associated with high upfront costs and it will be critical to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Breyanzi in the context of its clinical benefits. The potential reduction in long-term healthcare utilization if patients achieve sustained remission must be weighed against the initial investment in this personalized therapy. Moreover, the accelerated approval is contingent upon further confirmation of clinical benefit, which will be important for determining the value proposition of Breyanzi in a real-world setting. Market Research Analyst As a market research analyst, the approval of Breyanzi by the FDA is a strategic milestone for Bristol Myers Squibb, potentially strengthening its position in the oncology market. The expansion of Breyanzi's indications to include CLL and SLL broadens the therapy's addressable market and may drive revenue growth for the company. It's important to consider the competitive landscape, as Breyanzi is now the first CAR T-cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL, which could give Bristol Myers Squibb a first-mover advantage. However, market uptake will depend on factors such as physician acceptance, patient access and reimbursement dynamics. The company's support programs, like Cell Therapy 360, are key initiatives that could facilitate adoption by addressing logistical challenges associated with CAR T therapies and enhancing the overall treatment experience. 03/14/2024 - 09:35 PM Breyanzi offers a personalized treatment option delivered as a one-time infusion that provides deep and durable responses for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL who have historically had no standard of care In TRANSCEND CLL 004, the first pivotal multicenter trial to evaluate a CAR T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, 20% of patients treated with Breyanzi achieved a complete response (CR) with median duration of CR not reached, along with an established safety profile Breyanzi is now FDA approved for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and CLL or SLL, bringing this differentiated CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy to more patients PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval of Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel), a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). In R/R CLL or SLL, Breyanzi is delivered through a treatment process which culminates in a one-time infusion* with a single dose containing 90 to 110 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells. Please see the Important Safety Information section below, including Boxed WARNINGS for Breyanzi regarding Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Neurologic Toxicities, and Secondary Hematological Malignancies.

With the approval of Breyanzi as the first CAR T for relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, we are now able to offer these patients a personalized option, while further expanding access across the broadest array of B-cell malignancies, to address this critical unmet need.” CLL and SLL are among the most common types of B-cell lymphoma. Treatments for people living with CLL or SLL primarily consist of targeted therapies including BTK- and BCL-2 inhibitors. However, patients often experience relapse or become refractory following early-line treatment with these therapies and there is no established standard of care for patients with double-class exposed CLL or SLL. After relapsing or becoming refractory to these therapies, patients have few options and poor outcomes, including lack of durable complete responses. The Phase 1/2 open-label, single-arm TRANSCEND CLL 004 study was the first pivotal multicenter trial to evaluate a CAR T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL. The CR rate associated with Breyanzi treatment was 20% (95% CI: 11.1-31.8). Among patients who achieved a CR, median duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 15 months-NR) at the time of data cutoff. Among all responders (ORR = 45%; 95% CI: 32.3-57.5), median duration of response was 35.3 months (95% CI: 12.4-NR). High rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status were observed across patients treated with Breyanzi who achieved a CR, with an MRD-negativity rate of 100% in the blood (95% CI: 75.3-100) and 92.3% in the bone marrow (95% CI: 64-99.8). “CLL and SLL are currently considered incurable diseases with few treatment options in the relapsed setting that can confer complete responses, something that has historically been associated with improved long-term outcomes,” said Tanya Siddiqi, M.D., lead investigator and Associate Professor, Division of Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center. “The FDA approval of liso-cel in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL after treatment with prior BTKi and BCL2i is a remarkable breakthrough, shifting the treatment paradigm from continuous therapy with sequential regimens to overcome drug resistance, to a one-time personalized T-cell based approach that has the potential to offer patients complete and lasting remission.” Among 89 patients in the study treated with Breyanzi, occurrences of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) were mostly low grade. Any grade CRS occurred in 83% of patients, with Grade 3 CRS occurring in 9% of patients. No Grade 4/5 CRS events were reported. Any grade NEs were reported in 46% of patients, with Grade 3 NEs reported in 20% of patients and one case of Grade 4 NE reported. No Grade 5 NEs were reported. “For people struggling with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, current treatment choices are limited,” said Dr. Brian Koffman, physician, CLL patient and cofounder, executive vice president and chief medical officer of CLL Society. “The approval of Breyanzi as the first CAR T cell therapy available for relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL brings new hope to these patients with the potential for durable responses after a single CAR T infusion. We are grateful to the patients and their families who enter the trials and to all the researchers involved in making possible this important new treatment option in CLL and SLL.” Bristol Myers Squibb offers various programs and resources to address the needs of patients and caregivers, and provides support that allows for access to therapies, including Breyanzi. Bristol Myers Squibb also supports the patient and physician treatment experience by providing Cell Therapy 360, a digital service platform, which optimizes access to relevant information, manufacturing updates, and patient and caregiver support. About TRANSCEND CLL 004 TRANSCEND CLL 004 (NCT03331198) is a Phase 1/2 open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating Breyanzi in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study assessed the safety and recommended dose for the subsequent Phase 2 expansion cohort. The Phase 2 portion of the study is evaluating Breyanzi at the recommended dose from the Phase 1 monotherapy arm. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 portion of the study is complete response rate, including complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery, based on independent review committee according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018 guidelines. About CLL and SLL Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes, and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections. As the number of abnormal cells grows, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) also affects the lymphocytes, with cancer cells found mostly in the lymph nodes. While there are several treatments available for CLL and SLL, there is a need for additional effective therapies as there is no standard of care for relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL after prior therapy with targeted agents, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease have limited treatment options and generally experience shorter periods of response with each subsequent treatment. About Breyanzi Breyanzi is a CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, which enhances the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. Breyanzi is made from a patient’s own T cells, which are collected and genetically reengineered to become CAR T cells that are then delivered via infusion as a one-time treatment. Breyanzi is approved in the U.S., Japan and Europe for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory LBCL, and in Japan, Europe, Switzerland, and Canada for relapsed and refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Bristol Myers Squibb’s clinical development program for Breyanzi includes clinical studies in other types of lymphoma. For more information, visit clinicaltrials.gov. * Treatment process includes leukapheresis, manufacturing, administration, and adverse event monitoring. Indication BREYANZI is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of: adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B, who have: refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy; or refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy and are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to comorbidities or age; or relapsed or refractory disease after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Limitations of Use: BREYANZI is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and a B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

CRS and Neurologic Toxicities Monitoring Monitor patients daily for at least 7 days following BREYANZI infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities and assess for other causes of neurological symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated. Manage neurologic toxicity with supportive care and/or corticosteroid as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS or neurologic toxicity occur at any time. BREYANZI REMS Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, BREYANZI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the BREYANZI REMS. The required components of the BREYANZI REMS are: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer BREYANZI must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements. Certified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after BREYANZI infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Further information is available at www.BreyanziREMS.com, or contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332. Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of BREYANZI. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Serious Infections Severe infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have occurred in patients after BREYANZI infusion. In patients receiving BREYANZI, infections of any grade occurred in 36% (LBCL) and 35% (CLL/SLL), with Grade 3 or higher infections occurring in 12% (LBCL) and 16% (CLL/SLL) of all patients. Grade 3 or higher infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 7% (LBCL) and 10% (CLL/SLL), bacterial infections in 4.3% (LBCL) and 2.2% (CLL/SLL), viral infections in 1.9% (LBCL) and 1.1% (CLL/SLL), and fungal infections in 0.5% (LBCL) and 2.2% (CLL/SLL). Febrile neutropenia developed after BREYANZI infusion in 8% (LBCL) and 12% (CLL/SLL) of patients. Febrile neutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after BREYANZI administration and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Avoid administration of BREYANZI in patients with clinically significant, active systemic infections. Viral reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. In patients who received BREYANZI, 15 of 16 LBCL patients, and all 9 CLL/SLL patients with a prior history of HBV were treated with concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. In patients with prior history of HBV, consider concurrent antiviral suppressive therapy to prevent HBV reactivation per standard guidelines. Prolonged Cytopenias Patients may exhibit cytopenias not resolved for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and BREYANZI infusion. Grade 3 or higher cytopenias persisted at Day 29 following BREYANZI infusion in 36% (LBCL) and 45% (CLL/SLL) of patients, and included thrombocytopenia in 28% (LBCL) and 23% (CLL/SLL), neutropenia in 21% (LBCL) and 35% (CLL/SLL), and anemia in 6% (LBCL) and 12% (CLL/SLL). Monitor complete blood counts prior to and after BREYANZI administration. Hypogammaglobulinemia B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving BREYANZI. In patients receiving BREYANZI, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse reaction in 11% (LBCL) and 14% (CLL/SLL) of patients. Hypogammaglobulinemia, either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion, was reported in 28% (LBCL) and 37% (CLL/SLL) of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with BREYANZI and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement as clinically indicated. Live vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following BREYANZI treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during BREYANZI treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with BREYANZI. Secondary Malignancies Patients treated with BREYANZI may develop secondary malignancies. T cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including BREYANZI. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes. Monitor lifelong for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1- 888-805-4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing. Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving BREYANZI are at risk for developing altered or decreased consciousness or impaired coordination in the 8 weeks following BREYANZI administration. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, for at least 8 weeks. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS) Immune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with BREYANZI. Three of 89 (3%) safety evaluable patients with R/R CLL/SLL developed IEC-HS. Time to onset of IEC-HS ranged from 7 to 18 days. Two of the 3 patients developed IEC-HS in the setting of ongoing CRS and 1 in the setting of ongoing neurotoxicity. IEC-HS was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. One patient had fatal IEC-HS and one had ongoing IEC-HS at time of death. IEC-HS is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of IEC-HS should be administered per current practice guidelines. Adverse Reactions The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) in: LBCL are fever, cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 30%) include lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, platelet count decrease, and hemoglobin decrease. CLL/SLL are cytokine release syndrome, encephalopathy, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 30%) in CLL/SLL include neutrophil count decrease, white blood cell decrease, hemoglobin decrease, platelet count decrease, and lymphocyte count decrease.

However, the market could interpret the sale as a signal regarding the Selling Stockholder's view of ODDITY's future prospects.Moreover, the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares introduces a potential for increased market supply of ODDITY's shares, which could dilute the stock's value if exercised. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers suggests confidence in the offering's success, yet their fees and the overall impact on share price due to increased float should be considered by current and prospective shareholders. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the broader implications of ODDITY's secondary offering, it's essential to consider the technology sector's performance and investor sentiment. The pricing of the offering may reflect sector trends and the company's competitive position. If the tech sector is bullish, ODDITY's share price could remain stable or increase post-offering, despite the potential dilution. Alternatively, a bearish outlook could exacerbate the impact of increased share supply on the price.Investors should also assess the timing of the offering. If L Catterton is divesting at a market peak, this could suggest a strategic exit. Conversely, selling in a downturn could indicate a need for liquidity or a lack of confidence in a short-term recovery. This offering also serves as a benchmark for valuations within the tech industry, potentially influencing future equity deals and mergers and acquisitions activity. Securities Law Expert From a legal perspective, the effectiveness of the registration statement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a procedural milestone that allows the offering to proceed. Compliance with SEC regulations is mandatory and the availability of a prospectus ensures transparency, providing investors with critical information about the offering. The legal disclaimer in the press release is standard practice, designed to limit the company's and underwriters' liability and to inform potential investors of the regulatory framework governing the sale.The secondary offering's structure, with multiple book-running managers, is indicative of a robust legal and regulatory process, ensuring the offering adheres to market standards and legal requirements. Potential investors are advised to review the prospectus closely for risk factors, management's discussion and analysis and the financial statements, which offer insights into ODDITY's financial health and future outlook, beyond the information disclosed in the press release. 03/14/2024 - 08:55 PM NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ODDITY Tech Ltd.

Financially, NuScale reported revenue of $4.6 million and a net loss of $56.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, with cash and equivalents of $125.4 million and no debt on the balance sheet. Positive None. Negative NuScale reported a net loss of $56.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase from the net loss of $47.2 million for the same period in 2022. The net loss for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was $180.1 million, higher than the net loss of $141.6 million for the same period in 2022. Energy Industry Analyst The acceptance of NuScale Power Corporation's Standard Design Approval application by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is a significant milestone in the energy sector, particularly for the advancement of small modular reactor technology. The company's focus on commercialization and the initiation of manufacturing for NuScale Power Modules indicates a shift towards the operational phase, which is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for carbon-free energy solutions. The potential increase in power output from an uprated 77 MWe module design could position NuScale to meet the needs of a broader customer base, enhancing its competitive advantage in the market.However, the financial update reveals a substantial net loss, despite an increase in revenue year-over-year. While the company's balance sheet shows a strong cash position with no debt, the reported net losses underscore the challenges faced in the capital-intensive nuclear industry during the development phase. NuScale's cost efficiency actions to save $50-60 million annually may help in optimizing resources, but it's important to monitor how these savings impact the company's growth trajectory and ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. Environmental Policy Expert NuScale Power's progress in SMR technology aligns with global efforts to transition to low-carbon energy sources. The environmental implications of deploying SMRs are considerable, as they offer a more flexible and scalable alternative to traditional nuclear power plants. This could lead to wider adoption in various industrial applications, including hydrogen and ammonia production, which are key components in the renewable energy landscape. The company's advancement in this field may influence policy decisions and encourage the adoption of clean energy technologies, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.It is also worth noting the strategic importance of receiving the first-ever U.S. NRC design approval for an SMR. This regulatory milestone not only enhances NuScale's credibility but also sets a precedent for future SMR deployments, potentially shaping environmental policy and regulation in the nuclear energy sector. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the juxtaposition of NuScale Power's increased revenue against its widening net loss presents a complex picture for investors. The company's strategic redirection towards revenue-generating projects and securing new orders suggests a proactive approach to achieving long-term profitability. However, investors should consider the inherent risks associated with the long sales and development cycles typical of the nuclear industry.The company's lack of debt and substantial cash reserves are positive indicators of financial health, providing a buffer as it navigates the capital-intensive phases of SMR development and commercialization. The market's reception of NuScale's cost-saving measures and resource optimization will be critical to watch, as these efforts are intended to streamline operations and improve the company's strategic positioning. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Continued progress toward commercialization of small modular reactor (SMR) technology to meet consumer demand for safe, reliable, 24/7 and carbon-free baseload energy Planning underway for RoPower project’s Phase 2 Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) work Standard Design Approval application accepted and under review by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Doosan Enerbility continues to produce forgings and materials associated with the manufacture of the first NuScale Power Modules™ Company executed a resource optimization plan to reduce expenses and better position NuScale commercially, financially and strategically PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), the industry-leading provider of proprietary and innovative advanced small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Over the course of 2023, we made significant progress towards commercializing our SMR technology, including continued activities to ensure readiness for manufacturing of our first NuScale Power Modules, building traction amongst data centers and further developing industrial applications for SMRs, such as process heat, hydrogen, and ammonia production,” said John Hopkins, President and Chief Executive Officer of NuScale Power. “Additionally, as the first and only SMR to receive U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission design approval and certification and have Long Lead Materials in production, NuScale maintains our position as the global first mover in commercial SMR development. We continue to receive serious interest from major technology and industrial companies, utilities, national and local governments, and others seeking 24/7 clean, reliable energy and process heat.” Business Update RoPower project working to advance into the next phase of development by initiating Phase 2 Front-End Engineering and Design. NuScale technology was selected by Standard Power to support the development of two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The facilities are planned to produce nearly 2 GW of clean energy through the deployment of 24 NuScale Power Modules. Standard Design Approval (SDA) application for an uprated 77 MWe module design was accepted for review by the NRC in July 2023 and NuScale received a schedule for an anticipated 24-month review process. The increased power output will support the capacity needs of a wider range of customers with 12 modules producing nearly a gigawatt of electricity. As NuScale accelerates its commercialization efforts, it is also initiating the manufacture of NuScale Power Modules. Notably, our supply chain partners commenced the production of long lead time components, including forgings and other materials associated with the first NuScale Power Modules. Financial Update Balance sheet includes cash and equivalents of $125.4 million ($5.1 million of which is restricted), and no debt. In response to the burgeoning market opportunities and the reality of lengthy sales and development cycles, in January 2024, NuScale announced cost efficiency actions projected to result in approximately $50-60 million in annualized savings. The Company is redirecting resources to the most immediate commercial opportunities with a focus on advancing revenue-generating projects, securing new orders and positioning NuScale towards long-term success. Revenue of $4.6 million and net loss of $56.4 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, compared to revenue of $3.4 million and a net loss of $47.2 million, respectively, for the same period in 2022. Revenue of $22.8 million and a net loss of $180.1 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, compared to revenue of $11.8 million and a net loss of $141.6 million for the same period in 2022.

It's important for investors to monitor the fund's portfolio allocation and the sectors it's invested in, as this will influence the risk profile and the expected income.Additionally, the Board's statement that the distribution policy can be modified or terminated at any time highlights the dynamic nature of such funds. Changes in economic conditions, market volatility, or shifts in interest rates could prompt a reassessment of the distribution policy, impacting investor expectations and the fund's market attractiveness. Market Research Analyst The announcement from TCW Strategic Income Fund, Inc. regarding its quarterly distribution is a reflection of the fund's operational strategy and market positioning. Closed-end funds like TSI often attract investors seeking regular income and the consistency of distributions can be a significant factor in an investor's decision to hold or purchase shares. The mention of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code indicates compliance with regulatory requirements, which is crucial for investor confidence.From a market perspective, the distribution yield, calculated as the annualized distribution divided by the fund's market price, is an important metric for comparing TSI to other investment opportunities. Although the distribution itself might not be substantial in isolation, it can impact investor sentiment and the fund's market price. Observing the historical distribution patterns and comparing them to peers can provide insights into the fund's competitive standing.Furthermore, the fund’s longevity since its inception in March 1987 suggests a track record that can be scrutinized. Long-term performance, management stability and response to market cycles are aspects that investors might consider when evaluating the fund's resilience and potential for future growth. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TCW Strategic Income Fund, Inc.

Dividends are a key indicator of a firm's stability and investor confidence, as they represent a direct return on investment to shareholders.

Equity Residential Declares First Quarter Dividends,2024-03-14T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Equity Residential (EQR) increases its annualized dividend by 2% and sets record and meeting dates for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.,"Equity Residential Declares First Quarter Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Equity Residential (EQR) increases its annualized dividend by 2% and sets record and meeting dates for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Positive Equity Residential raises its annualized dividend by 2% to $2.70 per share. The first quarter common share dividend of $0.675 per share will be paid on April 12, 2024. A quarterly dividend of $1.03625 per share for the Series K Preferred Shares will be paid on April 1, 2024. The 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for June 20, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. CT. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Equity Residential's dividend increase is a positive signal to shareholders, indicating the company's confidence in its financial stability and earnings outlook. A 2% dividend increase, while modest, suggests a sustainable approach to shareholder returns, avoiding aggressive hikes that might compromise the company's liquidity. This is particularly noteworthy given the real estate sector's sensitivity to economic cycles and interest rate fluctuations.Investors typically view dividend increases as a sign of a company's health and a management team's commitment to returning value to shareholders. The increased dividend might attract income-focused investors, potentially leading to a more stable shareholder base. However, it's important to consider the payout ratio and whether the increased dividend is well-covered by earnings to assess the long-term viability of this policy. Market Research Analyst The real estate market has been under scrutiny given the recent macroeconomic volatility and Equity Residential's dividend increase could be interpreted as a strategic move to maintain investor interest amidst such conditions. The company operates in a sector where occupancy rates and rental yields are key performance indicators. The dividend hike may reflect underlying strength in these areas, possibly driven by favorable demographic trends and urbanization.Moreover, the increase aligns with broader market expectations where companies strive to deliver shareholder value through dividends and share buybacks. It's essential to monitor how this strategy correlates with the company's capital expenditure and growth plans, as reinvestment in property development or acquisitions could also drive long-term value. Economist From an economic perspective, the announcement by Equity Residential must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The modest increase in dividends may reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook, balancing shareholder returns with the need for financial prudence in an uncertain interest rate environment. As real estate is often financed through debt, the cost of borrowing is an important factor for companies like Equity Residential.The timing of the dividend increase could be strategic, preceding potential economic headwinds such as inflation or a slowdown in economic growth, which could impact disposable incomes and, by extension, rental markets. It's crucial to analyze this move alongside economic indicators to predict future performance and the potential impact on the company's stock price. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Increases Annualized Dividend by 2% Sets Record and Meeting Dates for 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today announced that its Board of Trustees declared quarterly dividends on the Company’s common and preferred shares.

Excluding foreign exchange impact, revenues decreased by 7% in 2023. Eastman Business Park segment excluded from reportable segments. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in consolidated revenues for both Q4 and the full year at Eastman Kodak Company is a notable indicator of the company's performance. The 10% decline in Q4 revenues and 7% for the full year suggests a contraction in sales, which could be attributed to market challenges or a reduction in demand for Kodak's products. However, it's worth noting the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage, which implies that while revenue has fallen, the company has improved its cost structure or has been able to sell its products at higher margins.The substantial increase in GAAP net income and Operational EBITDA for the full year is particularly impressive, indicating strong operational performance and effective cost management. Investors might view these improvements as a positive sign of the company's ability to enhance profitability despite revenue headwinds. The improved cash flow from operations and increased year-end cash balance also provide the company with more financial flexibility, which could support future investments or debt reduction.However, the segment performance shows mixed results, with the Print segment experiencing a significant revenue decline, while the Advanced Materials & Chemicals segment saw an increase in Operational EBITDA. This divergence suggests that Kodak's growth initiatives in the Advanced Materials & Chemicals group may be starting to pay off, but it also raises questions about the sustainability of the traditional Print business in a digital age. Market Research Analyst The performance of Eastman Kodak Company needs to be contextualized within the broader printing and imaging industry. The decline in print revenues may reflect ongoing industry-wide shifts towards digital solutions, which could be squeezing Kodak's traditional business. The company's focus on innovation and its upcoming product introductions at the drupa tradeshow are strategic moves to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving market. The emphasis on operational efficiency and smart revenue—revenue that contributes positively to profit margins—is critical for Kodak's long-term sustainability.Investors should consider the company's strategic investments in growth areas like Advanced Materials & Chemicals. The increasing revenue contributions from these segments suggest diversification away from declining print revenues, which could be a hedge against future risks. However, the scalability and competitive landscape of these new ventures will determine their impact on Kodak's overall financial health.Lastly, the strong cash performance and improved working capital management are positive signs that management is focused on creating a leaner, more cash-generative business. This financial prudence could be a key factor in navigating potential market downturns or investing in new technologies that could drive future growth. Economist The constant currency basis adjustment in Kodak's financials indicates that currency fluctuations have had a minor impact on the company's reported revenue decline. This suggests that the underlying business dynamics, rather than exchange rate volatility, are primarily responsible for the revenue decrease. In the context of a global economy, it's important to recognize that multinational companies like Kodak are exposed to foreign exchange risks, which can obscure the true performance of their international operations.Furthermore, the improved gross profit margins could be partially attributed to pricing rationalization, which may involve raising prices or discontinuing unprofitable products. While this can lead to short-term profitability gains, it could also potentially alienate price-sensitive customers or reduce market share if competitors do not follow suit.The increased Operational EBITDA and net income are encouraging, but they must be weighed against the backdrop of ongoing global cost increases. Companies are facing pressure from inflationary trends that could erode profit margins over time. Kodak's ability to continue executing on cost controls while investing in innovation will be critical in maintaining its competitive edge in the long term. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.

APPENDICES In this fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results news release, reference is made to the following non-GAAP financial measures: Operational EBITDA; andRevenues and Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis. Kodak believes that these non-GAAP measures represent important internal measures of performance. Accordingly, where they are provided, it is to give investors the same financial data management uses with the belief that this information will assist the investment community in properly assessing the underlying performance of Kodak, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Kodak’s segment measure of profit and loss is an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Operational EBITDA”). Operational EBITDA represents the earnings (loss) from continuing operations excluding the provision for income taxes; non-service cost components of pension and other postemployment benefits income; depreciation and amortization expense; restructuring costs and other; stock-based compensation expense; consulting and other costs; idle costs; other operating expense (income); loss on early extinguishment of debt; interest expense; and other (income) charges, net. The change in revenues and Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis, as presented in this financial results news release, is calculated by using average foreign exchange rates for the three or twelve months ended December 31, 2022, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect for the three or twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP measure of Net Income to Operational EBITDA and Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively: (in millions)Q4 2023 Q4 2022 $ Change % DeclineNet Income$5 $7 $(2) -29%All other 1 (1) 2 Depreciation and amortization 7 7 - Restructuring costs and other 1 10 (9) Stock based compensation 1 1 - Consulting and other costs(2) (3) (9) 6 Idle costs(3) 2 1 1 Other operating expense (income), net 6 (1) 7 Interest expense 16 11 5 Pension income excluding service cost component (39) (21) (18) Other charges, net 1 (1) 2 Provision for income taxes 4 3 1 Operational EBITDA$2 $7 $(5) -71%Impact of foreign exchange(5) (2) (2) Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis$- $7 $(7) -100% The following table reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP measure of Net Income to Operational EBITDA and Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively: (in millions)FY 2023 FY 2022 $ Change % ImprovementNet Income$75 $26 $49 188%All other (2) (3) 1 Depreciation and amortization 30 29 1 Restructuring costs and other(1) 10 13 (3) Stock based compensation 7 5 2 Consulting and other costs(2) (13) (2) (11) Idle costs(3) 3 3 - Other operating expense (income), net(4) 6 (1) 7 Interest expense(4) 52 40 12 Pension income excluding service cost component(4) (161) (98) (63) Loss on early extinguishment of debt(4) 27 - 27 Other (income) charges, net(4) (1) 1 (2) Provision for income taxes(4) 12 5 7 Operational EBITDA$45 $18 $27 150%Impact of foreign exchange(5) (2) (2) Operational EBITDA on a constant currency basis$43 $18 $25 139% Footnote Explanations: (1)Restructuring costs and other for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included $7 million and $10 million, respectively, which were reported as Restructuring costs and other and $3 million in each period representing inventory write-downs which were reported as Cost of revenues.(2)Consulting and other costs are primarily professional services and internal costs associated with certain corporate strategic initiatives, investigations and litigation.

The company strengthened its balance sheet with term loan financing and ATM proceeds. Auryxia net product revenue for 2023 was $170.3 million, and Akebia introduced new pipeline programs. Positive Strong financial results for Q4 2023 Potential U.S. approval for vadadustat by March 27, 2024 Strengthened balance sheet with term loan financing and ATM proceeds Auryxia net product revenue for 2023 was $170.3 million Introduction of new pipeline programs Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Akebia Therapeutics, particularly the net product revenue from Auryxia, represent a stable revenue stream that is crucial for the company's operations. The slight increase in net product revenues year-over-year indicates a steady market demand. Additionally, the strategic financial moves, such as the term loan from BlackRock and the ATM proceeds, enhance the company's liquidity, providing flexibility and a safety net for the upcoming potential product launch. This financial position could be seen favorably by investors as it suggests a level of preparedness for both opportunities and challenges ahead.However, it's important to note the decrease in total revenues year-over-year, which may raise concerns about the company's broader revenue-generating capabilities. The reliance on the success of vadadustat's approval is a significant factor to watch, as it could either catalyze a new growth phase or lead to financial strain. The company's claim of operational funding for the next two years, contingent on vadadustat approval, underscores the high stakes of the upcoming PDUFA date. Medical Research Analyst The potential approval of vadadustat by the FDA is a pivotal event for Akebia, as it could significantly disrupt the market for anemia treatments related to chronic kidney disease. The shift from R&D expenses towards commercial readiness reflects a strategic allocation of resources in anticipation of vadadustat's market entry. If vadadustat is approved, Akebia's position in the renal disease treatment market could be strengthened, potentially increasing its market share and impacting competitive dynamics.Furthermore, the introduction of new pipeline programs for acute kidney injury and retinopathy of prematurity indicates a commitment to diversifying the company's portfolio, which could mitigate risk and foster long-term growth. However, the success of these programs is uncertain and the company's future will be significantly influenced by the commercial performance of vadadustat, should it be approved. Market Research Analyst Considering the competitive landscape of the biopharmaceutical industry, Akebia's preparation for the potential launch of vadadustat is an indicator of the company's strategic vision. The appointment of Nicholas Grund as Chief Commercial Officer brings a focus on commercialization expertise, which is essential during this critical phase. The market's response to vadadustat, assuming approval, will depend on the effectiveness of Akebia's commercial strategy and the drug's competitive advantages over existing treatments.It is also worth noting the company's expectations for Auryxia's net product revenue growth in 2024, suggesting confidence in its existing product line. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with the company's future performance being closely tied to vadadustat's regulatory outcome and subsequent market acceptance. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Potential vadadustat U.S. approval on PDUFA date of March 27, 2024 Strengthened balance sheet with $55.0 million term loan financing and $26.0 million in proceeds from ATM Reported 2023 Auryxia (ferric citrate) net product revenue of $170.3 million CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Akebia Therapeutics®, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and recent business highlights. Akebia is preparing for a potential launch of vadadustat, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of March 27, 2024. ""We are eagerly awaiting the PDUFA date for vadadustat, now within weeks, and we believe the progress we have made over the past 12 months has positioned our team to successfully launch vadadustat in the U.S., if approved,"" said John P. Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. ""A U.S. approval for vadadustat will be transformational for Akebia and a significant step toward our goal of bettering the lives of people impacted by kidney disease. Our team remains dedicated to delivering an innovative oral therapeutic treatment for anemia due to chronic kidney disease for patients on dialysis."" Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Business Highlights: Appointed Nicholas Grund as Chief Commercial Officer, who brings years of expertise in customer-facing roles to Akebia. Mr. Grund's operational, commercial and strategic leadership experience across renal and specialty markets will be critical as Akebia prepares for the vadadustat launch in the U.S., if approved.Introduced new pipeline programs in acute care settings, potentially for acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (AKB-9090) and retinopathy of prematurity in neonates (AKB-10108).Closed a new debt facility with BlackRock that provides access to up to $55.0 million in borrowing capacity and used the proceeds from the first tranche of $37.0 million to pay down principal outstanding under the then loan agreement with Pharmakon Advisors, LP. The BlackRock debt facility, which closed on January 29, 2024, also extends the interest-only period in the event of vadadustat approval in the U.S. on or prior to June 30, 2024 without requiring any principal repayment until December 31, 2026.Concluded its offering of common stock under its ""at-the-market"" (ATM) sales agreement. Akebia raised approximately $26.0 million in gross proceeds.Akebia reported fourth quarter 2023 Auryxia® (ferric citrate) net product revenues of $53.2 million and full year 2023 revenues of $170.3 million, within Akebia's 2023 Auryxia net product revenue guidance of $170.0 - $175.0 million. ""We are approaching a potential U.S. launch of vadadustat from an extremely strong financial position. We expect Auryxia net product revenue growth in 2024, with a quarterly revenue cadence that is similar to 2023, we executed a term loan with BlackRock and implemented other financial strategies that together we believe will support our business operations for at least two years if vadadustat is approved. As we move forward, we will continue to carefully manage expenses, while investing appropriately for a successful potential launch of vadadustat,"" Mr. Butler added. Financial Results Revenues: Total revenues were $56.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $55.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $194.6 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $292.5 million for the full-year 2022.Net product revenues were $53.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $50.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $170.3 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $176.9 million for the full-year 2022.License, collaboration and other revenues were $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $24.3 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $115.5 million for the full-year 2022.COGS: Cost of goods sold was $18.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a benefit of $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $74.1 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $85.6 million for the full-year 2022. Akebia continues to record a non-cash intangible amortization charge of $9.0 million per quarter through the fourth quarter of 2024.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $32.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $63.1 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $130.0 million for the full-year 2022.SG&A Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses were $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $29.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $100.2 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $138.6 million for the full-year 2022.Net Income / Loss: Net income was $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $6.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and $51.9 million for the full-year 2023 compared to $94.2 million for the full-year 2022.Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, were approximately $42.9 million. Akebia believes its existing cash resources and the cash it expects to generate from product, royalty, supply and license revenues as well as the borrowings and potential future borrowings that are available under the BlackRock debt facility and the working capital liability are sufficient to fund our current operating plan for at least twenty-four months if vadadustat is approved.About Akebia TherapeuticsAkebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease.

About VadadustatVadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vadadustat is approved in Europe and Australia for the treatment of symptomatic anemia due to CKD in adult patients on chronic maintenance dialysis and in Taiwan for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients on dialysis. In Japan, vadadustat is approved as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VAFSEO (vadadustat) For safety information, view the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC/SmPC) for Vafseo® (vadadustat) at https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/2023/20230424158854/anx_158854_en.pdf, https://products.mhra.gov.uk/ and https://www.swissmedic.ch/swissmedic/en/home/humanarzneimittel/authorisations/swisspar.html and will be available via the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration website. IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR AURYXIA (ferric citrate) CONTRAINDICATION AURYXIA (ferric citrate) is contraindicated in patients with iron overload syndromes, e.g., hemochromatosis. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Iron Overload: Increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed in clinical trials with AURYXIA in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis treated for hyperphosphatemia, which may lead to excessive elevations in iron stores. Assess iron parameters prior to initiating AURYXIA and monitor while on therapy. Patients receiving concomitant intravenous (IV) iron may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of IV iron therapy.Risk of Overdosage in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion: Accidental ingestion and resulting overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Advise patients of the risks to children and to keep AURYXIA out of the reach of children.ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions with AURYXIA were: Hyperphosphatemia in CKD on Dialysis: Diarrhea (21%), discolored feces (19%), nausea (11%), constipation (8%), vomiting (7%) and cough (6%).Iron Deficiency Anemia in CKD Not on Dialysis: Discolored feces (22%), diarrhea (21%), constipation (18%), nausea (10%), abdominal pain (5%) and hyperkalemia (5%).SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy and Lactation: There are no available data on AURYXIA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. However, an overdose of iron in pregnant women may carry a risk for spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes and fetal malformation. Data from rat studies have shown the transfer of iron into milk, hence, there is a possibility of infant exposure when AURYXIA is administered to a nursing woman.To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Akebia Therapeutics at 1-844-445-3799.

CS Disco Board Approves $20 Million Share Repurchase Authorization,2024-03-14T20:15:00.000Z,High,Neutral,"CS Disco, Inc. (NYSE: LAW) announces a $20 million share repurchase program to enhance shareholder value, believing its shares are undervalued. The program allows flexibility in purchasing methods and timing, with no set end date.","CS Disco Board Approves $20 Million Share Repurchase Authorization Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary CS Disco, Inc. (NYSE: LAW) announces a $20 million share repurchase program to enhance shareholder value, believing its shares are undervalued. The program allows flexibility in purchasing methods and timing, with no set end date. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by CS Disco, Inc. of a share repurchase program to the tune of $20 million signifies a strategic move to optimize capital allocation and possibly signal confidence in the company's intrinsic value. From a financial perspective, this action could lead to earnings per share (EPS) accretion, as the overall share count reduces, potentially boosting investor sentiment. Moreover, it's a display of self-assessment by management, indicating that they consider the stock to be undervalued—a common rationale for buybacks.However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such a program. The funds allocated for the repurchase could alternatively be invested in growth initiatives or used for debt reduction. It's essential to evaluate the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements to understand if this capital return is the best use of funds in the context of the company's financial health and strategic objectives. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs often impact the market perception of a company. In the case of DISCO, the program could be interpreted as a positive signal, potentially leading to a short-term uptick in stock price as the market reacts to the perceived undervaluation. It's important to analyze market trends and the performance of similar companies to gauge if DISCO's move aligns with broader industry behaviors or if it's an outlier.Long-term implications are less certain and hinge on the execution of the buyback, including the timing and pricing of share repurchases. Effective execution, aligned with market conditions, can maximize the benefit to shareholders. Conversely, poor timing or overpaying for shares can diminish the program's intended effects. Market research should take into account the historical performance of DISCO's stock in response to past repurchase programs if applicable. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding share repurchases is stringent, with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Commission providing a method for companies to repurchase their own shares without facing insider trading allegations. The mention of potential purchases through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan indicates DISCO's awareness and adherence to legal requirements.It's crucial for stakeholders to recognize that such repurchases are subject to market conditions and legal constraints, which can affect the volume and timing of buybacks. The company's discretion to suspend or discontinue the program at any time adds a layer of uncertainty, which must be factored into any assessment of the program's potential impact. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CS Disco, Inc. (“DISCO”) (NYSE: LAW) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $20 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. “We believe DISCO’s shares are undervalued and this repurchase program is a prudent use of capital that underscores our commitment to enhancing stockholder value,” said Scott Hill, Chief Executive Officer of DISCO. The share repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time using a variety of methods which may include open market purchases or purchases through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, all in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The timing, prices and sizes of purchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations. The repurchase program does not have an end date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion. About DISCO DISCO (NYSE: LAW) provides cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal product offerings that simplify legal hold, legal request, ediscovery, legal document review and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers and governments.

The reaffirmation of the Adjusted EBITDA target suggests management's confidence in the company's profitability, despite excluding expenses from new initiatives like BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™. The completion of a new $150 million Senior Secured Credit Facility and a stable BB+ credit rating could improve the company's financial flexibility. However, a net loss, including significant non-cash pension adjustments and a decline in Q4 revenues due to the completion of lower-margin renewable projects, raise concerns about the sustainability of profit margins and operational efficiency.The $16.0 million grant for clean hydrogen development is a strategic step towards diversifying and future-proofing the company's energy portfolio. However, the actual impact on the stock will depend on the successful commercialization of these technologies. The expanded pipeline of over $9.0 billion in identified global project opportunities reflects potential for future growth, but the conversion of these opportunities into actual revenue will be critical for investor confidence.Overall, the company's strategic realignment and cost-saving initiatives are aimed at improving financial performance, but the market will be watching closely for tangible results in terms of revenue growth, margin improvement and a reduction in net losses. The focus on high-margin and high-quality international projects could improve profitability, but it also introduces geopolitical and execution risks. Market Research Analyst The global demand for environmentally friendly technologies, evidenced by the 31% increase in the Environmental segment, aligns with current market trends towards sustainability. The company's engagement in carbon capture and hydrogen generation technologies positions it well in the growing clean energy market. However, the 4% decline in Q4 revenues and a 3% decrease in ending backlog may signal a need to closely monitor market demand and the competitive landscape in the renewable sector.Strategic shifts away from lower-margin new build projects reflect an adaptation to market conditions, potentially leading to a more sustainable business model. The mention of new opportunities in waste-to-energy projects in the U.S. and Europe indicates an expansion strategy that could capture new market segments and diversify revenue streams.The company's focus on deleveraging and liquidity enhancement through strategic alternatives for non-strategic assets is a prudent approach in current market conditions. Yet, the ability to execute these strategies without disrupting ongoing operations will be crucial for maintaining stakeholder confidence. Energy Sector Analyst The awarded $16.0 million grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority signifies governmental support for innovative clean energy solutions, which is a strong endorsement for the company's BrightLoop technology. This investment into clean hydrogen generation with CO2 capture is a strategic move, especially considering the global push towards decarbonization and the potential size of the hydrogen market.The company's strategic business realignment towards higher-margin opportunities, particularly in the Thermal and Environmental segments, reflects an understanding of the energy sector's evolving dynamics. The continued development of the BrightLoop and ClimateBright technologies, along with the pursuit of utility-scale carbon capture projects, shows a commitment to staying at the forefront of energy innovation.However, the move away from high interest, low margin new build projects to reduce overhead and interest costs will require careful management to ensure the company does not miss out on potential high-growth areas within the renewable sector. The energy sector's volatility and regulatory changes are additional factors that could impact the company's future performance and should be monitored closely. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Revenues from Continued Operations increased 18% Year over Year, led by double-digit revenue growth across all business segments Reiterates Full Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA target of $100.0 million to $110.0 million, excluding BrightLoopTM and ClimateBrightTM expenses Completed new $150 million Senior Secured Credit Facility; Reaffirmed Credit Rating of BB+ Awarded $16.0 million grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority, advancing the development of a 15 tonnes per day BrightLoop clean hydrogen generation facility with CO2 capture with Black Hills Energy Expanded pipeline to over $9.0 billion in identified global project opportunities, including over $1.5 billion in BrightLoop and ClimateBright opportunities Achieved annualized cost savings of over $19.0 million to date related to strategic business realignment progressing toward stated target of over $30 million Q4 2023 Continuing Operations Financial Highlights – Revenues of $227.2 million, declined when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the completion of several lower margin renewable projects – Net loss of $54.3 million, including non-cash items of $38.0, million primarily related to pension mark-to-market adjustments, compared to net income of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included a mark-to-market gain of $7.7 million – Loss per share of $0.65, including non-cash items of $0.43, primarily related to pension mark-to-market adjustments, compared to a loss per share of $0.02 in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included a mark-to-market gain of $0.09 – Adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million, compared to $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 – Adjusted EBITDA, excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright expenses, of $20.8 million, compared to $22.1 million in 2022 – Bookings in the fourth quarter were $250.3 million, compared to $174.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Full Year 2023 Continuing Operations Summary: – Revenues of $999.4 million, an 18% improvement compared to 2022 – Net loss of $78.6 million, including non-cash items of $38.0 million, primarily related to pension mark-to-market adjustments, compared to a net loss of $20.0 million in 2022, which included a mark-to-market gain of $7.7 million – Loss per share of $1.05, including non-cash items of $0.43, primarily related to pension mark-to-market adjustments, compared to a loss per share of $0.35 in 2022, which included a mark-to-market gain of $0.09 – Adjusted EBITDA of $79.1 million, compared to $67.5 million in 2022 – Adjusted EBITDA, excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright expenses, of $84.1 million, compared to $71.8 million in 2022 – Bookings of $878.0 million, an increase of 2% compared to full year 2022 bookings – Ending backlog of $530.5 million, a 3% decrease compared to the end of 2022 AKRON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (""B&W"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: BW) announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. ""For 2023, revenues across all segments achieved double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis, driven by increased activity and expansion into our key end-markets, particularly in our Environmental segment, which saw a 31% year-over-year increase. Our full year results displayed continued year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA which was in line with our 2023 Adjusted EBITDA target range, excluding BrightLoop™ and ClimateBright™,” said Kenneth Young, B&W’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to make progress in converting our $9.0 billion global pipeline of identified project opportunities to bookings, as shown in the consolidated top-line improvement when compared to last year. We believe these results reflect a strong global demand for our technologies underpinning our pipeline and outlook for sustained growth in 2024 and beyond. Simultaneously, we continue our development, engineering and construction activities around our several BrightLoop projects and are intently focused on our strategic investments to enhance our ClimateBright decarbonization platform and BrightLoop hydrogen generation technology.” “Our backlog inclusive of planned announcements is in line with our overall expectations as we enter 2024. Our pipeline is increasing in all segments including BrightLoop and ClimateBright. We are actively producing several FEED studies that we believe will translate into potential projects in 2024 for utility scale carbon capture technologies. We are advancing the development of our BrightLoop projects in Wyoming, Louisiana, West Virginia and Ohio,” Young added. “Importantly, we have taken significant steps to strategically realign the company for improved financial performance in 2024, driven by several key initiatives that include deleveraging the balance sheet by delivering more predictable cash flow generation through our aftermarket businesses and capitalizing on higher-margin opportunities. We are evaluating strategic alternatives for non-strategic assets to increase liquidity. We are also seeing new pipeline opportunities for waste-to-energy in the United States as well as in Europe, including in the UK, France and other countries. As previously stated, we continue to pursue higher margin and high quality projects internationally to reduce our reliance on high interest, low margin new build projects, which we believe in turn will allow us to reduce the associated overhead and interest costs. In parallel, we remain on track to realize our expected annualized cost savings target of over $30 million and reduce our interest expense. By establishing our new $150 million senior secured credit facility, we’ve enhanced our liquidity profile and expect the refinancing to provide annual interest cost savings of approximately $5 million.” “Looking forward, we anticipate 2024 to be a strong year for Babcock & Wilcox in new bookings and stronger financial performance across all of our segments. We believe Thermal and Environmental have the highest growth potential for 2024, and we continue to execute our renewable energy strategy targeting more selective opportunities. We continue the developmental efforts around our decarbonization and hydrogen generation platform and focus on the various activities required to deploy our BrightLoop technology at commercial scale,” Young continued. “Our recently awarded $16 million grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority to support the permitting, engineering and initial construction activities for the Black Hills project is a testament to the progress we’re making to bring this technology to market. We remain fully committed to expanding our BrightLoop commercial activities in the years ahead, with targeted bookings of approximately $1 billion by 2028, which represents less than 1% of the estimated global market for hydrogen production.” Q4 2023 Continuing Operations Financial Summary Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $227.2 million, a 4% decline compared to $236.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to lower volumes in our Renewable segment due to our new build business. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $54.3 million, compared to net income of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, including non-cash items primarily related to pension mark-to-market adjustments. Loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.65 compared to a loss per share of $0.02 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.7 million compared to operating income of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.5 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $250 million. Ending backlog was $531 million, which is a 3% decrease compared to backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. All amounts referred to in this release are on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's segments, are provided in the exhibits to this release. Babcock & Wilcox Renewable segment revenues were $62.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 33% compared to $92.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to our strategic shift to reduce reliance on lower margin new build projects. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.4 million, a decrease of 39% compared to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the lower revenue volume described above as well as higher transportation costs associated with a large new build project. Babcock & Wilcox Environmental segment revenues were $68.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 58% compared to $43.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily driven by higher volume related to flue gas treatment projects and higher overall volume of cooling technology projects. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.0 million, an increase of 6% compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by product mix and the volume described above. Babcock & Wilcox Thermal segment revenues were $115.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 9% compared to $105.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The revenue increase is attributable to higher volume in our construction project business and our package boiler business, partially offset by a decline in service projects. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $17.2 million, an increase of 15% compared to $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the higher revenue volume and product mix described above. Full Year 2023 Continuing Operations Financial Summary Consolidated revenues in 2023 were $999.4 million, an 18% improvement compared to 2022. The improvement was primarily due to a higher level of activity across all our segments. Net loss in 2023 was $78.6 million compared to a net loss of $20.0 million in 2022, primarily related to overall increases in costs and expenses, higher interest expense, an increase in foreign exchange losses and goodwill impairment expense. Operating income in 2023 was $19.9 million, compared to operating income of $2.3 million in 2022 and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $79.1 million, an increase of 17% compared to $67.5 million in 2022. Total bookings in 2023 were $878.3 million, a 2% increase compared to full year 2022 bookings, and backlog at December 31, 2023 was $530.5 million, a 3% decrease compared to December 31, 2022. Reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's segments, are provided in the exhibits to this release. Babcock & Wilcox Renewable segment revenues were $318.6 million in 2023, an increase of 10% compared to $288.7 million in 2022, primarily the result of continued growth in our European Renewable parts and services business as we continue to expand globally. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.6 million, an increase of 7% compared to $21.2 million in 2022, primarily attributable to a $6.2 million gain on sale related to the development rights of a future solar project that was sold in the prior year, partially offset by the increased volume in our European parts and services business. Babcock & Wilcox Environmental segment revenues were $202.9 million in 2023, an increase of 31% compared to $154.4 million in 2022, primarily driven by increased volume in SPIG, our air cooled condenser business in Italy. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.3 million, an increase of 56% compared to $9.8 million in 2022, primarily driven by higher volume, as described above. Babcock & Wilcox Thermal segment revenues were $499.2 million in 2023, an increase of 20% compared to $415.1 million in 2022, primarily the result of a large construction project and increased volume in our package boiler business. Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $66.7 million, an increase of 18% compared to $56.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to the large construction project and increased volumes in our package boiler business, as described above. Liquidity and Balance Sheet At December 31, 2023, the Company had total debt of $379.5 million and a cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $71.3 million. We face liquidity challenges arising primarily from losses recognized on our B&W Solar loss contracts, which have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have taken, or plan to take, certain actions to address our liquidity needs. Based on our ability to raise funds through such actions, we have concluded that it is probable that we will have sufficient capital to meet our operating, debt service and capital requirements for the next twelve months. Reducing Cost of Debt Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we obtained a commitment to refinance our Senior Credit facility. We also amended our existing Reimbursement Agreement, including updating certain financial covenants thereunder. The refinancing commitment upon closing is expected to reduce our interest cost by up to $5 million per year based on current interest rates. Impacts of Market Conditions Management continues to adapt to macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts from inflation, higher interest rates and foreign exchange rate volatility, geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) and global shipping and supply chain disruptions that continued to have an impact during 2023. In certain instances, these situations have resulted in cost increases and delays or disruptions that have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our ability to meet customers’ demands. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these market conditions on current and future periods and actively manage costs and our liquidity position to provide additional flexibility while still supporting our customers and their specific needs. The duration and scope of these conditions cannot be predicted, and therefore, any anticipated negative financial impact on our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated. Earnings Call Information B&W plans to host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, March 15, 2024 at 5 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. The listen-only audio of the conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet on B&W’s Investor Relations site. The dial-in number for participants in the U.S. is (833) 470-1428; the dial-in number for participants in Canada is (833) 950-0062; the dial-in number for participants in all other locations is (929) 526-1599. The conference ID for all participants is 048920. A replay of this conference call will remain accessible in the investor relations section of the Company’s website for a limited time. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate its performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, the Company believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting its financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company introduced the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoopTM and ClimateBrightTM. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because of the increasing importance of BrightLoop and ClimateBright to the future growth of the Company. Management uses EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright to assess the Company’s performance independent of these technologies. Prior period results have been revised to conform with the revised definition and present separate reconciling items in our reconciliation, including business transition costs. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis is defined as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each of the segments, further adjusted for corporate allocations and research and development costs. At a segment level, the Adjusted EBITDA presented is consistent with the way the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business and is calculated as earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization adjusted for items such as gains or losses arising from the sale of non-income producing assets, net pension benefits, restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, costs related to financial consulting, research and development costs and other costs that may not be directly controllable by segment management and are not allocated to the segment. The Company presents consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the ongoing, operating performance before corporate overhead and other expenses not attributable to the operating performance of the Company's revenue generating segments. This release also presents certain targets for the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA in the future; these targets are not intended as guidance regarding how the Company believes the business will perform. The Company is unable to reconcile these targets to their GAAP counterparts without unreasonable effort and expense. Bookings and Backlog Bookings and backlog are our measure of remaining performance obligations under our sales contracts. It is possible that our methodology for determining bookings and backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customers to payment for work performed. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and contracts in our backlog may be canceled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. Backlog can vary significantly from period to period, particularly when large new build projects or operations and maintenance contracts are booked because they may be fulfilled over multiple years. Because we operate globally, our backlog is also affected by changes in foreign currencies each period. We do not include orders of our unconsolidated joint ventures in backlog. The Company is in the process of exiting its only remaining fixed fee Operational and Maintenance Contract in our Renewable segment. A similar contract was exited as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of this contract on our operating results as well as our backlog in order to highlight the performance of the business. Bookings represent changes to the backlog. Bookings include additions from booking new business, subtractions from customer cancellations or modifications, changes in estimates of liquidated damages that affect selling price and revaluation of backlog denominated in foreign currency. We believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods, and that shorter-term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend.

Third Coast Announces Conversion to State-Chartered Bank,2024-03-14T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCBX) has converted its charter from a Texas state savings bank to a Texas banking association, aiming to expand its commercial loan portfolio while maintaining high-quality banking services for customers.","Third Coast Announces Conversion to State-Chartered Bank Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Third Coast Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCBX) has converted its charter from a Texas state savings bank to a Texas banking association, aiming to expand its commercial loan portfolio while maintaining high-quality banking services for customers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The conversion of Third Coast Bancshares' charter from a state savings bank to a Texas banking association is a strategic move that could have significant implications for the company's growth trajectory. This shift allows Third Coast to broaden its commercial loan offerings, which could lead to an increase in revenue streams and diversification of its financial portfolio. From a financial analyst's perspective, the potential for improved risk management through a more diversified loan portfolio is noteworthy. Additionally, the ability to align more closely with commercial and retail customer needs may enhance the bank's competitive position in the market.It is important to monitor how this transition will affect the bank's cost structure and regulatory compliance requirements. The change in charter could potentially result in different regulatory capital requirements, which may influence the bank's financial planning and capital allocation strategies. Investors should keep an eye on subsequent financial disclosures to gauge the impact of these changes on the bank's operational efficiency and profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, Third Coast's charter conversion is indicative of a broader trend in the banking sector where institutions are seeking greater flexibility to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. The removal of 'SSB' from its name and the update to its digital presence with a new website URL and email addresses reflect a strategic rebranding effort that could resonate positively with current and potential clients.Understanding the competitive dynamics within the Texas banking sector, this move may be designed to signal Third Coast's commitment to growth and innovation. By positioning itself as a full-service banking association, Third Coast could attract a wider customer base, especially businesses seeking comprehensive banking solutions. Observing customer response and market share changes in the coming quarters will be essential to assess the effectiveness of this strategic pivot. Legal Expert Legally, the transition from a state savings bank to a banking association involves a change in regulatory oversight and compliance obligations. It's critical to recognize that the Texas Department of Banking, which will now oversee Third Coast, may impose different regulatory standards compared to the Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending. This could affect the bank's legal framework, operational policies and reporting requirements.Stakeholders should be aware that such conversions are typically accompanied by a thorough review process to ensure adherence to the new regulatory body's standards. The bank's ability to navigate this transition smoothly, without incurring significant legal costs or operational disruptions, will be crucial to maintaining stakeholder confidence and avoiding any negative impact on its stock performance. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Third Coast converts to a Texas Banking Association HOUSTON, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Coast Bancshares, Inc.

Strategic priorities for 2024 include customer expansion, product innovation, and technology initiatives.","Marchex Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Marchex, Inc. (MCHX) announced its financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with GAAP revenue of $12.4 million in Q4 and a net loss of $1.1 million. The company focuses on AI and conversational intelligence to drive revenue acceleration. Strategic priorities for 2024 include customer expansion, product innovation, and technology initiatives. Positive Positive: Marchex reported stable revenue growth in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year, showcasing resilience in a challenging market environment. Positive: The company signed new customers across various verticals and aims to drive growth through customer expansion and product innovation in 2024. Positive: Marchex's focus on AI and conversational intelligence positions it well to capitalize on the growing demand for data-driven insights in vertical markets. Negative: Despite revenue growth, the company reported a net loss for both Q4 2023 and the full year, indicating potential financial challenges. Negative: Conversation volumes were down in Q4 2023 due to seasonal factors and economic pressures, which could impact future revenue. Negative None. Financial Analyst Revenue Stability and Loss Reduction: The marginal increase in GAAP revenue from $12.3 million in Q4 2022 to $12.4 million in Q4 2023 indicates a level of revenue stability for Marchex, albeit with minimal growth. The reduction in net loss from $3.6 million in Q4 2022 to $1.1 million in Q4 2023 suggests an improvement in cost management or operational efficiency. However, the full year figures show a concerning increase in net loss from $8.2 million in 2022 to $9.9 million in 2023, which could be indicative of underlying challenges in the company's business model or market conditions.Adjusted EBITDA Considerations: The positive swing in Adjusted EBITDA from negative $1.7 million in Q4 2022 to positive $0.1 million in Q4 2023 is noteworthy. It is essential to consider the reorganization costs of approximately $1.62 million when evaluating the full year Adjusted EBITDA of negative $3.4 million. Excluding these one-time costs, the Adjusted EBITDA would have been negative $1.78 million, which may offer a more normalized view of the company's operational performance. Market Research Analyst Customer Acquisition and Product Innovation: The announcement of new customer sign-ups and the expansion of existing customer relationships, particularly in the automotive, home services and healthcare verticals, could be a positive signal for future revenue growth. The focus on AI-driven product innovation, such as AI call summaries and sentiment analysis, aligns with current market trends towards leveraging AI for business intelligence. The completion of cloud-based infrastructure and user interface improvements by Q3 2024 is projected to enhance customer experience and potentially lead to increased sales.Market Positioning: The CEO's statement about positioning Marchex as a leader in conversational intelligence and aiming to build a nine-figure business reflects ambitious growth plans. The strategic focus on conversational AI and the anticipation of launching new growth avenues within the year could resonate well with investors looking for companies at the forefront of AI application in business processes. Technology Analyst Infrastructure and AI Developments: The completion of primary cloud-based infrastructure initiatives is an important step towards scalability and agility in product development. A unified user interface and single sign-on are crucial for enhancing user experience, which can lead to higher customer retention and acquisition. Marchex's investment in these areas suggests a commitment to improving the technical foundation necessary for rapid innovation and product deployment.Generative AI Prospects: The mention of 'robust generative AI product opportunities' by the CEO highlights a strategic move towards leveraging advanced AI technologies. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize how businesses interact with data and could provide Marchex with a competitive edge in the conversational intelligence market. However, it's important to monitor how these technologies will be adopted by the company's target verticals and the impact on the company's financial performance. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marchex, Inc.

Adjusted non-GAAP loss per share for 2023 was $(0.12) compared to $(0.08) for 2022. Fourth Quarter Summary: New Customer Traction and Existing Customer Expansion. During the fourth quarter, Marchex signed new customers across multiple verticals including automotive, home services and health care. In addition, the company saw continued traction by signing up more than a hundred auto dealers through direct or channel partners sales initiatives over the last twelve months. Conversation Volumes. Overall conversation volumes were down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to typical seasonality and as some customers faced pressure due to certain inflationary and overall consumer-related macroeconomic factors. Strategic Priorities and Growth Initiatives For 2024: Existing Customer Expansion and New Customer Traction to Drive Growth in 2024. In 2024, the company expects to add meaningfully to its base of customer relationships across multiple verticals, including home services, healthcare, auto services and auto, as well as expand some of its most significant existing large enterprise relationships. The company expects to continue to build its pipeline of customers utilizing AI features and products. Accelerate Product Innovation. The company expects to expand its success with recent product launches such as AI call summaries and sentiment analysis with more AI features and capabilities launched throughout the year. The company believes its continued product innovation will accelerate revenue growth and deepen vertical penetration across all of its core verticals from new and existing customers. Complete Technology Initiatives to Enable Faster Innovation and New Initiatives. The company expects it will complete its primary cloud-based infrastructure initiatives as well as complete its single sign on and unified user interface by the third quarter, which will advance the rate of overall product innovation and customer facing sales initiatives. “2023 was a year of great foundational progress for Marchex. We moved aggressively to position the company to take advantage of our robust conversational data and position ourselves to emerge as a leader in conversational intelligence across our core vertical markets,"" said Edwin Miller, CEO. ""After meeting with many of our customers through 2023 and already in 2024, I firmly believe there is a significant opportunity to build a nine-figure business. This year, we are continuing to complete our key initiatives to enable Marchex to take advantage of our robust generative AI product opportunities. We are putting the pieces in place to achieve our growth ambitions and accelerate the business. Marchex is ideally positioned to help Fortune 500 businesses understand and act on their data. We are focused on driving the future of conversational AI in our verticals and opening up new avenues for growth, some of which will launch in the course of this year. Business Outlook The following forward-looking statements reflect Marchex's expectations as of ​March 14, 2024​. For the first quarter ending March 31, 2024: Revenue is anticipated to be somewhat lower than fourth quarter 2023 levels. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be somewhat lower than the fourth quarter 2023 levels, with improvements sequentially throughout the year. For the fiscal year 2024: The company anticipates revenue growth for the full year with sequential revenue progress throughout the year. The company anticipates that gross margins can increase by 5 percent or more by the end of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be at or above break-even for the full year. The company anticipates 2024 year end cash balances to be at or near year end 2023 levels. “In January we saw continued pressure on conversational volumes consistent with the fourth quarter in certain verticals such as our small business resellers, which we expect to flow through in the first part of the year. However, based on the current pipeline of customers and ongoing pilots, we believe we will grow the business sequentially from the first quarter revenue levels. In addition, the completion of our infrastructure initiatives should enable us to scale our gross margins and accelerate our go-to-market initiatives in the latter half of the year, positioning Marchex for accelerating growth,” said Miller. Management will hold a conference call, starting at 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, March 14, 2024​, to discuss its ​fourth quarter and Full Year 2023,​ financial results and other company updates. Access to the live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the Investors section of Marchex’s website at www.marchex.com. An archived version of the webcast will also be available at the same location two hours after completion of the call.

Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, other financial guidance, acquisitions, dispositions, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. There are a number of important factors that could cause Marchex's actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements including but not limited to product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition and general economic conditions. These factors are described in greater detail in the ""Risk Factors"" section of our most recent periodic report and registration statement filed with the SEC. All of the information provided in this release is as of ​March 14, 2024,​ and Marchex undertakes no duty to update the information provided herein. In the event the press release contains links to third party websites or materials, the links are provided solely as a convenience to you. Marchex is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites or materials and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy thereof. Non-GAAP Financial Information: To supplement Marchex's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide clarity internally and externally, Marchex uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance and liquidity, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted OIBA, and Adjusted non-GAAP income (loss) per share. Financial analysts and investors may use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBA to help with comparative financial evaluation to make informed investment decisions. Financial analysts and investors may use Adjusted non-GAAP income (loss) per share to analyze Marchex's financial performance since these groups have historically used EPS related measures, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions, and to evaluate a company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before (1) interest, (2) income taxes, (3) amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense, (6) acquisition and disposition-related costs, and (7) foreign government assistance subsidies. Adjusted EBITDA is an alternative measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, and management believes it provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's liquidity and ability to fund its operations and financing obligations. Adjusted OIBA represents Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for depreciation and amortization. This measure, among other things, is another metric by which Marchex has evaluated the performance of its business, to include being the basis on which Marchex's internal budgets were based and by which Marchex's management was evaluated in 2023. This measure represents Marchex's consolidated operating results, taking into account depreciation and other intangible amortization, but excluding the effects of certain other expenses removed in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA, as detailed above. Adjusted non-GAAP income (loss) per share represents Adjusted non-GAAP income (loss) divided by GAAP diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted non-GAAP income (loss) generally captures those items on the statement of operations that have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash exclusive of certain items that are not indicative of Marchex’s recurring core operating results and represents net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders plus the net of tax effects of: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) acquisition and disposition related costs (benefit), (3) amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions, (4) interest income and other, net, and (5) foreign government assistance subsidies. Marchex's management believes that investors should have access to, and Marchex is obligated to provide, the same set of tools that management uses in analyzing the company's results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Marchex’s non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar titled terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how Marchex defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Marchex endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measures presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence, GAAP financial statements, and detailed descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.

(KR) declares a quarterly dividend of 29 cents per share, showcasing a 13.7% annual growth rate since 2006. The company aims to increase dividends over time, focusing on long-term sustainable net earnings growth and maintaining an investment grade debt rating. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Kroger's quarterly dividend of 29 cents per share is a tangible return on investment for shareholders. The historical compounded annual growth rate of 13.7% since 2006 is a testament to Kroger's commitment to shareholder returns. This growth rate is particularly impressive in the retail sector, which operates on thin margins and faces fierce competition. The dividend policy is a clear signal of the company's financial health and confidence in its ability to generate consistent cash flow.However, investors should also consider the balance between dividend payouts and reinvestment in the company. While dividends are attractive, they should not come at the expense of necessary capital expenditures that sustain long-term growth. Kroger's strategy to invest in the business while also maintaining its investment-grade debt rating suggests a prudent approach to financial management. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Kroger's dividend announcement may influence investor sentiment and stock valuation. Dividends are often a factor in the total return calculation for investors and a consistent increase can make the stock more appealing to income-focused investors. Additionally, Kroger's capital allocation strategy, which emphasizes sustainable net earnings growth, suggests a forward-looking approach that may reassure investors about the company's market position and ability to adapt to industry changes.It is important to monitor how Kroger's investments in the business translate to improved efficiencies, market share gains and adaptability to consumer trends. The retail industry is rapidly evolving with the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer behaviors and Kroger's ability to navigate these changes will be critical for long-term success. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM CINCINNATI, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Kroger Co.'s (NYSE: KR) Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of 29 cents per share to be paid on June 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2024.

Market Research Analyst The completion of the business combination between Brand Engagement Network Inc. (BEN) and DHC Acquisition Corp. represents a strategic move in the AI industry, which is witnessing rapid growth and innovation. The merger is expected to enhance BEN's market position by leveraging DHC's financial resources and investor base, potentially leading to increased research and development capabilities. This can result in more advanced AI solutions that cater to personalized customer engagement—a key competitive parameter in today's market.The merger also signifies confidence from DHC's shareholders, which could translate to a positive market reception. However, investor sentiment will need to be monitored closely as the combined entity begins trading under new ticker symbols. The market's response to BEN's performance post-merger will be important in determining the success of the transaction.Moreover, the focus on 'business-safe AI solutions' suggests an emphasis on ethical AI practices, which is increasingly important to consumers and regulators. This could provide BEN with a reputational advantage in an industry where trust and compliance are becoming as important as technological innovation. Financial Analyst The initiation of trading for Brand Engagement Network Inc. on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the new ticker symbol 'BNAI' marks a pivotal moment for the company's financial future. The public listing is likely to provide BEN with greater access to capital, enhancing its ability to invest in technology and expand its market reach. The availability of publicly traded warrants 'BNAIW' also adds an investment instrument for potential investors, offering a leveraged bet on the company's future performance.From a financial perspective, the key metrics to watch in the upcoming quarters will be BEN's revenue growth, market share expansion and the scalability of its AI platform. The ability to generate substantial value for stakeholders, as mentioned by the CEO, will be quantified in the company's financial statements, with particular attention to profitability, cash flow and return on investment.Investors should consider the inherent risks associated with the AI industry, such as rapid technological changes and intense competition, which may impact BEN's ability to maintain its market position and deliver on growth expectations. Technology Industry Analyst Brand Engagement Network Inc.'s emphasis on personalized consumer engagement and superior customer experience (CX) through AI solutions is indicative of the broader industry trend towards hyper-personalization. As businesses increasingly seek to differentiate themselves through technology, BEN's full-stack, human-like AI platform could see heightened demand, especially in sectors where customer engagement is a critical success factor.The transition to a public company might accelerate BEN's innovation cycle, as the pressure to deliver shareholder value often drives increased investment in research and development. The company's commitment to 'helpful, friendly AI assistants' points to a user-centric approach to AI, which could resonate well with businesses looking to enhance their customer engagement strategies without sacrificing user trust.Long-term success for BEN will likely depend on its ability to maintain technological leadership, protect its intellectual property and adapt to evolving industry standards and consumer expectations in the dynamic AI landscape. 03/14/2024 - 06:48 PM JACKSON, Wyo. & SOUTHLAKE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Brand Engagement Network Inc.

Company expects FDA decision on 510(k) clearance in July 2024. Positive Movano Health's Evie Ring pulse oximeter exceeded FDA guidelines in the recent hypoxia trial with UCSF, showcasing its accuracy. The Evie Ring's clinical performance was a key focus for Movano Health's FDA submission, with plans to address outstanding comments and present new data in April 2024. The Evie Ring offers a wide range of health and wellness metrics through a mobile app, aiming to simplify data presentation and empower users to make informed health decisions. Negative None. Medical Device Regulatory Expert The recent announcement by Movano Health regarding their Evie Ring pulse oximeter surpassing FDA guidelines in a UCSF study is a significant development within the health technology sector. The root mean square error (RMSE) average of 2.46% achieved by the Evie Ring not only demonstrates a high level of accuracy but also an improvement over the FDA's requirement of 3.5% for SpO2 measurements. This performance could expedite the FDA's 510(k) clearance process, which is important for the company's transition into the medical device market. The successful clinical performance is a testament to the product's reliability, potentially positioning it favorably against other medical devices.Moreover, the strategic decision to address FDA comments and present new data from the latest study may strengthen the company's application. The clearance, expected in July 2024, could significantly impact Movano Health's market position, allowing them to tap into both the consumer wellness and medical device segments. The dual functionality of the Evie Ring, serving both consumer and medical needs, could create a unique value proposition in the market. Healthcare Market Analyst The integration of comprehensive health metrics in Movano Health's Evie Ring, including SpO2, heart rate variability and menstrual tracking, signifies a broader trend in consumer health devices evolving into medically relevant tools. The wearable's ability to compete with hospital-grade pulse oximeters in terms of accuracy suggests a potential disruption in the traditional medical device industry. As consumers increasingly seek devices that offer both wellness tracking and clinical-grade monitoring, Movano Health's positioning could capture a significant share of this growing market.From a business perspective, the anticipated FDA clearance for the Evie Med Ring could open up new revenue streams for Movano Health and possibly drive stock market interest. Investors are likely to monitor the company's progress closely, as FDA clearance could lead to increased adoption of the Evie Ring in clinical settings, potentially boosting sales and market share. The emphasis on a user-friendly mobile app that translates complex health data into actionable insights could also enhance consumer engagement and retention, further driving the company's growth. Consumer Technology Analyst Movano Health's focus on blending style, personalization and accessibility with medical-grade capabilities in the Evie Ring reflects a growing consumer demand for health technology products that do not compromise on aesthetics. The market for wearable technology is highly competitive and the ability to stand out with a product that caters to both health-conscious consumers and medical patients could be a game-changer. The Evie Ring's design improvements and the simplification of data presentation through its mobile app are strategic moves that could improve user experience and adoption rates.In the long term, the success of the Evie Ring could set a precedent for consumer wearables to gain medical device status, potentially influencing industry standards and regulatory practices. If Movano Health can successfully navigate the FDA clearance process, it could inspire similar innovations and strategies among competitors, leading to a new wave of health technology products that bridge the gap between consumer and medical applications. 03/14/2024 - 06:31 PM PLEASANTON, Calif., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Movano Health (Nasdaq: MOVE), a pioneer in health technology, has completed another hypoxia trial with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) yielding new blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) data, confirming the accuracy of its Evie Ring pulse oximeter exceeds the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. The Evie Ring entered commercial production in late 2023 as a consumer wellness device. This latest UCSF study, completed in the first quarter of 2024, used the production model ring, which reflected several design improvements from the pre-commercial model used in the earlier study and will be submitted to FDA and sold under the brand name Evie Med. During the second trial, each subject wore four Evie Rings. When testing arterial blood gas levels, the four Evie Rings achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) average of 2.46%, which was once again well below the FDA guidance of 3.5% for SpO2. Additionally, the Evie Ring's accuracy exceeded that of the two commercially available, hospital-grade reference pulse oximeters in the study. Movano Health believes one of the most critical components of the FDA submission remains the ring's clinical performance. The company plans to address the outstanding FDA comments from August 2023 for the Evie Med Ring in April 2024 and present the corroborating data from the first quarter of 2024 clinical study. Movano Health expects to receive a decision regarding its 510(k) clearance in July 2024. ""Our goal for Evie is to deliver both a consumer and medical device wearable that combines accessibility, personalization and style with the recognized capabilities of a medical device,"" said John Mastrototaro, CEO of Movano Health. ""The results of this latest study lay the groundwork to fulfilling all aspects of that goal. The journey toward establishing ourselves as a medical device company demands considerable effort, yet we view it as a substantial competitive advantage and a valuable asset in comparison to existing wellness solutions. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA throughout this final step in the review process."" The Evie Ring combines health and wellness metrics to give a full picture of one's health: resting heart rate, heart rate variability, SpO2, respiration rate, skin temperature variability, period and ovulation tracking, menstrual symptom tracking, activity profile, including steps, active minutes and calories burned, sleep stages and duration, and mood tracking. This data is delivered through a mobile app which aims to simplify how data is presented, moving away from complex graphs and charts, and turning biometric information into actionable insights that will help women make manageable lifestyle changes and take a more proactive approach to mitigating the risks of chronic disease.

Financial Analyst The completion of Ball Corporation's tender offers for its Senior Notes due in 2025 and 2026 represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's debt profile. The high participation rate, with a large percentage of the outstanding principal amounts being tendered, indicates a positive reception from debt holders. This could be interpreted as a sign of investor confidence in Ball Corporation's creditworthiness and future prospects.From a financial perspective, the tender offers may lead to a reduction in interest expenses due to the retirement of higher-interest debt. This could potentially improve Ball's net interest margins and earnings per share, making it an attractive point for stakeholders. However, it is important to consider the cost of these offers, including any premiums paid and the impact on the company's cash reserves, especially since the funds for the tender offers are sourced from the sale of Ball's aerospace business. The divestiture of a business unit to finance debt restructuring can have mixed implications, as it may alter the company's overall business strategy and revenue streams. Market Research Analyst Ball Corporation's tender offer transaction may have broader implications for the company's stock market performance. Investors often view such debt management strategies as a proactive approach to financial health, which could lead to favorable market sentiment. However, the timing and success of these offers could also reflect the prevailing interest rate environment and the company's anticipation of future rate changes.It is important to monitor the market's reaction to Ball's operational shift following the divestment of its aerospace segment. The reallocation of capital towards debt reduction instead of business expansion or R&D could be seen as a conservative move, potentially affecting the company's growth trajectory. Market analysts will closely observe how these changes align with Ball's long-term strategic goals and the possible recalibration of its market position. 03/14/2024 - 06:51 PM WESTMINSTER, Colo., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Corporation (""Ball"") (NYSE: BALL) announced today the expiration and final results of its previously announced offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all of the $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Notes"") and (ii) any and all of the $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the ""2026 Notes"" and, together with the 2025 Notes, the ""Notes"").

The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Cadre Holdings regarding the public offering of its shares is a significant event with potential implications for the stock's liquidity and capital structure. The dual nature of the offering, with both company and selling stockholder shares, suggests a strategic move to raise capital while also providing an exit or partial liquidity event for the major shareholder. The pricing at $35.00 per share will set a benchmark for the stock's value, which market participants will closely scrutinize.Investors will be interested in the use of proceeds by the company. If the funds are earmarked for growth initiatives, debt reduction, or other value-enhancing strategies, this could be viewed positively. However, if the capital raised is primarily benefiting the selling stockholder without clear benefits to the company's strategic position, investors might react differently. The additional option for underwriters to purchase more shares could indicate confidence in the company's prospects or simply be a standard over-allotment option. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the public offering of Cadre Holdings shares can be an indicator of the company's market perception and future growth expectations. The fact that a significant portion of the shares are being offered by a selling stockholder, who is also the company's Chairman and CEO, might raise questions about insider confidence in the company's future performance. However, it is not uncommon for insiders to divest part of their holdings for personal financial planning purposes.The timing and size of the offering can also reflect the company's strategic positioning within the safety equipment industry. If the sector is expected to grow due to regulatory changes or increased demand, the offering could be well-timed to capitalize on these trends. Conversely, if the industry is facing headwinds, the offering might be seen as an attempt to shore up finances ahead of tougher times.

Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the timing of the filings and the content within the IAMGOLD's annual information form can impact the mining sector at large. Investors often look for trends in cost control, resource exploration and reserve replacement, which are key indicators of long-term sustainability in the mining industry. For instance, if IAMGOLD reports lower than average discovery costs or higher than expected reserve replenishment, this could signal operational efficiency and a competitive edge. Conversely, any indication of dwindling reserves or escalating production costs could raise red flags about the company's future profitability and market position.Additionally, the comparison of IAMGOLD's financial and operational metrics with industry peers can provide a relative performance assessment.

(CSE: CHM) (US OTC: CHMJF) (the ""Company"" or ""Chemistree""), announces that it has filed a Notice of Meeting on SEDAR+ calling an extraordinary meeting of the holders of the 10% senior unsecured convertible debentures of the Company due March 29, 2024 (the ""Debentures"") to be held on April 5, 2024, with a record date of March 6, 2024 (the ""Debentureholder Meeting""). In conjunction with the planned Restructuring Transaction (as defined below), the Company has accepted the resignations of Nicolas Zitelli and Gina Dickson from their roles as directors of the Company. THE DEBENTUREHOLDER MEETINGAt the Debentureholder Meeting, the Company will put forward the following extraordinary resolutions to the holders of the Debentures (the ""Debentureholders""), which are governed by the trust indenture between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company dated March 29, 2019, as supplemented on January 17, 2022 (the ""Indenture""): (i) To consider and, if deemed appropriate, approve an extraordinary resolution, the full text of which is set forth in Appendix ""A"" to the management information circular dated March 12, 2024 (the ""Circular""), pursuant to which all of the principal of the outstanding Debentures will be settled and all claims of the Debentureholders thereunder will be extinguished in exchange for common shares (""Common Shares"") in the capital of the Company (the ""Restructuring Transaction""). Pursuant to the Restructuring Transaction, the Company intends to issue an aggregate of 683,700,000 Common Shares at a price of $0.01 per Common Share to Debentureholders. Following the closing of the Restructuring Transaction, the Debentureholders will hold Common Shares representing approximately 90.3% of the outstanding Common Shares, representing 100,000 Common Shares issued for every $1,000 in principal amount of Debentures held. (ii) To consider and, if deemed appropriate, approve an extraordinary resolution, the full text of which is set forth in Appendix ""B"" to the Circular, pursuant to which Odyssey Trust Company (the ""Trustee""), as trustee under the Indenture, shall have the right and be authorized to accept or consent on behalf of the Debentureholders to any plan of reorganization or restructuring transaction that may be made in any bankruptcy, liquidation, restructuring, or other insolvency proceeding relative to the Company, by taking action of any character in such proceeding without any further extraordinary resolution being required prior to such acceptance or consent being granted (the ""Trustee Authorization""). BACKGROUND TO THE RESOLUTIONSThe principal amount of the Debentures, being $6,837,000, will mature and become due on March 29, 2024. The board of directors of Chemistree (the ""Board"") has concluded that the Company will not have sufficient funds to settle the principal amount of the Debentures with cash on maturity and that the Company will not be able to successfully raise the requisite amount of cash necessary to pay the principal amount of Debentures with its current capital structure. The Company has identified the Restructuring Transaction as an avenue to address these issues and to enhance securityholder value in the long run. The Board believes that the Restructuring Transaction will: (i) eliminate the Company's convertible debt and debt service obligations, thereby providing the Company with added liquidity; (ii) allow management additional flexibility to focus on the Company's operations, as opposed to focusing on debt-servicing obligations and repayment; (iii) increase the strength of the Company's balance sheet; (iv) provide the Debentureholders with an aggregate ownership stake in the Company of approximately 90%; (v) allow Debentureholders to participate more effectively and efficiently in the equity upside of the Company; and (vi) simplify the Company's capital structure. The Company believes in its growth potential, and it believes the Restructuring Transaction is in the best interests of Debentureholders. Should the Restructuring Transaction not be approved by the Debentureholders or the Company determines not to proceed with the Restructuring Transaction for any reason, the Company has identified the Trustee Authorization as an avenue to simplify Debentureholder participation in any plan of reorganization or restructuring transaction that may be made in any bankruptcy, liquidation, restructuring, or other insolvency proceeding relative to the Company. By approving the Trustee Authorization, Debentureholders authorize the Trustee to act on their behalf in such proceedings, meaning that the Trustee can make decisions without the need for a further extraordinary resolution from the Debentureholders. If the Trustee Authorization is not approved, the Debentureholders may be responsible for their own costs related to plan of reorganization or restructuring transaction that may be made in any bankruptcy, liquidation, restructuring, or other insolvency proceeding relative to the Company, which may increase the timeline for recovery of the principal amounts of the Debentures. KEY STEPS TO THE RESOLUTIONSChemistree will hold the Debentureholder Meeting to consider the Restructuring Transaction and the Trustee Authorization on April 5, 2024. Pursuant to the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution approving either of the Restructuring Transaction and the Trustee Authorization is required to be passed at a meeting of Debentureholders in which the holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of Debentures outstanding on the date of the Debentureholder Meeting are present in person or by proxy. The resolution must be passed by holders of at least 66⅔% of the principal amount of the Debentures present in person or by proxy at the Debentureholder Meeting, or any adjournment thereof. Alternatively, each resolution can be passed, in writing, by the holders of at least 66⅔% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures. Each Debentureholder present in person or represented by proxy at the Debentureholder Meeting shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Debentures held by such Debentureholder.

Obsidian Energy Completes Offer to Purchase $2.0 Million of our Outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes,2024-03-14T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"Obsidian Energy  completes the offer to purchase $2.0 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due July 27, 2027, resulting in an oversubscription of approximately $49.2 million.

The Company paid $2.0 million for the Notes, leading to a proration for the tendered Notes. Settlement was completed, leaving $114.2 million of Notes outstanding. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Obsidian Energy's offer to purchase a portion of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes is a strategic financial maneuver. The transaction's oversubscription indicates a robust demand for the company's debt instruments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal regarding investor confidence in Obsidian Energy's creditworthiness. The proration of the tendered notes, due to the oversubscription, means that investors who offered their notes for sale had only a fraction of them accepted, which is a common outcome in oversubscribed debt repurchase scenarios.From a financial perspective, the repurchase of debt can lead to an improvement in the company's debt-to-equity ratio, assuming the equity value remains constant or increases. This could potentially enhance the company's financial health and appeal to both debt and equity investors. However, the $2.0 million repurchase is relatively small compared to the remaining $114.2 million of notes outstanding, which suggests that the impact on the company's leverage may be minimal. Debt Market Analyst Obsidian Energy's recent repurchase offer is a noteworthy event in the debt market, particularly for those holding the company's 11.95 percent Senior Unsecured Notes. The high interest rate on these notes reflects a premium for the risk associated with unsecured debt, which is not backed by collateral. The tender offer's oversubscription suggests that the yield offered by these notes is attractive compared to current market rates, or that note holders are seeking to liquidate their positions for liquidity or strategic reasons.For the remaining note holders, the reduced outstanding principal could imply a slight increase in the notes' scarcity, potentially affecting their market value. The buyback also demonstrates Obsidian Energy's proactive approach to liability management, which could influence the market's perception of the company's financial strategy and future debt issuances. Corporate Strategy Analyst Obsidian Energy's decision to repurchase a portion of its high-interest debt before maturity is a strategic move that reflects the company's broader financial strategy. By reducing high-cost debt, the company could be aiming to lower its interest expenses, which can free up cash flow for other operational or strategic initiatives. This move also signals to the market that the company is actively managing its capital structure and is willing to use available cash to address debt obligations, which can be seen as a sign of financial prudence.It is important to monitor how these actions fit into Obsidian Energy's long-term strategy, particularly in the context of the energy sector's volatility. The company's ability to manage its debt profile effectively will be important in maintaining financial flexibility and pursuing growth opportunities or weathering downturns in the energy market. 03/14/2024 - 05:00 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 14, 2024) - OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD.

Almaden Provides Corporate Update,2024-03-14T22:47:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,Almaden Minerals  announces a Request for Consultations against Mexico under the CPTPP and voluntary delisting from NYSE American due to non-compliance with listing standards.,"Almaden Provides Corporate Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Almaden Minerals announces a Request for Consultations against Mexico under the CPTPP and voluntary delisting from NYSE American due to non-compliance with listing standards. Positive None. Negative Almaden is facing a potential arbitration claim against Mexico for breaching CPTPP provisions, seeking damages of at least US$200 million. The Company's securities are not meeting the NYSE American exchange's listing standards, with a 30-trading-day average price of less than US$0.20 per share. Almaden will voluntarily delist from NYSE American if sustained price improvement is not achieved by April 19, 2024, and intends to list on the OTCQB Marketplace for U.S. shareholders. Legal Expert The initiation of arbitration proceedings by Almaden Minerals Ltd. against the United Mexican States under the CPTPP is a significant legal action that could have substantial financial implications. The claim for damages of no less than US$200 million reflects a serious contention over alleged breaches of the agreement. The legal basis of the claim and Mexico's response, or lack thereof, could set a precedent for future disputes under this multilateral trade agreement. Stakeholders should monitor the developments closely, as the outcome could influence investor confidence and the company's financial health. Financial Analyst Almaden's decision to voluntarily delist from the NYSE American due to non-compliance with continued listing standards indicates a strategic pivot towards alternative trading platforms such as the OTCQB Marketplace. This move, likely driven by the company's low share price, suggests a need to reassess the company's financial stability and market valuation. Investors should consider the potential liquidity and visibility impacts of trading on a less prominent exchange, as well as the implications of the arbitration claim on the company's future financial position. Market Research Analyst The transition of Almaden's listing from the NYSE American to the OTCQB Marketplace may affect the stock's market perception and accessibility to investors. While the OTCQB is a recognized platform, it typically caters to smaller, growth-oriented companies and may not provide the same level of scrutiny and regulatory oversight as more established exchanges. This could influence the investment community's perception of Almaden's governance and operational risk, potentially affecting the stock's demand and price dynamics in the short to medium term. 03/14/2024 - 06:47 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Almaden Minerals Ltd. (“Almaden” or “the Company”; TSX: AMM; NYSE American: AAU) is providing an update regarding its Request for Consultations delivered to the United Mexican States (“Mexico”, see press release dated December 14, 2023), and its listing on the NYSE American stock exchange (see press release of October 25, 2023). Request for Consultations As previously reported, on December 13, 2023, Almaden delivered to Mexico a written Request for Consultations in accordance with Article 9.18 of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (“CPTPP”), setting out a brief description of facts regarding the measures at issue. On December 29, 2023, Mexico acknowledged receipt of that Request and stated that it would propose dates for a consultation meeting in the near future, but never reverted with proposed dates, leaving the dispute unresolved. Accordingly, on March 14, 2024, Almaden delivered to Mexico written notice of its intention to submit a claim (“Claim”) to arbitration against Mexico (the “Notice”) in accordance with Article 9.19.3 of the CPTPP. This Notice has been delivered by Almaden together with Almadex Minerals Ltd., on behalf of themselves and their Mexican subsidiaries. Amongst other things, the Notice sets out the factual background of the dispute as well as the legal basis of the resulting Claim, the provisions of the CPTPP that Mexico has breached, and the relief sought. The damages relating to the Almaden and Almadex Claim will be for no less than US$200 million, in the aggregate. The Notice enables the Company to initiate arbitration should an amicable resolution of the dispute with the Mexican government not be reached. The filing of the Notice must precede initiation of arbitration by a minimum of 90 days. In good faith and in the spirit of cooperation, Almaden invites Mexico once again to engage in discussions and negotiations with a view to achieving an amicable resolution of the dispute. If such consultations with Mexico are unsuccessful, Almaden may then submit the Claim to arbitration under the CPTPP, seeking damages for the harm incurred, plus interest, costs, and any such further relief as a Tribunal may deem appropriate. NYSE American Continued Listing Standards As previously announced, Almaden is not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American exchange because the Company’s securities have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time which NYSE American determines to be a 30-trading-day average price of less than US$0.20 per share. The Company’s continued listing on the NYSE American exchange is predicated on it demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time which has determined to be no later than April 19, 2024. Although Almaden has requested consultations with Mexico under the CPTPP, to date Mexico has not proposed a date for these consultations. In view of this, and the Company’s wish to provide predictability to shareholders, the Company has determined to voluntarily delist from the NYSE American exchange. Almaden intends to seek a listing on the OTCQB Marketplace in parallel with its de-listing from the NYSE American exchange to ensure a continued U.S. trading platform for its U.S. shareholders. The Company provided notice of the voluntary delisting to the NYSE American on March 14, 2024 and intends to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a timely manner to effect the delisting. It is anticipated that the delisting will become effective at the end of business on or about April 4, 2024. The Company has made an application to the OTCQB and expects that its common shares will be quoted on the OTCQB on the next trading day without interruption. On Behalf of the Board of Directors, “J.

Net income decreased by 57.5% in 2023. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in revenues and net income for Montauk Renewables indicates a challenging fiscal year, despite stable RNG production volumes. The reduction in revenue is primarily attributed to the decline in RIN and natural gas prices. This price sensitivity underscores the volatility inherent in the renewable energy market, where commodity prices can significantly impact financial performance. The company's ability to mitigate some of this impact through its tiered royalty structure demonstrates strategic financial management, albeit not sufficient to offset the overall decline in operating income.Looking at the operational expenses, the increase in maintenance and repair costs suggests a focus on long-term asset health, which could potentially reduce future operational disruptions. However, this has contributed to the short-term financial strain. The divestiture of the gas rights agreement at the Security Renewable Electricity facility, which is in excess of the site's carrying value, indicates a strategic move to optimize asset portfolios and could provide a small financial buffer.Montauk's outlook for the upcoming year, with projected increases in both RNG and Renewable Electricity revenues, suggests a recovery trajectory. However, this projection must be weighed against the backdrop of market price fluctuations and the potential for unforeseen operational challenges. Market Research Analyst Montauk's foray into the Turkish market with the Montauk Ag Renewables development and the collaborative project with a subsidiary of European Energy in North America to capture and liquify biogenic carbon dioxide represent strategic geographic and product diversification. These initiatives could open new revenue streams and partnerships, enhancing the company's competitive position in the global renewable energy sector. The extension of facility operations on Waste Management landfills also indicates solidified business relationships and a secured operational footprint.However, the delays in commissioning the Blue Granite project until 2026 and the phased feedstock volume increases at the Pico site introduce elements of uncertainty. These delays could affect investor confidence and delay potential revenue. It's essential to monitor how these developments will influence the company's market share and investor sentiment in the renewable energy industry, which is increasingly competitive and influenced by regulatory changes and technological advancements. Energy Sector Analyst The financial results of Montauk Renewables reflect the broader energy sector's dynamics, particularly the impact of fluctuating commodity prices on companies involved in renewable energy. The RNG market is influenced by regulatory incentives like the Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), which can be volatile and subject to policy changes. Montauk's performance exceeding the average D3 RIN index price is a positive indicator of their market positioning.Additionally, the company's investment in new technologies and capacity expansion, such as the digestion capacity project and the liquification of biogenic carbon dioxide, aligns with industry trends towards innovation and sustainability. These investments are critical for long-term growth but require significant capital expenditure, which could impact financials in the short term. The renewable energy sector is poised for growth, but companies like Montauk must navigate the complexities of project commissioning timelines, regulatory environments and technological advancements to capitalize on this potential. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM PITTSBURGH, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Montauk Renewables, Inc. (“Montauk” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: MNTK), a renewable energy company specializing in the management, recovery, and conversion of biogas into renewable natural gas (“RNG”), today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Full Year Highlights: Revenues of $174.9 million, decreased 14.9% year over year Net Income of $14.9 million, decreased 57.5% year over year Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $46.5 million, decreased 34.1% year over year RNG production of 5.5 million MMBtu, flat year over year While we had flat production volumes in 2023 as compared to 2022, our sales of RINs from RNG increased approximately 2.5% to 44.9 million RINs sold in 2023. However, lower prices of both the average realized price of RINs sold and natural gas resulted in lower revenues in 2023. These 2023 price driven reductions to revenues of approximately $30.7 million were offset through our tiered royalty structure reducing royalty expense in 2023 by approximately $9.3 million, which led to our $20.9 million reduction in 2023 operating income. Our average pricing realized on RIN sales during 2023 of $2.71 exceeded the average D3 RIN index price of $2.63 during 2023. Our Montauk Ag Renewables development in Turkey, NC was notified by the NC Utilities Commission that it received approval for our New Renewable Energy Facility designation and Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. In March 2024, we submitted an amendment to our New Renewable Energy Facility application. At our Pico site, we began using our new reception pit and additional digester capacity in 2023 and expect the digestion capacity project to be fully commissioned during the second quarter of 2024. Our dairy host informed us that the third and final feedstock volumes are to be expected in 2025. We now expect our second facility at our Apex site to be commissioned during the fourth quarter of 2024 at which time we will have the capacity to process available feedstock as the landfill host increases its waste intake. Finally, distribution upgrades required by our interconnection partner for our Blue Granite project have delayed our expected commissioning of that facility until 2026. We are excited by our recent announcement with a North American subsidiary of European Energy to capture, clean and liquify biogenic carbon dioxide from our four Texas facilities. We expect to begin capital expenditures later in the second half of 2024 with the goal of delivering 140 thousand tons per year in 2027. We also recently reached two separate five year extensions at two of our facilities located on Waste Management landfills. These extensions were reached in connection with our sale of the gas rights agreement at our Security Renewable Electricity facility for $1.0 million effective October 2024. These proceeds are in excess of the sites carrying value and the sale comes as the power purchase agreement at the Security site was set to expire in late 2024. Full Year Financial Results Total revenues in 2023 were $174.9 million, a decrease of $30.7 million (14.9%) compared to $205.6 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in realized RIN prices of 16.6% to $2.71 in 2023 compared to $3.25 in 2022. Additionally, natural gas index pricing decreased 58.7% during 2023 compared to 2022. Operating and maintenance expenses for our RNG facilities were $47.9 million, an increase of $4.2 million (9.5%) compared to $43.7 million in 2022. Our total RNG facilities reported reduced utility expenses of approximately $2.1 million in 2023 as compared to 2022. Other RNG operating and maintenance expenses increased approximately $6.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of facility preventative maintenance, repairs, wellfield operational enhancements, and non capitalizable costs. Our Renewable Electricity Generation operating and maintenance expenses in 2023 were $11.7 million, a decrease of $1.3 million (10.2%) compared to $13.1 million in 2022, primarily due to timing of scheduled preventative maintenance intervals at our Bowerman facility. Total general and administrative expenses were $34.4 million in 2023, an increase of $0.3 million (0.8%) compared to $34.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily related to employee related costs, including stock based compensation. Operating income in 2023 was $23.6 million, a decrease of $20.9 million (47.0%) compared to $44.5 million in 2022. Net income in 2023 was $14.9 million, a decrease of $20.3 million (57.5%) compared to $35.2 million in 2022. Full Year Operational Results We produced approximately 5.5 million Metric Million British Thermal Units (“MMBtu”) of RNG in 2023, flat compared to 5.5 million MMBtu produced in 2022. We produced approximately 194 thousand megawatt hours (“MWh”) in Renewable Electricity in 2023, an increase of 4 thousand MWh compared to 190 thousand MWh produced in 2022. Our Security facility produced approximately 5 thousand MWh more in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of prior period engine maintenance. 2024 Full Year Outlook RNG revenues are expected to range between $195 and $215 million RNG production volumes are expected to range between 5.8 and 6.1 million MMBtu Renewable Electricity revenues are expected to range between $18.0 and $19.0 million Renewable Electricity production volumes are expected to range between 190 and 200 thousand MWh Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss results.

The survival benefit observed in the RATIONALE 302 trial, with a median overall survival increase from 6.3 to 8.6 months, is significant, albeit modest, for this patient population. It's important to note that while these figures represent a statistical improvement, the real-world implications may vary based on individual patient factors. The safety profile also appears to be an improvement over traditional chemotherapy, which can be quite toxic and this could potentially lead to better patient adherence and quality of life. Medical Research Analyst TEVIMBRA's approval is based on robust clinical data from a global Phase 3 trial, which is a strong validation of its efficacy. However, it's critical to examine the cost-effectiveness of such treatments, as they often come with high price tags. With TEVIMBRA set to become a key component of BeiGene's solid tumor program, its impact on the market will depend on how it is positioned against competitors, reimbursement strategies and the outcomes of ongoing trials for other indications. The fact that TEVIMBRA is being reviewed for additional indications, such as non-small cell lung cancer and the mention of over 900,000 global prescriptions, suggest a potential for significant market expansion, which could make it an attractive portfolio addition for investors looking at the oncology space. Market Research Analyst The oncology market is highly competitive and the entry of TEVIMBRA could disrupt current treatment paradigms, especially in the second-line treatment of ESCC. BeiGene's strategy to conduct over 17 registration-enabling trials demonstrates an aggressive approach to market penetration and could lead to rapid adoption if further approvals are granted. The drug's availability in the second half of 2024 gives BeiGene a timeline to strategize its market entry and address potential barriers. Investors should monitor BeiGene's performance closely, as the successful commercialization of TEVIMBRA will hinge on effective marketing, sales execution and the ability to differentiate from other PD-(L)1 inhibitors already on the market. 03/14/2024 - 04:28 PM Results from the global, Phase 3 RATIONALE 302 trial showed TEVIMBRA prolonged the survival of patients who received prior systemic treatment compared to chemotherapy Approval represents the first indication in the U.S. for TEVIMBRA BASEL, Switzerland & BEIJING & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160; SSE: 688235), a global oncology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TEVIMBRA® (tislelizumab-jsgr) as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) after prior systemic chemotherapy that did not include a PD-(L)1 inhibitor. TEVIMBRA will be available in the U.S. in the second half of 2024. “Today’s FDA approval of TEVIMBRA for patients with ESCC who have previously received chemotherapy, along with its ongoing review of our BLA for first-line ESCC patients, represents a significant step in our commitment to bringing this therapy to more patients around the world,” said Mark Lanasa, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Solid Tumors at BeiGene. “As BeiGene’s first drug candidate produced through our immuno-oncology program and second approved medicine in the U.S., TEVIMBRA is poised to be a critical pillar of our solid tumor development program, which spans more than 17 registration-enabling clinical trials in more than 30 countries across regions globally.” The approval is based on the RATIONALE 302 trial, which met its primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful survival benefit for TEVIMBRA compared with chemotherapy. In the ITT population, the median overall survival (OS) in the TEVIMBRA arm was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.5, 10.4) compared to 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.3, 7.0) in the chemotherapy arm (p=0.0001; hazard ratio [HR]=0.70 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.85]). The safety profile of TEVIMBRA was favorable over chemotherapy.i The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions for TEVIMBRA, including laboratory abnormalities, were increased glucose, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, decreased albumin, increased alkaline phosphatase, anemia, fatigue, increased AST, musculoskeletal pain, decreased weight, increased ALT and cough.i “Patients diagnosed with advanced or metastasized ESCC, the most common histologic subtype of esophageal cancer, often progress following initial therapy and are in need of new options,” Syma Iqbal, M.D., Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, Section Chief Gastrointestinal Oncology, Division of Medical Oncology and Cancer Physician in Chief, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. “The RATIONALE 302 trial showed that patients with previously treated ESCC who received TEVIMBRA saw a clinically meaningful survival benefit, highlighting its potential as an important treatment option for these patients.” Tislelizumab received approval by the European Commission for advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior chemotherapy in 2023 and a positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February 2024 as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer across three indications. The FDA is also reviewing Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic ESCC and patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The target action dates are July and December 2024, respectively. BeiGene has launched more than 17 potentially registration-enabling trials with TEVIMBRA, of which 11 Phase 3 randomized trials and four Phase 2 trials have already had positive readouts. Through these trials, TEVIMBRA has demonstrated its potential to deliver clinically meaningful improvements in survival benefits and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of cancer patients across a range of tumor types – in many cases, regardless of PD-(L)1 status – both as monotherapy and in combination with other regimens. More than 900,000 patients have been prescribed TEVIMBRA globally to date. About RATIONALE 302 RATIONALE 302 is a global, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study (NCT03430843) designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TEVIMBRA when compared with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic ESCC. The study randomized 512 patients from 132 research sites in 11 countries in Europe, Asia and North America. About ESCC Globally, esophageal cancer (EC) is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths, and ESCC is the most common histologic subtype, accounting for nearly 90% of ECs.ii An estimated 957,000 new EC cases are projected in 2040, an increase of nearly 60% from 2020, underscoring the need for additional effective treatments.ii EC is a rapidly fatal disease, and more than two-thirds of patients have advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, with an expected five-year survival rate of less than 6% for those with distant metastases.iii About TEVIMBRA® (tislelizumab-jsgr) Tislelizumab is a uniquely designed humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity against PD-1. It is designed to minimize binding to Fc-gamma (Fcγ) receptors on macrophages, helping to aid the body’s immune cells to detect and fight tumors. U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information for TEVIMBRA (tislelizumab-jsgr) INDICATION TEVIMBRA (tislelizumab-jsgr), as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior systemic chemotherapy that did not include a PD-(L)1 inhibitor. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions TEVIMBRA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity. In general, if TEVIMBRA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroids. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which can be fatal. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.8% (75/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (1.4%), and Grade 2 (1.7%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 35 (1.8%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 27 (1.4%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis resolved in 47% of the 75 patients. Of the 27 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for pneumonitis, 18 reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 3 (17%) patients had recurrence of pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which can be fatal. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 0.9% (17/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 2 (0.1%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 10 (0.5%) patients. All 17 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Two (12%) of the 17 patients received immunosuppressive treatment. Immune-mediated colitis resolved in 88% of the 17 patients. Of the 10 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for colitis, 8 reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 1 (13%) patient had recurrence of colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, which can be fatal. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.7% (34/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (1%), and Grade 2 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation in 9 (0.5%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 20 (1%) patients. All patients received systemic corticosteroids. Twenty-nine (85%) of the 34 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. One patient (2.9%) of the 34 patients received immunosuppressive treatment. Immune-mediated hepatitis resolved in 59% of the 34 patients. Of the 20 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for hepatitis, 12 reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 2 (17%) patients had recurrence of hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold TEVIMBRA depending on severity. Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.3% (6/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. TEVIMBRA was withheld in 5 out of the 6 patients. All 6 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Two (33%) of the 6 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 17% of the 6 patients. Hypophysitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity. Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in 0.1% (1/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including a Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reaction. No TEVIMBRA treatment discontinuation or withholding was required. Thyroid Disorders TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity. Thyroiditis: Immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 0.4% (7/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Thyroiditis did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. TEVIMBRA was withheld in 1 (0.1%) patient. One (14%) of the 7 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Thyroiditis resolved in 29% of the 7 patients. Hyperthyroidism: Immune-mediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 0.6% (12/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism led to the permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 1 (0.1%) patient and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 1 (0.1%) patient. One (8%) of the 12 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 92% of the 12 patients. Hypothyroidism: Immune-mediated hypothyroidism occurred in 7% (132/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (5%) adverse reactions. TEVIMBRA was not permanently discontinued in any patient, while treatment was withheld in 6 (0.3%) patients. Two (1.5%) of the 132 patients received systemic corticosteroids. All 132 patients received hormone replacement therapy. Hypothyroidism resolved in 27% of the 132 patients. The majority (86%) of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Type 1 diabetes mellitus has been reported with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated nephritis, which can be fatal. Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 0.4% (7/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. TEVIMBRA was permanently discontinued in 3 (0.2%) patients and treatment was withheld in 3 (0.2%) patients. All patients received systemic corticosteroids. Nephritis with renal dysfunction resolved in 57% of the 7 patients. Of the 3 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for nephritis, 2 reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement and one patient had recurrence of nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported, some with fatal outcome. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% (24/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 3 (0.2%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 9 (0.5%) patients. Twenty-three (96%) of the 24 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Immune-mediated skin reactions resolved in 58% of the 24 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for dermatologic adverse reactions, 8 reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 2 (25%) patients had recurrence of immune-mediated rash. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in 1972 patients who received TEVIMBRA: myositis, myocarditis, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and pericarditis. The following additional clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions have been reported with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, including severe or fatal cases. Cardiac/Vascular: Vasculitis Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.­­ Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Other (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions TEVIMBRA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (83/1972) patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 or higher (0.3%) reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) and interrupt the infusion for moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA. Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TEVIMBRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TEVIMBRA and for 4 months after the last dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS Permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in ≥ 1% of patients were hemorrhage, pneumonitis (including pneumonitis and immune-mediated pneumonitis), and pneumonia. Dosage interruptions of TEVIMBRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruptions in ≥ 2% of patients were pneumonia, pneumonitis, and fatigue. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were increased glucose, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, decreased albumin, increased alkaline phosphatase, anemia, fatigue, increased AST, musculoskeletal pain, decreased weight, increased ALT, and cough.

The Company plans to use the proceeds for debt repurchases and other corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Vital Energy, Inc. regarding the upsizing of its private placement offering to $800 million in senior notes at a 7.875% interest rate reflects a strategic move to restructure its debt profile. By offering a lower interest rate compared to its existing senior notes due in 2028 and 2030, which are at 10.125% and 9.750% respectively, the company is aiming to reduce its cost of capital. This is a significant step given the size of the offering and the current interest rate environment.The decision to use the proceeds to repurchase higher-interest debt and repay borrowings under the senior secured credit facility suggests a proactive approach to capital management. This could potentially improve the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, making it more attractive to investors and credit rating agencies. However, the benefits will depend on the execution of the tender offers and the company's ability to manage the associated fees and expenses.It's worth noting that the senior notes will be unsecured and guaranteed by a subsidiary, which may have implications for the company's risk profile. Investors will need to assess the creditworthiness of the subsidiary and the impact of these guarantees on the overall financial health of Vital Energy. Legal Expert The legal implications of the senior notes being offered in a private placement and not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933 are noteworthy. The restriction to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons indicates a targeted approach to fundraising, minimizing the regulatory burden and expediting the capital-raising process.However, the exclusivity of the offering could limit market liquidity for the notes, as they cannot be freely traded in the U.S. secondary market unless they are subsequently registered or meet an exemption. This limitation should be factored into the investment decision-making process, as it affects the ease with which these securities can be later sold.The guarantees by Vital Midstream Services, LLC and certain future subsidiaries introduce an additional layer of complexity. Investors and their legal advisors will need to scrutinize the terms of these guarantees to understand the potential liabilities and the hierarchy of claims in the event of financial distress. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the upsizing of Vital Energy's private placement offering signals confidence from the company in investor appetite for its debt instruments. The competitive interest rate of 7.875% for the senior notes, relative to current market rates, is designed to attract institutional investors seeking yield in a potentially rising interest rate environment.However, the attractiveness of this offering will also be influenced by the broader energy market trends and investor sentiment towards the sector. Fluctuations in energy prices, regulatory changes and shifts in the demand for energy can all impact the perceived risk and return profile of Vital Energy's debt offering.Moreover, the market's reception to this offering will provide insights into the credit market's view of the company's financial stability and the energy sector's outlook. The success of this placement and the subsequent debt repurchase will be closely monitored by market participants as indicators of Vital Energy's financial strategy and market conditions. 03/14/2024 - 04:43 PM TULSA, OK, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vital Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NYSE: VTLE) (“Vital Energy” or the “Company”), today announced the pricing of its previously announced private placement offering (the “Offering”), upsized to $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of 7.875% senior notes due 2032 at 100% of par (the “senior notes”) in a private placement to eligible purchasers.

CoStar Group's investment of over $1 billion in Homes.com has led to explosive growth and a unique 'Your Listing, Your Lead' business model, connecting buyers directly to agents. The company's extensive marketing campaign and focus on neighborhood-specific content have contributed to its success. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 567% year-over-year traffic growth for Homes.com is a noteworthy performance metric that reflects on the efficacy of the platform's marketing strategies and the 'Your Listing, Your Lead' business model. This model, which emphasizes direct connections between buyers and agents, appears to be a significant differentiator in the market. The substantial investment of over $1 billion by CoStar Group in Homes.com, particularly in targeted marketing efforts across various high-profile media events, has likely played a critical role in increasing the platform's visibility and user traffic.From a market research perspective, the traffic growth also indicates a shift in consumer behavior towards online homebuying portals, which could suggest a broader trend in the real estate industry's digitization. The surge in traffic as compared to rivals like Realtor and Redfin underscores a competitive advantage that may translate into increased market share. However, it's important to note that traffic is just one indicator of success; the ability to monetize this traffic effectively and maintain a high level of user engagement will be important for the long-term sustainability of the growth. Financial Analyst The inclusion of CoStar Group, the parent company of Homes.com, in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indexes is indicative of its financial stability and the positive outlook investors may have regarding its growth prospects. The financial commitment to Homes.com, as well as the reported traffic growth, could have a favorable impact on CoStar Group's stock performance. However, it is essential to evaluate the return on investment of the $1 billion spent, especially in the context of the real estate industry's cyclical nature and current economic conditions.Investors should assess the conversion rates of traffic to actual sales and the resulting revenue, as well as scrutinize the company's upcoming financial statements for evidence of the growth's sustainability. It would also be prudent to consider the operational costs associated with maintaining and further developing the platform, including the employment of a large workforce dedicated to content creation. While the growth figures are impressive, they must be balanced against the costs incurred and the potential for future revenue generation. 03/14/2024 - 05:43 PM Homes.com is the #2 Homebuying Portal with 567% Year-Over-Year Traffic Growth WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Homes.com Residential Network reached more than 149 million unique visitors in February, cementing Homes.com’s position as the second-most trafficked homebuying portal. * Homes.com itself achieved a 567% year-over-year (YOY) traffic increase. ** The traffic data demonstrate the popularity of Homes.com’s unique “Your Listing, Your Lead” business model which connects buyers directly to the agents representing a given property listing, ensuring convenience and transparency for the buyer and the preservation of agents’ commissions.

Improvement in Gross Profit and decrease in SG&A led to profitability improvement in 2023. Strong growth and profitability momentum entering 2024 with a full year revenue forecast of $300 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in annual revenues of 51.9% to $243.8 million for Redwire Corporation is a robust indicator of the company's growth trajectory, especially in the high-potential space infrastructure sector. The improvement in net loss by $103.4 million to $(27.3) million and the positive shift in Adjusted EBITDA to $15.3 million from a previous negative balance demonstrate operational efficiency and a stronger command over cost structures. A noteworthy aspect for stakeholders is the book-to-bill ratio of 2.81 for Q4 2023, which suggests a healthy demand for the company's offerings, as it indicates that Redwire received almost three times more orders than the revenue recognized during the quarter.From a liquidity perspective, the total available liquidity of $48.3 million, alongside the positive net cash flow from operations, provides the firm with a cushion to navigate short-term obligations and invest in strategic initiatives. However, the year-over-year decrease in book-to-bill from 2.04 to 1.23 may raise questions about the sustainability of order intake, which investors should monitor closely. Market Research Analyst Redwire's focus on scaling production and expanding offerings aligns with the current industry trends towards commercialization and diversification in the space sector. The contract secured with an undisclosed satellite manufacturer for approximately $142 million underscores the company's competitive positioning and potential for capturing significant market share. The increase in Contracted Backlog by 19.1% to $372.8 million provides visibility into future revenue streams, which is critical for forecasting and strategic planning.However, it is essential to contextualize the company's financials within the broader space infrastructure industry, which is characterized by high capital expenditure and long lead times. The long-term success of Redwire will depend on its ability to maintain technological leadership and manage the risks associated with the complex nature of space missions. Economist The financial performance of Redwire has implications for the broader economy, especially within the high-tech and aerospace sectors. The company's growth reflects increased economic activity and investment in space technologies, which can have multiplier effects on job creation, innovation and technological advancements. The positive Adjusted EBITDA and improved net loss are indicative of an improving cost structure, which can lead to more sustainable growth and potential for reinvestment in R&D.Moreover, the strategic importance of space infrastructure for national security and global communication networks means that Redwire's performance is not just a business matter but also of interest to policymakers and government stakeholders. The company's ability to secure large contracts and improve its financial health is a positive sign for the industry's maturation and resilience. 03/14/2024 - 05:29 PM Revenues for full year 2023 increased 51.9% to $243.8 million Net Loss for full year 2023 improved by $103.4 million to $(27.3) million Adjusted EBITDA1 for full year 2023 increased by $26.3 million to $15.3 million Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2023 improved by $20.5 million to $15.7 million Book-to-bill2 ratio for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2.81 JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Redwire Corporation (NYSE: RDW), a leading innovator in space infrastructure enabling space mission providers with the foundational building blocks and integrated solutions needed for complex space missions, today announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. If underlying assumptions to forward-looking statements prove inaccurate, or if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, and the Company disclaims any intention or obligation, other than imposed by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this press release are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Comparable Revenues. Non-GAAP financial measures are used to supplement the financial information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant U.S. GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, impairment expense, acquisition deal costs, acquisition integration costs, acquisition earnout costs, purchase accounting fair value adjustment related to deferred revenue, severance costs, capital market and advisory fees, litigation-related expenses, write-off of long-lived assets, equity-based compensation, committed equity facility transaction costs, debt financing costs, and warrant liability change in fair value adjustments. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the incremental Adjusted EBITDA that acquired businesses would have contributed for the periods presented if such acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of the year in which they occurred. Accordingly, historical financial information for the businesses acquired includes pro forma adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the concepts of Article 8 of Regulation S-X, which are ultimately added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow is computed as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Comparable Revenues is calculated as revenues less acquisition-related revenues. Revenues are considered acquisition-related for the first four full quarters since the entities’ acquisition date. After the completion of four fiscal quarters, revenues from acquired entities are presented as comparable in the current period with prior periods conformed to current presentation. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. We use Free Cash Flow as a useful indicator of liquidity to evaluate our period-over-period operating cash generation that will be used to service our debt, and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities and/or acquisitions, among other uses. Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Free Cash Flow is available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure. Comparable Revenues is used to compare revenues over various periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions whose results are not reflected in all periods presented. We believe Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Comparable Revenues provide meaningful insights into the impact of strategic acquisitions as well as an indicative run rate of the Company’s future operating performance. Key Performance Indicators Management uses Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) to assess the financial performance of the Company, monitor relevant trends and support financial, operational and strategic decision-making. Management frequently monitors and evaluates KPIs against internal targets, core business objectives as well as industry peers and may, on occasion, change the mix or calculation of KPIs to better align with the business, its operating environment, standard industry metrics or other considerations. If the Company changes the method by which it calculates or presents a KPI, prior period disclosures are recast to conform to current presentation. During the first quarter of 2023, we made the following changes with respect to our KPIs: Changed the book-to-bill calculation to present this metric on an LTM (“Last Twelve Months”) basis, whereas prior period disclosures were presented on a year-to-date basis. Book-to-bill LTM is calculated by aggregation of quarterly revenues and contracts awarded for the last four quarters. Changed the backlog calculation to present only contracted backlog, whereas prior period disclosures also presented uncontracted backlog. There was no change in the calculation of contracted backlog. Management believes these presentation changes will provide meaningful insights into contract award trends and increase comparability of the Company’s performance metrics with those of industry peers.

The contracts awarded balance includes firm contract orders, including time and material contracts, awarded during the period and does not include unexercised contract options or potential orders under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Although the contracts awarded balance reflects firm contract orders, terminations, amendments, or contract cancellations may occur which could result in a reduction to the contracts awarded balance. We view book-to-bill as an indicator of future revenue growth potential. To drive future revenue growth, our goal is for the level of contracts awarded in a given period to exceed the revenue recorded, thus yielding a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.0. Our book-to-bill ratio was 2.81 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 3.74 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2023 none of the contracts awarded balance relates to acquired contract value. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, contracts awarded includes $109.8 million of acquired contract value from the Space NV acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.23 for the LTM ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2.04 for the LTM ended December 31, 2022. For the LTM ended December 31, 2023, none of the contracts awarded balance relates to acquired contract value. For the LTM ended December 31, 2022, contracts awarded includes $109.8 million of acquired contract value from the Space NV acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Backlog The following table presents our contracted backlog as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and related activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. (in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Organic backlog, beginning balance $ 313,057 $ 139,742 Organic additions during the period 300,042 327,035 Organic revenue recognized during the period (243,800 ) (160,549 ) Foreign currency translation 3,491 6,829 Organic backlog, ending balance 372,790 313,057 Acquisition-related contract value, beginning balance — — Acquisition-related backlog, ending balance — — Contracted backlog, ending balance $ 372,790 $ 313,057 We view growth in backlog as a key measure of our business growth. Contracted backlog represents the estimated dollar value of firm funded executed contracts for which work has not been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract). Our contracted backlog includes $19.3 million and $37.4 million in remaining contract value from time and materials contracts as of December 31, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Organic backlog change excludes backlog activity from acquisitions for the first four full quarters since the entities’ acquisition date. Contracted backlog activity for the first four full quarters since the entities’ acquisition date is included in acquisition-related contracted backlog change. After the completion of four fiscal quarters, acquired entities are treated as organic for current and comparable historical periods. Organic contract value includes the remaining contract value as of January 1 not yet recognized as revenue and additional orders awarded during the period for those entities treated as organic. Acquisition-related contract value includes remaining contract value as of the acquisition date not yet recognized as revenue and additional orders awarded during the period for entities not treated as organic. Organic revenue includes revenue earned during the period presented for those entities treated as organic, while acquisition-related revenue includes the same for all other entities, excluding any pre-acquisition revenue earned during the period. There is no acquisition-related backlog activity presented in the table above as all acquired entities have completed four fiscal quarters post-acquisition. Although contracted backlog reflects business associated with contracts that are considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or contract cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog. In addition, some of our multi-year contracts are subject to annual funding. Management expects all amounts reflected in contracted backlog to ultimately be fully funded. Contracted backlog from foreign operations in Luxembourg and Belgium was $106.0 million and $129.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These amounts are subject to foreign exchange rate translations from euros to U.S. dollars that could cause the remaining backlog balance to fluctuate with the foreign exchange rate at the time of measurement.

Financial Review RevenuesRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $313 million (74% gold, 24% silver, 1% palladium and 1% cobalt), with the $77 million increase relative to the prior period quarter being primarily due to a 17% increase in the number of GEOs³ sold; and a 13% increase in the average realized gold equivalent³ price. Revenue was $1,016 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a $49 million decrease from 2022 due primarily to a 10% decrease in the number of GEOs³ sold, resulting from relative changes in the GEOs³ produced but not yet delivered; partially offset by a 6% increase in the average realized gold equivalent³ price. Cash Costs and MarginAverage cash costs¹ in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $417 per GEO³ as compared to $447 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This resulted in a cash operating margin¹ of $1,514 per GEO³ sold, an increase of 20% as compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, a result of the higher realized price per ounce coupled with the lower average cash costs. Average cash costs¹ in 2023 were $424 per GEO³ as compared to $447 in 2022. This resulted in a cash operating margin¹ of $1,466 per GEO³ sold, a 10% increase from 2022. Cash Flow from OperationsOperating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to $242 million, with the $70 million increase due primarily to the higher gross margin. Operating cash flows in 2023 amounted to $751 million, with the $7 million increase from the comparable period of the previous year being due primarily to higher amounts of interest received during the current year, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Balance Sheet (at December 31, 2023) Approximately $547 million of cash on handDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made total upfront cash payments of $452 million relative to the mineral stream interests consisting of$35 million payment relative to the Blackwater Silver precious metals purchase agreement (""PMPA"");a $10 million payment relative to the expansion of the Blackwater Gold PMPA;$17 million relative to the Cangrejos PMPA;$20 million relative to the Curraghinalt PMPA; and$370 million relative to the Salobo III expansion paymentWith the existing cash on hand coupled with the fully undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, the Company believes it is well positioned to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive mineral stream interests.Fourth Quarter Operating Asset Highlights Salobo: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Salobo produced 71,800 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 89% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by higher throughput, with production from the third concentrator line commencing at the end of 2022, combined with higher grades and recoveries. The prior year was also impacted by changes in maintenance routines. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Salobo reached its highest production level since the fourth quarter of 2019 as the ramp-up of the Salobo III expansion continued to advance. On November 21, 2023, Vale reported the successful completion of the throughput test for the first phase of the Salobo III project, with the Salobo complex exceeding an average of 32 Mtpa over a 90-day period. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid Salobo $370 million for the completion of the first phase of the Salobo III expansion project on December 1, 2023. Salobo III is expected to achieve a sustained throughput capacity of 36 Mtpa in the fourth quarter of 2024. Antamina: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Antamina produced 1.0 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 3% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. On February 15, 2024, Peru's National Environmental Certification Service for Sustainable Investments approved, after a detailed evaluation process, the Modification of the Environmental Impact Study, which will allow for the extension of Antamina's mine life from 2028 to 2036. Peñasquito: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Peñasquito produced 1.0 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 41% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower throughput resulting from a labour strike which began on June 7, 2023 and ended on October 13, 2023. Newmont Corporation (""Newmont"") reports that operations have since safely ramped up after a resolution was reached with the National Union of Mine and Metal Workers of the Mexican Republic (""the Union"") on October 13, 2023. Newmont has indicated that Peñasquito is expected to deliver higher co-product production in 2024 due to higher silver, lead and zinc content from the Chile Colorado pit. Constancia: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Constancia produced 0.8 million ounces of attributable silver and 22,300 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 28% and 112%, respectively, relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. Record quarterly gold production combined with strong silver production are a result of significantly higher grades attributable to the mining of high-grade zones of the Pampacancha deposit, combined with higher recoveries. Hudbay Minerals Inc. (""Hudbay"") reports that gold production in 2024 is expected to decrease from 2023 levels due to a smoothing of Pampacancha high-grade gold zones over the 2023 to 2025 period as additional high-grade areas were mined in 2023 ahead of schedule, and other high-grade areas were deferred to 2025. Hudbay has indicated that the Pampacancha deposit is now expected to be depleted in the third quarter of 2025, as opposed to mid-2025 as previously reported. Sudbury: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Vale's Sudbury mines produced 6,300 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 19% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, due to higher throughput, grade and recoveries. Stillwater: In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Stillwater mines produced 2,300 ounces of attributable gold and 4,200 ounces of attributable palladium, an increase of approximately 7% for gold and 9% for palladium relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher throughput and grades. Voisey's Bay: In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Voisey's Bay mine produced 215,000 pounds of attributable cobalt, an increase of approximately 67% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, as the transitional period between the depletion of the Ovoid open-pit and ramp-up to full production of the Voisey's Bay underground extension nears completion. Vale reports that physical completion of the Voisey's Bay underground mine extension was 92% at the end of the fourth quarter, and that the main surface assets are completed and already operating. The electromechanical assembly on the remaining surface assets are well advanced (above 60% physical progress). In the underground portion, the scope in Reid Brook is completed and the project is fully focused on Eastern Deeps. The mine development is concluded and construction is ongoing. Other Gold: In the fourth quarter of 2023, total Other Gold attributable production was 700 ounces, a decrease of approximately 78% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the closure of the Minto mine in May 2023. Other Silver: In the fourth quarter of 2023, total Other Silver attributable production was 1.3 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 28% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the temporary suspension of attributable production from Aljustrel and the disposal of the Yauliyacu PMPA. Detailed mine-by-mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Wheaton's consolidated MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section.

The Company has implemented a dividend reinvestment plan (""DRIP"") whereby shareholders can elect to have dividends reinvested directly into additional Wheaton common shares based on the Average Market Price, as defined in the DRIP. 2024 and Long-Term Production Outlook Using Updated 2024 Commodity Price Assumptions It is important to note that as gold outperformed all other metals during 2023, the assumed metal prices for 2024 results in lower gold equivalency calculations1 in 2024 compared to 2023.

In 2024, GEO5 production is forecast to be consistent with levels achieved in 2023, as expected stronger attributable production from Peñasquito and Voisey's Bay is forecast to be offset by lower production from Salobo, the suspension of operations at Minto, and the temporary halting of production at Aljustrel. Attributable production is forecast to increase at Peñasquito as a result of uninterrupted operations, and at Voisey's Bay due to the ongoing transition from the Ovoid pit to the underground mines. Attributable production is forecast to decrease slightly at Salobo due to lower grades as per the mine plan, which are expected to partially offset increasing throughput as the Salobo III expansion project continues toward completion. In addition, the Company anticipates production from the Blackwater project to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. On May 13, 2023, it was announced that operations at the Minto Mine had been suspended, and the Yukon Government had assumed care and control of the site. On September 12, 2023, it was announced that as a result of low zinc prices, the production of zinc and lead concentrates at the Aljustrel Mine would be halted from September 24, 2023, until the second quarter of 2025. Combined, the removal of production from Minto and Aljustrel accounts for a 25,000 GEO5 reduction in 2024 production guidance. Long-Term Production Outlook Historically, Wheaton has provided 5 and 10-year averages for its long-term guidance, however, the Company has elected to introduce a 5-year target (2028), in addition to an annual average for years 6 through 10 (i.e. 2029-2033), with a goal of providing increased granularity and further transparency of our expected growth trajectory. Production is forecast to increase by approximately 40% over the next five years to over 800,000 GEOs5 by 2028, primarily due to growth from Operating assets including Salobo, Antamina, Peñasquito, Voisey's Bay and Marmato; Development projects which are in-construction and/or permitted including Blackwater, Platreef, Goose, Mineral Park, Fenix, Curipamba and Santo Domingo; and Pre-development projects including Marathon and Copper World, for which production is anticipated towards the latter end of the five-year forecast period. From 2029 to 2033, attributable production is forecast to average over 850,000 GEOs5 in the five-year period and incorporates additional incremental production from pre-development assets including Cangrejos, Kudz ze Kayah, Curraghinalt, Victor and Kutcho projects, in addition to the Brewery Creek, Black Pine and Mt. Todd royalties. Not included in Wheaton's long-term forecast and instead classified as 'optionality', includes potential future production from Pascua Lama, Navidad, Toroparu, Cotabambas, Metates, DeLamar and additional expansions at Salobo outside of the Salobo III mine expansion project.

Non-IFRS Measures Wheaton has included, throughout this document, certain non-IFRS performance measures, including (i) adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share; (ii) operating cash flow per share (basic and diluted); (iii) average cash costs of gold, silver and palladium on a per ounce basis and cobalt on a per pound basis; and (iv) cash operating margin. i. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are calculated by removing the effects of non-cash impairment charges (reversals) (if any), non-cash fair value (gains) losses and other one-time (income) expenses as well as the reversal of non-cash income tax expense (recovery) which is offset by income tax expense (recovery) recognized in the Statements of Shareholders' Equity and OCI, respectively. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, management and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share (basic and diluted). Three Months EndedDecember 31 Years EndedDecember 31 (in thousands, except for per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 168,435 $ 166,125 $ 537,644 $ 669,126 Add back (deduct): Impairment charge (reversal) - 1,719 - (8,611) Gain on disposal of Mineral StreamInterest - (51,443) (5,027) (155,868) Gain (loss) on fair value adjustment of share purchase warrants held (217) (67) 31 1,033 Income tax (expense) recovery recognized in the Statement of Shareholders' Equity - - - 4,143 Income tax (expense) recovery recognized in the Statement of OCI (3,487) (7,214) 3,719 (6,513) Income tax recovery related to prior year disposal of Mineral Stream Interest - (5,376) (2,672) 2,404 Other (162) - (644) (802) Adjusted net earnings $ 164,569 $ 103,744 $ 533,051 $ 504,912 Divided by: Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 453,010 452,070 452,814 451,570 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 453,611 452,778 453,463 452,344 Equals: Adjusted earnings per share - basic $ 0.363 $ 0.229 $ 1.177 $ 1.118 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $ 0.363 $ 0.229 $ 1.176 $ 1.116 ii. Operating cash flow per share (basic and diluted) is calculated by dividing cash generated by operating activities by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (basic and diluted). The Company presents operating cash flow per share as management and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metal mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of operating cash flow per share (basic and diluted). Three Months EndedDecember 31 Years EndedDecember 31 (in thousands, except for per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash generated by operating activities $ 242,226 $ 172,028 $ 750,809 $ 743,424 Divided by: Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 453,010 452,070 452,814 451,570 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 453,611 452,778 453,463 452,344 Equals: Operating cash flow per share - basic $ 0.535 $ 0.381 $ 1.658 $ 1.646 Operating cash flow per share - diluted $ 0.534 $ 0.380 $ 1.656 $ 1.643 iii. Average cash cost of gold, silver and palladium on a per ounce basis and cobalt on a per pound basis is calculated by dividing the total cost of sales, less depletion, by the ounces or pounds sold. In the precious metal mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, management and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. The following table provides a calculation of average cash cost of gold, silver and palladium on a per ounce basis and cobalt on a per pound basis.

Dividends declared in the referenced calendar quarter, relative to the financial results of the prior quarter. Details of the dividend can be found in the Wheaton's news release date March 14, 2024, titled ""Wheaton Precious Metals Declares Quarterly Dividend.""2 Statements made in this section contain forward-looking information with respect to forecast production, funding outstanding commitments and continuing to acquire accretive mineral stream interests and readers are cautioned that actual outcomes may vary. Please see ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for material risks, assumptions and important disclosure associated with this information.3 Gold equivalent ounces for 2023 actual production and sales are calculated by converting silver, palladium and cobalt to a gold equivalent by using the following commodity price assumptions: $1,850 per ounce gold, $24 per ounce silver, $1,800 per ounce palladium, $1,100 per ounce platinum and $18.75 per pound cobalt.4Source: Company reports & S and P Capital IQ estimates of 2024 byproduct cost curves for gold, zinc/lead, copper, PGM, nickel & silver mines. Portfolio mine life based on recoverable reserves and resources as of Dec 31, 2022 and 2022 actual mill throughput and is weighted by individual reserve and resource category.5Gold equivalent forecast production for 2024 and the longer-term outlook are based on the following updated commodity price assumptions: $2,000 per ounce gold, $23 per ounce silver, $1,000 per ounce palladium, $950 per ounce of platinum and $13.00 per pound cobalt.6Total streaming and royalty agreements relate to the purchase of precious metals and cobalt relating to 18 mining assets which are currently operating, 23 which are at various stages of development and 4 of which have been placed in care and maintenance or have been closed. 7Under the Platreef PMPA, Wheaton International will be entitled to purchase 62.5% of the payable gold until a total of 218,750 oz of gold has been delivered to Wheaton International under the gold stream, at which point Wheaton International will be entitled to purchase 50% of the payable gold production until a total of 428,300 oz of gold has been delivered to Wheaton International under the gold stream, at which point Wheaton International will be entitled to purchase 3.125% of the payable gold production. If certain thresholds are met, including if production through the Platreef project concentrator achieves 5.5 Mtpa, the 3.125% residual gold stream will terminate. Under the Platreef Gold PMPA, Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (which acquired Nomad Royalty Ltd. on August 15, 2022) (""Sandstorm"") is entitled to purchase 37.5% of payable gold.

(BLND) meets fourth-quarter 2023 revenue guidance and shows strong operating loss improvement throughout the year. Despite market challenges, the company has made significant progress on strategic priorities, including revenue growth, mortgage relationships, and cost structure optimization. Positive Blend Labs (BLND) achieves double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in every quarter of 2023. The company maintains its leading market share in the mortgage industry. Significant reduction in loss from operations due to streamlined cost structure. Optimistic outlook for future growth and success. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported achievement of revenue guidance and the improvement in operating loss for Blend Labs are key financial indicators that are likely to influence investor sentiment. The consistent double-digit revenue growth suggests that the company is expanding its market presence, which is a positive sign for potential investors. The reduction in operational losses indicates improved efficiency in cost management, which could lead to future profitability. However, the broader market environment remains challenging, which suggests that the company's performance must be viewed in the context of wider economic conditions that could affect its growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst Blend Labs' strategic focus on expanding its consumer banking footprint and deepening mortgage relationships is a calculated move within the cloud banking software industry. By maintaining a leading market share in mortgages, the company leverages a stable revenue stream while exploring growth in consumer banking. This diversification can be beneficial in mitigating risks associated with market volatility. However, it is important to assess the competitive landscape and the demand for cloud banking solutions to determine the sustainability of Blend's growth and market position. Economist The streamlining of cost structures leading to reduced operational losses is indicative of effective management practices, especially in a challenging market environment. Such fiscal discipline can be a buffer during economic downturns and can also provide the company with more agility to invest in growth opportunities as they arise. However, it is essential to analyze the macroeconomic factors that may affect the banking software sector, such as interest rate changes, regulatory shifts and technological advancements, to fully understand the potential impact on Blend Labs' financial health in the long term. 03/14/2024 - 04:21 PM Meets Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenue Guidance and Delivers Strong Operating Loss Improvement in Every Quarter in 2023 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Blend Labs, Inc. (NYSE:BLND), a leader in cloud banking software, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. “Despite a challenging market environment, Blend has achieved substantial progress on our three strategic priorities over the course of 2023,” said Nima Ghamsari, Head of Blend. “First, we’ve expanded our consumer banking footprint by achieving double digit year-on-year revenue growth in every quarter. Second, we continued to deepen our mortgage relationships and maintain our leading market share. And third, we’ve succeeded in streamlining our cost structure, which resulted in a significant reduction in loss from operations. “Looking ahead, we are optimistic about our strong pipeline and we will continue to accelerate our growth as we work towards our mission of building simple, proactive, and instant experiences for any banking product.” Recent Business Highlights Expanding Consumer Banking Footprint: Closed eight new consumer banking deals in the fourth quarter, which includes signing a multi-year consumer banking deal with Citizens Bank, one of the nation’s oldest and largest financial institutions, to deliver a more consistent, frictionless application experience to their customers. Growing Mortgage Customer Base and Focus on Continued Innovation: Welcomed two new top 100 financial institutions by retail customer base to our mortgage solution, including the 10th largest credit union in the U.S. based on total assets. Blend’s ongoing product investments in new data integrations and AI-enhancements, like Blend Copilot, are positioning its customers for more efficient growth ahead of a potential industry rebound. Continued Strengthening of Mortgage Suite Unit Economics: Blend’s mortgage suite economic value per funded loan rose to $91 in 4Q23 from $81 in 4Q22, representing continued adoption of its mortgage add-on products. Pacing Towards Profitability: Blend GAAP net operating loss decreased significantly in 4Q23 compared to the same period last year. Blend non-GAAP net operating loss in 4Q23 outperformed the top end of guidance on execution of efficiency initiatives.

Liquidity, Cash, & Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, Blend has cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including restricted cash, totaling $144.2 million with total debt outstanding of $140.0 million in the form of the Company’s term loan.

During 4Q23, Blend prepaid a portion of its outstanding term loan balance in an aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million, terminated the revolving line of credit, and amended the maturity date of the term loan to provide for a maturity extension to June 30, 2027, provided certain conditions are satisfied.

First Quarter 2024 Outlook Blend is providing guidance for the first quarter of 2024 as follows: $ in millions Q1 2024 Guidance Blend Platform Segment Revenue $22.0 – $24.0 Title Revenue $10.5 – $11.5 Blend Labs, Inc. Consolidated Revenue $32.5 – $35.5 Non-GAAP Net Operating Loss ($14.0) – ($12.0) Blend’s 1Q24 guidance reflects an internally estimated 800,000 - 875,000 U.S. aggregate industry mortgage originations in 1Q24. Note that economic conditions, including those affecting the levels of real estate and mortgage activity, as well as the financial condition of some of our financial customers, remain highly uncertain. We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalent to our non-GAAP Net Operating Loss outlook or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, stock-based compensation, which is affected by our hiring and retention needs and future prices of our stock, and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.

Further information on these risks and other factors that could affect our financial results are set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that will be filed following this press release.

Except as required by law, Blend does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, this press release and the accompanying tables contain, and the conference call will contain, non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP software platform gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP Blend Platform segment gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net operating loss, and non-GAAP consolidated net loss per share. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and trends, in allowing for greater transparency with respect to measures used by our management in their financial and operational decision making, and in comparing our results of operations with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand the operational performance of their businesses. We adjust the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures as detailed in the reconciliations below: Stock-based compensation and amortization of warrant. We exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of warrant, which are non-cash expenses, from our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these items provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions, and expense related to stock-based awards can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. Compensation realignment costs. We exclude the compensation realignment costs incurred in connection with the change in our compensation strategy from our non-GAAP financial measures. These costs relate to amortization of one-time two-installment cash bonus payment made to certain employees in lieu of previously committed equity-based awards, driven by an organizational initiative to standardize our equity compensation program. We believe that excluding these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides more meaningful period to period comparisons. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. We exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, which is a non-cash expense, from our non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude these amortization expenses because we do not believe these expenses have a direct correlation to the operation of our business. Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill. We exclude impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which are non-cash charges, from our non-GAAP financial measures. These charges are unusual in nature and we do not believe these charges have a direct correlation to the operation of our business. Restructuring costs. We exclude restructuring costs as these costs primarily include employee severance, executive transition costs and other costs directly associated with resource realignments incurred in connection with changing strategies or business conditions. These costs can vary significantly in amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of our business and we believe that excluding them provides easier comparability of pre- and post-restructuring operating results. Litigation contingencies. We exclude costs related to litigation contingencies, which represent reserves for legal settlements. These costs are non-recurring in nature and we do not believe they have a direct correlation to the operation of our business. Foreign currency gains and losses. We exclude unrealized gains and losses resulting from remeasurement of assets and liabilities from foreign currency into the functional currency as we do not believe these gains and losses to be indicative of our business performance and excluding these gains and losses provides information consistent with how we evaluate our operating results. Transaction-related costs. We exclude costs related to mergers and acquisitions from our non-GAAP financial measures as we do not consider these costs to be related to organic continuing operations of the acquired business or relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the acquired assets. These adjustments allow for more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations and forward looking guidance. These costs include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other transactional costs incurred in connection with acquisition activities, and non-recurring transition and integration costs. Gains related to carrying value adjustments of non-marketable equity securities. We exclude gains related to the carrying value adjustments of non-marketable equity securities because we do not believe these non-cash gains have a direct correlation to the operation of our business. Income taxes. We exclude non-cash non-recurring tax benefits from our non-GAAP financial measures. These tax benefits consist of the changes in the valuation allowance resulting from acquisitions and from changes in U.S. tax law requiring capitalization and amortization of research and development costs for tax purposes. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures include measures related to our liquidity, such as free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow and free cash flow margin. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities less cash spent on additions to property, equipment, internal-use software and intangible assets. Unlevered free cash flow is defined as free cash flow plus cash paid for interest on our outstanding debt. Free cash flow margin is defined as free cash flow divided by total revenue. We believe information regarding free cash flow, free cash flow margin and unlevered free cash flow provide useful information to investors as a basis for comparing our performance with other companies in our industry and as a measurement of the cash generation that is available to invest in our business and meet our financing needs. However, given our debt service obligations (including the existing $140 million remaining principal on the term loan under our credit agreement due in June 2026) and other contractual obligations, unlevered free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. It is important to note that the particular items we exclude from, or include in, our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the items excluded from, or included in, similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in the same industry. In addition, other companies may utilize metrics that are not similar to ours. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. There are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures since they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results.

I-Mab Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Business Update,2024-03-14T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"I-Mab reports positive clinical results for uliledlimab and givastomig, plans strategic divestiture in China, and discloses financial results for 2023.","I-Mab Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Business Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary I-Mab reports positive clinical results for uliledlimab and givastomig, plans strategic divestiture in China, and discloses financial results for 2023. Positive Positive clinical results for uliledlimab and givastomig in oncology were highlighted in the PR. Strategic divestiture agreement in China to transfer assets and business operations by March 2024. Financial results for 2023 show a decrease in net loss, with total net revenues of RMB27.6 million. Cash position decreased to RMB2.3 billion by the end of 2023, compared to RMB3.5 billion in 2022. Share buyback program authorized, with US$8.6 million repurchased by December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for 2023 was RMB1,105.3 million, showing improvement from 2022. Negative The strategic divestiture may impact the Company's future financial results and operations. Net revenues for 2023 were relatively low compared to previous years. A significant decrease in cash position from 2022 to 2023 raises concerns about liquidity. The share buyback program may not have a substantial impact on improving financial performance. Continued net losses and impairment of goodwill reflect ongoing challenges for the Company. Financial Analyst The divestiture of I-Mab's assets and operations in China is a strategic move that can have significant implications for the company's financial health. By offloading these assets, I-Mab is poised to reduce its future development costs, which is a positive step towards financial streamlining. The potential receipt of up to US$80 million contingent on the Hangzhou Company's performance could provide a non-operational cash influx, enhancing I-Mab's liquidity position.However, the discontinuation of consolidation of the divested entities may lead to a material change in reported financials. Investors should closely monitor how these changes impact the company's balance sheet and income statement. The extinguishment of the US$183 million repurchase obligations will improve the liabilities side of the balance sheet, potentially leading to a stronger financial position.From a stock market perspective, the transaction could be received positively if investors believe the move will focus I-Mab's efforts on more promising assets and markets. However, any delays or hiccups in the transaction's completion could create uncertainty that may affect stock performance. Medical Research Analyst The pipeline updates provided by I-Mab indicate a robust focus on developing treatments for various cancers, with uliledlimab and givastomig leading the way. The progress into Phase 2 and Phase 1b studies respectively suggests that I-Mab is moving forward in the clinical development process, which is critical for eventual FDA approval and commercialization.The successful dosing of the first patient in the triplet combination study for givastomig and the planned IND filing for uliledlimab in combination therapy are both significant steps in oncology drug development. If these therapies prove to be effective, they could meet significant unmet medical needs and generate substantial revenue for I-Mab in the long term.However, the actual impact on I-Mab's business will depend on the outcomes of these trials. Positive results could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially higher stock prices, while negative results could have the opposite effect. It is also important to note that the oncology market is highly competitive and the success of these drugs will depend on their efficacy and safety profiles compared to existing treatments. Market Research Analyst The financial results show a mixed picture for I-Mab. The decrease in net revenues from RMB-221.6 million in 2022 to RMB27.6 million in 2023 is a significant improvement, although it's important to understand the context of the negative revenues in 2022 due to the non-cash accounting treatment. The reduction in research and development expenses and administrative expenses suggests effective cost management, which could be viewed favorably by the market.However, the reported net loss of RMB1,465.7 million for 2023, while an improvement from the previous year, still indicates that I-Mab is in a loss-making phase, which is not uncommon for biotech companies in the development stage. The share buyback program indicates management's confidence in the company's value, which could be a positive signal to investors.It's essential to consider the long-term potential of I-Mab's pipeline against the backdrop of current financial losses. The company's ability to bring its products to market and secure FDA approval will be critical in determining its future financial performance and impact on the stock market. 03/14/2024 - 05:00 PM Recently announced agreement to divest assets and business operations in China marks an important milestone for the Company; the transaction is expected to close by the end of March 2024Uliledlimab (CD73 antibody) on track to file an IND in combination with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors for patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC in 1H 2024First patient dosed in an ongoing, triplet combination, dose escalation study of givastomig (CLDN18.2x4-1BB bispecific antibody) in 1Q 2024RMB2.3 billion (US$321.8 million) in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023ROCKVILLE, Md., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- I-Mab (the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: IMAB), a U.S.-based, global biotech company, exclusively focused on the development and potential commercialization of highly differentiated immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent business updates. ""2023 was a transitional year for I-Mab and we were pleased to report encouraging clinical results in our two lead global assets in oncology, uliledlimab and givastomig. As we prepare for the closing of the strategic divestiture, we look forward to providing investors with a road map to value creation and believe that our differentiated clinical assets, uliledlimab, givastomig, and ragistomig will achieve critical milestones and trial initiations this year,"" said Raj Kannan, Director and Chief Executive Officer of I-Mab. Pipeline Overview and Upcoming Milestones: Uliledlimab: Phase 2, with a focus on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Uliledlimab is designed to target CD73 and promote stronger activation of the patient's immune system against cancer cells. Uliledlimab is potentially differentiated from other products in development due to its non-competitive binding with adenosine monophosphate and the potential for complete inhibition of CD73's immune dampening function. Encouraging results from a Phase 2 study of uliledlimab in combination with toripalimab, presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2023) in patients with advanced NSCLC, provided compelling support for further development of uliledlimab. In particular, the subset of patients with both high CD73 expression and PD-L1 TPS>1% showed an impressive 63% overall response rate. Additionally, enrollment of patients with treatment resistant ovarian cancer has been completed, and ongoing efforts will be streamlined to focus on expediting NSCLC development. Upon the receipt of the investigational new drug (IND) approval, the Company plans to initiate the triplet study for uliledlimab in combination with chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in newly diagnosed patients with advanced NSCLC in the second half of 2024.Givastomig (Claudin 18.2 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody): Phase 1b, with a focus on gastric cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma Givastomig was designed as a bispecific antibody to target Claudin 18.2-positive tumor cells, with conditional activation of pro-immune 4-1BB in the tumor microenvironment. Phase 1 monotherapy data presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO 2023) showed encouraging objective responses in patients with gastric cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma whose tumors progressed or recurred after prior standard treatments, including those with low levels of Claudin 18.2 expression. This program is being jointly developed with ABL Bio. I-Mab owns 50% of the global rights of givastomig. The enrollment of patients from the U.S. and China with newly diagnosed (frontline treatment) gastric and esophageal cancer in combination with chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor began in the first quarter of 2024.Ragistomig (PD-L1 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody): Phase 1 dose escalation, with a focus on solid tumors Ragistomig was designed as a bispecific antibody to address PD-L1 resistant tumors, differentiated by the conditional activation of 4-1BB's pro-immune stimulation when it binds to its PD-L1 target. Early observations reported by our development partner, ABL Bio, showed promising objective responses in patients with various solid tumors whose tumors progressed or recurred after prior standard treatments, including in patients with relapsed or refractory cancer after prior PD-L1 inhibitors. These early signs of efficacy are encouraging, and enrollment in the Phase 1 study continues. This program is being jointly developed with ABL Bio. I-Mab owns 50% of the global rights of ragistomig (TJ-L14B/ABL503). Top-line Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion results are expected to be presented at a major medical conference in the first half of 2024.Impact of Strategic Transaction on Pipeline The agreement to divest assets and business operations in China, previously announced in a press release on February 7, 2024, is expected to be completed by the end of March 2024. Upon the closing of the transaction, the Greater China rights for assets including eftansomatropin alfa, felzartamab, uliledlimab, and givastomig will be transferred to I-Mab Biopharma (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated affiliate (the ""Hangzhou Company""). I-Mab will no longer bear future development costs of these divested assets in China and may receive an aggregate consideration of the RMB equivalent of up to US$80 million, contingent on the Hangzhou Company group's achievement of certain future regulatory and sales-based milestone events relating to these divested assets in China. The transaction, if closed, will also extinguish existing repurchase obligations owed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the amount of approximately US$183 million. As a result of the closing of the transaction, the Company will cease consolidation of the divested entities, assets, and businesses as well as their corresponding financial results. The Company's financial condition and results of operations will be materially affected and the Company's historical results will not be indicative of future financial condition or results of operations. Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of RMB2.3 billion (US$321.8 million), compared with RMB3.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. Share Buyback In August 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to US$40 million of American Depository Shares (""ADSs""), each ten ADSs representing 23 ordinary shares of the Company, or ordinary shares in aggregate over a 12-month period. During the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased US$8.6 million of its ADSs, equating to 4,633,386 ADSs or 10,656,794 ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had issued and outstanding ordinary shares of 185,613,662, representing the equivalent of 80,701,592 ADSs assuming the conversion of all ordinary shares into ADSs. Net Revenues Total net revenues for the full year of 2023 were RMB27.6 million (US$3.9 million), compared with RMB-221.6 million (US$-32.1 million) for the full year of 2022. Total net revenues in 2023 consisted of revenues recognized in connection with the strategic collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and revenues generated from the supply of investigational products to AbbVie and Human Immunology Biosciences, Inc. The negative figure for net revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a one-time, non-cash accounting treatment of US$-48.0 million (equivalent to RMB-314.2 million) recorded in the second half of 2022 following the amendment to the original license and collaboration agreement with AbbVie in August 2022. This amendment led to a reduced probability of achieving a key milestone that was included in the consideration of revenue recognition in prior years. Research & Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the full year of 2023 were RMB810.6 million (US$114.2 million), compared with RMB904.9 million (US$131.2 million) for the full year of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reduced payroll expenses related to headcount optimization as a result of asset prioritization and reduced share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense was RMB66.8 million (US$9.4 million) for the full year of 2023, compared with RMB117.9 million (US$17.1 million) for the full year of 2022. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses for the full year of 2023 were RMB453.0 million (US$63.8 million), compared with RMB815.8 million (US$118.3 million) for the full year of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reduced payroll expenses related to decreased headcount as a result of resource optimization and reduced share-based compensation expenses for management personnel, reduced expenses for professional services, and reduced legal expenses in relation to the disputes with Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of RMB95.5 million (US$13.5 million). Share-based compensation expense was RMB126.2 million (US$17.8 million) for the full year of 2023, compared with RMB239.3 million (US$34.7 million) for the full year of 2022. Other Expenses, Net Net other expenses for the full year of 2023 were RMB38.1 million (US$5.4 million), compared with RMB126.6 million (US$18.4 million) for the full year of 2022. The change was primarily driven by unrealized exchange rate losses due to the significant fluctuation in the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar in 2022. Equity in Loss of Affiliates Equity in loss of affiliates for the full year of 2023 was RMB80.0 million (US$11.3 million), compared with RMB437.5 million (US$63.4 million) for the full year of 2022. The loss was mainly recognized in relation to the operating loss of the Company's investee, I-Mab Biopharma (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd. Impairment of Goodwill For the full year of 2023, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of RMB162.6 million (US$22.9 million). The goodwill impairment resulted from the Company's annual impairment analysis, and reflects the continued disconnect between I-Mab's anticipated future performance and present uncertainty reflected in its market valuation. Net Loss Net loss for the full year of 2023 was RMB1,465.7 million (US$206.4 million), compared with RMB2,507.3 million (US$363.5 million) for the year 2022. Net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the full year of 2023 was RMB7.19 (US$1.01), compared with RMB13.21 (US$1.92) for the full year of 2022. Net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders for the full year of 2023 was RMB16.54 (US$2.33), compared with RMB30.38 (US$4.41) for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP Net Loss Non-GAAP adjusted net loss, which excludes share-based compensation expenses and impairment of goodwill, for the full year of 2023 was RMB1,105.3 million (US$155.7 million), compared with RMB2,136.3 million (US$309.7 million) for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the full year of 2023 was RMB5.42 (US$0.76), compared with RMB11.26 (US$1.63) for the full year of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders for the full year of 2023 was RMB12.47 (US$1.76), compared with RMB25.90 (US$3.75) for the full year of 2022. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses adjusted net income (loss) as a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net income (loss) before share-based compensation and impairment of goodwill. The Company's management believes that adjusted net income (loss) facilitates understanding of operating results and provides management with a better capability to plan and forecast future periods. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results"" set forth at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for GAAP results. A limitation of using adjusted net income (loss) is that adjusted net income (loss) excludes share-based compensation expense and impairment of goodwill that has been and may continue to be incurred in the future.

The Fund and KKR do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date on which such statements were made except as required by law. This document is not an offer to sell securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund KKR Income Opportunities Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC (“KKR Credit”), an indirect subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. (“KKR”). The Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in first- and second-lien secured loans, unsecured loans and high yield corporate debt instruments. It expects to employ a dynamic strategy of investing in a targeted portfolio of loans and fixed-income instruments of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers and implementing hedging strategies in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.

About KKR Credit Launched by KKR in 2004, KKR Credit invests on behalf of its managed funds, clients and accounts across the corporate credit spectrum, including secured credit, bank loans and high yield securities and alternative assets such as junior debt, asset-based finance, corporate direct lending, strategic investments and structured finance.

The Fund will invest in loans and other types of fixed‐income instruments and securities. Such investments may be secured, partially secured or unsecured and may be unrated, and whether or not rated, may have speculative characteristics. The market price of the Fund’s investments will change in response to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, when interest rates rise, the values of fixed‐income instruments fall, and vice versa. Use of leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and return for Common Shareholders but, at the same time, creates risks, including the likelihood of greater volatility in the NAV and market price of, and distributions on, the Common Shares. In particular, leverage may magnify interest rate risk, which is the risk that the prices of portfolio securities will fall (or rise) if market interest rates for those types of securities rise (or fall). As a result, leverage may cause greater changes in the Fund’s NAV, which will be borne entirely by the Fund’s Common Shareholders. Derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Fund. The risk of loss from a short sale is unlimited because the Fund must purchase the shorted security at a higher price to complete the transaction and there is no upper limit for the security price. The use of options, swaps, and derivatives by the Fund has the potential to significantly increase the Fund’s volatility. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. The Fund’s investments in securities or other instruments of non‐U.S. issuers or borrowers may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility and changes in value.

The shares were sold pursuant to a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. No offer or solicitation is made in this communication. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of 85,000 shares by NioCorp Developments Ltd. under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement indicates a strategic move to raise capital while adhering to pre-agreed pricing mechanisms. The sale price of $2.6638, representing 97% of the volume-weighted average, suggests a slight discount to the market, which is a common practice in such agreements to incentivize the purchaser and mitigate risk.Investors should note that the reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for exemption from registration implies a private placement, typically targeted at sophisticated investors. This maneuver allows NioCorp to bypass the more extensive disclosure requirements of a public offering, thus expediting the capital raise process.However, the limited pool of investors and the absence of a public offering in Canada may restrict market liquidity. Stakeholders should assess the potential dilutive effect of such an issuance on their holdings, alongside the company's rationale for capital infusion, which might be directed towards growth initiatives or operational needs. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the Advance Shares issuance by NioCorp is important for investors to understand. Utilizing the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) indicates a non-public offering, which is less burdensome from a regulatory standpoint but limits the pool of potential investors to those who meet certain criteria, such as accredited investors.It's also significant that the Advance Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Investors should be aware of the implications this has for the resale of these shares, as there may be restrictions until they are registered or exempted from registration.Furthermore, the clear statement that this communication is not an offer or solicitation and that in Canada, the shares are not being publicly offered, demonstrates NioCorp's compliance with securities regulations and their cautious approach to avoid misinterpretation of their actions as a public offering. Market Research Analyst The sale of Advance Shares by NioCorp, particularly at a slight discount, could be reflective of the company's confidence in its future prospects and a willingness to secure funding even at a minor sacrifice in immediate valuation. The pricing mechanism tied to the volume-weighted average price ensures a fair market-related price, which can be appealing to investors looking for opportunities aligned with current market values.Market participants should consider the broader industry context and NioCorp's position within it. If the capital is being raised for projects that have the potential to significantly enhance NioCorp's market share or product offerings, the long-term benefits might outweigh the short-term dilution of share value.Additionally, the use of a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement is indicative of a proactive approach to financing, which can be reassuring to investors, as it provides a company with a ready access to capital that can be utilized when necessary to drive growth or fund operations. 03/14/2024 - 05:30 PM CENTENNIAL, CO / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2024 / NioCorp Developments Ltd.

The Offering is expected to close on April 1, 2024, and the net proceeds will be used for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. Positive Baytex Energy Corp. increases the size of its private placement offering to US$575 million. The senior unsecured notes due 2032 will bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per annum. The Notes were priced at 99.266% of par to yield 7.500% per annum.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws. In Canada, the Notes will be offered and sold on a private placement basis in certain provinces. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Baytex Energy Corp. regarding the pricing and upsize of its senior unsecured notes is a strategic financial move. The upsizing to US$575 million indicates a robust demand from investors, which may reflect confidence in the company's creditworthiness and future prospects. The interest rate of 7.375% is slightly below the yield, which suggests that the notes were priced attractively to investors. This could potentially lead to a favorable reception in the bond market.By opting to redeem its outstanding 8.75% notes due in 2027, Baytex is capitalizing on the opportunity to reduce its interest expenses, as the new notes carry a lower interest rate. This could improve their debt profile and interest coverage ratios, which are key metrics for credit rating agencies and investors. Over time, this may have positive implications for the company's stock performance as the market often reacts favorably to improved financial stability and reduced leverage.However, the use of proceeds to repay a portion of the debt on its credit facilities also indicates that the company is managing a significant level of debt. Investors should monitor the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage to assess the sustainability of its capital structure. Market Research Analyst The private placement of senior unsecured notes by Baytex Energy Corp. reflects broader market trends where energy companies are securing financing to strengthen their balance sheets and fund operations or strategic initiatives. Given the volatility in energy prices and the necessity for energy companies to maintain liquidity, such financial instruments are important for operational flexibility.Investors should consider the sector's performance and the potential impact of fluctuating oil and gas prices on Baytex's ability to service its debt. Furthermore, as the notes are not registered under the Securities Act, they are subject to certain restrictions on their transferability, which could affect their liquidity in the secondary market. This is a common trade-off in private placements that offer higher yields in exchange for less liquidity.It is also important to note the timing of the transaction, which is set to close on April 1, 2024. The successful completion of this offering may signal to the market that Baytex has the financial flexibility to navigate the current economic environment, which could influence investor sentiment and the company's stock price. Legal Expert The legal aspects of Baytex Energy Corp.'s note offering are significant as they involve complex securities regulations. The reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S for the issuance of these notes is a common strategy for U.S. and non-U.S. investors, respectively, allowing Baytex to bypass the more rigorous public registration process. This move is indicative of a strategic approach to capital raising, utilizing exemptions to access a broader range of investors while remaining compliant with securities laws.However, the lack of registration under the Securities Act implies that these securities come with higher risks due to the limited disclosure requirements compared to publicly offered securities. For potential investors, it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence. The conditional notice of redemption for the 2027 Notes also introduces a layer of complexity and legal considerations, as it is contingent upon the successful completion of the Offering.Investors should be aware of the legal implications of the private placement nature of the offering, which restricts the resale of the notes, potentially impacting their marketability and pricing in secondary markets. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 14, 2024) - Baytex Energy Corp. (TSX: BTE) (NYSE: BTE) (""Baytex"") is pleased to announce the pricing and upsize to US$575 million of its previously announced private placement offering (the ""Offering"") of senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the ""Notes"").

Announces First Quarter 2024 Common and Preferred Stock Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (GPMT) announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for common stock and $0.4375 per share for Series A Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on April 15, 2024. The Board considered factors like nonaccrual loans, leverage, real estate market trends, and interest rate expectations. The company aims for distributable earnings to cover the dividend, but near-term profitability may be impacted by nonaccrual loans. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. reflects the company's commitment to providing shareholder returns despite the challenges highlighted by the CEO, including the impact of nonaccrual loans and the current state of the commercial real estate market. The dividend payment indicates a level of confidence in the company's liquidity and financial stability, as dividends are typically paid out from earnings or retained earnings. However, it's important to consider the sustainability of such dividends, especially in light of the mentioned nonaccrual loans which could signal potential issues in asset quality and future cash flows.Investors should analyze the dividend yield in relation to the company's earnings to assess whether the dividend payments are at a sustainable payout ratio. Additionally, the reference to 'distributable earnings before losses' suggests that the company is considering non-cash expenses and potential future losses in its dividend policy, which could be a prudent approach in a volatile market. Understanding the company's capital structure and leverage is also critical, as a 'low level of leverage' can be a positive sign of risk management but may also impact the company's return on equity. Market Research Analyst The commercial real estate market trends and the anticipation of future interest rate cuts are external factors that can significantly influence Granite Point's performance. The commercial real estate market is currently experiencing some dislocation, as indicated by the CEO, which can affect property values and, consequently, the performance of mortgage trusts like GPMT. The ability to resolve nonaccrual loans is important for the trust's financial health and investor confidence.Investors should monitor broader market trends, including interest rate movements and real estate market indicators, to predict how these might affect GPMT's asset performance and profitability. The reference to 'market expectations for future interest rate cuts' is particularly noteworthy, as lower interest rates can reduce borrowing costs and potentially stimulate the real estate market, but they can also lead to narrower interest margins for mortgage REITs. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Granite Point's strategy in dealing with the challenges posed by nonaccrual loans is pivotal. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest is overdue and full collection of principal is uncertain, which can be a red flag for REITs that specialize in mortgage lending. The management's plan to cover dividends over time through distributable earnings before losses indicates a forward-looking approach to financial planning. However, the resolution of nonaccrual loans is a complex process that requires careful management of the properties and loans in question.For a mortgage REIT like GPMT, the quality of the loan portfolio is a key determinant of financial health. The company's ability to navigate the 'dislocated market' and improve its 'run-rate earnings' post-resolution of these loans will be critical for long-term sustainability. Investors would benefit from a deeper analysis of the company's loan portfolio, historical loss rates and strategies for managing and recovering from nonaccrual loans. 03/14/2024 - 04:42 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (NYSE: GPMT) (“GPMT,” “Granite Point” or the “Company”) today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2024. This dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to holders of record of common stock at the close of business on April 1, 2024. The Company’s Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4375 per share of the 7.00% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. This dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on April 1, 2024. “When establishing the new quarterly dividend, our Board evaluated a number of factors, including the impact of nonaccrual loans on our near-to-medium-term profitability, our low level of leverage, the ongoing trends in the commercial real estate market, and market expectations for future interest rate cuts,” said Jack Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Granite Point. “We believe that over time our distributable earnings before losses will cover the dividend; however, in the near-term our nonaccrual loans will impact our profitability and resolving them will require some time, given the dislocated market. Once we resolve these loans we expect our run-rate earnings to improve.” About Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc.

ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS’ THIN FILM FREEZING (TFF) TECHNOLOGY TFF Pharmaceuticals’ proprietary Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology allows for the transformation of both existing compounds and new chemical entities into dry powder formulations exhibiting unique characteristics and benefits. The TFF process is a particle engineering process designed to generate dry powder particles with advantageous properties for inhalation, as well as parenteral, nasal, oral, topical and ocular routes of administration. The process can be used to engineer powders for direct delivery to the site of need, circumventing challenges of systemic administration and leading to improved bioavailability, faster onset of action, and improved safety and efficacy. The ability to deliver therapies directly to the target organ, such as the lung, allows TFF powders to be administered at lower doses compared to oral drugs, reducing unwanted toxicities and side effects. Laboratory data suggests the aerodynamic properties of the powders created by TFF can deliver as much as 75% of the dose to the deep lung. TFF does not introduce heat, shear stress, or other forces that can damage more complex therapeutic components, such as fragile biologics, and instead enables the reformulation of these materials into easily stored and temperature-stable dry powders, making therapeutics and vaccines more accessible for distribution worldwide. The advantages of TFF can be used to enhance traditional delivery or combined to enable next-generation pharmaceutical products. ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaging patented rapid freezing technology to develop and transform medicines into potent dry powder formulations for better efficacy, safety, and stability. The company’s versatile TFF technology platform has broad applicability to convert most any drug, including vaccines, small and large molecules, and biologics, into an elegant dry powder highly advantageous for inhalation, or for topical delivery to the eyes, nose and the skin.

The dividend covers the period from December 30, 2023, through March 29, 2024, with 795,878 Series A Preferred Shares outstanding. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a dividend of $0.546875 per share on Imperial Petroleum's 8.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock is a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The yield, which is derived from the annual dividend rate divided by the current share price, is a key metric for income-focused investors. This preferred stock issuance is particularly attractive in a low-interest-rate environment, as it provides a steady income stream.It is essential to assess the sustainability of these dividends. The payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, can indicate the company's financial health. If the payout ratio is too high, it could suggest that the company is not reinvesting enough into its operations, which may affect long-term growth. Conversely, a moderate payout ratio might imply a balance between rewarding shareholders and funding future development.Investors should also be aware of the difference between preferred and common stock. Preferred shares typically have a fixed dividend and priority over common shares in the event of liquidation, but they generally lack voting rights. The trade-off between higher income and less influence on company decisions is a critical consideration for investors. Market Research Analyst Imperial Petroleum's dividend announcement also reflects on the company's positioning within the seaborne transportation sector. The industry is known for its cyclical nature, with profitability often tied to global economic conditions and trade volumes. A company capable of maintaining consistent dividend payments during different market cycles may be perceived as having a competitive advantage and operational resilience.Furthermore, the stock market typically reacts to dividend announcements, as they can signal a company's confidence in its financial stability. A consistent dividend payout can attract a specific investor demographic looking for regular income, potentially increasing demand for the preferred shares. However, it's also important to monitor the sector's overall performance, as external factors such as oil price volatility and shipping rates can impact the company's ability to sustain dividends. Economist From an economic standpoint, Imperial Petroleum's dividend payout needs to be evaluated in the context of the broader economic environment. Inflation rates, interest rates and economic growth projections can influence investor behavior towards dividend stocks. For instance, in a high-inflation scenario, fixed dividends might be less attractive as they could result in a negative real return. Conversely, in a deflationary environment, these dividends could become more appealing.Moreover, the economic climate affects the shipping industry directly. Economic downturns can lead to reduced demand for shipping services, impacting revenue and cash flow for companies like Imperial Petroleum. It is important for investors to consider these macroeconomic factors when assessing the attractiveness and sustainability of dividend payments. 03/14/2024 - 04:45 PM ATHENS, Greece, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMPERIAL PETROLEUM INC.

TC Energy enters agreement to sell Prince Rupert Gas Transmission entities to Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG,2024-03-14T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"TC Energy  (TRP) announces the sale of PRGT to Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG, emphasizing strategic priorities and energy infrastructure development.","TC Energy enters agreement to sell Prince Rupert Gas Transmission entities to Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TC Energy (TRP) announces the sale of PRGT to Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG, emphasizing strategic priorities and energy infrastructure development. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The sale of Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Holdings Ltd. (PRGT) by TC Energy to Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG aligns with TC Energy's strategic focus on capital discipline and asset optimization. By maintaining its capital expenditure within the projected range post-2024, TC Energy is signaling a commitment to financial prudence and operational efficiency.The transaction also highlights the growing trend of Indigenous participation in large-scale energy projects, which can foster goodwill and potentially streamline project approvals and development. The inclusion of Indigenous co-ownership could enhance the social license to operate and may lead to a more sustainable and inclusive approach to project development.Although initial proceeds are not deemed material to TC Energy, the structure of the deal with potential additional payments contingent on project milestones indicates a strategic approach to risk-sharing and value realization. This could be a model for future infrastructure transactions, balancing immediate financial considerations with long-term project success. Financial Analyst The non-material initial proceeds suggest that the immediate impact on TC Energy's balance sheet will be limited. However, the potential for additional payments based on project milestones introduces a variable component to the company's future revenue stream. This contingent payment structure may be indicative of the project's risk profile and the company's confidence in the project's completion and operation.Investors should note that the deal's closing is subject to definitive agreements and customary conditions, which implies a degree of uncertainty. The market's response will likely hinge on the perceived benefits of the transaction in terms of balance sheet flexibility, capital allocation and the project's alignment with TC Energy’s long-term strategic objectives.The transaction also speaks to the broader market's appetite for energy infrastructure investments and the role of natural gas in the global energy mix. The emphasis on responsibly produced Canadian natural gas for emissions reduction may resonate with ESG-focused investors, potentially influencing TC Energy's stock performance in a market increasingly sensitive to sustainability considerations. Market Research Analyst The strategic sale of PRGT is indicative of TC Energy's broader strategy within the energy sector, particularly in relation to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. By enabling the development of a new LNG corridor, TC Energy is contributing to Canada's positioning as a key player in the global LNG supply chain, especially in the context of increasing demand for secure and sustainable energy sources.The collaboration with Indigenous communities and the co-ownership model may serve as a benchmark for future infrastructure projects, potentially influencing industry standards and expectations. This could lead to increased investor interest in companies that proactively engage with Indigenous communities and adopt inclusive development practices.Furthermore, the transaction may have implications for the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) growth, as it could unlock new opportunities for gas exploration and production, thereby impacting the broader market dynamics within the energy sector. Monitoring how this development influences the WCSB's output and Canada’s LNG export capacity will be important for stakeholders invested in the North American energy landscape. 03/14/2024 - 05:00 PM Transaction demonstrates TC Energy’s focus on its strategic priorities while facilitating the development of critical energy infrastructure CALGARY, Alberta, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TC Energy Corporation (TSX, NYSE: TRP) (TC Energy or the Company) announced today that it has entered into a binding letter agreement with Nisga’a Nation and Western LNG (the Buyers) regarding the purchase and sale of all outstanding shares in Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Holdings Ltd. and the limited partnership interests in Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (collectively, PRGT). PRGT is a wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy and the developer of a natural gas pipeline project in British Columbia and potential delivery corridor that would further unlock Canada as a secure, affordable and sustainable source of LNG. This transaction demonstrates TC Energy’s resolve toward delivering its 2024 strategic priorities while facilitating the development of critical energy infrastructure. TC Energy’s strategic priorities are focused on staying within its $6 to $7 billion annual net capital expenditure limit, post-2024, maximizing the value of its assets and further enhancing the strength and flexibility of its balance sheet. This agreement fits with those priorities and more. “We are pleased to see this important project move forward while remaining firm on our commitment to our strategic priorities. This is an important agreement that will see Indigenous co-ownership and development of an integrated LNG project. Enabling LNG development in British Columbia is good for Indigenous communities, our customers, supports the long-term growth of the WCSB and global emissions reduction through the export of responsibly produced Canadian natural gas,” said François Poirier, President and CEO, TC Energy. As part of the letter agreement, TC Energy has committed to provide transition services, on a reimbursable basis, to facilitate the seamless transition of the pipeline project and support development work planned for this year. Subject to the execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Initial proceeds from the transaction are not expected to be material to TC Energy, with the potential to receive additional payments contingent upon the project achieving final investment decision and commercial operation.

(NYSE: OSG) declares a cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its Class A Common Stock. The dividend will be paid on April 11, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. The Company's President and CEO, Sam Norton, emphasizes the strong financial condition and commitment to shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a cash dividend by Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. signifies a positive reinforcement of shareholder value, indicative of the company's liquidity and profit distribution policy. The dividend payout, especially following an earnings release that suggests a strong financial condition, is a signal to the market that the company is confident in its ongoing cash flow and financial stability. It's important to note that the dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the dividend and dividing it by the stock's price, can affect investor perception and stock attractiveness.Furthermore, the commitment to evaluating future dividends reflects a proactive approach to capital management. It's essential to consider the dividend payout ratio, which represents the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio is typically a sign of financial health, but it's also important to balance between rewarding shareholders and retaining enough capital for growth and debt reduction, as mentioned by the CEO. Market Research Analyst Dividend declarations can have a multifaceted impact on the stock market. They are often interpreted as a display of corporate confidence, which can enhance the company's image among investors and potentially lead to an increase in stock demand. However, the market's reaction also depends on the broader economic context, including interest rate trends, inflation and industry-specific conditions. In the shipping industry, factors such as global trade volumes, charter rates and fuel costs are pivotal in determining a company's performance and, by extension, its ability to sustain dividend payments.Investor sentiment towards dividends can also vary; some investors seek out high-dividend stocks for steady income, particularly in volatile or bear markets, while others might prioritize companies that reinvest profits back into growth opportunities. The balance between these preferences can shift based on macroeconomic conditions and market cycles. Debt Analyst The CEO's statement on reducing debt exposure in conjunction with paying dividends is a important aspect of the company's financial strategy. Debt levels are a significant concern for investors as they can impact a company's risk profile. High debt can lead to increased interest expenses and vulnerability to interest rate hikes, which can erode net income and reduce the funds available for dividends.When a company emphasizes debt reduction alongside dividend payments, it suggests a strategic approach to capital allocation that balances shareholder returns with long-term financial health. It's beneficial to examine the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio to assess its leverage and ability to meet financial obligations. A prudent approach to debt management can contribute to creditworthiness and potentially lower borrowing costs in the future, which is a positive sign for investors. 03/14/2024 - 04:45 PM TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Preliminary Results and Announcement of Earnings Date,2024-03-14T20:35:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Radius Recycling, Inc. (RDUS) reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results with a net loss of approximately $(35) million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Market conditions impacted sales volumes, with ferrous sales down by 15% sequentially, nonferrous up by 7% year-over-year, and finished steel up by 5% year-over-year.

(RDUS) reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results with a net loss of approximately $(35) million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Market conditions impacted sales volumes, with ferrous sales down by 15% sequentially, nonferrous up by 7% year-over-year, and finished steel up by 5% year-over-year. The company implemented cost reduction measures to achieve $40 million in annual benefits and expects operating cash outflow of $50-60 million for the quarter. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The preliminary results announced by Radius Recycling, Inc. suggest a challenging quarter, with a net loss and a decrease in ferrous sales volumes. However, the increase in nonferrous sales volumes year-over-year and the expected improvement in finished steel sales volumes highlight a mixed performance. The market conditions, including the tight supply flows and the impact of weather, are significant as they affect the availability and cost of raw materials. The anticipated benefits from productivity initiatives and cost reductions could be a positive sign for investors, indicating the company's proactive approach to managing expenses during tough market conditions.Furthermore, the expected operating cash outflow and increased net working capital needs suggest liquidity pressures that could impact the company's short-term financial stability. However, the company's focus on expanding its recycling services platform and the mention of decarbonization trends as a positive driver for demand could resonate with investors interested in environmentally sustainable practices and long-term growth opportunities in the recycling sector. Financial Analyst Radius Recycling's projected net loss and the anticipated restructuring charges are critical for evaluating the company's financial health. The increase in adjusted EBITDA, despite a net loss, indicates some level of operational efficiency. The sequential decrease in ferrous sales volumes is concerning, but an 8% increase in average net selling prices for ferrous recycled metals could offset some revenue losses. The effective tax rate and the recognition of a valuation allowance charge on deferred tax assets provide insights into the company's tax position and its impact on net income.Investors will likely scrutinize the company's capital expenditure plans and debt levels in relation to its cash flow position. The expected increase in capital expenditures to $80 million for fiscal 2024 and a net debt of $360 million are key figures that need to be assessed in the context of the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its investment and debt obligations. The strategic focus on nonferrous production and recycling services expansion could be a long-term growth driver, but it is essential to balance this with the company's current financial constraints. Environmental and Sustainability Expert Radius Recycling's commentary on decarbonization trends and the increased demand for recycled metals is indicative of the broader shift towards sustainable practices in the industry. The company's emphasis on low carbon and net zero carbon emission products, such as GRNTM finished steel, aligns with global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of manufacturing processes. Recycled metals are indeed less carbon-intensive compared to mined metals, which could give Radius Recycling a competitive advantage as industries and consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability.Moreover, the company's 3PRTM service and supply chain solution that enables customers to increase their recycling rates is an innovative approach that could meet the growing demand for sustainable supply chain solutions. While these initiatives position the company favorably in the long term, it is important to consider the current economic pressures and how they might affect the pace of adoption for these sustainable technologies and services. 03/14/2024 - 04:35 PM Nonferrous and Finished Steel Sales Volumes Up Year-over-Year Cost Reduction Target Increased PORTLAND, Ore., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radius Recycling, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDUS) today announced preliminary results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter ended February 29, 2024. Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Expected Performance The Company anticipates: Net loss to be approximately $(35) million. Loss per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $(1.19) - $(1.24).Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $2 million, and adjusted loss per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $(1.05) - $(1.10). Market Conditions, Prices, and Volumes. Tight supply flows for recycled metals and unusually wet winter weather impacted sales volumes and metal spreads for both recycled metals and finished steel during the Company’s second quarter. Ferrous sales volumes are expected to decrease sequentially by 15% due to the lower supply flows including delays of certain bulk shipments at quarter-end. Nonferrous sales volumes are expected to be down 3% sequentially, but up 7% year-over-year supported by additional production from the Company’s advanced nonferrous recovery technologies and expansion of our platform. Finished steel sales volumes are expected to increase by 5% year-over-year and steel mill utilization is expected to be 81% versus 75% in the prior year period, reflecting the continued strength of non-residential and infrastructure demand in the Western U.S. Sequentially, finished steel sales volumes are expected to decrease by 11% due to seasonally lower construction demand exacerbated by a prolonged period of rain on the West Coast. Average net selling prices for ferrous recycled metals are expected to be up 8% sequentially, benefiting from the strengthening in global prices in the early part of the quarter driven by restocking, before softening due to lower demand including continued elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. Average net selling prices for nonferrous recycled metal are expected to be up 3% sequentially and be flat for finished steel products. Results for the second quarter are expected to include a benefit from average inventory accounting of approximately $2 per ferrous ton. Productivity Initiatives and Cost Reductions. During the second quarter, the Company implemented a plan to reduce selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense by 10% and increase production cost efficiencies to deliver $40 million in aggregate annual benefits, which are in addition to the $30 million in annual benefits previously announced that were substantially implemented in the second quarter. The new measures include reductions in headcount and other employee-related expenses, as well as decreases in non-trade procurement spend, transportation and logistics, and other outside services. Approximately half of the targeted quarterly run-rate benefits from these initiatives are expected to be achieved in the third quarter, with substantially all of the remainder by the end of the fiscal year. The Company expects to incur related restructuring charges and other exit-related costs in the range of $6 million, of which $3 million are expected to be incurred during the second quarter. Operating Cash Flow. Operating cash outflow for the second quarter is expected to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million, reflecting an increase in net working capital due primarily to the timing of shipment and collections. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $15 million for the second quarter, and the Company projects fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million. At the end of the second quarter, total debt is expected to be approximately $374 million and net debt is expected to be approximately $360 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be an expense of approximately 4% on GAAP results and 8% on adjusted non-GAAP results, both including the recognition of a valuation allowance charge of $2 million on deferred tax assets in one of the Company’s tax jurisdictions. Tamara Lundgren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Without question, current market conditions remain challenging as cyclical headwinds are creating tighter supply flows and compressing metal spreads. We have navigated effectively through these periods of tight scrap availability before, and we are focused on what we can control: costs, operating efficiencies, and execution of our strategic priorities to increase our nonferrous production and expand our recycling services platform.” She continued, “Scrap supply flows should improve with normal seasonality and benefit as U.S. interest rates decline and global manufacturing activity recovers. On the demand side, decarbonization trends continue to be a positive driver for our products and services. Many low carbon technologies are more metal intensive than the technologies they are replacing and recycled metals require less carbon to produce than mined metals. With our 100+ operating facilities producing recycled ferrous volumes of over four million tons and nonferrous volumes of over 700 million pounds annually, our low carbon and net zero carbon emission GRNTM finished steel products, and our 3PRTM service and supply chain solution that enables our customers to increase their recycling rates, we are well-positioned to benefit from market improvements and these positive structural demand trends.” The preliminary information provided above is based on the Company’s current estimates of its financial results for the quarter ended February 29, 2024, and remains subject to change based on final review of the Company’s second quarter financial results. Earnings Call Date The Company will report financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter ended February 29, 2024 on Thursday, April 4, 2024. The Company will host a webcast conference call to discuss the results at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the same day. The webcast of the call and the accompanying slide presentation may be accessed at www.radiusrecycling.com/company/investors on Radius Recycling’s website under Company > Investors. The call will be hosted by Tamara Lundgren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Stefano Gaggini, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. About Radius Recycling, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains performance based on adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders, adjusted EBITDA, and debt, net of cash, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided a reconciliation of these measures for each period discussed to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures adds a meaningful presentation of our results from business operations excluding adjustments for restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, asset impairment charges, charges for legacy environmental matters (net of recoveries), amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, business development costs not related to ongoing operations including pre-acquisition expenses, and the income tax benefit allocated to these adjustments, items which are not related to underlying business operational performance, and improves the period-to-period comparability of our results from business operations. We believe that presenting debt, net of cash is useful to investors as a measure of our leverage, as cash and cash equivalents can be used, among other things, to repay indebtedness. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Adecoagro S.A. (AGRO) announces record financial performance for Q4 2023 with all-time highs in gross sales, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Despite initial challenges due to weather conditions, the company showcased resilience and achieved significant growth in key financial metrics. Positive Record Gross sales in 2023 due to increased cane productivity leading to higher sugar production and solid sales prices. Adjusted EBITDA of $476.6 million, a 10.1% increase from 2022, driven by strong performance in Rice and Sugar segments. NCFO at $175.9 million, up by 24.5% year-over-year, resulting in a distribution of $70.3 million to be paid in 2024 via dividend and share repurchase. Net debt reduced by 25.9% to $502.5 million, with Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA at 1.1x. Shareholder distribution in 2023 included repurchase of 2.7 million shares and cash dividends totaling $61.2 million. 2024 shareholder distribution plan includes a minimum distribution of $70.3 million via cash dividend and share buyback. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in gross sales by Adecoagro S.A. reflects a positive trend in agriculture commodity productivity and pricing, particularly in sugar, rice and dairy segments. This is indicative of a well-executed strategy in market positioning and product diversification. The company's ability to navigate a challenging start to the year, marked by extreme weather conditions and still achieve record financial metrics suggests a robust business model and operational efficiency.Investors should note the substantial decrease in net debt, which enhances the company's financial stability and may be favorable for future borrowing costs. The reported net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.1x falls below the commonly accepted threshold of 2.0x to 3.0x for healthy financial leverage, signaling a conservative financial posture. This could be a point of interest for stakeholders looking for companies with prudent financial management practices. Financial Analyst The 10.1% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA and 24.5% increase in NCFO are significant indicators of Adecoagro's operational success and financial health. These metrics are essential for evaluating the company's profitability and cash generation capabilities. The distribution of $70.3 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases reflects a commitment to returning value to investors, which could potentially enhance shareholder sentiment and support stock price performance.However, investors should be cautious of external factors such as commodity price volatility and the potential impact of climate change on agricultural yields. While the company has shown resilience, these factors can introduce risk to future earnings. The company's performance in mitigating these risks could be a critical factor in sustaining its financial growth trajectory. Agricultural Economist The performance of Adecoagro in the face of an unprecedented drought highlights the importance of geographic and product diversification in the agricultural sector. The firm's strategic focus on being a low-cost producer is a competitive advantage that allows for better absorption of external shocks such as adverse weather conditions and fluctuating market prices. This strategy is essential for maintaining profitability in the inherently variable agricultural market.It's also noteworthy that the company's success is partly attributed to its financial strategy, which capitalized on opportunities in the Argentine market. Adecoagro's approach to leveraging local market conditions, while managing risks, could serve as a model for other agribusinesses operating in volatile economies. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM LUXEMBOURG, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Adecoagro S.A.

This, in turn, has fully offset the decline reported in the Crops segment driven by an unprecedented drought and higher costs.NCFO in 2023 stood at $175.9 million, 24.5% higher year-over-year, resulting in a minimum distribution of $70.3 million to be paid in 2024 via dividend and share repurchase. Net debt came down by 25.9% to $502.5 million on (i) greater cash generation and (ii) lower debt levels thanks to the Company's financial strategy. Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA stood at 1.1x.Full year results overview: 2023 started as a challenging year as our operations in Argentina and Uruguay suffered the effects of extreme dry weather. Despite this, we delivered strong results quarter after quarter, showing the company's resilience. This was achieved thanks to our geographic and product diversification, our flexibility to shift across markets and products, our focus on being low-cost producers, and our ability to adapt our financial strategy to profit from opportunities in the Argentine market.Along with the investments carried out throughout the past years across all our operations, this culminated in all-time records for the Company's main financial metrics, as well as in better operational indicators (excluding Crops). At a consolidated level, Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $476.6 million, marking a 10.1% year-over-year increase, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow from Operations (NCFO) reached $175.9 million, 24.5% higher than in 2022. Cash generated was distributed to shareholders, invested in growth projects and used to deleverage - a 25.9% year-over-year reduction in our net debt position to $502.5 million, reaching 1.1x Net Debt/EBITDA.Remarks 2023 Shareholder Distribution During 2023, we distributed a total of $61.2 million, or 43% of the NCFO generated in 2022, representing a distribution yield of 5.9%. This was executed via the repurchase of 2.7 million shares at an average price of $9.54 per share (2.5% of the company's equity), totaling $26.2 million. In addition, we distributed cash dividends in the amount of $35.0 million, paid in two installments of $17.5 million each in May and November 2023, representing approximately $0.33 per share.2024 Announced Shareholder Distribution In 2023, we generated $175.9 million of NCFO, which implies a minimum distribution of $70.3 million to be distributed via a combination of cash dividend and share buyback throughout 2024. Cash dividends will amount to $35.0 million to be paid in two installments of $17.5 million each, in or about May and November 2024. Such dividend distribution is subject to the approval of the annual shareholder meeting to be held next April 17th. The balance will be distributed via buybacks and/or dividends as the case may be.During the first two months of the year, we repurchased 1.8 million shares (1.7% of the company's equity) under our existing share buyback program at an average price of $10.19 per share, totaling $18.1 million.Commitment to reduce 20% our carbon footprint by 2030 We are proud to announce our 2030 commitment to reduce carbon intensity by 20% relative to 2021 (base year: 0.31 intensity). This target considers all our Scope 1 and Scope 2 net emissions and the total production volume of our business.Non-Gaap Financial Measures: For a full reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures please refer to page 27 of our 4Q23 Earnings Release found on Adecoagro's website (ir.adecoagro.com) Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry.

Completes Acquisition of Assets from Tyson Foods, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (CALM) has finalized the acquisition of a broiler processing plant, hatchery, and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri, previously closed by Tyson Foods, Inc. The company aims to revamp these assets for shell egg and egg products production, signaling a strategic move for expansion and diversification. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of a broiler processing plant, hatchery and feed mill by Cal-Maine Foods represents a strategic expansion that could have significant implications for the company's market position and operational capabilities. By repurposing these assets for shell egg and egg products production, Cal-Maine is diversifying its production capabilities and potentially increasing its production capacity.This move may be interpreted as a proactive approach to meet growing consumer demand for eggs and egg products, which has been on the rise due to factors such as increased protein consumption and the versatility of eggs as an ingredient. It's also worth noting that the acquisition of facilities previously owned by a major player like Tyson Foods could provide Cal-Maine with advanced technologies and infrastructure that may enhance efficiency and reduce production costs over time.However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with such expansions, including the time and capital required to remodel and repurpose the facilities, as well as the potential for unforeseen operational challenges. The impact on Cal-Maine's financials will depend on how effectively the company can integrate these new assets and realize anticipated synergies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Cal-Maine Foods' completion of this acquisition is a significant capital investment that could affect the company's short-term liquidity and leverage ratios. The long-term success of this investment will hinge on the company's ability to increase production volumes and sales while managing the costs associated with the remodeling and repurposing of the acquired assets.Investors should monitor Cal-Maine's forthcoming financial statements for changes in capital expenditures, any increases in debt and the impact on cash flow. Additionally, the company's return on investment will be a critical factor to watch, as it will indicate how effectively Cal-Maine is utilizing these new assets to generate profit.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape of the egg industry and how this acquisition might alter Cal-Maine's market share. If the repurposed facilities lead to significant cost savings or product innovations, Cal-Maine could strengthen its competitive edge against other producers. Agricultural Economist The completion of this acquisition by Cal-Maine Foods can be seen as a strategic move within the agricultural sector, particularly within the poultry and egg production industry. The decision to repurpose existing facilities rather than building new ones can be a more cost-effective and faster approach to expanding production capacity.Given that the egg market is subject to fluctuations based on feed costs, disease outbreaks and consumer trends, Cal-Maine's investment in additional production infrastructure could provide more flexibility to respond to market changes. This could be particularly advantageous in managing the volatility associated with feed prices, as owning a feed mill may allow for better cost control.However, the integration of these new operations into Cal-Maine's existing business model will require careful management to avoid disruption to current operations. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory environment, including environmental and food safety standards, will also be important in determining the success of this venture. 03/14/2024 - 04:45 PM RIDGELAND, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) (“Cal-Maine Foods” or the “Company”), the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States, today announced it has completed the previously announced acquisition of a broiler processing plant, hatchery and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri, that were closed by Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) (“Tyson”) in 2023. The Company plans to remodel and repurpose the assets for use in shell egg and egg products production. Sherman Miller, president and chief executive officer of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., stated, “We are pleased to join the Dexter community and are excited about the opportunities to expand our operations. We intend to partner with the existing strong network of local contract growers who can support our shell egg production capabilities. Dexter’s central geographic location and strong work force will enhance our supply and distribution capabilities for customers in Missouri and surrounding markets. Importantly, we will also benefit from closer proximity to sources for our primary feed ingredients. We look forward to the new production opportunities, including the potential for additional free-range capacity, in this new community and market for Cal-Maine Foods.” About Cal-Maine Foods Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs, including conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced eggs.

Carey is a leading net lease REIT with a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate properties in the U.S. and Europe. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in quarterly cash dividend announced by W. P. Carey Inc. indicates a positive cash flow situation, suggesting that the company's net lease property investments are generating reliable income. This is a sign of financial health and stability, which can be attractive to investors looking for steady income streams through dividends. It's important to evaluate the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. If the yield is higher than what's available from other investments with similar risk profiles, it could draw more investors to the stock.However, investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A high payout ratio could mean the company is returning most of its profits to shareholders, leaving less capital for growth opportunities. It's essential to balance between rewarding shareholders and reinvesting in the company's expansion. Real Estate Market Analyst W. P. Carey's focus on single-tenant, industrial, warehouse and retail properties in geographically diverse and economically stable regions is a strategic choice. These property types tend to offer stable cash flows due to long-term net leases with built-in rent escalations, which can protect against inflation. The company's diversification across property types and regions can reduce risk and enhance the resilience of its portfolio.Investors should pay attention to the broader market trends in commercial real estate, including shifts in supply and demand, e-commerce growth impacting warehouse and industrial spaces and the health of the retail sector. Understanding these factors can provide insights into the company's potential performance and the sustainability of its dividend payments over the long term. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- W.

Colgate Announces Dividend Increase – Effective 2nd Quarter 2024,2024-03-14T20:35:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) increases quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2024.

Annualized rate now at $2.00 per share. The Company has a long history of uninterrupted dividends since 1895. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Colgate-Palmolive Company to increase its quarterly dividend represents a positive signal to shareholders and reflects the company's financial health. The increment from $0.48 to $0.50 per share, although modest, indicates a confidence in the company's cash flow sustainability. This decision will likely be well-received by income-focused investors, as it suggests a reliable and potentially growing income stream. The historical consistency of dividend payments since 1895 underscores a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders.However, it's important to assess the payout ratio and compare it with industry peers to ensure that the increased dividends are not at the expense of necessary capital reinvestment or debt reduction. A high payout ratio could limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or weather economic downturns. In the context of consumer goods, where competition is intense and innovation is key, maintaining a balance between rewarding shareholders and funding business development is vital. Market Research Analyst Colgate-Palmolive's dividend increase can be seen as a strategic move to maintain investor interest in a mature market. The company operates in a sector characterized by stable demand, which often translates into predictable revenue streams. Given the vast portfolio of products and global reach, the brand's strength is a critical factor in maintaining market share against competitors. The dividend hike may also be interpreted as a lever to enhance shareholder value in light of the company's sustainability initiatives.From a market perspective, the increase in dividend might also act as a differentiator among competitors, particularly in attracting and retaining long-term investors. The emphasis on sustainability and community wellbeing in the company's communication aligns with a growing investor appetite for socially responsible and environmentally friendly investments. This aspect of the company's strategy could appeal to a broader demographic of investors, looking beyond mere financial returns. Sustainability Expert Colgate-Palmolive's focus on sustainability and community wellbeing is noteworthy in the context of its dividend increase announcement. The company's efforts in decreasing plastic waste, promoting recyclability and conserving natural resources resonate with an increasing trend of corporate social responsibility. These initiatives could serve to strengthen the company's brand image and foster consumer loyalty, which in turn can contribute to long-term financial stability and shareholder value.Investors are increasingly considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. Colgate-Palmolive's commitment to programs like Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures, which has significant reach, can enhance the company's ESG profile. Aligning financial strategies such as dividend policies with sustainability efforts may provide a competitive edge in attracting investment from funds and individuals focused on sustainable investing. 03/14/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) today increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.50 per share, up from $0.48 per share.

(NYSE: COHR), a global leader in materials, networking, and lasers, announced today that three of its products received awards in the 2024 Lightwave Innovation Reviews. “We are excited and honored to receive recognition from Lightwave’s Innovation Reviews,” said Dr. Sanjai Parthasarathi, Chief Marketing Officer, Coherent. “These well-known awards, so highly respected in the optical communications industry, recognize our continuous innovation in coherent technologies, from components to pluggable modules. We provide differentiated solutions enabling high-speed transmission at 800 Gbps leveraging our industry-leading indium phosphide technology platform. Our new WaveShaper product further enhances an already exceptional portfolio of instruments by supporting an extended DWDM spectrum, enabling research and testing activities for optical transmission in the O-band.” The following three products were recognized: 140 Gbaud IC-TROSA for 800G DCO (Digital Coherent Optics): the 140 Gbaud integrated coherent transmitter-receiver optical subassembly (IC-TROSA) was recognized in the category of Optical Components. Featuring fully embedded control and management electronics, this InP-based component contains all functions to enable high optical output power and low power dissipation for 800G coherent transmission. This complete coherent optical engine available in both C- and L-band versions is the industry’s first to enable 800G QSFP-DD and OSFP digital coherent optical (DCO) pluggable transceivers in support of higher-capacity, lower-power, and lower-cost DWDM networks. 800G coherent pluggable DCO Module in QSFP-DD form factor: the new 800G pluggable DCO in QSFP-DD received an award in the Optical Transceivers and Transponders category. This module is the first digital coherent optical module (DCO) in the ultra-compact QSFP-DD form factor. Its compact form factor allows it to be plugged directly into routers and switches for IP-over-DWDM architectures, and its high transmitter optical output power of 0 dBm makes it optimal for datacenter interconnect, metro, and regional network applications with ROADMs. This transceiver is capable of supporting up to 1000 km fiber reach at 800 Gbps line rate and even longer reaches at 400G. WaveShaper 4000 B/O band programmable optical spectrum synthesizer: the WaveShaper 4000 B/O band programmable optical spectrum synthesizer earned a “superb” score of 5.0 in the category of Lab/Production Test Equipment. It enables the design and prototyping of DWDM ROADMs and optical nodes in the O-band thanks to its huge 16.5 THz spectrum, covering 165 x 100 GHz channels. It supports both development and production testing in CWDM and LR4/LR8 applications. Judges commented, “This product will see increasing application in two areas: expanding traditional WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) transport into O-band for additional capacity and the design and testing of multi-wavelength short-reach interconnects in O-band.” About Coherent Coherent empowers market innovators to define the future through breakthrough technologies, from materials to systems. We deliver innovations that resonate with our customers in diversified applications for the industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets.

(NYSE: BFS) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share on its common stock, unchanged from the previous quarter. The Company also announces dividends on its preferred stocks. Saul Centers operates 61 properties, mainly in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area.","Saul Centers Declares Quarterly Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Saul Centers, Inc. (NYSE: BFS) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share on its common stock, unchanged from the previous quarter. The Company also announces dividends on its preferred stocks. Saul Centers operates 61 properties, mainly in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When examining Saul Centers, Inc.'s dividend declaration, it's important to note that the consistency of the dividend amount could be interpreted as a signal of stability in the company's cash flow. The unchanged dividend suggests management's confidence in the company's ability to maintain its earnings and cash flow levels. This can be reassuring to income-focused investors who rely on dividends for a portion of their returns. However, the lack of dividend growth might raise questions for growth-oriented investors who typically look for companies with rising dividends as a sign of financial health and growth prospects.Furthermore, the declaration of dividends on preferred stocks indicates a commitment to fulfilling obligations to preferred shareholders, who are often seen as having a lower risk tolerance compared to common stockholders. The rates on the Series D and E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks remain attractive compared to current interest rates, which could indicate a solid investment for those seeking fixed income securities in a potentially volatile market. Real Estate Market Analyst The real estate industry context is essential when analyzing Saul Centers' announcement. The firm's focus on the Washington, DC/Baltimore area, a region with a relatively stable economic base due to government and contractor presence, provides some insulation against market downturns. The company's portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties is designed to cater to the daily needs of consumers, which can be less sensitive to economic fluctuations than other types of retail properties.However, investors should be aware of the broader retail real estate market trends, such as shifts towards e-commerce and the impact of consumer behavior changes on brick-and-mortar retail spaces. Saul Centers' ability to maintain high occupancy rates and attract tenants in a changing retail environment will be key to sustaining their operating income and, by extension, their dividend payouts. 03/14/2024 - 04:17 PM BETHESDA, Md., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Saul Centers, Inc.

The successful bond issuance highlights investor confidence in Hamilton, securing more retrocession than targeted at a better price. Positive None. Negative None. Risk Management Expert In the context of insurance, the issuance of catastrophe bonds is a strategic move for risk mitigation. By securing a $200 million capacity through Easton Re, Hamilton Insurance Group diversifies its risk portfolio, transferring potential financial losses from natural disasters to investors. This not only shields the company's capital reserves but also stabilizes its financial position, ensuring that it can withstand the financial strain of a catastrophic event without significantly impacting its liquidity or solvency.The transaction indicates a proactive approach to financial planning, which is particularly pertinent given the volatility associated with natural disasters. Moreover, the favorable terms achieved – exceeding initial targets and at a better price – reflect investor confidence in Hamilton's risk management and financial stability. This could potentially lead to lower insurance premiums for customers or improved terms, which in turn could enhance the company's competitive position in the market. Insurance Industry Analyst The successful sponsorship of the Easton Re catastrophe bond by Hamilton Insurance Group signifies a continued trend in the insurance industry towards the utilization of alternative risk transfer mechanisms. Catastrophe bonds serve as a financial instrument designed to raise capital for insurance companies in the event of a specified natural disaster, thus providing a buffer against claims that may arise from such events.The strategic use of such instruments is indicative of an insurer's financial innovation and agility. By capitalizing on the ILS market, Hamilton not only secures additional reinsurance at a cost-effective rate but also demonstrates to stakeholders its commitment to maintaining a robust balance sheet. This could potentially lead to positive stock market reactions as investors and analysts often look favorably upon companies that effectively manage their risk exposure. Investment Analyst From an investment perspective, the announcement that Hamilton Insurance Group has exceeded its retrocession targets at a better price than anticipated could be interpreted as a positive signal. It suggests that the company has managed to negotiate favorable terms in the capital markets, which could be due to a strong track record, sound risk management practices, or favorable market conditions.The ability to attract investment at a lower cost of capital is beneficial for the company's profitability. Additionally, the fact that this is Hamilton's second sponsorship of Easton Re bonds may indicate a growing trust and interest from the ILS investor community. For investors, this could imply a level of security and confidence in Hamilton's business model and future prospects. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd.

The company focused on cash efficiency and strengthened its balance sheet with a $20 million royalty transaction. Key initiatives included an internal scoping study for Mt Todd, extending agreements, starting drilling programs, and publishing an inaugural ESG report. The updated feasibility study for Mt Todd showed project economics similar to two years ago. The company reported a net loss of $6.6 million in 2023 compared to $4.9 million in 2022. Vista received $7 million in February 2024 from the Royalty and expects $10 million more in the first half of 2024. Positive None. Negative Consolidated net loss increased from $4.9 million in 2022 to $6.6 million in 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased from $8.1 million in 2022 to $6.1 million in 2023. The company reported no debt, but the net loss indicates financial challenges. The financial results show a decline in cash reserves and an increase in net losses. Financial Analyst Vista Gold Corp's audited financial results indicate a strategic focus on cash conservation and balance sheet strengthening, evidenced by the completion of a $20 million royalty transaction. The staged receipt of funds from this deal enhances liquidity, a critical factor when assessing the financial health of the company. The reported consolidated net loss of $6.6 million reflects a year-over-year increase in losses, which could raise concerns about operational efficiency and profitability. However, the absence of debt in the company's financial structure is a positive indicator, as it suggests a lower risk profile and potential resilience against market volatility.Furthermore, the company's emphasis on a smaller-scale, staged development strategy for the Mt Todd project is indicative of a risk-averse approach to capital expenditure. This could appeal to investors who are cautious about the high costs typically associated with mining projects. The updated feasibility study, which shows stable project economics despite sector-wide cost increases, may reassure stakeholders about the project's viability. However, the long-term success of this strategy will hinge on gold price fluctuations and the company's ability to efficiently manage operating costs. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership with CIBC Capital Markets is a significant development for Vista Gold Corp, as it could facilitate the identification and advancement of potential investors or partners for the Mt Todd project. The focus on maximizing shareholder value through such collaborations is a common strategy in the mining sector, aimed at sharing risks and benefits. The commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, as demonstrated by the publication of their inaugural ESG report, aligns with the increasing investor demand for responsible mining practices. This could enhance the company's reputation and investor appeal in a market that is progressively prioritizing sustainability.Moreover, the company's proactive measures, such as extending the agreement with the Northern Territory Government and pursuing additional gold resources through drilling programs, are likely to be perceived positively by the market. These efforts could lead to an improved production schedule and cash flows, which are key drivers of a mining company's valuation. It's also important to monitor the gold market trends as they will directly impact the company's future performance and the attractiveness of the Mt Todd project to potential investors or acquirers. Mining Industry Analyst The decision to pursue a smaller-scale, staged development at Mt Todd suggests Vista Gold Corp is adapting to industry challenges, such as high capital costs and uncertain commodity prices. The staged development approach could reduce upfront capital requirements and allow for production to commence sooner, potentially generating revenue to fund further expansion. This strategy also reflects a trend in the mining industry towards modular and scalable project development.Additionally, the extended term of the agreement with the Northern Territory Government provides a longer runway for project development and operation, which could enhance the project's net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR), two critical financial metrics in mining project evaluations. The focus on adding near-surface gold resources may improve the project's economics by lowering the strip ratio and reducing the cost per ounce of gold produced. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the company's prospects, as they can significantly influence the project's risk profile and potential return on investment. 03/14/2024 - 05:01 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vista Gold Corp. (NYSE American and TSX: VGZ) (“Vista” or the “Company”) today announced its audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, with cash totaling $6.1 million at year-end. All dollar amounts in this press release are in U.S. dollars. During 2023, the Company focused on the efficient use of cash and strengthened its balance sheet by completing a $20 million royalty transaction (“Royalty”). Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty, we received $3 million in December 2023, $7 million in February 2024, and expect to receive the remaining $10 million during the first half of 2024. Frederick H. Earnest, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vista, stated, “Our team successfully executed on a number of key initiatives during 2023 and we are off to a great start in 2024. During this period we: completed an internal scoping study that we believe confirmed the potential for a smaller-scale, staged development strategy for Mt Todd; extended the term of the agreement with the Northern Territory Government pertaining to Mt Todd through December 31, 2029 with the option for a three-year extension; started a drilling program targeting shallow gold resources at the north end of the Batman deposit which is expected to add near-surface gold resources, benefiting the mine production schedule and project cash flows in early years; published our inaugural ESG report, which recognizes our belief in the importance of conducting our business in a responsible and sustainable manner, and our commitment to aligning our business practices with current and evolving ESG principles to ensure the long-term success and positive impact of our operations; and recently announced the results of the updated feasibility study for Mt Todd that includes capital and operating costs, gold price, and foreign exchange rates reflective of current market conditions, with project economics that are approximately the same or slightly better than reported two years ago, inclusive of cost increases that have affected the entire gold mining sector.” Mr. Earnest continued, “Our top priority in 2024 is realizing value for our shareholders. Receipt of the Royalty funding enables us to move forward strategically in our efforts to de-risk Mt Todd and maximize value. We continue to work with CIBC Capital Markets (“CIBC”) to identify and advance interest in Mt Todd and are focused on achieving a transaction that maximizes shareholder value. We plan to leverage the results of the drilling program and prior technical studies by advancing evaluations of smaller-scale, staged development scenarios at Mt Todd with a focus on lower initial capital costs. Our evaluation of a smaller-scale, staged development strategy for Mt Todd complements the work that we are doing with CIBC and increases optionality.” Summary of Financial Results Vista reported a consolidated net loss of $6.6 million, or $0.05 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a consolidated net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.04 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.1 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $8.1 million at December 31, 2022. In February 2024, the Company received the second instalment payment under the Royalty in the amount of $7 million and expects to receive the final instalment payment in the amount of $10 million during the first half of 2024. The Company continued to have no debt.

The company's decision to change its fiscal year end aims to align reporting with its equity investment in Peak Gold LLC. Contango also completed a Credit and Guaranty Agreement for a senior secured loan facility and invested in the Peak Gold JV for project development. Positive None. Negative The company reported a significant net loss of $40.8 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023. Entering into derivative gold hedging contracts led to an unrealized loss of $23.4 million on derivative contracts in the 2023 period. Increased interest costs related to funds drawn down on the secured credit facility and higher general and administrative costs impacted the financial results negatively. Although there were reductions in exploration expenses and losses on the Peak Gold JV, the overall net loss increased primarily due to derivative contracts and increased costs. The company's financial performance for the six-month period was impacted by various cost increases and derivative contract losses. Financial Analyst The reported net loss of $40.8 million for Contango ORE is a significant figure, particularly when contrasted with the previous year's loss of $21.4 million. The almost doubling of the loss is primarily attributed to the non-cash expense from derivative contracts, which indicates a high level of volatility in the gold market. Investors should note that while this loss is non-cash and related to accounting for derivatives, it reflects the risks associated with gold price fluctuations and the company's hedging strategy. The increase in interest costs due to funds drawn on a secured credit facility also suggests a rise in the company's leverage, which could impact its financial flexibility.Furthermore, the reduction in exploration expenses and the decrease in the loss on the Peak Gold JV are positive signs of cost management and operational efficiency. However, the increased general and administrative costs, including retention and severance payments, could be a concern if they continue to rise. The investment of $34.4 million in the Peak Gold JV and the progress on the Manh Choh project are indicative of a strategic focus on long-term production capabilities. These investments, along with the public offering that raised $30.4 million, should be considered by investors as they evaluate the company's growth potential against its current financial health. Market Research Analyst Contango ORE's alignment of its fiscal year with that of its investment in the Peak Gold JV and peer companies is a strategic move that may facilitate better comparative analysis and peer benchmarking. This change, however, is administrative and unlikely to have a direct impact on the company's operational performance. The market's response to the transition report will depend on investor sentiment regarding the company's long-term prospects, particularly the anticipated production start in the second half of 2024 at the Manh Choh project.The commencement of mining operations and the progress on budget and schedule are positive indicators for the project's future success. However, the escalation in costs and the potential for further volatility in gold prices could pose risks. The company's ability to manage these risks and maintain its project timeline will be important for investor confidence. The strategic partnership with Kinross Gold Corporation for the operation of the Manh Choh project adds a layer of credibility and operational expertise, which may be viewed favorably by the market. Mining Sector Analyst The transition to production at the Manh Choh project is a pivotal phase for Contango ORE. The commencement of ore mining and stockpiling, along with the transportation of ore to Fort Knox for processing, are critical steps in the transition from exploration to production. The mechanical completion and commissioning activities for the project, as mentioned by the CEO, are essential for ensuring operational readiness and a smooth ramp-up to production.Investors should be aware that the mining sector is capital-intensive and the costs associated with constructing and commissioning new projects can be significant. Contango's ability to stay on budget and on schedule is commendable, but investors should remain vigilant about the potential for unforeseen expenses or delays, which are not uncommon in the industry. The forward gold price compared to the contracted hedge price will continue to be an important factor in the company's financial performance, given the significant impact of mark-to-market derivative contracts on the current financial results. 03/14/2024 - 04:27 PM FAIRBANKS, Alaska--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Contango ORE, Inc. (“Contango” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: CTGO) announced today it filed its Form 10-KT for the transition period ended December 31, 2023, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 14, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from June 30th to December 31st, effective as of December 31, 2023. This decision was made to better align the Company’s reporting period with the Company’s 30% equity investment in Peak Gold LLC (the “Peak Gold JV”) and Contango’s peer companies. As a result, this Form 10-KT is a transition report and includes financial information for the transition period from July 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023. In this transition report on Form 10-KT, we include financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2023, which are audited, compared to the financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2022, which are unaudited. The Company reported a net loss of $40.8 million or a loss of $4.44 per basic and diluted share for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023, which includes a non-cash expense of $23.4 million related to a loss on mark-to-market derivative contracts that are calculated based on a forward gold price compared to the contracted hedge price. This compares to a net loss of $21.4 million or a loss of $3.15 per basic and diluted share for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 (unaudited), which included non-cash costs totaling $2.0 million primarily related to share-based compensation expense. The primary reason for the increase in net loss in the 2023 period is due to the Company entering into derivative gold hedging contracts with its lenders in the 2023 period, resulting in an unrealized loss on derivative contracts in the amount of $23.4 million. Additionally, the Company incurred increased interest costs related to the funds drawn down on its secured credit facility in the 2023 period, as well as increased general and administrative costs related to increased retention and severance payments and insurance costs. These were offset by a reduction in exploration expenses at the Lucky Shot project and a reduction in the loss on the Peak Gold JV, which relates to pre-production costs for development and construction at Peak Gold JV’s Manh Choh project that is operated by Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”). During the six-month period ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the following: All closing conditions related to a Credit and Guaranty Agreement with ING Capital LLC and Macquarie Bank Limited for a senior secured loan facility of up to $70 million, of which $65 million is committed subject to certain conditions, to fund the Company’s portion of the pre-production construction and working capital/operating expenditures for the Manh Choh project; Investment of $34.4 million in the Peak Gold JV for expenditures at the Manh Choh project. The Manh Choh project celebrated the commencement of mining operations with a ground-breaking ceremony on August 29, 2023. Construction to date remains on schedule and on budget, with initial production anticipated in the second half of 2024; and An underwritten public offering for gross proceeds of $30.4 million on July 26, 2023. Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Company’s President and CEO, commented, “At the Manh Choh project, construction is essentially completed, on budget and on schedule for initial production in the second half of 2024. Mining activities are well underway, including the commencement of ore mining and stockpiling. Transportation of ore to Fort Knox, where it will be processed, has commenced and will gradually increase throughout the first half of the year. Modifications to the Fort Knox mill continue to progress on schedule and on budget. Construction of the conveyors and associated buildings are planned for the first quarter of 2024, along with interior piping and mechanical installations. The commissioning and operational readiness team for Kinross is in place and preparing for pre-commissioning activities following the mechanical completion of each area. I am extremely pleased with the progress to date and will continue to provide updates on milestones as we approach commencement of production.” ABOUT CONTANGO Contango is a NYSE American listed company that engages in exploration for gold and associated minerals in Alaska.

(the “Company” or “PSI”) (OTC Pink: PSIX), a leader in the design, engineering and manufacture of emission-certified engines and power systems, announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $104.8 million, a decrease of $32.3 million, or 24%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of lower sales of $29.5 million and $16.8 million within the industrial and transportation end markets, respectively, partially offset by an increase of $14.0 million in the power systems end market. Decreased industrial end market sales are primarily due to decreases in demand for products used within the material handling and arbor care markets, as well as being directly affected by the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) which limited the Company’s ability to import certain raw materials at the end of 2023. The decreased sales within the transportation end market were primarily attributable to lower sales in the school bus market as customer products have evolved and new compliance and regulatory requirements have changed engine product offerings. Higher power systems end market sales are primarily due to increased demand for products across various applications, with the largest increases attributable to products used within the demand response market as well as traditional oil and gas products. Gross profit decreased by $1.9 million, or 6%, during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 26.3%, an increase of 4.8% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to improved mix, pricing actions and freight cost management. For both the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, warranty costs were $1.0 million. A majority of the warranty activity is attributable to products sold within the transportation end market in prior years. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during the fourth quarter of 2023 by $0.7 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower legal costs during the period. These decreased costs were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense. Interest expense was $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $4.3 million in the same period in the prior year, largely due to lower average outstanding debt, partially offset by higher overall effective interest rates on the Company’s debt. The Company recorded income tax expense of $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to income tax expense of $0.3 million for the same period in 2022. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 is related primarily to the impact of state income taxes and deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.4 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to net income of $9.3 million, or $0.40 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income was $7.5 million, or Adjusted income per share of $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to Adjusted net income of $10.1 million, or Adjusted income per share of $0.44 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was $12.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $16.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for the Company’s definition of Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the financial tables that accompany this release for reconciliations of these measures to their closest comparable GAAP measures. Debt Update The Company’s total debt was approximately $145.2 million at December 31, 2023, while cash and cash equivalents were approximately $22.8 million. This compares to total debt of approximately $211.0 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.3 million at December 31, 2022. Included in the Company’s total debt at December 31, 2023, were borrowings of $50.0 million under the Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement with Standard Chartered Bank, as the Company paid down $80.0 million during 2023, and borrowings of $25.0 million, $50.0 million, and $19.8 million, under the Second, Third and Fourth Shareholder’s Loan Agreements, respectively, with Weichai America Corp., the Company’s majority stockholder. Management Comments Dino Xykis, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer, commented, “While we were unable to reach the topline revenue goals we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year due to the unforeseen headwinds of the UFLPA and overall market conditions, we are pleased with what we were able to achieve by increasing margins and overall profitability, an accomplishment we would not have been able to achieve without the full support of every individual here at Power Solutions.” Xykis continued, “While some of these topline pressures are expected to continue into 2024, we expect strong growth from the power systems end market to help drive our outlook for the upcoming year.” Outlook for 2024 The Company expects its sales in 2024 to increase by approximately 3% versus 2023 levels, a result of expectations for strong growth in the power systems end market paired with flat sales in the industrial end market and a forecasted reduction in the transportation end markets. Notwithstanding this outlook, which is being driven in part by expectations for continuous improvement in supply chain dynamics, including timelier availability of parts and a continuation of favorable economic conditions within the United States and across the Company’s various markets, the Company cautions that significant uncertainty remains as a result of supply chain challenges, inflationary costs, commodity volatility, and the impact on the global economy of the war in Ukraine, among other factors.

Non-GAAP financial measures provide insight into selected financial information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated below. Non-GAAP Financial MeasureComparable GAAP Financial MeasureAdjusted net incomeNet incomeAdjusted net income per shareNet income per common share – dilutedEBITDANet incomeAdjusted EBITDANet income The Company believes that Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in its industry as well as by the Company’s management in assessing the performance of the Company. Adjusted net income is defined as net income as adjusted for certain items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Adjusted net income per share is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share adjusted for the impact of special items. EBITDA provides the Company with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of other non-cash and certain other items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of the Company’s operations and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share, and Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor because these measures are widely used to evaluate companies’ operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measures, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, the book value of assets, the capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired, among other factors. They are not, however, intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

American Vanguard Reports Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Results,2024-03-14T20:26:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"American Vanguard Corporation (AVD) reports a strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, with net sales of $172.2 million and $579 million, respectively.

The company aims for a transformation target of $15 million additional adjusted EBITDA by 2026 through various business initiatives.","American Vanguard Reports Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary American Vanguard Corporation (AVD) reports a strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, with net sales of $172.2 million and $579 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $21 million, showing a significant increase from $12 million in 2022. The company aims for a transformation target of $15 million additional adjusted EBITDA by 2026 through various business initiatives. Positive Strong financial results for Q4 and full year 2023 Net sales of $172.2 million in Q4 and $579 million for the full year Adjusted EBITDA of $21 million in Q4, up from $12 million in 2022 Targeting 8 to 12% revenue growth in 2024 with a focus on increasing adjusted EBITDA by $15 million by 2026 Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining American Vanguard Corporation's recent financial results reveals a mixed picture. On one hand, the sharp rebound in Q4 is noteworthy, with net sales and net income showing significant improvement over the same quarter of the previous year. This suggests a resilient performance in the face of challenges such as global destocking and competition from Chinese generic products. On the other hand, the full year comparison indicates a decline in net sales and a substantial drop in net income.Investors should be aware that while the Q4 results are promising, the full year figures raise questions about the company's ability to sustain growth and profitability. The CEO's statement about improved demand and solid manufacturing operations in Q4 provides some optimism, but the decline in annual net income from $27.4 million to $7.5 million cannot be overlooked.Furthermore, the adjusted EBITDA target set for 2024, implying a significant increase, suggests that management is confident about their business transformation initiative. However, investors should consider the execution risks associated with such strategic changes, especially since the full benefits are only expected by 2026. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, American Vanguard's performance and strategic initiatives need to be contextualized within the broader agricultural chemicals industry. The company's experience with supply chain issues and the oversupply from Chinese competitors speaks to larger industry trends impacting many players. The company's targeted 8 to 12% revenue growth for the upcoming year is ambitious, considering the full year net sales decline in 2023.Their focus on maintaining strong profit margins and managing operating expenses is a sound strategy, but it remains to be seen how well they can execute this amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties and industry-specific challenges. Investors should monitor how American Vanguard's brand value and operational efficiencies compare to industry peers, as these factors will be critical in achieving their adjusted EBITDA goals. Supply Chain Expert Supply chain resilience has clearly been a major factor for American Vanguard as indicated by their Q4 recovery. The company's ability to navigate the unavailability of their most profitable products due to supply chain disruptions is commendable. However, the reliance on supply chain optimization as a significant component of their transformation initiative suggests that there may be further challenges ahead.Investors should consider the company's plans for digital sub-initiatives and operational improvements as part of their transformation strategy. These areas can be critical levers for improving supply chain efficiency and reducing costs. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives will depend on successful implementation and adaptation to the rapidly changing global supply chain environment. 03/14/2024 - 04:26 PM Sets $15MM Adjusted EBITDA Gain as Transformation Target NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights – versus Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter: Net sales were $172.2 million in 2023, compared to $159.5 million in 2022 Net income was $7.0 million in 2023, compared to $3.9 million in 2022 Earnings per diluted share of $0.25 in 2023, compared to $0.13 in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $21 million in 2023, compared to $12 million in 2022 Fiscal 2023 Full Year Financial Highlights – versus Fiscal 2022 Full Year: Net sales were $579 million in 2023, compared to $610 million in 2022 Net income was $7.5 million in 2023, compared to $27.4 million in 2022 Earnings per diluted share of $0.26 in 2023, compared to $0.92 in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $55 million in 2023, compared to $73 million in 2022 Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: “We rebounded sharply in Q4 after having weathered the effect of global destocking within the distribution channel, the oversupply of Chinese generic products into multiple regions, and the unavailability of our most profitable products due to supply chain issues. Increased demand during Q4 provided evidence that destocking activity continues to subside and that, even while showing greater discipline, procurement within the distribution channel is following more normal patterns. During the quarter, we achieved predicted revenue growth, maintained solid manufacturing operations, sustained strong profit margins by bolstering brand value and strengthened our balance sheet.” Mr. Wintemute concluded: “Looking forward, we believe that our company is situated well in both domestic and international markets and are targeting 8 to 12% revenue growth resulting in a full year adjusted EBITDA range of $70 to $80 million in 2024. We expect gross profit margins to remain strong, operating expenses to be tightly managed, and factory performance to be efficient. In addition, with the assistance of our consultant Kearney, through our business transformation initiative, we are targeting growth of adjusted EBITDA to 15% of net sales or an additional $15 million or more of adjusted EBITDA on a full year basis. The full benefit of the transformation will be realized by 2026 through a combination of operational, commercial, digital, and general and administrative sub-initiatives. We look forward to giving you a detailed presentation during our upcoming earnings call.” Conference Call Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO, Bob Trogele, EVP & COO and David T. Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results and strategic themes at 5:00 pm ET on March 13, 2023.

Positive None. Negative None. Medical Technology Analyst The FDA's 510(k) clearance of the da Vinci 5 robotic system signifies an important milestone for Intuitive and the medical technology industry as a whole. This clearance not only validates the safety and efficacy of the new system but also enables Intuitive to commercialize the product in the U.S. market. The enhancements in precision, imaging and force-sensing technology represent significant advancements in robotic-assisted surgery.From a technology perspective, the increased computing power and data capabilities of da Vinci 5 position Intuitive at the forefront of surgical innovation. The system's integration with various software applications, like the My Intuitive app and SimNow, indicates a push towards a more digital, data-driven surgical environment. This could lead to better surgical outcomes through improved training and real-time data analysis, potentially reducing complications and hospital readmissions.The system's design, focusing on surgeon comfort and workflow efficiency, could also improve operating room turnover times. This is important for hospitals looking to maximize the utilization of their capital investments. However, the cost of upgrading to or acquiring the new system will be a consideration for healthcare facilities, particularly as they weigh the benefits against the substantial investment required. Healthcare Economist Intuitive's release of da Vinci 5 has the potential to disrupt the economic landscape of surgical procedures. The claim of improved patient outcomes and lowered total cost of care is particularly compelling. If substantiated, this could lead to a shift in healthcare spending, with a preference for robotic-assisted surgeries that promise better value for money.However, the initial limited release to select U.S. customers suggests a cautious go-to-market strategy, likely aimed at managing the production scale-up and controlling the quality of the surgical outcomes. This phased approach will provide real-world data that can be leveraged to justify the system's cost to other hospitals and insurers, potentially influencing reimbursement policies.Moreover, the long-term implications of integrating force-sensing technology and advanced data analytics could pave the way for AI-driven surgical enhancements. This might lead to predictive analytics in surgery, further optimizing resource allocation and patient care strategies. Yet, the adoption curve could be steep, as the healthcare industry is typically slow to adopt new technologies due to regulatory and reimbursement hurdles. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM Da Vinci 5 builds on decades of Intuitive technology and millions of robotic proceduresSUNNYVALE, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intuitive (NASDAQ:ISRG), a global technology leader in minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided 510(k) clearance for da Vinci 5, the company’s next-generation multiport robotic system. “We are pleased to receive FDA clearance for our fifth-generation robotic system, da Vinci 5,” said Gary Guthart, CEO. “Intuitive is committed to meaningful improvements in surgery that enable better patient outcomes, enhance the patient and care team experiences, and ultimately lower the total cost of care. After more than a decade of careful research, design, development, and testing, we believe da Vinci 5 will deliver on these goals and help drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery.” Da Vinci 5 builds on Intuitive’s da Vinci Xi’s highly functional design, which surgeons and care teams around the world have used in more than 7 million procedures to date. The system includes more than 150 enhancements, including: Improved accuracy and precision: Da Vinci 5’s design and engineering enhancements, including new surgeon controllers and powerful vibration and tremor controls, make it the smoothest and most precise system Intuitive has developed to date.Next-generation 3D display and image processing: Da Vinci 5 is equipped with Intuitive’s highest quality and most natural 3D imaging system, enabling surgeons to see more today, and supporting future generations of surgical endoscopes and vision software as those technologies evolve.First-of-its-kind force-sensing technology: Da Vinci 5 introduces Force Feedback technology and optional instruments that enable the system to measure, and surgeons to feel, subtle forces exerted on tissue during surgery —something no other surgical technology in any modality offers. In preclinical trials with surgeons at all experience levels, Force Feedback demonstrated up to 43 percent less force exerted on tissue, which may translate to less trauma on tissue. The ability to measure this force adds an important new data stream to surgical data science, which can bring future analytical insights supported through artificial intelligence. Force Feedback instruments, which are optional for use with da Vinci 5, are cleared for use in the same procedures as da Vinci Xi, except pediatric and cardiac procedures, and a specific contraindication for the Force Feedback needle driver for use in suturing during hysterectomy and myomectomy procedures. Meaningful throughput and workflow enhancements: Da Vinci 5 has innovative features that are designed to help increase surgeon autonomy and streamline surgeon and care team workflow. ​For example, da Vinci 5 has integrated key OR technologies, including insufflation and an electrosurgical unit. The system also includes an optimized user interface, with settings that are accessible by the broader surgical team and by the surgeon directly from the head-in menu. Surgeons have access to other key settings while head-in to help them stay focused on the surgical field.Together, these innovations will continue to streamline workflow in the OR and potentially save valuable time, without compromising patient safety. This can enable more efficient use of a hospital’s human and capital resources.Expanded computing power and advanced data capabilities: Da Vinci 5 has more than 10,000 times the computing power of da Vinci Xi. This enables innovative new system capabilities and advanced digital experiences, now and in the future, including integration with Intuitive’s My Intuitive app, SimNow (virtual reality simulator), Case Insights (computational observer), and Intuitive Hub (edge computing system).Greater surgeon comfort: The system features a redesigned console capable of customizable positioning, allowing surgeons to find their best fit for surgical viewing and comfort, including the ability to sit completely upright. The surgeon can make any necessary adjustments while their head is in the console, with options designed to fit different body types, including surgeons who are pregnant. Da Vinci 5 will initially be available to a small number of customers in the U.S. who collaborated with Intuitive during the development period and those with mature robotic surgery programs. Intuitive will work with surgeons at these initial sites to generate additional data on the system’s use before a wider commercial introduction. “We strive to provide customers with technology that meets their needs and solves important problems,” said Intuitive’s Chief Medical Officer, Myriam J. Curet, M.D. “We intend to launch da Vinci 5 more broadly in the U.S. and globally after we learn from and work with an initial smaller number of customers directly.” Da Vinci 5 is the latest addition to the da Vinci family, which includes multiport systems da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi, and the single-port system da Vinci SP. These offer surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable, proven solutions from Intuitive. “We design our systems so we can integrate new functions, capabilities, indications, and instrumentation over time,” said Curet. “Our careful attention to customers’ long-term needs and goals has led our systems to become the hospital standard, and we expect to continue developing and innovating da Vinci 5 and da Vinci Xi over the coming years.” Intuitive will hold a teleconference at 5:45 a.m. PDT on Monday, March 18, 2024, to discuss the da Vinci 5 features and benefits and our launch plans. The call will be webcast and can be accessed on Intuitive’s website at www.intuitive.com or by dialing (844) 291-6362 using the access code 5898411. The webcast replay of the call will be made available on our website at www.intuitive.com within 24 hours after the end of the live teleconference and will be accessible for at least 30 days.

The steel mills segment anticipates an increase in earnings due to higher selling prices and volumes, while the steel products segment expects a decrease. Nucor has repurchased 5.5 million shares and returned $1.13 billion to stockholders. Earnings release is scheduled for April 22, 2024, with a conference call on April 23, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The guidance provided by Nucor Corporation indicates a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share (EPS), moving from $3.16 to a projected range of $3.55 to $3.65. This suggests a positive trajectory for the company's profitability, which could be a result of operational efficiency, cost management, or favorable market conditions. The steel mills segment, in particular, shows promise with expected higher average selling prices and volumes, especially in sheet mills. This might reflect a robust demand for steel products, potentially driven by construction and manufacturing sectors.However, the steel products segment is anticipated to face a decline due to lower selling prices and volumes. This could be indicative of market saturation or increased competition affecting this segment of Nucor's business. The raw materials segment's stability, with DRI facility performance balancing out lower scrap processing margins, suggests a hedged position against market volatility in raw material costs.The share repurchase activity, with 5.5 million shares bought back at an average price of $180.79, signals the company's confidence in its intrinsic value. Additionally, returning $1.13 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends demonstrates a strong commitment to shareholder returns, which is often well-received in the market and can positively influence investor sentiment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the projected EPS increase year-over-year from the first quarter of 2023 to the same period in 2024 shows that Nucor is managing to navigate the economic environment effectively. The specific mention of the performance of the sheet mills within the steel mills segment could point to strategic initiatives that have been undertaken to capitalize on market opportunities or innovations in product offerings.The reported share repurchase program reflects a strategic use of capital that may be seen as a move to optimize shareholder value, particularly when considering the share repurchase price relative to current and historical stock performance. It's important to analyze the repurchase price in the context of the company's valuation metrics such as P/E ratio and compare it to industry benchmarks.The return of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases could be a signal that the company is generating sufficient cash flow and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. It also may suggest that Nucor is currently prioritizing direct shareholder value return over reinvestment or expansion, which could have implications for the company's long-term growth strategy. Steel Industry Expert The steel industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to global economic trends, including construction activity, manufacturing output and commodity prices. The details concerning the steel mills segment's performance, particularly the sheet mills, are significant as they provide insight into the demand for flat steel products, which are extensively used in automotive, appliance and construction industries. The increase in average selling prices and volumes for this segment could be indicative of a recovery or growth in these sectors.Conversely, the expected decrease in the steel products segment could be linked to market-specific challenges such as import competition, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer demand. Understanding the nuances of these market dynamics is essential for stakeholders to assess the sustainability of Nucor's profitability in different segments.The mention of the raw materials segment's performance being comparable to the previous quarter, despite challenges in scrap processing operations, highlights the importance of vertical integration and the ability to control input costs in the steel manufacturing process. This control can be a critical factor in maintaining profitability amidst fluctuating raw material prices. 03/14/2024 - 04:30 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) today announced guidance for its first quarter ending March 30, 2024. Nucor expects first quarter earnings to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65 per diluted share. Nucor reported net earnings of $3.16 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. The steel mills segment's earnings are expected to increase in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher average selling prices and volumes, particularly at our sheet mills. Earnings in the steel products segment are expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2024 due to lower average selling prices and decreased volumes. We expect earnings in the raw materials segment in the first quarter of 2024 to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023 as improved performance of our DRI facilities is offset by lower margins at our scrap processing operations. Quarter-to-date, Nucor has repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares at an average price of $180.79, and has returned approximately $1.13 billion to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.

The data shows Anaphylm's rapid absorption and sustained levels comparable to autoinjectors. The FDA feedback is positive, reaffirming the company's goal of filing NDA by the end of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The pharmacokinetic data presented for Anaphylm, indicating rapid Tmax and comparable AUC to existing autoinjectors, is a significant milestone in drug development. The ability of a sublingual film to match the efficacy profiles of established epinephrine delivery systems could disrupt the current market for emergency anaphylaxis treatments. This innovation offers a needle-free alternative, potentially increasing patient compliance and expanding the addressable market. The positive feedback from the FDA Type C meeting further de-risks the development pathway, suggesting a clearer route to a New Drug Application (NDA). However, the pediatric study's deferral and the FDA's withholding of judgment on the program's sufficiency until further studies are completed introduce elements of uncertainty that could affect the timeline for final approval and market entry. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Aquestive Therapeutics' announcement could be a catalyst for investor interest, as it signifies progress towards a potential first-to-market oral epinephrine treatment. The current reliance on autoinjectors like EpiPen means there's a substantial market for alternatives that offer ease of use and potentially lower costs. Should Anaphylm gain FDA approval, it could capture a significant share of the market and provide a competitive edge over injectable treatments. However, investors should consider the competitive landscape, including potential generic entrants and advancements in alternative delivery technologies, which may influence Anaphylm's market penetration and pricing strategy. Medical Research Analyst The clinical implications of Anaphylm's rapid Tmax could be profound for anaphylaxis management, where every minute can be critical. The favorable safety profile observed, with no serious adverse events reported, is encouraging for patient safety. However, the need for further studies, including the impact of mouth conditions and pediatric trials, highlights that there are still hurdles to overcome before the drug's efficacy and safety profiles are fully understood. The long-term implications for patient outcomes and healthcare costs will depend on the drug's real-world effectiveness and its integration into treatment protocols. 03/14/2024 - 05:23 PM Anaphylm meets all predefined primary and secondary pharmacokinetic endpointsAnaphylm time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is consistently faster than autoinjectorsAnaphylm exposure levels (AUC) are comparable to autoinjectors for 30 minutes after dosing Anaphylm is well-tolerated with no serious adverse events Company receives positive Type C meeting feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the clinical development of Anaphylm Company reaffirms goal of filing NDA before the end of 2024 WARREN, N.J., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQST), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today released positive topline clinical data from its Phase 3 pivotal pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical study of Anaphylm™ (epinephrine) Sublingual Film and findings from the FDA Type C meeting. Anaphylm is the Company’s first and only orally administered epinephrine prodrug product candidate under development for the treatment of severe life-threatening allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. “We are extremely pleased with the pivotal study results as well as our recent FDA interaction,” said Daniel Barber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. “When it comes to treating severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, we often hear from clinicians that rapid absorption of epinephrine at the first sign of symptoms is critical. Our pivotal study indicates that Anaphylm is comparable to the leading autoinjectors immediately following administration and our time to maximum concentration, or Tmax, is faster than the leading autoinjectors. We believe this performance is unprecedented among the alternate delivery options under development and are excited at the potential of Anaphylm as the only oral medicine for treatment of severe allergies.” “In addition, our recent discussions with the FDA remained consistent with our previous interactions,” continued Mr. Barber. “We believe we have a clear understanding of the remaining clinical development steps necessary for a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the second half of the year. Our goal continues to be to file our NDA before the end of 2024 following completion of a positive pre-NDA meeting.” David Golden, M.D., a renowned expert on anaphylaxis and an allergy-immunology consultant at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore, stated, “The data from the Anaphylm pivotal study build on the compelling data generated from the prior Anaphylm pilot studies. These latest study results show that the sublingual administration of epinephrine provides rapid and sustained levels of epinephrine similar to approved treatments. Anaphylm is a promising needle-free alternative to the current standard of care, allowing patients to easily carry and administer this life-saving medication.” Topline Data from Pivotal Phase 3 Study in AdultsThe two-part, Phase 3, single-center, open-label, randomized study was designed to compare the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and repeat doses of Anaphylm versus single and repeat doses of the epinephrine intra-muscular (IM) injection and epinephrine autoinjectors (EpiPen® and Auvi-Q®) in healthy adult subjects. The primary endpoint was to compare the PK of epinephrine following the single administration of Anaphylm to the single administration of Adrenalin (epinephrine IM injection) and autoinjectors in healthy adult subjects. The secondary endpoints included evaluating PK sustainability following repeat administration and the safety and tolerability following single and repeat administrations versus epinephrine IM injection and epinephrine autoinjectors. The single dose part of the Phase 3 study was designed as a four-period, four-treatment, four-sequence, comparative PK study with 64 enrolled adult subjects. As outlined in the presentation posted to the Company’s website and filed with the SEC today, key findings from the single dosing part of the study included that Anaphylm: Achieved a geometric mean Cmax of 470 pg/mL bracketed by epinephrine autoinjectors AUVI-Q at 521 pg/mL and EpiPen at 469 pg/mL,Generated partial AUCs between (bracketed) autoinjectors and Adrenalin manual IM injection from 5 to 60 minutesMaintained a median Tmax of 12 minutes compared to 20 minutes for EpiPen, 30 minutes for AUVI-Q, and 50 minutes for Adrenalin,Produced a meaningful change from baseline pharmacodynamic measures of blood pressure and heart rate at the first tracked time point of 2 minutes, andWas consistently well tolerated with no SAEs. The repeat dosing part of the Phase 3 study was designed as a three-period, three-treatment, six sequence, comparative PK study with 36 enrolled adult subjects. As outlined in the presentation posted to the website and filed with the SEC, the key findings from the repeat dosing part of the Study included that Anaphylm: Maintains epinephrine plasma concentrations equal to or greater than existing injection products at all but 1 timepoint out to 2 hours,Demonstrated a median Tmax of 10 minutes after administration of the second dose,Exhibited consistent pharmacodynamics, andWas consistently well tolerated with no SAEs. FDA Type C MeetingThe Company also successfully completed a Type C meeting with the FDA that addressed open items from the November 2022 End-of-Phase 2 meeting including addressing (1) the impact of any product hold time, (2) the potential for emesis (vomiting), and (3) the impact of potential mouth conditions such as angioedema (swelling). In response to these questions, the FDA indicated that the Company has “adequately addressed” the FDA’s previous concerns by removing product hold time from the administration instructions and provided additional information on how to characterize emesis in the Company’s NDA submission. Regarding mouth conditions, the FDA recommended administering Anaphylm after oral exposure to a known allergen and assessing PK performance thereunder. The Company will execute this study in the second quarter of 2024. This study will replace the Company’s previously planned angioedema study. The FDA noted that substantial progress had been made in the Anaphylm clinical development program and did not outline any new clinical development requirements. As expected, the FDA reiterated that, as with other epinephrine programs under development, concentrations of epinephrine above known EpiPen levels must be justified from a safety perspective, and PK sustainability remains a focus. Furthermore, the FDA recommended that Aquestive begin its pediatric study after completion of the remaining adult studies. The Company is aligned with this recommendation from the FDA. The FDA reserved judgement on the sufficiency of the Anaphylm clinical development program until completion of ongoing and planned studies, the results of which are expected to be presented at the pre-NDA meeting.

About AnaphylaxisAnaphylaxis is a serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction with that is rapid in onset and potentially fatal. As many as 49 million people in the United States are at chronic risk for anaphylaxis. Lifetime prevalence is at least 5%, or more than 16 million people in the United States. Direct costs of anaphylaxis have been estimated at $1.2 billion per year, with direct expenditures of $294 million for epinephrine, and indirect costs of $609 million. The frequency of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has increased 500–700% in the last 10–15 years. Of patients who previously experienced anaphylaxis, 52% had never received an epinephrine auto-injector prescription, and 60% did not have an auto-injector currently available. The most common causes of anaphylaxis are foods (such as peanuts), venom from insect stings, and medications. Epinephrine injection is the current standard of treatment intended to reverse the severe manifestation of anaphylaxis, which may include skin rash, throat swelling, respiratory difficulty, gastrointestinal distress, and loss of consciousness. About Anaphylm™ Anaphylm is a polymer matrix-based epinephrine prodrug candidate product. The product is similar in size to a postage stamp, weighs less than an ounce, and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration.

The STAR-T trial results were chosen for a Breakout Presentation at the AATS Annual Meeting. Plans to submit DrugSorb-ATR for regulatory approval to the FDA and Health Canada in 2024. Negative Q4 2023 saw a decrease in total revenue by 8% compared to Q4 2022. Total product sales in Q4 2023 decreased by 4% compared to Q4 2022. Core CytoSorb sales in Q4 2023 dropped by 1% compared to Q4 2022. Cost of revenue remained stable at approximately $13.9 million for both 2023 and 2022. Financial Analyst The detailed financial performance of CytoSorbents Corporation, as outlined, paints a picture of a company navigating the post-pandemic economic landscape with a degree of resilience. The reported 10% year-over-year growth in core sales, excluding COVID-19 related sales, indicates a stable demand for the company's non-pandemic products. This growth, coupled with an increase in product gross margins from 70% to 72%, suggests an improvement in operational efficiency. However, the decrease in total revenue and product sales during Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 raises questions about the sustainability of growth and the impact of external factors such as exchange rates on revenue.Furthermore, the company's strategic focus on submitting DrugSorb-ATR for regulatory approval and the anticipated launch of the PuriFi hemoperfusion pump are strategic moves that could significantly affect future revenues. While the company's cash position, cost-cutting measures and manufacturing optimizations are reassuring, investors should monitor the execution of these initiatives closely, as they are pivotal to the company's growth trajectory. Medical Research Analyst The selection of the STAR-T trial results for a Breakout Presentation at the prestigious AATS Annual Meeting underscores the scientific community's interest in CytoSorbents' DrugSorb-ATR technology. The focus on the isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery subpopulation, where reduced bleeding complications were observed, highlights a potential niche market for the company's product. However, the primary effectiveness endpoint not being met in the overall patient population warrants a cautious interpretation of the results.The extended CE Mark under the MDD and the strategic partnership in India are notable developments that could expand the company's international footprint. The potential shift in the market preference towards ticagrelor, especially with its upcoming generic status, may open up new opportunities for DrugSorb-ATR. Nevertheless, the actual impact on sales will depend on regulatory approvals, market adoption rates and the ability to compete with existing therapies. Market Research Analyst The company's performance within the context of the broader medical device and blood purification market is of interest. While CytoSorbents has demonstrated a steady increase in product gross margins, the overall modest increase in total revenue suggests that the market for their products is stable but not rapidly expanding. The emphasis on cost control and efficiency improvements is a common strategy in this sector, especially post-COVID, as companies adjust to new market realities.The upcoming regulatory submissions and product launches are critical strategic steps that could redefine the company's market positioning. The anticipated launch of the PuriFi hemoperfusion pump, in particular, could provide a competitive edge in markets with less developed dialysis capabilities. The potential healthcare reform in Germany may present both challenges and opportunities, as it could lead to an increased focus on therapies for sicker patients and complex operations, aligning well with CytoSorbents' product offerings. 03/14/2024 - 04:39 PM STAR-T trial results selected for a Breakout Presentation at the American Association of Thoracic Surgery Annual Meeting in late-April 2024 CytoSorbents intends to submit DrugSorb-ATR for regulatory approval to U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada this year CytoSorb core sales increased approximately 10% year-over-year 2023 Product gross margins increased to 72% Cumulative CytoSorb treatments surpassed 228,000 PRINCETON, N.J., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO), a leader in the treatment of life-threatening conditions in the intensive care unit and cardiac surgery using blood purification via its proprietary polymer adsorption technology, today reported financial and operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and provides its 2024 outlook.

We expect to follow this event with an Analyst and Investor Day and provide a review of the data by an esteemed thought leader panelWe plan to submit for regulatory approval of DrugSorb®-ATR to the FDA and Health Canada in the second half of 2024 to reduce the severity of bleeding in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery on the blood thinner, Brilinta®. This follows the prior discussion of topline study results in December 2023, and subsequent additional data analysis from the STAR-T TrialOur European Union CE Mark for CytoSorb was extended under the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) to the earlier of either December 2028 or when we achieve E.U. Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification, which effort is currently ongoingEntered into a new strategic partnership and temporary distribution agreement in India for CytoSorb with the publicly-traded Indian pharmaceutical company, Eris Lifesciences, following its definitive agreement with Biocon Biologics to acquire Biocon’s Nephrology branded formulations business unit, and with it, Biocon’s key leadership and field force of these businesses, including the personnel commercializing CytoSorb in IndiaExpecting to launch our new PuriFi stand-alone hemoperfusion pump later this year following the expiration of our previously disclosed distribution agreement with Nikkiso Europe GmbH for its PureAdjust® hemoperfusion pump in September 2023 Dr. Phillip Chan, Chief Executive Officer of CytoSorbents stated, “In 2024, we are intent on providing clarity to investors on the key factors that will determine the near-term and future success of this Company. These include visibility on submission of DrugSorb-ATR for regulatory approval to U.S. FDA and Health Canada this year, returning to significant growth in our core existing CytoSorb business outside the U.S. and Canada, continued improvements in product gross margins coupled with a right-sized operating expense structure, and adequately financing CytoSorbents for success.” STAR-T Update The pivotal, U.S. and Canadian STAR-T (Safe and Timely Antithrombotic Removal – Ticagrelor) randomized controlled trial was designed to support FDA and Health Canada marketing approval for DrugSorb®-ATR to reduce the risk of perioperative bleeding in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery potentially caused by Brilinta® (ticagrelor, AstraZeneca). Our technology has received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for this application, highlighting the major unmet medical need and lack of approved or cleared therapies for this problem. Following the completion of the STAR-T trial last year, we announced topline data from the study in December 2023 as follows: The independent STAR-T Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) conducted a review of unblinded data on all 140 patients in the trial and concluded there were no issues with device safety, meeting the primary safety endpoint of the studyFollowing initial data analysis from STAR-T, the primary effectiveness endpoint in the overall patient population that underwent different types of cardiac surgeries was not met. However, in the pre-specified subpopulation of patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery that accounted for more than 90% of patients enrolled in the STAR-T trial and also represent the main use case for DrugSorb®-ATR, we observed evidence of reduced bleeding complications, including serious bleeding events. We have since performed additional analyses of our trial data in the isolated CABG population and believe the results further support the favorable benefit-to-risk profile of DrugSorb-ATR in these patients who represent the overwhelming majority facing this clinical unmet need. We are pleased at the selection of the STAR-T trial for a breakout presentation at the 104th Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, described as the world’s most prestigious cardiothoracic surgery event. This year, the meeting will be in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA), who are often managing blood product usage due to intraoperative bleeding during surgical procedures. In general, this conference is targeted towards cardiothoracic surgeons and physicians in related specialties; perfusionists; non-physician health care providers involved in the care of cardiothoracic surgical patients; as well as fellows, residents, and medical students in cardiothoracic surgery. These are the stakeholders who directly witness and need to manage the perioperative bleeding complications of their patients on blood thinners and who would use DrugSorb-ATR in clinical practice. Shortly after AATS, we plan to host an Analyst and Investor Day to share these data with participants, who will then be able to evaluate the benefit-risk proposition of DrugSorb-ATR. Our data give us confidence in our decision to submit for regulatory approval to U.S. FDA and Health Canada, estimated in the second-half of 2024. For an interesting discussion on therapies seeking FDA approval in our situation, see page 3 of this report from Zacks Research. Although we cannot predict the outcome of a regulatory submission, should DrugSorb-ATR be approved in both the U.S. and Canada only for patients undergoing isolated CABG, we believe the initial total addressable market opportunity remains relatively intact at approximately $325 million initially, and may expand significantly as ticagrelor (aka Brilinta®, AstraZeneca) becomes generic this year and potentially displaces generic clopidogrel (aka Plavix®, BMS/Sanofi) in the market as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor in patients with acute coronary syndromes based on both the superior efficacy data over clopidogrel and the ability to be removed in cases where urgent CABG is required (due to DrugSorb-ATR). 2023 Sales Highlights 2023 was a reasonable recovery year of progress and growth, where core (non-COVID-19) CytoSorb sales grew roughly 10% over the prior year. This was particularly true coming off of a challenging 2022 that we described last year as a “perfect storm” of geopolitical, economic, post-pandemic, and company-specific factors. That said, the results understate some of the excellent progress we are making to grow and diversify our revenue base, based upon our long-term growth strategy and investment commitments to support our hybrid sales model. Strong performance from our International Direct sales division (representing 14 countries, excluding Germany) resulted in 27% sales growth year-over-year to approximately $6.0 million, or 19% of 2023 product salesDistributor and Partner sales (representing more than 60 countries) grew 18% (excluding U.S. dsitributor sales in 2022) in the first three quarters of 2023 over the prior year. Based on our stand-alone pump initiative that is expected to catalyze sales of CytoSorb in countries with less developed dialysis capabilities, we had budgeted higher growth in Q4 for this division. For a number of different reasons, it became clear that Nikkiso’s PureAdjust® hemoperfusion machine was not the long-term solution for our stand-alone pump initiative and we mutually agreed to not renew our distributor agreement in September 2023. We pivoted to an alternative strategy, focused on the launch of our own hemoperfusion machine called Purifi that we expect to launch later this year. Anticipation of this machine, however, led to some order slippage from distributors to the new year, resulting in lower than expected Q4 2023 sales overall. For the year, Distributor and Partner sales grew 9% (excluding U.S. distributor sales in 2022) to $12.1 million, or 39% of 2023 product salesDirect Sales Germany was flat at 3% growth to $13.0 million for the year, or 42% of 2023 product sales. German hospitals are still working through the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic with staff shortages, decreased hospital beds, fewer patients, and fewer revenue generating procedures, and economic stressors such as inflation, labor, energy, and other unexpected costs. Notwithstanding this market backdrop, the costs and challenges that physicians and healthcare workers continue to face in the management of critical illness and cardiac surgery are real. Given the numerous applications, both old and new, that our products can help to address, and other initiatives such as our preferred supplier agreement with the largest private hospital networks in Germany, we believe there are many opportunities to return to significant growth in the country. That said, we are currently tracking a proposal for healthcare reform of Germany’s hospital system. In July 2023, Germany’s federal and state governments issued a consensus white paper that could result in new laws that change how hospitals are funded. Government payments to hospitals would de-emphasize the DRG (diagnosis-related group) “lump sum” payment system that incentivizes revenue generation through more patients treated and procedures performed, and instead emphasize base payments focused on quality measures and appropriate patient care. This is expected to favor a shift of routine operations and procedures to outpatient centers, consolidation of smaller hospitals into larger ones, and importantly, an increased focus of remaining hospitals on sicker patients, more complex operations such as cardiothoracic surgery and organ transplant, and on therapies that help reduce the severity of illness and help patients recover faster. Given that the goal of our therapies is to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the costs of critical care and cardiac surgery by controlling deadly inflammation and other life-threatening conditions, while reducing the need for expensive life support measures that keep patients in the hospital, we believe such reform may favor our business in the longer-term. Hospital administrators expect such change will take careful planning and time, potentially years, to implement. We continue to track these developments with interest. As we discussed in the last earnings release, we believe we can return to and potentially even exceed our historic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25%. We outlined a number of macro trends in healthcare that favor our therapies, such as the aging population that is prone to critical illness, the use of blood thinners by millions of people worldwide to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack, and the epidemic of chronic liver disease that afflicts one in every five people globally. Meanwhile, we also discussed our numerous growth initiatives, like our stand-alone pump intiative with the pending launch of our own PuriFi machine, the impact that supportive data from STAR-T may have on the blood thinner opportunity worldwide, our global marketing agreement with Fresenius Medical Care where CytoSorb is the featured solution for cytokine, bilirubin, and myoglobin removal on its critical care platforms worldwide, our new E.U. trademark of “Expanding the Dimension of Blood Purification®” that highlights the up to 40-50% of patients in the ICU where our therapies could be beneficial, and relatively “new” applications with exciting recently published clinical data in fields such as artificial liver support, fluid balance in septic shock, infective endocarditis, heart transplant, ex vivo organ perfusion – particularly lung transplant, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the effect of CytoSorb on gram negative endotoxin-induced cytokine storm – a major cause of septic shock. Reduced Cash Burn with Tight Control Over Expenses Following our equity financing in December, we ended the year with $15.6 million in cash, including $1.5 million in restricted cash, and $5 million in debt. We have implemented significant cost cutting measures to significantly reduce our cash burn, including a 15% reduction-in-force, termination of non-core R&D programs, termination of the STAR-D trial to focus on STAR-T, and a third consecutive year of salary freezes for executive management. The benefit of these cost cuts on operating expenses, particularly our headcount reductions, will become more apparent with time as notice periods and severance payments are completed. Finally, we have worked diligently to optimize our manufacturing efficiencies and expect CytoSorb product gross margins to be in the 75-80% range on a quarterly basis this year, after averaging 72% in 2023. Dr. Chan concluded, “We believe the successful execution of our strategy will form the basis of a strong turnaround of our business and position us well for strong growth and profitability in the next several years. We thank you for your continued support.” Conference Call Details: Date: Thursday, March 14th, 2024Time: 4:30 PM Eastern TimeParticipant Dial-In: (888) 596-4144Conference ID: 5329219Live Presentation Webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/tgivev9aParticipants are recommended to dial in approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

Results of Operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Revenues: For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated total revenue, which includes product revenue and grant income, of approximately $36,349,000 as compared to revenues of approximately $34,689,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $1,660,000, or 5%. Revenue from CytoSorb product sales was approximately $31,015,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to approximately $28,573,000 in the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2,442,000, or 9%. Other product revenue was approximately $70,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $787,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $717,000. COVID-19 product sales were $0 in 2023 and approximately $300,000 in 2022. Direct sales increased by approximately $928,000, or 5% and distributor sales increased by approximately $797,000, or 7% during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar also positively impacted 2023 product sales by approximately $780,000. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the average exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.08 as compared to an average exchange rate of $1.05 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Grant income was approximately $5,264,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to approximately $5,329,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $65,000, or 1%. Cost of Revenue: For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cost of revenue was approximately $13,957,000 and $13,956,000, respectively. Grant cost of revenue increased approximately $41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Product cost of revenues decreased approximately $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Product gross margins were approximately 72% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and approximately 70% for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to inefficiencies related to the relocation of our production activities to our new manufacturing facility in Princeton, New Jersey during the year ended December 31, 2022, that did not recur in 2023. Gross Profit: Gross profit was approximately $22,392,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of approximately $1,659,000 or 8%, versus gross profit of $20,733,000 in 2022. This increase is attributed to increased sales and the increase in product gross margin percentage as discussed above. Research and Development Expenses: Our research and development costs were approximately $15,729,000 and $15,119,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of approximately $610,000, or 4%. This increase was related to approximately $850,000 of costs incurred related to pre-production manufacturing activities required to bring the new manufacturing plant to a state of commercial readiness and approximately $720,000 of costs related to pre-commercialization activities related to DrugSorb ATR. These increases were offset by a decrease in clinical trial related costs of approximately $940,000, due primarily to the termination of our STAR-D clinical trial in the U.S., and other non-grant related research and development costs of approximately $20,000. Legal, Financial and Other Consulting Expenses: Our legal, financial and other consulting costs were approximately $4,272,000 and $2,848,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of approximately $1,424,000, or 50%. This increase was due to an increase in legal fees of approximately $1,010,000 due to the abandonment of certain issued patents and patent applications, fees related to Company’s equity transactions and the settlement of a litigation matter; an increase in employment agency fees of approximately $178,000 related to the hiring of certain management personnel, an increase in consulting fees of approximately $179,000 related to regulatory matters on DrugSorb-ATR and an increase in accounting fees of approximately $57,000. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Our selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $33,600,000 and $34,288,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of approximately $688,000, or 2%. This decrease was due to a decrease in sales and marketing costs, which include advertising and conference attendance, of approximately $839,000, a decrease in royalty expense of approximately $109,000, a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense (which includes both stock options and restricted stock units) of approximately $115,000, a decrease in commercial insurance of approximately $165,000 and a decrease in public relations costs of approximately $135,000. These decreases were offset by an increase in salaries, commissions, and related costs of approximately $532,000 and an increase in other general and administrative costs of approximately $143,000. Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately $1,949,000, as compared to a loss on foreign currency transactions of approximately $2,449,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 2023 gain is directly related to the increase of the exchange rate of the Euro as of December 31, 2023, as compared to December 31, 2022. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.11 per Euro as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.07 per Euro at December 31, 2022. The 2022 loss is directly related to the decrease in the exchange rate of the Euro as of December 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.07 per Euro as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $1.14 per Euro at December 31, 2021. Benefit from Income Taxes: Our benefit from income taxes was approximately $814,000 and $1,093,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These benefits were realized by utilizing the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program whereby the State of New Jersey allows us to sell a portion of our state net operating losses to a third party. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, our operations have been primarily financed through the issuance of debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2023, we had current assets of approximately $25.7 million and current liabilities of approximately $14.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, $25 million of our total shelf amount was allocated to our ATM facility, of which approximately $20.3 million remained available. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 2,656,464 shares pursuant to the Sale Agreement, at an average selling price of $1.76 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $4,532,000. In April of 2023, we received approximately $1,000,000 in cash from the approved sale of our net operating losses and research and development credits from the State of New Jersey. In March of 2024, we received approximately $880,000 in cash from the approved sale of our net operating losses and research and development credits from the State of New Jersey. On December 13, 2023, the Company closed on a registered direct offering for the sale, directly to investors, of 7,733,090 shares of registered common stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,706,561 shares of common stock (the “Offering”). Each share of common stock and accompanying warrant to purchase up to 0.35 shares of common stock, were sold together for a combined purchase price of $1.33, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $10,285,000. After deducting transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company in connection with the Offering, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $9,785,000, excluding any proceeds that may be received upon the exercise of the warrants. Each warrant is immediately cash exercisable at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the issue date. We are also managing our resources proactively, continuing to invest in key areas such as our U.S. and Canadian pivotal STAR-T trial, which includes the detailed analysis of trial data and the preparation of our application for marketing approval to the U.S. FDA and Health Canada. We have also instituted and continue to maintain tight control over expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $15.6 million in cash, including approximately $14.1 million and $1.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash, respectively. We believe this is sufficient to fund the Company’s operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. We will need to raise additional capital to support our ongoing operations in the future, and the Company is actively pursuing financing sources, including less or non-dilutive debt financing, royalty financing, strategic or direct investments, equity financing, and/or combinations thereof. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in these endeavors.About CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO) CytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in the treatment of life-threatening conditions in the intensive care unit and in cardiac surgery through blood purification. Its lead product, CytoSorb®, is approved in the European Union and distributed in 75 countries worldwide. It is an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber that reduces “cytokine storm” or “cytokine release syndrome” in common critical illnesses that can lead to massive inflammation, organ failure and patient death. In these diseases, the risk of death can be extremely high, and there are few, if any, effective treatments. CytoSorb is also used during and after cardiothoracic surgery to remove antithrombotic drugs and inflammatory mediators that can lead to postoperative complications, including severe bleeding and multiple organ failure. At the end of 2023, more than 228,000 CytoSorb devices had been used cumulatively. CytoSorb was originally launched in the European Union under CE mark as the first cytokine adsorber. Additional CE mark extensions were granted for bilirubin and myoglobin removal in clinical conditions such as liver disease and trauma, respectively, and for ticagrelor and rivaroxaban removal in cardiothoracic surgery procedures. CytoSorb has also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in the United States for use in adult critically ill COVID-19 patients with impending or confirmed respiratory failure. The DrugSorb™-ATR antithrombotic removal system, based on the same polymer technology as CytoSorb, also received two FDA Breakthrough Device Designations, one for the removal of ticagrelor and another for the removal of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) apixaban and rivaroxaban in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during urgent cardiothoracic procedures. The Company has completed the FDA-approved, randomized, controlled STAR-T (Safe and Timely Antithrombotic Removal-Ticagrelor) study of 140 patients at approximately 30 centers in U.S. and Canada to evaluate whether intraoperative use of DrugSorb-ATR can reduce the perioperative risk of bleeding in patients receiving ticagrelor and undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. This pivotal study is intended to support U.S. FDA and Health Canada marketing approval for DrugSorb-ATR in this application. CytoSorbents’ purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Its technologies have received non-dilutive grant, contract, and other funding of approximately $50 million from DARPA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Air Force Material Command (USAF/AFMC), and others. The Company has numerous marketed products and products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology protected by many issued U.S. and international patents and registered trademarks, and multiple patent applications pending, including ECOS-300CY®, CytoSorb-XL™, HemoDefend-RBC™, HemoDefend-BGA™, VetResQ®, K+ontrol™, DrugSorb™, ContrastSorb, and others.

Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation Announces Common and Preferred Dividends for the First Quarter 2024,2024-03-14T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (CHMI) declares dividends for the first quarter of 2024, with $0.15 per share for common stock, $0.5125 per share for Series A Preferred Stock, and $0.515625 per share for Series B Preferred Stock.","Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation Announces Common and Preferred Dividends for the First Quarter 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (CHMI) declares dividends for the first quarter of 2024, with $0.15 per share for common stock, $0.5125 per share for Series A Preferred Stock, and $0.515625 per share for Series B Preferred Stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of dividends by Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation represents a tangible return to shareholders and is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health. The dividend payout, especially in a consistent manner, can be an attractive feature for income-focused investors. It's important to analyze the dividend yield, which is calculated by annualizing the dividend and dividing by the stock's price. This metric helps in comparing the income-generating potential of CHMI's stock relative to others in the market.Moreover, the sustainability of these dividends is critical. Investors should examine the company's earnings, payout ratio and free cash flow to assess whether the dividends are supported by strong financials or if they might be at risk in the future. A payout ratio that exceeds earnings consistently could signal future cuts in dividends or the need for the company to raise additional capital. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements can influence investor sentiment and stock performance. In the case of Cherry Hill, the declaration of dividends for both common and preferred stock could be seen as a positive signal, potentially leading to an increased demand for CHMI shares. However, the market's reaction will also depend on how these dividends compare to the company's historical payouts and those offered by competitors within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector.It's also worth noting the difference in dividend amounts between the common stock and the preferred stock, which is typical due to the preferential treatment given to preferred shareholders. The impact on the stock market will largely hinge on whether these dividends meet, exceed, or fall short of market expectations. Additionally, the fixed-to-floating rate nature of the Series B Preferred Stock indicates a potential interest rate hedge for investors, which could be appealing in varying economic climates. Economist Dividend policy can reflect broader economic conditions. For instance, a stable or increasing dividend might suggest that Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation is experiencing favorable conditions within the housing and credit markets, which are essential for REITs. Conversely, if the macroeconomic environment were to deteriorate, leading to increased mortgage delinquencies or a decline in real estate values, this could put pressure on the company's ability to maintain its dividend levels.Furthermore, the current interest rate environment plays a role in the attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, such stocks can be more appealing than fixed-income alternatives, but as interest rates rise, the competition for investor capital intensifies. Investors should consider how shifts in monetary policy may impact the yield spread between CHMI's dividends and safer bond investments. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM FARMINGDALE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (NYSE: CHMI) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.15 per share on the Company’s common stock for the first quarter of 2024.

Key accomplishments include acquiring AI-ECG algorithms from Mount Sinai, FDA pathway changes, and enhanced team recruitment. The company aims to lead the AI-ECG market with improved financials, extended cash runway, and clinical advancements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report from Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. highlights a significant transformation in their financial health between the second and third quarters of FY2024. With a shift from a deficit to a positive shareholders' equity of $8.6 million and a cash position of $7.1 million, the company has strengthened its financial stability. This is a critical factor for investors as it suggests an improved ability to sustain operations and invest in growth without immediate need for additional financing. The successful capital raise of $9.2 million and debt-to-equity conversion of $1.1 million reflect investor confidence and a strategic move to improve the balance sheet. However, the lack of significant revenue in Q3 FY2024 is a point of concern, indicating that the company is still in a pre-commercial stage. The valuation of the intangible asset at $1.6 million, resulting from the license agreements with Mount Sinai, should be scrutinized for its potential future income generation versus the cost incurred. Medical Research Analyst HeartSciences' strategic shift to expand its AI-ECG algorithm portfolio and the decision to pursue a 510(k) FDA pathway for its MyoVista® device are pivotal for its operational strategy. The clinical relevance of this change is substantial as it suggests a potentially faster and more cost-effective route to market, which is particularly important for medical technology firms. The completed patient recruitment for the MyoVista validation study and the company's anticipation of quick clinical validation post-algorithm update are positive indicators of progress towards commercialization. Furthermore, the peer-reviewed publication demonstrating the efficacy of the MyoVista AI-ECG model in screening diabetic patients offers a glimpse into the clinical impact and market potential, considering the vast global prevalence of diabetes. The enhanced team and advisory board with expertise in cardiology and data science are poised to add value to the company's FDA regulatory progress and operational execution. Market Research Analyst HeartSciences' strategic pivot to a cloud-based, hardware-agnostic platform for delivering AI-ECG solutions represents a forward-thinking approach to capturing market share in the cardiovascular diagnostic space. This flexibility allows for integration with existing ECG devices used worldwide, potentially accelerating adoption across various healthcare settings. The acquisition of a portfolio of AI-ECG algorithms from a reputable institution like Mount Sinai not only diversifies the company's offerings but also infuses credibility into their technology. The emphasis on operational execution and rapid market entry is critical in the highly competitive med-tech industry. The focus on heart disease screening, particularly in high-risk populations such as diabetics, aligns with a growing market need for early detection and prevention strategies, which could lead to substantial growth opportunities for HeartSciences if their solutions are adopted on a large scale. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Southlake, TX, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heart Test Laboratories, Inc. d/b/a HeartSciences (Nasdaq: HSCS; HSCSW) (""HeartSciences"" or the ""Company""), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered medical technology company focused on transforming ECGs/EKGs to save lives through earlier detection of heart disease, today reported financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2024 ended January 31, 2024 and provided a business update. Q3 FY2024 and Recent Accomplishments HeartSciences has seen a fundamental change in its business opportunity since the end of the second fiscal quarter, with material improvements to its financial position and outlook. A summary of the main changes and business highlights during Q3 FY2024 and to date include: Strategic shift from a Company with a single-device, single-algorithm to one with a broad portfolio of AI-ECG cardiovascular algorithms to be delivered via a cloud-based hardware agnostic platform. Enables the Company to provide AI-ECG solutions in any care setting worldwide in a manner that best suits different providers, either via one of the millions of ECG’s currently in clinical use or via our proprietary MyoVista® wavECG™ device; Secured a robust AI-ECG pipeline through the acquisition of licenses for an industry leading portfolio of AI-ECG algorithms, technologies and patent rights from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York (Mount Sinai). Mount Sinai became the Company’s largest shareholder as a result of the acquisition; FDA pathway for the MyoVista® device changed to 510(k). Now expect that the 510(k) pathway and use of retrospective data will apply to the cloud-platform and Mount Sinai AI-ECG algorithms, which will facilitate a quicker and more cost-effective regulatory path to commercialization;Significantly strengthened both the employee base and broader team to provide for more rapid and effective operational execution: Recruited a new VP of Clinical and Regulatory and engaged a new FDA advisory firm, with specific experience delivering a 510(k) cleared AI-ECG algorithm;Recruited a senior software project director and engaged a leading software developer to develop the AI-ECG cloud-platform, on which work has already started;Strengthened our scientific advisory board with the addition of data scientists and cardiologists and broadened our overall scientific and clinical relationships; Diligent, methodical progress towards FDA submission of the MyoVista and incorporated AI-ECG algorithm: Patient recruitment and core-lab work for the MyoVista validation study has been completed;Following the FDA’s agreement for HeartSciences to adjust the echocardiographic measurement thresholds for older patients of the first MyoVista® AI-ECG algorithm (to increase clinical value), the Company is updating the algorithm to the modified thresholds in collaboration with Mount Sinai. Once complete, clinical validation is expected to take place relatively quickly, ahead of the overall MyoVista FDA submission.The Company continues to target FDA clearance for the MyoVista® around calendar year end 2024; Further clinical validation of MyoVista technology from a peer-reviewed publication with data demonstrating that screening for heart disease in diabetic patients using a MyoVista AI-ECG model significantly outperformed conventional screening standards of care. Diabetes represents a major risk factor for heart disease and affects approximately 500 million people worldwide;Significantly improved financial position. The Q3 FY2024 shareholders’ equity was $8.6 million, compared to a $1.6 million deficit in Q2 FY2024, and cash was $7.1 million, compared to $0.1 million in 2Q FY2024, providing a longer cash runway to make material business progress. Management Commentary Andrew Simpson, CEO of HeartSciences, commented, ""Our vision is that AI-ECG will transform cardiovascular medicine by providing a much more effective tool for heart disease screening in front-line healthcare settings. Heart disease represents the most significant disease burden and cost in healthcare and is the leading cause of death. Today, the major challenge is early identification, as heart disease is only generally symptomatic at an advanced stage which, in turn, negatively affects patient health and increases treatment costs. Our aim is to ensure HeartSciences is a leader in the AI-ECG market.” “We recognize the importance of operational execution and getting to market as quickly as possible. Since the end of Q2 FY2024, we have successfully completed a series of actions that have materially strengthened the Company, placing us in a far better position than ever before. We have significantly improved our financial position and cash runway, alleviating many of the operational and financial constraints we faced in 2023, enabling us to focus on key operational milestones,” added Mr. Simpson. “We licensed a broad range of AI-ECG algorithms and IP from Mount Sinai for key cardiovascular indications. We expect this will save years of R&D and millions of dollars in data acquisition and algorithm development costs as well as providing us with the ability to develop a AI-ECG cloud-platform in addition to the MyoVista.” continued Mr. Simpson. “We also materially bolstered our team through key internal and external consulting hires, as well as making important additions to our scientific advisory board to ensure more effective regulatory progress. Finally, we saw continued expansion of our extensive patent portfolio amidst a regular flow of positive developments including: (i) the establishment of a screening program for Irish Garda (police) officers in Ireland using MyoVista; (ii) recent publication of a study to estimate the health economic impact of the AI-ECG algorithm intervention to detect low ejection, which aids in establishing appropriate reimbursement rates; and (iii) recent peer-reviewed publication demonstrating that in screening of diabetic patients for heart disease using MyoVista technology was superior to existing standards-of-care. We are off to an exciting start to 2024 and look forward to diligent progress on our targeted initiatives to bring AI-ECG to the clinical community.” Mr. Simpson concludes. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results There were no significant revenues in the third quarter fiscal 2024. As of January 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $7.1 million and shareholders’ equity was approximately $8.6 million. During the third quarter fiscal 2024, the Company raised $9.2 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock and converted $1.1 million of debt to equity. Further, HeartSciences issued common stock to Mount Sinai in connection with entering into a series of license agreements which resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of $1.6 million. Complete financial results have been filed in the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q with Securities Exchange Commission and is available on the Company’s website.

CEO Ryan Greenawalt emphasized the success of Alta's diversified growth strategy and positive outlook for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Alta Equipment Group Inc.'s announcement of a 21.7% increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter and a 19.4% increase for the full year is a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory. The expansion in both the Construction and Material Handling segments suggests a robust demand in these markets. However, the reported net loss of $(2.7) million, an increase from $(1.5) million the previous year, raises concerns about the company's profitability despite top-line growth. The increase in gross profit by 20.0% is positive, but investors should consider the rise in general and administrative expenses by 18.6%, which could be diluting the impact of revenue growth on the bottom line.The company's strategy of growth through acquisitions has contributed significantly to revenues and Adjusted EBITDA, which is a positive sign for investors looking at the company's ability to integrate and leverage new assets. However, the increased interest expenses, particularly a 136.4% increase in interest expense related to floor plan payable – new equipment, suggest that the company's leverage and associated costs are also growing. This could be a point of concern for long-term financial health and warrants close monitoring.The guidance for 2024 with an expected Adjusted EBITDA between $207.5 million and $217.5 million reflects management's confidence in continued growth. However, given the current net losses, investors should be cautious and look for improvements in net income as a sign of sustainable growth. Market Research Analyst The material handling and construction equipment markets are evidently experiencing a period of strong growth, as indicated by Alta's revenue increases in these segments. The company's focus on high-margin parts and service business, which saw a 17.7% revenue increase, aligns with industry trends of emphasizing after-sales support and service as a steady income stream. Alta's expansion of its field service technician team is a strategic move to capitalize on this trend.Alta's organic growth and market expansion, along with its aggressive acquisition strategy, indicate an assertive approach to capturing market share. The forecast for non-residential construction starts and lift truck deliveries to remain strong in 2024 suggests a favorable environment for Alta's continued revenue growth. However, the reliance on acquisitions for growth can be a double-edged sword, as it may introduce integration risks and could potentially distract from organic growth initiatives.The positive industry indicators and increased state DOT budgets are supportive of the company's optimistic outlook for 2024. Investors should note the potential for increased infrastructure spending to drive demand for Alta's products and services, but also consider the cyclical nature of the construction industry which may affect future performance. Economist The financial results of Alta Equipment Group Inc. reflect broader economic trends, such as increased activity in construction and material handling sectors. The company's revenue growth is indicative of a healthy industrial economy, where equipment demand is high. The reported increase in state DOT budgets for the fiscal year 2024 could be a result of fiscal policies aimed at stimulating economic growth through infrastructure investment, which would benefit companies like Alta.However, the net loss figures point to macroeconomic challenges that may include rising interest rates, which are evident in the company's increased interest expenses. This could be a reflection of a tightening monetary policy environment, where borrowing costs are higher, affecting companies with significant leverage. The company's future performance may be contingent on its ability to manage these higher costs and improve operational efficiency to turn increased revenues into net profits.While the company's outlook for 2024 is positive, external economic factors such as potential shifts in government spending, trade policies and commodity prices could influence Alta's operational costs and profit margins. Investors should consider these macroeconomic variables when evaluating the company's long-term growth potential and financial stability. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights: (comparisons are year over year) Total revenues increased 21.7% year over year to $521.5 millionConstruction and Material Handling revenues of $328.1 million and $179.0 million, respectivelyProduct support revenues increased 14.2% year over year with Parts sales increasing to $69.1 million and Service revenues increasing to $60.8 millionNew and used equipment sales grew 25.1% to $298.1 millionNet loss available to common stockholders of $(2.7) million compared to $(1.5) million in 2022Basic and diluted net loss per share of $(0.08) compared to $(0.05) in 2022Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share* of $0.03 for 2023 compared to $0.10 for 2022 Adjusted EBITDA* grew 16.4% to $49.7 million compared to $42.7 million in 2022Completed acquisitions of Burris Equipment Company and Ault Industries Inc. 2023 Full Year Financial Highlights: (comparisons are year over year) Total revenues increased $305.0 million year over year to $1,876.8 millionConstruction and Material Handling revenues of $1,124.7 million and $681.5 million, respectivelyMaster Distribution with revenues of $83.8 millionProduct Support revenues increased 17.7% year over year with Parts sales increasing to $278.3 million and Service revenues increasing to $241.3 millionNew and used equipment sales grew 25.5% to $1,025.9 millionNet income available to common stockholders of $5.9 million compared to $6.3 million in 2022Basic and diluted net income per share of $0.18 compared to $0.20 in 2022Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share* of $0.69 and $0.68, respectively, compared to $0.58 for both in 2022Adjusted EBITDA* grew 21.1% to $191.4 million, exceeding guidance midpoint, compared to $158.1 million in 2022 LIVONIA, Mich., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alta Equipment Group Inc. (NYSE: ALTG) (“Alta”, ""we"", ""our"" or the “Company”), a leading provider of premium material handling, construction and environmental processing equipment and related services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. CEO Comment: Ryan Greenawalt, Chief Executive Officer of Alta, said “The momentum in our business continued throughout the balance of 2023 and as a result, we delivered solid financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and 2023 fiscal year. Total revenues grew 21.7% to $521.5 million for the fourth quarter and increased 19.4% to $1.9 billion for the year. Our business continues to benefit from the broad-based strength in our major end-user markets. For the year, revenues from our Construction Equipment segment grew 12.9% to $1.1 billion while Material Handling revenues increased 19.4% to $681.5 million. As a result, our high-margin parts and service business revenue increased 17.7% to $519.6 million. One of our key priorities remains providing our customers with best-in-class support to keep their fleets and job sites running with as little down time as possible. Thus, we continued to expand our field service population, ending the year with more than 1,300 skilled technicians, which represents nearly half of our 3,000 employees. Overall, we achieved record results in 2023.” Mr. Greenawalt continued, “Our diversified growth strategy continues to prove very successful. During the year, we achieved organic revenues growth of 12.3% by increasing our market share, expanding our product portfolio, investing in rental fleet and entering new territories. The 16 acquisitions we have completed since going public in 2020 are also major contributors to our success, providing $537 million in revenues and $65 million in Adjusted EBITDA. We are continuing to pursue accretive acquisitions opportunities which would further expand the scale and scope of product offerings for our customers. Of course, our success would not be possible without the solid execution by our dedicated team at Alta.” In conclusion, Mr. Greenawalt commented, “Our outlook for 2024 is positive as industry indicators support our expectations for continued growth this year. Non-residential construction starts are forecast to increase compared to 2023. The material handling industry is forecasting another year of strong lift truck deliveries that is likely to resemble, if not exceed, the record year of lift truck deliveries in 2023. Additionally, state DOT 2024 fiscal year budgets are more than 10% higher than last year. And importantly, the sentiment from our customers is consistent with strength we experienced in 2023. Finally, we are very focused on continued growth and operating leverage in 2024 with the end goal of improving shareholder value.” Full Year 2024 Financial Guidance and Other Financial Notes: The Company released its 2024 guidance range and expects to report Adjusted EBITDA between $207.5 million and $217.5 million for the 2024 fiscal year.

Alta’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside Alta’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures resulting from supply chain disruptions or a tightening labor market; negative impacts on customer payment policies and adverse banking and governmental regulations, resulting in a potential reduction to the fair value of our assets; the performance and financial viability of key suppliers, contractors, customers, and financing sources; economic, industry, business and political conditions including their effects on governmental policy and government actions that disrupt our supply chain or sales channels; fluctuations in interest rates; the market price for our equipment; collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our union-represented employees; our success in identifying acquisition targets and integrating acquisitions; our success in expanding into and doing business in additional markets; our ability to raise capital at favorable terms; the competitive environment for our products and services; our ability to continue to innovate and develop new business lines; our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including, but not limited to, skilled technicians; our ability to maintain our listing on the New York Stock Exchange; the impact of cyber or other security threats or other disruptions to our businesses; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, rental fleet and other organic investments or internal reorganizations; federal, state, and local government budget uncertainty, especially as it relates to infrastructure projects and taxation; currency risks and other risks associated with international operations; and other risks and uncertainties identified in this presentation or indicated from time to time in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Alta’s annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Alta cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive, and readers should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Alta does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. *Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share, in this press release because we believe they are useful performance measures that assist in an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to financing methods or capital structure. We believe such measures are useful for investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, such measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or in isolation from, net income, revenues, operating profit, debt, or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense (not including floorplan interest paid on new equipment), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjustments for certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. We exclude these items from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts are either non-recurring or can vary substantially within the industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables to reflect the Company's estimated financial obligations less cash and floor plan payables on new equipment (""FPNP""). The FPNP is used to finance the Company's new inventory, with its principal balance changing daily as equipment is purchased and sold and the sale proceeds are used to repay the notes. Consequently, in managing the business, management views the FPNP as interest bearing accounts payable, representing the cost of acquiring the equipment that is then repaid when the equipment is sold, as the Company's floor plan credit agreements require repayment when such pieces of equipment are sold. The Company believes excluding the FPNP from the Company's total debt for this purpose provides management with supplemental information regarding the Company's capital structure and leverage profile and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by Company management and research analysts. Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's debt obligations, as reported in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to reflect certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares, respectively, outstanding during the period. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables, Adjusted net income, Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance. For example, items such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, certain one-time or non-recurring items as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted net income. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables, Adjusted net income, Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share should not be construed as an indication that results will be unaffected by the items excluded from these metrics. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted total net debt and floor plan payables, Adjusted net income, Adjusted basic and diluted net income per share may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable measures under GAAP, please see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.

The exchange offer includes considerations for early and late participation, with details on interest payments and settlement dates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Rackspace Technology regarding the exchange and funding offers for its 3.50% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028 represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. By offering to exchange existing notes for new ones and to purchase some for cash, Rackspace is potentially reducing future interest payments and extending the maturity of its debt. This could improve liquidity and financial flexibility, which are essential for funding ongoing operations and investments in hybrid, multicloud and AI technology solutions.However, the impact on the stock market will largely depend on investor perception of the company's creditworthiness and the attractiveness of the new terms being offered. If the market views this as a sign of financial strength and confidence in the company's future cash flows, it could lead to a positive reaction in Rackspace's stock price. Conversely, if the exchange is perceived as a way to manage problematic debt levels, it could be seen unfavorably. The details of the offer, such as the original issue discount on the new term loans, suggest a careful approach to incentivize participation without significantly increasing the company's cost of capital. Market Research Analyst The timing and structure of Rackspace's debt exchange offer may reflect broader market conditions and investor appetite for corporate debt, particularly in the technology sector. The company's decision to not accept partial tenders could indicate a desire for a clean transaction process and a strong push to restructure its debt obligations in a decisive manner. The move to offer a cash purchase option alongside the exchange could appeal to a wider range of debt holders, potentially increasing the likelihood of a successful offer.It's also worth noting the strategic use of an early participation incentive, which is a common tactic to encourage prompt decision-making among bondholders. This could expedite the process and provide Rackspace with a clearer picture of its future debt profile sooner rather than later. The company's ability to successfully navigate this exchange offer could signal to the market its competence in managing complex financial operations, which may have positive implications for its reputation among investors and analysts. Legal Expert The exchange offer's reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act indicates a targeted approach to engage with institutional investors and non-U.S. persons, which aligns with the common practice of private placements in corporate finance. By limiting the offer to qualified institutional buyers and those complying with Regulation S, Rackspace is adhering to the legal framework designed to facilitate transactions with sophisticated investors while mitigating regulatory risks.The use of a confidential exchange offering memorandum and the engagement of a transaction agent further underscore the company's commitment to due diligence and regulatory compliance. The legal intricacies of such offers, including the precise timing and withdrawal rights, are crafted to provide clarity and fairness to all participants while ensuring the company's actions are within the bounds of securities laws. This careful legal structuring is crucial for minimizing the risk of disputes and ensuring a smooth transaction process. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN ANTONIO, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology® (NASDAQ: RXT) (“Rackspace” or the “Company”), a leading end-to-end hybrid, multicloud, and AI technology solutions company, through its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Finance, LLC (the “New Issuer”), today announced offers to eligible holders in respect of any and all of the 3.50% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Existing Secured Notes”) issued by its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Technology Global, Inc., to (i) (A) exchange certain of those Existing Secured Notes for new 3.50% FLSO Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Exchange Notes”) issued by the New Issuer and (B) have purchased for cancellation certain of those Existing Secured Notes by the New Issuer for cash (collectively, the “Exchange Offer”), and (ii) fund (the “Funding Offer” and, together with the Exchange Offer, the “Offers”) new senior secured first lien first out term loans (the “New FLFO Term Loans”) of the New Issuer.

Expected availability of Rezdiffra in the U.S. in April. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's accelerated approval of Rezdiffra for NASH treatment marks a significant milestone in hepatology. The decision is based on Phase 3 trial results demonstrating efficacy in improving liver fibrosis and resolving NASH without worsening conditions. This is particularly notable as there were no prior FDA-approved treatments for NASH, indicating a high unmet medical need.Rezdiffra's mechanism as a THR-β agonist targets the underlying causes of NASH, which is a progressive liver disease often associated with obesity and diabetes. The lack of a liver biopsy requirement for diagnosis could increase the drug's accessibility and patient compliance, potentially expanding the treatment's market penetration. However, continued approval hinges on confirmatory trials, which suggests that investors should be cognizant of future study outcomes when assessing Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' long-term prospects. Healthcare Economist The approval of Rezdiffra introduces a new drug to the market with the potential to alter the cost landscape of NASH treatment. Given the chronic nature of the disease and the potential reduction in the progression to cirrhosis, this therapy could decrease the long-term economic burden on the healthcare system. This includes potential savings from averting liver transplants and managing complications of advanced liver disease.However, the cost-effectiveness of Rezdiffra will be scrutinized, considering the specialty pharmacy distribution and patient support programs. The drug's pricing strategy and insurance coverage will be key factors in its market adoption and impact on Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' revenue. Stakeholders should monitor payer responses and patient access programs' effectiveness in facilitating treatment uptake. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The introduction of Rezdiffra is poised to disrupt the NASH therapeutics market. As the first FDA-approved medication for this indication, it sets a competitive benchmark. The drug's performance in the MAESTRO-NASH trial, with statistically significant results on primary endpoints, positions it favorably against other therapies in development.Investors should track Madrigal's marketing strategy and post-approval studies, as these will influence both physician prescribing patterns and payer coverage decisions. Furthermore, the adverse reactions profile, which appears manageable based on trial data, will be a critical factor in patient adherence and long-term success. Monitoring competitor responses and pipeline developments will be essential for understanding the evolving market dynamics. 03/14/2024 - 04:15 PM Rezdiffra becomes the first and only medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH (also known as “MASH”)Accelerated approval was based on Phase 3 data demonstrating that Rezdiffra improved liver fibrosis and resolved NASH in patients with noncirrhotic NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis Rezdiffra prescribing information does not include a liver biopsy requirement for diagnosisMadrigal conference call scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 5:15 pm ET CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval for Rezdiffra (resmetirom) in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory trials. Bill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal, stated, “NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis is a serious and progressive liver disease that, until now, has not had an FDA-approved therapy. The accelerated approval of Rezdiffra is a culmination of more than 15 years of research from our founder Dr. Becky Taub and a small R&D team that took on one of the biggest challenges in drug development. This is a historic moment for the NASH field and represents the best of what our industry is capable of. We’re excited to deliver Rezdiffra to patients in need.” Becky Taub, M.D., the Founder, Chief Medical Officer and President of Research & Development of Madrigal, stated, “Madrigal would like to thank the many patients who made the accelerated approval of Rezdiffra possible by participating in our clinical studies. We believe Rezdiffra will change the treatment paradigm for NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis, giving physicians a liver-directed therapy to help improve fibrosis and resolve NASH before their patients progress to cirrhosis.” Wayne Eskridge, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Fatty Liver Foundation, stated, “This is a day of celebration for patients with NASH who have been waiting many years for the first approved therapy. I believe this approval milestone will bring new energy and momentum to the NASH community, accelerating our efforts to improve disease education, build care pathways, and expand investment in NASH research.” Rezdiffra is a once-daily, oral THR-β agonist designed to target key underlying causes of NASH. The accelerated approval of Rezdiffra was based on results from the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial, which was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. MAESTRO-NASH is an ongoing pivotal, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1,759 patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. Following 52 weeks of treatment, both 100 mg and 80 mg doses of Rezdiffra demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo on two primary endpoints: NASH resolution (including a reduction in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] activity score by ≥2 points) with no worsening of fibrosis, and an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score. Fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution were consistent regardless of age, gender, type 2 diabetes status, or fibrosis stage. The Rezdiffra prescribing information does not include a liver biopsy requirement for diagnosis. The recommended dosage of Rezdiffra is based on actual body weight. For patients weighing <100 kg (220 lbs.), the recommended dosage is 80 mg orally once daily. For patients weighing ≥100 kg (220 lbs.), the recommended dosage is 100 mg orally once daily. Stephen Harrison, M.D., Chairman for both Pinnacle Clinical Research and Summit Clinical Research, San Antonio, Texas, Visiting Professor of Hepatology, Oxford University, and lead Principal Investigator of the MAESTRO studies, commented, “The approval of the first medication for NASH is a true game-changer for healthcare providers, the research community and, most importantly, patients living with this serious liver condition. Based on the robust efficacy and safety data generated in two large Phase 3 MAESTRO studies, I believe Rezdiffra will become the foundational therapy for patients with NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis.” Dr. Harrison continued, “Importantly, we continue to study Rezdiffra to determine if the positive results observed in the MAESTRO studies will lead to reduced risk of progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, need for liver transplant and premature mortality.” MAESTRO-NASH remains ongoing as an outcomes study designed to generate confirmatory data that, if positive, will help verify clinical benefit and may support full approval. A second ongoing outcomes trial is evaluating progression to liver decompensation events in patients with well-compensated NASH cirrhosis treated with Rezdiffra versus placebo. Rezdiffra should not be used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The most common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Rezdiffra included diarrhea, nausea, pruritis, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and dizziness. Diarrhea and nausea typically began early in treatment initiation and were mild to moderate in severity. A separate, noninvasive Phase 3 trial, MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, evaluated the safety and tolerability of Rezdiffra and contributed to the safety database supporting regulatory benefit-risk assessment. Rezdiffra is expected to be available to patients in the U.S. in April and will be distributed through a limited specialty pharmacy network. Madrigal is committed to helping appropriate patients who may benefit from Rezdiffra access the medication through the Madrigal Patient Support program. This program is designed to help patients navigate insurance and affordability challenges and provide co-pay support for eligible patients. Madrigal has also established a patient assistance program (PAP) to help patients with no insurance access Rezdiffra. Conference Call and Webcast Madrigal will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:15 PM ET to discuss the accelerated approval of Rezdiffra. To access the webcast of the call with slides please visit the Investors section of Madrigal’s website or click here. An archived webcast will be available on the Madrigal website after the event. Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH Trial Results MAESTRO-NASH is an ongoing Phase 3 trial that enrolled 1759 patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-daily Rezdiffra at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg or placebo. The two primary endpoints at week 52 were NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis and an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score. The key secondary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24. Rezdiffra achieved both primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint of the MAESTRO-NASH trial. Additionally, Rezdiffra improved liver enzymes, fibrosis biomarkers and imaging tests as compared with placebo. The primary results of the trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2024. Patients enrolled in the MAESTRO-NASH trial continue on therapy after the initial 52-week treatment period for up to 54 months to accrue and measure hepatic clinical outcome events including progression to cirrhosis on biopsy and hepatic decompensation events, as well as all-cause mortality. The 54-month outcomes portion of the trial is designed to generate confirmatory data that, if positive, will help verify Rezdiffra’s clinical benefit and may support full approval. About NASH Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH is a leading cause of liver-related mortality and an increasing burden on healthcare systems globally. Additionally, patients with NASH, especially those with more advanced metabolic risk factors (hypertension, concomitant type 2 diabetes), are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events and increased morbidity and mortality. Once patients progress to NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), the risk of adverse liver outcomes increases dramatically. NASH is rapidly becoming the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. Madrigal estimates that approximately 1.5 million patients have been diagnosed with NASH in the U.S., of which approximately 525,000 have NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. Madrigal plans to focus on approximately 315,000 diagnosed patients with NASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis under the care of the liver specialist physicians during the launch of Rezdiffra. NASH is also known as metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups came together to rename the disease, with the goal of establishing an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and diagnosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), NASH was renamed MASH, and an overarching term, steatotic liver disease (SLD), was established to capture multiple types of liver diseases associated with fat buildup in the liver. In addition to liver disease, patients with MASH have at least one related comorbid condition (e.g., obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or type 2 diabetes). About Rezdiffra What is Rezdiffra? Rezdiffra is a prescribed medicine used along with diet and exercise to treat adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver. It is not known if Rezdiffra is safe and effective in children (under 18 years old). This indication is approved based on improvement of NASH and liver scarring (fibrosis). There are ongoing studies to confirm the clinical benefit of Rezdiffra. Before you take Rezdiffra, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have any liver problems other than NASH.have gallbladder problems or have been told you have gallbladder problems, including gallstones.are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Rezdiffra will harm your unborn baby.are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Rezdiffra passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Rezdiffra.

Rezdiffra and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects. Rezdiffra may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Rezdiffra works.Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take medicines that contain gemfibrozil to help lower your triglycerides, or cyclosporine to suppress your immune system, because Rezdiffra is not recommended in patients taking these medicines.Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines such as clopidogrel to thin your blood or statin medicines to help lower your cholesterol.Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. What are the possible side effects of Rezdiffra? Rezdiffra may cause serious side effects, including: liver injury (hepatotoxicity). Stop taking Rezdiffra and call your healthcare provider right away if you develop the following signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity: tiredness, nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice), pain or tenderness in the upper middle or upper right area of your stomach (abdomen). gallbladder problems. Gallbladder problems such as gallstones, inflammation of the gallbladder, or inflammation of the pancreas from gallstones can occur with NASH and may occur if you take Rezdiffra. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of these conditions including nausea, vomiting, fever, or pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen to your back and the pain may happen with or without vomiting.

The securities are being offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company like Xcel Brands announces a public offering of its common stock, it's a pivotal moment that demands close scrutiny from a financial perspective. The primary purpose of such an offering is often to raise capital, which can be used for a variety of strategic moves such as debt repayment, funding new projects, or acquisitions. Investors should note that the market's reception to this offering could influence Xcel's stock price. If the offering is priced below current market levels, it might lead to a temporary dip in share value. Conversely, a well-received offering could bolster investor confidence and potentially drive up the share price. Another aspect to consider is dilution. Current shareholders might experience a dilution of their ownership percentage, which can affect the value of their investment. However, the influx of capital could also lead to growth and increased market share, which may offset the dilution effect in the long run. The role of Craig-Hallum Capital Group as the sole managing underwriter is also significant. Their reputation and the terms they negotiate will play a crucial role in the success of the offering. Market Research Analyst The timing and conditions of Xcel Brands' public offering are indicative of the company's market strategy and the confidence of its management in the brand's growth potential. The retail and consumer goods sector is highly competitive and Xcel's move to raise capital suggests an aggressive posture towards expansion or innovation. Prospective and current investors should look beyond the immediate effects of the offering and consider the company's long-term strategy. Furthermore, the market's response to this offering will provide valuable insights into investor sentiment towards Xcel Brands. A successful offering could signify market approval of the company's direction, while a lackluster response might signal the need for a strategic reassessment. The details in the prospectus supplement will be crucial for investors, as they will outline the intended use of proceeds, which can greatly affect the company's future performance. Legal Expert It's important to understand the legal framework governing Xcel Brands' public offering. The shelf registration statement, which has already been declared effective by the SEC, allows for the timely offering of securities, providing Xcel with the flexibility to tap into the market opportunistically. The legal stipulations that no sale can occur in any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful ensures compliance with varying state securities laws, which is a safeguard for both the company and investors. Investors should pay attention to the prospectus and prospectus supplement, as these documents contain critical information about the risks, terms and conditions of the offering. Any discrepancies or omissions in these legal documents could have significant implications. Moreover, the legal language that 'this press release shall not constitute an offer to sell' is a standard disclaimer to prevent premature commitments before the full details of the offering are disclosed and understood. 03/14/2024 - 04:10 PM NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xcel Brands, Inc.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Altus Power, Inc. (NYSE: AMPS) reported strong financial results for full year 2023, with revenues reaching $155.2 million, a 53% increase from 2022, and adjusted EBITDA of $93.1 million, a 59% increase from the previous year.

The company expects operating revenues of $200-222 million and adjusted EBITDA of $115-135 million for 2024, showing significant growth projections. Positive Strong financial performance in full year 2023 with revenues of $155.2 million, a 53% increase from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $93.1 million, a 59% increase from the previous year. Altus Power added 150 enterprise customers and expanded its portfolio to 896 MW in 2023. The company completed 74 MW of new-build assets and closed an 84 MW acquisition deal with Vitol in January 2024. Operating revenues expected to reach $200-222 million and adjusted EBITDA projected at $115-135 million for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Altus Power's financial results for the full year 2023 show a substantial 53% increase in revenues compared to the previous year, indicating a robust expansion in the company's operations. Despite this, the company reported a GAAP net loss of $26.0 million, a significant shift from the net income reported in 2022. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to non-cash losses from remeasurement of alignment shares. However, investors should note the 125% increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which reflects strong operational cash flow and financial health of the company.Looking at the adjusted EBITDA, which increased by 59%, provides a clearer picture of the company's operational performance by excluding non-recurring and non-cash items. This metric, along with the adjusted EBITDA margin remaining high at 60%, suggests efficiency in operations and the ability to generate profits from its core business activities. The company's guidance for 2024 forecasts further growth, which could indicate confidence in the sustainability of its business model. However, investors should remain aware of the volatility in non-cash accounting items that can significantly impact reported net income. Market Research Analyst Altus Power's positioning as the largest owner of commercial scale solar assets in the US is a strategic advantage in an industry that is benefiting from increasing demand for renewable energy sources. The company's expansion, both in terms of customer base and operational assets, is a positive indicator for future growth prospects. The addition of approximately 150 enterprise customers and a 91% increase in portfolio size to 896 MW are key metrics that reflect the company's market penetration and scalability.Moreover, Altus Power's strategic acquisition from Vitol at the start of 2024 demonstrates proactive asset growth and could further solidify its market leadership. With a year-ending cash balance of $219 million and no expected equity needs, Altus Power appears to be in a strong position to finance its growth without diluting shareholder value. The company's growth trajectory is well-aligned with the broader shift towards renewable energy, which could result in sustained demand for its services. Energy Sector Analyst The financial results of Altus Power highlight the dynamic nature of the renewable energy sector. The expansion of the company's asset base and the growth in megawatt hours sold underscore the increasing adoption of solar energy solutions in the commercial sector. Altus Power's focus on building a customer-centric platform with recurring revenues is a strategic move that could lead to long-term contractual stability and predictable cash flows.However, the sector is subject to regulatory changes, technological advancements and fluctuations in government incentives, all of which can impact profitability. Altus Power's ability to maintain a high adjusted EBITDA margin in such a capricious environment is commendable, but stakeholders should remain vigilant of the potential risks associated with the renewable energy market, such as changes in tariff structures, competition from emerging technologies and the cost dynamics of solar panel manufacturing. 03/14/2024 - 04:10 PM Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Full year 2023 revenues of $155.2 million, a 53% increase compared to full year 2022 GAAP net loss of $26.0 million for full year 2023, compared to net income of $52.2 million for full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA* of $93.1 million for full year 2023, a 59% increase compared to full year 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities of $79.4 million, a 125% increase over 2022 Adjusted EBITDA margin* of 60% for full year 2023, compared to 58% for full year 2022 Business Highlights Added ~150 enterprise customers, bringing total to over 450 Increased portfolio size by 91% to 896 MW during 2023 Completed ~74 MW of new-build assets and added ~352 MW of assets in operation Largest owner of commercial scale solar assets in the US1 Expanded presence with offices on the West Coast, resulting from our first platform acquisition Approaching 1 gigawatt portfolio with closing of 84 MW acquisition from Vitol in January 2024 Year ending cash balance of $219 million underpins financing plan for 2024 with no expected equity needs STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altus Power, Inc. (NYSE: AMPS) (“Altus Power” or the “Company”), the largest commercial scale provider of clean, electric power, today announced its financial results for fourth quarter and full year 2023. “2023 was another record year for Altus on a number of fronts, with revenue, adjusted EBITDA, customer additions and asset growth all reaching new highs,"" said Lars Norell, co-CEO of Altus Power. ""As an industry leader in a growing market, we are building a different kind of power company. We are customer-centric and have growing annual recurring revenues* which we expect will allow us to deliver our shareholders sustainable and profitable growth over time."" ""As the largest player in commercial scale solar, the advantages of our category leadership are becoming ever more evident, and we are continuing to scale our platform in order to support our ongoing growth. We kickstarted 2024 with a strategic acquisition, bolstering our operational assets through a partnership with Vitol. Our pipeline is rich with new build opportunities arising from our expanding set of partners,"" added Gregg Felton, Co-CEO of Altus Power. ""We believe our balance sheet is well positioned to support the growth in customers and assets available to us."" Fourth Quarter Financial Results Operating revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $34.2 million, compared to $26.8 million during the same period of 2022, an increase of 28%. The increase is primarily due to the growth of megawatt hours generated by Altus Power's assets in service of the Company's growing customer base. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net loss totaled $40.0 million, compared to net income of $67.1 million for the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a $17.7 million non-cash loss from remeasurement of alignment shares during the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to a $71.5 million non-cash gain from remeasurement of both warrants and alignment shares during the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA* during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $17.3 million, compared to $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, a 5% increase. The quarter-over-quarter growth in adjusted EBITDA* was primarily the result of increased revenue from additional solar energy facilities, partially offset by an increase in our general and administrative expenses. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Operating revenues for full year 2023 totaled $155.2 million, compared to $101.2 million in 2022, driven by customer additions and growth in megawatt hours sold over the past twelve months. Full year 2023 GAAP net loss totaled $26.0 million, compared to net income of $52.2 million in 2022 primarily driven by the non-cash net gain of $55.7 million from remeasurement of both warrants and alignment shares in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA* during full year 2023 totaled $93.1 million, compared to $58.6 million for full-year 2022. This growth was primarily the result of increased revenue from additional solar energy facilities, partially offset by an increase in our general and administrative expenses. Initiating 2024 Guidance Altus Power expects 2024 operating revenues in the range $200-222 million, and adjusted EBITDA* in the range of $115-135 million, representing 36% and 34% growth over 2022 at the midpoints, respectively. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information *Denotes Non-GAAP financial measure. We present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We believe certain financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our business. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, income tax expense or benefit, acquisition and entity formation costs, stock-based compensation expense, and excluding the effect of certain non-recurring items we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance such as, but not limited to, gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, change in fair value of redeemable warrant liability, change in fair value of Alignment Shares liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, net, and other miscellaneous items of other income and expenses We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we use to measure our performance. We believe that investors and analysts also use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in evaluating our operating performance. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income and to adjusted EBITDA margin is net income over operating revenues. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to suggest that our future results will be unaffected by non-cash or non-recurring items. In addition, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are not necessarily comparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as calculated by other companies and investors and analysts should read carefully the components of our calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to management, investors and analysts in providing a measure of core financial performance adjusted to allow for comparisons of results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Factors in this determination include the exclusion of (1) variability due to gains or losses related to fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration and the change in fair value of redeemable warrant liability and Alignment Shares liability, (2) strategic decisions to acquire businesses, dispose of property, plant and equipment or extinguish debt, and (3) the non-recurring nature of stock-based compensation and other miscellaneous items of income and expense, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, adjusted EBITDA represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, as well as interest expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, which are not representative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our management for internal planning purposes, including our consolidated operating budget, and by our board of directors in setting performance-based compensation targets. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to but viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, as we believe it provides a more complete understanding of ongoing business performance and trends than GAAP measures alone. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition to adjusted EBITDA, we may also refer to annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which is a non-GAAP measure. ARR is an estimate that management uses to determine the expected annual revenue potential of our operating asset base at the end of a calendar year. ARR assumes customary weather, production, expenses and other economic and market conditions, as well as seasonality. It is not derived from a GAAP financial measure so it is difficult to provide a meaningful reconciliation to GAAP. The elements of our financial statements that are considered or evaluated in determining our ARR are the following: the estimated megawatt hours of generation assuming all new build and operating assets added any time during the year were in place for the full year and the estimated power prices for such assets based on historical power prices. We believe this metric can be helpful to assess our portfolio asset base in operation at the beginning of an annual period, e.g. if we were to receive the benefit of assets added for a full year even if they were added during a partial year. This figure is only an estimate and is based on a number of assumptions by Altus Power's management that may or may not be realized. Altus Power does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, items such as acquisition and entity formation costs, gain on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, change in fair value of redeemable warrant liability, change in fair value of alignment shares. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Altus Power’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA Definitions Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net represents interest on our borrowings under our various debt facilities, amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs, and gains and losses on interest rate swaps. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense. Depreciation expense represents depreciation on solar energy systems that have been placed in service. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line composite method over the estimated useful lives of assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Amortization includes third party costs necessary to enter into site lease agreements, third party costs necessary to acquire PPA and NMCA customers and favorable and unfavorable rate revenues contracts. Third party costs necessary to enter into site lease agreements are amortized using the straight-line method ratably over 15-30 years based upon the term of the individual site leases. Third party costs necessary to acquire PPAs and NMCA customers are amortized using the straight-line method ratably over 15-25 years based upon the term of the customer contract. Estimated fair value allocated to the favorable and unfavorable rate PPAs and REC agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective agreements. Accretion expense includes over time increase of asset retirement obligations associated with solar energy facilities. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. We account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As such, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally, we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. We have a partial valuation allowance on our deferred state tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred state tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. Acquisition and Entity Formation Costs. Acquisition and entity formation costs represent costs incurred to acquire businesses and form new legal entities. Such costs primarily consist of professional fees for banking, legal, accounting and appraisal services. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted under the Legacy Incentive Plans and Omnibus Incentive Plan, as defined in Note 17, ""Stock-Based Compensation,"" to our consolidated financial statements included in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration. In connection with various acquisitions, contingent consideration may be payable upon achieving certain conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model or an expected cash flow approach. Significant assumptions used in the measurement of fair value of contingent consideration associated with various acquisitions include market power rates, estimated volumes of power generation of acquired solar energy facilities, percentage of completion of in-development solar energy facilities, and the risk-adjusted discount rate associated with the business. Gain or Loss on Disposal of Property, Plant and Equipment. In connection with the disposal of assets, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, which represents the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the disposed asset. Change in Fair Value of Redeemable Warrant Liability. In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed a redeemable warrant liability composed of publicly listed warrants (the ""Redeemable Warrants"") and warrants issued to CBRE Acquisition Sponsor, LLC in the private placement. In October 2022, the Company redeemed all outstanding Redeemable Warrants. The redeemable warrant liability was remeasured through the date all outstanding Redeemable Warrants were redeemed, and the resulting loss was included in the consolidated statements of operations. Change in Fair Value of Alignment Shares. Alignment Shares represent Class B common stock of the Company which were issued in connection with the Merger. Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (""Alignment Shares"") are accounted for as liability-classified derivatives, which were remeasured as of December 31, 2023, and the resulting gain was included in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of outstanding Alignment Shares using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model utilizing a distribution of potential outcomes based on a set of underlying assumptions such as stock price, volatility, and risk-free interest rates. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net. When the repayment of debt is accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, loss on extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the reacquisition price of debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other income and expenses primarily represent interest income, state grants, and other miscellaneous items.

Positive Record full-year gross margin and net income reported by Karat Packaging Inc. as the business expands. Fourth quarter 2023 net sales reached $95.6 million, with a gross profit of $34.1 million and net income of $4.2 million. Karat aims for a low to mid-single-digit increase in first-quarter 2024 sales and a gross margin goal of 37 to 39 percent. Full-year 2024 sales expected to rise by 8 to 15 percent with a gross margin goal of 35 to 38 percent. CEO Alan Yu notes a 7.3 percent growth in sales volume and plans for market expansion and operational enhancements. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in gross margin to 35.7% and net income margin to 4.4% for Karat Packaging Inc. in Q4 2023, despite the various adjustments and write-offs, indicates a strong pricing strategy and operational efficiency. The company's ability to pass on savings from ocean freight and raw material costs to customers, while still increasing gross profit by 14.9%, suggests a competitive edge in cost management. The focus on eco-friendly products, with an 11% growth for the quarter, aligns with consumer trends towards sustainability, potentially opening up new market segments and customer bases.Looking ahead, the guidance for net sales growth of 8 to 15% for the full year 2024, coupled with a gross margin goal of 35 to 38%, projects a positive outlook. However, the assumption of no significant increases in ocean freight rates could be a point of vulnerability, as the logistics industry is susceptible to volatile fuel prices and international trade policies. The expansion into new markets and the implementation of automation and AI technologies could further streamline operations and enhance productivity, which may be reflected in future financial performance. Financial Analyst The dividend increase from $0.20 to $0.30 per share signals confidence in Karat Packaging Inc.'s financial health and its cash flow stability. This move could attract income-focused investors and support the company's stock price. However, the misclassification adjustments within the income statement, although not affecting net income, might raise concerns about internal controls and financial reporting accuracy. Investors may seek reassurance that these issues are being addressed to prevent future occurrences.The adjusted EBITDA decrease from $9.9 million to $8.6 million in Q4 2023 and the decline in adjusted EBITDA margin from 10.7% to 9.0% could indicate underlying challenges in maintaining profitability levels. While non-GAAP measures like adjusted EBITDA can provide a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding one-time items, investors should also consider GAAP measures to understand the company's financial position fully. Supply Chain Analyst The strategic decision to scale back U.S. manufacturing in favor of imports, as mentioned in the financial results, suggests a shift towards a more flexible supply chain model. This move has seemingly contributed to the improved gross margin by leveraging cost advantages of overseas production. However, it also exposes the company to risks associated with global supply chain disruptions and trade uncertainties. The new lease for a distribution center in Arizona indicates an expansion strategy that could enhance distribution efficiency and customer reach, particularly in the South, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions.Furthermore, the company's initiative to develop new eco-friendly products and the reported sales growth in this category reflect an adaptive response to the increasing demand for sustainable solutions in the foodservice industry. This strategic focus not only caters to consumer preferences but also positions the company well in light of potential regulatory changes favoring environmentally responsible products. 03/14/2024 - 04:10 PM Record Full Year Gross Margin and Net Income as Business Continues to ExpandCHINO, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Karat Packaging Inc. (Nasdaq: KRT) (“Karat” or the “Company”), a specialty distributor and manufacturer of environmentally friendly, disposable foodservice products and related items, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Fourth quarter 2023 financial results included: Change of estimate on import duty reserve totaling $2.3 million, an increase to cost of goods sold.Write-off of $1.1 million of a vendor prepayment upon the resolution of a legal contingency, an increase to general and administrative expenses.Out-of-period tax adjustment of $0.3 million, an increase to provision for income taxes.Misclassification adjustments for the full year amounts within the income statement with no impact on net income: Adjustment of $6.4 million online sales platform fees, an increase to net sales, offset by the same increase to selling expenses.Adjustment of $3.9 million of certain production expenses out of general and administrative expenses into cost of goods sold. The prior period financial results were not adjusted due to the immaterial impact on the overall financial statements. Net sales of $95.6 million, including the adjustment of $6.4 million online sales platform fees, versus $92.7 million in the prior-year quarter, up 3.1 percent in amount and 7.3 percent in volume.Gross profit of $34.1 million, including the favorable impact totaling $0.2 million from the import duty reserve and the adjustments, up 14.9 percent from the prior-year quarter.Gross margin of 35.7 percent, including the negative impact totaling 240 basis points from the import duty reserve and adjustments, versus 32.0 percent in the prior-year quarter.Net income of $4.2 million, including the negative impact totaling $2.9 million from the import duty reserve, vendor prepayment write-off, and tax adjustment, versus $4.5 million in the prior-year quarter.Net income margin of 4.4 percent, including the negative impact totaling 350 basis points from the import duty reserve, vendor prepayment write-off, tax adjustment and the adjustments, versus 4.9 percent in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA of $8.6 million, including the negative impact totaling $2.3 million from the import duty reserve, versus $9.9 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.0 percent, including the negative impact totaling 330 basis points from the import duty reserve and the adjustments, versus 10.7 percent in the prior-year quarter. Guidance Net sales for the 2024 first quarter expected to increase low to mid-single digit from the prior-year quarter.Gross margin goal for the 2024 first quarter: 37 to 39 percent versus 39.8 percent for 2023 first quarter.Net sales for full year 2024 expected to increase 8 to 15 percent from the prior year.Gross margin goal for full year 2024: 35 to 38 percent assuming no significant increases in ocean freight rates. “Sales volume again grew 7.3 percent for the 2023 fourth quarter over the prior-year quarter. However, revenue was impacted principally by year-over-year pricing comparisons and start-up delays into 2024 by several new national and regional chain accounts,” said Alan Yu, Chief Executive Officer. “During the fourth quarter, we continued to scale back U.S. manufacturing, which further enhanced gross margin to a near record high of 35.7 percent. “Sales of our eco-friendly products grew 11 percent for the quarter and comprised 33 percent of total net sales, which exceeded our expectations. We continue to develop new and innovative eco-friendly products to meet increasing demand and expand our customer base. “As part of our growth plan, we recently signed a new lease for a distribution center in Arizona, which is expected to be fully operational early in the second quarter. Together with our salesforce expansion, we can further penetrate key U.S. markets in the South, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest regions. We also are implementing automation and AI technologies to enhance operation and distribution productivity. “With Karat’s strong operating cash flow and balance sheet, our board of directors in February authorized another increase in the quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.30 per share, from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share,” Yu added. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 3.1 percent to $95.6 million, from $92.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase included the impact of $6.4 million from the adjustment of online sales platform fees and volume growth of 7.3 percent, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year pricing comparison, as the Company passed on savings from ocean freight and raw material costs to customers. Cost of goods sold for the 2023 fourth quarter was $61.5 million, which included an additional import duty reserve of $2.3 million and the adjustment of $3.9 million of certain production expenses from general and administrative expenses, compared with $63.0 million in the prior-year quarter, which included an out-of-period inventory write-off of $1.7 million. Despite the larger unfavorable discrete items in the 2023 fourth quarter, gross profit increased 14.9 percent to $34.1 million, from $29.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 35.7 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter, from 32.0 percent in the same quarter last year primarily as a result of our continued scale back of manufacturing operations in favor of imports and improved operating efficiencies. Operating expenses in the 2023 fourth quarter were $29.5 million, or 30.8 percent of net sales, compared with $24.9 million, or 26.8 percent of net sales, in the prior-year quarter. Operating expenses in the 2023 fourth quarter included a negative impact totaling $3.6 million from the vendor prepayment write-off and the adjustments noted above. Additionally, the year-over-year increase in operating expense was primarily driven by higher labor costs and rent and warehouse expense from workforce expansion and additional leased warehouses partially offset by a decrease in shipping and transportation costs and stock-compensation expense. Net income for the 2023 fourth quarter was $4.2 million, compared with $4.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income margin was 4.4 percent in the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with 4.9 percent in the prior-year quarter. Net income attributable to Karat for the 2023 fourth quarter was $3.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $4.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $8.6 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with $9.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was 9.0 percent of net sales, compared with 10.7 percent in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, a non-GAAP measure defined below, was $0.24 per share in the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with $0.30 per share in the prior-year quarter. 2023 Full Year Results Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased 4.1 percent to $405.7 million, from $423.0 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable pricing comparison and lower logistics services and shipping revenue partially offset by the positive impact of $6.4 million from the adjustment of online sales platform fees and volume growth of 3.7 percent. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $252.6 million, which included an additional import duty charge of $3.9 million, an inventory write-off of $1.7 million in connection with scaling back production, and the adjustment of $3.9 million of certain production expenses from general and administrative expenses, compared with $290.9 million in the prior year, which included an out-of-period inventory write-off of $0.9 million. Despite the larger unfavorable discrete items in 2023, gross profit increased 15.9% to $153.0 million, from $132.1 million a year ago. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased to 37.7 percent, from 31.2 percent for the prior year. Gross margin benefited from lower total ocean freight and import costs, the Company’s initiative to scale back manufacturing operations in favor of imports and the strong U.S. dollar. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $111.0 million, or 27.4 percent of net sales, compared with $102.1 million, or 24.1 percent of net sales, for the prior year. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a negative impact totaling $2.5 million from the additional import duty charge and the adjustments. Additionally, the year-over-year increase was primarily due to increases in labor, rent, warehouse, and utility expenses from workforce expansion and additional leased warehouses, marketing expense as we grow our e-commerce channel, and impairment expense and loss, net, primarily related to disposal of machinery as we scaled back production. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in shipping and transportation costs, stock-compensation expense and bad debt expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased 28.4 percent to $33.2 million, from $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income margin increased to 8.2 percent in 2023, compared with 6.1 percent in the prior year. Net income attributable to Karat was $32.5 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, for the full 2023 year, compared with $23.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined below, increased to $59.1 million for the full 2023 year, compared with $45.6 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure defined below, increased to 14.6 percent in 2023, compared with 10.8 percent in 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, a non-GAAP measure defined below, rose to $1.83 per share in 2023, from $1.30 per share in the prior year.

The out-of-period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented an inventory write-off recorded during the year 2022, which management believes was not representative of our underlying operating performance. The adjustment was to correct immaterial errors in the accounting for certain inventory items in our previously issued quarterly and annual financial statements.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Karat utilizes certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not defined by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable GAAP measure so calculated and presented. The following non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release: Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest income and interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, secondary offering transaction costs, write-off of certain inventory items outside the normal course of business, impairment expense and (gain) loss, net, on disposal of machinery outside the normal course of business, and out-of-period adjustment.Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by net sales.Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is calculated as diluted earnings per common share, plus the per share impact of stock-based compensation, secondary offering transaction costs, write-off of certain inventory items outside the normal course of business, impairment expense and (gain) loss, net, on disposal of machinery outside the normal course of business, out-of-period adjustment, and adjusted for the related tax effects of these adjustments. We believe the above-mentioned non-GAAP measures, which are used by management to assess the core performance of Karat, provide useful information and additional clarity of our operating results to our investors in their own evaluation of the core performance of Karat and facilitate a comparison of such performance from period to period. These are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, net income, earnings per share, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently.

Strong performance in reinsurance and merchant banking initiatives. Issuance of additional common stock contributing to the growth in total shareholders' equity. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net reinsurance premiums and net investment income are indicative of Fundamental Global Inc.'s strategic effectiveness in capital deployment, particularly in loss-capped reinsurance arrangements. This strategy appears to have paid off, as evidenced by the growth in premiums and the successful business combination contributing to investment gains. The increase in net income to $2.1 million from a net loss in the previous year demonstrates a notable turnaround in profitability, which is a positive signal for investors and stakeholders.The rise in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to non-cash stock compensation, suggests a focus on aligning management incentives with shareholder value, which could be seen as a long-term investment in leadership. However, the increase in expenses warrants monitoring to ensure it aligns with the company's growth trajectory and does not unduly burden the financials.The balance sheet strength, with a $5.2 million increase in shareholders' equity and substantial investment holdings, positions the company well for future growth. The diversified nature of the company's operations could offer stability, but also requires careful management to avoid overextension. Market Research Analyst Fundamental Global's performance in the reinsurance sector and its investment outcomes are reflective of broader market trends, where companies with diversified portfolios can leverage synergies across different business units. The successful execution of their reinsurance strategy and the gains from business combinations like FG Merger Corp. and iCoreConnect Inc. highlight the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities.The dividend payment on the 8% Series A Preferred Stock is a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which could enhance investor confidence and potentially attract income-focused investors. This move, coupled with the company's increased net income, may signal a strong value proposition to both current and prospective shareholders.Looking ahead, the market will likely be interested in the consolidated results post-merger, which will offer a clearer picture of the new entity's financial health and strategic direction. The company's approach to reducing public company costs and focusing on high ROIC businesses will be key areas of interest for stakeholders evaluating the company's efficiency and potential for sustained growth. 03/14/2024 - 04:10 PM Continued Growth in Reinsurance and Investment Results leads to Net Income in 2023 MOORESVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fundamental Global Inc. (Nasdaq: FGF) (the “Company” or ""Fundamental Global""), formerly known as FG Financial Group, Inc., today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. As previously announced, FG Financial Group, Inc. and FG Group Holdings Inc. completed their merger (“Merger”) as of February 29, 2024, whereby FG Group Holdings Inc. merged with and into FG Group LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the merger, the Company was renamed Fundamental Global Inc. The financial results presented in this earnings release reflect the financial results of FG Financial Group, Inc. for the periods ended December 31, 2023, prior to the completion of the Merger, and do not reflect the results of the legacy FG Group Holdings Inc. business. D. Kyle Cerminara, Chairman and CEO of Fundamental Global, commented, “We are pleased to have completed the merger transaction with FG Group Holdings Inc. Today, we are operating as Fundamental Global Inc., a unified public company combining the legacy businesses of FG Group Holdings Inc. and FG Financial Group, Inc. Our goal is to consolidate and simplify all of our operations, reduce public company costs and focus our efforts on accelerating growth in select scalable and high ROIC businesses. Our reinsurance portfolios and investments generated strong results as we deployed capital in those areas driving a significant increase in net income in the legacy FG Financial Group, Inc. business during 2023. We look forward to implementing our plans with a focus on shareholder returns.” Select 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results and Highlights Note: The financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 reflect the financial results of FG Financial Group, Inc. and do not include the financial results of FG Group Holdings Inc., which was merged into FG Group LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, subsequent to the end of the year. Starting in the first quarter of 2024, results will be reported on a consolidated basis. Fundamental Global Inc.’s 2023 fourth quarter and full year financial results included: Net reinsurance premiums earned increased to $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the year ended 2023, net premiums earned were $16.6 million, increasing from $13.0 million in 2022. The increase in reinsurance premiums for the year was driven by the successful execution of the Company’s strategy to deploy capital in loss-capped reinsurance arrangements. Net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $1.5 million compared to net investment income of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the year ended 2023, net investment income was $9.8 million, increasing from $6.8 million in 2022. Net investment income increased for the year primarily due to gains associated with the successful business combination of FG Merger Corp. and iCoreConnect Inc. The Company paid dividends on its 8% Series A Preferred Stock of $1.8 million, or $2.00 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses were $2.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $2.3 million and $8.4 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. This increase in current year expense was primarily due to increased stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense with no impact on shareholders’ equity. The increase in non-cash stock compensation expense was partially offset by reductions in cash compensation and managements’ initiatives to reduce operating overhead. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $2.1 million, or $0.21 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.7 million or $(0.09) per fully diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Balance Sheet Highlights As of December 31, 2023, Fundamental Global’s key balance sheet items included: Investment holdings totaling $30.9 million, including directly or indirectly held investments in OppFi, iCoreConnect Inc., holdings under the Company’s Merchant Banking Platform for FG Acquisition Corp., FG Communities, Craveworthy, and other holdings. Total shareholders’ equity of $42.5 million, an increase of $5.2 million from $37.3 million at December 31, 2022, driven by profitable performance in reinsurance and merchant banking initiatives, as well as by the issuance of additional common stock.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsNet revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $86.6 million as compared to $69.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing year-over-year growth of 25.5%. The 25.5% year-over-year growth was driven by the acquisition of four dispensaries and commencement of adult-use sales in Maryland, and a more than doubling of the Company’s wholesale business in New Jersey, partially offset by retail declines in New Jersey and Michigan. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 48.2% as compared to 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year improvement of 360 basis points was driven by yield improvements in New Jersey, margin optimization in Michigan, and the acquisition of four dispensaries and commencement of adult-use sales in Maryland. In the fourth quarter, gross margin in Maryland declined compared to the previous quarter, resulting from an equipment malfunction which led to a crop failure at its Maryland facility. The product output from that incident led to higher discounting in the quarter. Maryland gross margins in the quarter were also impacted by temporary under absorption of fixed costs in non-flower production due to scale up in this area. The Company is increasing output of non-flower product to meet its growing wholesale business and increase verticality in its four dispensaries. The increased output is expected to partially improve gross margin in Q1 and more fully absorb fixed costs into Q2. General & Administrative expenses (G&A) for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $27.7 million as compared to $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $25.4 million compared to $32.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. G&A as a percent of revenue, excluding stock-based compensation, was 29.4% in the fourth quarter, achieving the Company’s stated goal of 30%, compared to 47.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2022 included a $10.0 million reserve for bad debt related to one customer in Michigan. GAAP Net loss from continuing operations was $41.8 million, inclusive of $57.7 million of non-cash impairment charges, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million in Q4 2022. The non-cash impairment charges were recorded against goodwill and intangibles for the Company’s Michigan and California businesses. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $19.6 million, representing a 22.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin, as compared to $12.2 million and 17.7% in Q4 2022. The year-over-year improvement of 490 basis points was driven by gross margin expansion and G&A expense leverage. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net revenue for the full year 2023 totaled $317.3 million, as compared to $247.8 million for 2022, an increase of 28.0%, primarily driven by adult-use sales in New Jersey, the acquisition of four retail dispensaries in Maryland, the commencement of adult-use sales in Maryland, and growth in retail sales in Michigan. Gross profit margin was 50.3% compared to 41.0% for the full year 2022. The increase was driven by adult-use sales and yield improvements in New Jersey, adult-use sales and the acquisition of four retail dispensaries in Maryland, various margin optimization efforts in Michigan, and cost optimizations in Pennsylvania. While revenue grew 28.0%, General & Administrative expenses (G&A) declined year-over-year. G&A expenses were $115.2 million, as compared to $115.6 million in 2022. G&A as a percent of revenue was 36.3% as compared to 46.6% in 2022. This 1,030 basis points of reduction as a percentage of revenue was driven by the growth in sales and the Company’s across the board efforts to optimize its costs and drive positive cash flow. Also, the fourth quarter of 2022 included a $10.0 million reserve for bad debt related to one customer in Michigan. GAAP Net Loss from continuing operations was $82.3 million, inclusive of $58.0 million of non-cash impairment charges, compared to a net loss of $299.4 million in 2022, inclusive of $311.1 million of non-cash impairment charges. The non-cash impairment charges were recorded against goodwill and intangibles for the Company's Michigan and California businesses. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $68.8 million as compared to $38.8 million in 2022 resulting in an increase of 77.1% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was driven by the growth in revenue of 28.0% year-over-year, and improvements in gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 21.7% as compared to 15.7% in 2022, an improvement of 600 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the improvements in gross margin and optimizations of G&A. Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, were $25.3 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.8 million as of December 31, 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This represented the Company’s sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow from continuing operations. Capex spending was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the Company’s Hagerstown, Maryland expansion. Free cash flow was $7.9 million compared to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, payments were made related to $4.1 million of debt paydown and $4.7 million of cash distributions to the Company’s New Jersey partners. After initiating a comprehensive evaluation in early 2023, and based on legal interpretations, the Company has changed its tax position to challenge its tax liability under Internal Revenue Code - Section 280E. This has resulted in the reclassification of $59.2 million of tax liabilities, as of December 31, 2023, to long term liabilities and an uncertain tax position on the balance sheet. The Company will be filing amended returns for calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022 and expects to receive refunds of approximately $26 million of federal and state refunds related to 2020 and 2021. The current income tax liability on December 31, 2023 was $4.8 million and the Company plans to make payments as an ordinary taxpayer going forward. As of March 13, 2024, there were 367 million basic shares outstanding including 291 million common shares, 13 million preferred shares as converted, and 63 million exchangeable shares. Additionally, there are 42 million warrants and options outstanding at a weighted average price of $3.91.

The Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this news release. Neither the TSX nor any securities regulator accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. About TerrAscendTerrAscend is a leading TSX-listed cannabis company with interests across the North American cannabis sector, including vertically integrated operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, and California through TerrAscend Growth Corp. and retail operations in Canada through TerrAscend Canada, Inc.

For more information visit www.terrascend.com. Caution Regarding Cannabis Operations in the United StatesInvestors should note that there are significant legal restrictions and regulations that govern the cannabis industry in the United States. Cannabis remains a Schedule I drug under the US Controlled Substances Act, making it illegal under federal law in the United States to, among other things, cultivate, distribute, or possess cannabis in the United States. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable US federal money laundering legislation. While the approach to enforcement of such laws by the federal government in the United States has trended toward non-enforcement against individuals and businesses that comply with medical or adult-use cannabis programs in states where such programs are legal, strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis will neither absolve TerrAscend of liability under U.S. federal law, nor will it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against TerrAscend. The enforcement of federal laws in the United States is a significant risk to the business of TerrAscend and any proceedings brought against TerrAscend thereunder may adversely affect TerrAscend's operations and financial performance.

Forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions of management in light of management’s experience and perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors relevant in the circumstances, including assumptions in respect of current and future market conditions, the current and future regulatory environment, and the availability of licenses, approvals and permits. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Actual results and developments may differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Forward-looking information is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking information. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States relating to cannabis operations in the United States; and the risk factors set out in the Company’s most recently filed MD&A, filed with the Canadian securities regulators and available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and in the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2024. The statements in this press release are made as of the date of this release. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking information, whether, as a result of new information, future events, or results or otherwise, other than as required by applicable securities laws. Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresIn addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates: (i) EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude [provision for income taxes, finance expenses, depreciation and amortization, relief of fair value upon acquisition, share-based compensation, gain on extinguishment of debt, restructuring related charges, impairment of good will and intangible assets and certain other items which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations as EBITDA from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items such as inventory write downs outside of the normal course of operations, share based compensation expense, impairment charges taken on goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, the gain or loss recognized on the revaluation of our contingent consideration liabilities, the gain or loss recognized on the remeasurement of the fair value of the U.S denominated preferred share warrants and other warrants liabilities, one time fees incurred in connection with our acquisitions and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance, (iii) Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, less capital expenditures for property and equipment, and (iv) General & Administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation as a percentage of Revenue, net. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes this definition is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company’s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses.

The company shows growth in agent network, revenue decline, and improved Adjusted EBITDA loss. CEO Marco Fregenal emphasizes growth strategy and cost optimization for profitable growth in 2024. Positive Fathom's real estate agent network grew by 13.7% to 11,795 agent licenses in Q4 2023. Total revenue decreased by 11.2% to $74.1 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $2.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to $5.9 million in Q4 2022. CEO Marco Fregenal highlights growth strategy and cost optimization for profitable growth in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Fathom Holdings Inc. indicate a mixed performance amidst a challenging real estate market. The company's growth in agent licenses, up 13.7%, outpaces the industry's decline, suggesting effective recruitment and retention strategies. However, the overall decrease in transactions and total revenue, with a 11.2% dip year-over-year, reflects the broader market's downturn influenced by rising interest rates and home prices.What catches the eye is the increased revenue in ancillary services, particularly the mortgage business, which grew by 19.1%. This diversification into mortgage services could be a strategic hedge against the volatility in real estate brokerage. The reduction in GAAP net loss by $1.5 million and the decrease in General and Administrative expenses by 6.3% reflect the company's cost-saving measures. However, the increase in stock compensation costs and interest and income tax expenses could be areas of concern for cash flow moving forward.Adjusted EBITDA, while still negative, has shown improvement, which could be indicative of a more efficient operational model. Investors might view the commitment to achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA as a positive signal, but it is essential to monitor subsequent quarters to confirm a sustainable trend. Market Research Analyst Fathom's strategic positioning within the real estate services industry, especially its investment in technology and ancillary services, is noteworthy. The company's resilience in transaction volume compared to the industry average suggests a competitive edge. However, it is vital to consider the broader economic context, with interest rates likely to continue influencing homebuyer behavior and the real estate market.The company's focus on optimizing its cost structure could be a response to these macroeconomic pressures. It is also interesting to note that despite the revenue decrease in its primary brokerage service, the growth in ancillary services like mortgage suggests a pivot towards more stable revenue streams. The long-term success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to maintain its service quality and competitive agent value proposition, which seems robust at the moment.Investors should also consider the potential long-term benefits of the company's SaaS offerings for brokerages and agents, as these could lead to recurring revenue and increased market penetration. The balance between immediate cost savings and continued investment in growth areas will be critical for the company's future performance. Economist The real estate sector is highly sensitive to economic cycles and Fathom's performance must be assessed in light of the prevailing economic conditions, such as interest rate hikes and housing market dynamics. The company's ability to grow its agent network in a declining market is commendable and could be attributed to its value proposition and strategic growth initiatives.However, the reduced transaction volume and revenue reflect the broader economic headwinds facing the industry. The emphasis on achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA is a prudent financial goal, but the path to this objective will be influenced by external economic factors, including monetary policy and consumer confidence.Analysing the company's financial health requires a nuanced understanding of these external pressures and the company's internal strategies to mitigate them. The improved Adjusted EBITDA loss is a positive indicator, but continuous evaluation of the company's performance against the backdrop of economic trends is necessary for a comprehensive assessment. 03/14/2024 - 04:09 PM – Company Targets Achieving and Remaining Adjusted EBITDA Positive Moving Forward – CARY, N.C., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fathom Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FTHM) (""Fathom"" or the ""Company""), a national, technology-driven, end-to-end real estate services platform integrating residential brokerage, mortgage, title, insurance, and SaaS offerings for brokerages and agents, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""Throughout the year we remained focused on our growth strategy and took meaningful steps to better position Fathom for profitable growth in 2024,"" said Fathom CEO Marco Fregenal. ""While the residential real estate industry remains challenging, we firmly believe that our future remains bright and by continuing to grow our agent base and optimize our cost structure, we are positioning Fathom for continued success as the industry rebounds. We believe we'll continue to attract high quality agent teams and brokerages going forward as our agent value proposition remains compelling in the current environment and our pipeline of opportunities remains robust. We're also seeing the benefits from the cost-reduction measures we've implemented and the new agent commission structure we announced last year, giving us increased confidence in our growth strategy and path to profitability."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Fathom's real estate agent network grew 13.7% to approximately 11,795 agent licenses at December 31, 2023, up from approximately 10,370 agent licenses at December 31, 2022, compared to an industry decline of approximately 1.61%. For the overall industry, real estate transactions in the 2023 fourth quarter declined by 13.8% compared to the 2022 fourth quarter, however, Fathom only saw a decrease of 11.0%, completing approximately 8,290 transactions for the 2023 fourth quarter. Real estate transactions decreased primarily due to the rise in interest rates in 2023 as well as higher home prices. Fathom's ability to stay ahead of the overall market decline in transactions is due to its continued strategic recruiting efforts and service commitment to its agents. Fathom's total revenue decreased 11.2 % for the 2023 fourth quarter to $74.1 million, from $83.4 million for the 2022 fourth quarter. Brokerage revenue decreased 12.8% in the 2023 fourth quarter primarily due to the decline in brokerage transactions, however, this decline was partially offset by a 19.1% increase in Fathom's ancillary services, particularly in Fathom's mortgage business. Segment revenue for the 2023 fourth quarter compared with the 2022 fourth quarter was as follows: Revenue Three months endedDecember 31, (Revenue $ in millions) 2023 2022 UNAUDITED Real Estate Brokerage $ 69.4 $ 79.5 Mortgage 1.8 1.3 Technology 0.8 0.7 Corporate and other services (a) 2.1 1.9 Total revenue $ 74.1 $ 83.4 (a) Transactions between segments are eliminated in consolidation. Such amounts are eliminated through the Corporate and other services line. GAAP net loss for the 2023 fourth quarter was $8.4 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with a net loss of $9.9 million, or $0.63 per share, for the 2022 fourth quarter. This $1.5 million reduction in loss was primarily due to the increase in ancillary revenues and to the cost savings efforts that began in 2022 and carried forward in 2023, partially offset by an increase in stock compensation costs and an increase in interest and income tax expenses. General and Administrative expense totaled $10.1 million for the 2023 fourth quarter, a decrease of 6.3% compared with $10.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Driven by many of the factors discussed above, Adjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP measure, improved to $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with an Adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fathom is committed to achieving and remaining Adjusted EBITDA positive moving forward. Fathom provides Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, because it offers additional information for monitoring the Company's cash flow performance. A table providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP measure, as well as an explanation of, and important disclosures about, this non-GAAP measure, is included in the tables at the end of this press release. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Fathom's real estate agent network grew 13.7% to approximately 11,795 agents at December 31, 2023, up from approximately 10,370 at December 31, 2022. Fathom completed approximately 38,139 real estate transactions in full year 2023, a 14.7% decrease relative to the prior year. In comparison, transaction volume for the overall industry fell 19% in full year 2023 compared to 2022. Total revenue for 2023 decreased by 16.4% to $345.2 million, from $412.9 million for 2022. For the year brokerage revenues declined by 16.7% and ancillary revenues declined by 11.3%. Overall revenues are lower in 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower transaction volumes attributable to rising home prices and, for much of the year, surging mortgage rates that made 2023 the least affordable market in decades. Segment revenue for the 2023 full year, compared with the 2022 full year was as follows: Revenue Year Ended December 31, (Revenue $ in millions) 2023 2022 Real Estate Brokerage $ 325.4 $ 390.6 Mortgage 7.2 9.6 Technology 3.2 2.7 Corporate and other services (a) 9.4 10.0 Total revenue $ 345.2 $ 412.9 (a) Transactions between segments are eliminated in consolidation. Such amounts are eliminated through the Corporate and other services line. GAAP net loss for the full 2023 year was $24.0 million, or a loss of $1.47 per share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $27.6 million, or a loss of $1.73 per share, for 2022. This reduction in net loss was attributable to our strategic cost saving efforts in all areas which included reductions in headcount, reductions in third party vendor costs, and payroll reductions for the management team, partially offset by an increase in stock compensation costs, amortization of intangible assets, and increases in interest and income tax expenses. General and Administrative expense totaled $38.8 million for the full 2023 year, a decrease of 10.3% compared with $43.2 million for the full 2022 year due to our cost cutting initiatives, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in stock compensation costs in 2023 compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4.1 million in 2023, versus an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $12.2 million for 2022 due to a $3.6 million reduction in net loss which included an increase in non-cash stock compensation costs of $3.9 million and an increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization of $0.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 decreased to $7.4 million from $8.3 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash was primarily related to our operating activities and continued investment in our technology platform, and includes the benefit of the $3.8 million and $4.2 million net proceeds from our debt financing completed in the second quarter and our common stock offering completed in December, respectively. 2023 Highlights In 2023, our agents paid $550 for each of their first 15 completed sales transactions, up from $500 on their first 12 sales transactions in 2022. After their fifteenth transaction, our agents paid $150 per transaction for the rest of their anniversary year, up from $99 per transaction in 2022.Fathom Realty expanded its operations in California through the addition of Advance 1 McKeever Realty.

Fathom believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about the Company's financial performance, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by Fathom's management for financial and operational decision-making. Fathom believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in its business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the expenses that the Company excludes in Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, Fathom believes the exclusion of share-based compensation expense and transaction-related costs associated with the Company's acquisition activity, provides a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of its operations and provides better transparency into its results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other income and expense, net which primarily includes nonrecurring items, such as, minor legal settlement claims, severance costs, professional fees related to investigating potential financing opportunities, if applicable, and other non-cash items representing reserves on certain agent fee collections. Fathom is presenting the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to assist investors in seeing its financial performance through the eyes of management, and because the Company believes this measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing Fathom's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA compared to net income (loss), the closest comparable GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that: Adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and stock options, which have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in Fathom's business and an important part of its compensation strategy;Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction-related costs primarily consisting of professional fees and any other costs incurred directly related to acquisition activity, which is an ongoing part of Fathom's growth strategy and therefore likely to occur; andAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized software, and acquisition related intangible asset costs, however, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future.

The company's year-end cash and investments of $14.8 million are expected to fund operations through Q1 '25. Multiple clinical opportunities in cancer types with high unmet medical need, along with upcoming clinical milestones, highlight the company's progress in 2023. Positive INT230-6 progresses into late-stage clinical trials for sarcoma and breast cancer. Year-end cash and investments of $14.8 million expected to fund operations through Q1 '25. Positive clinical results and regulatory progress for cancer treatment technology. Multiple clinical opportunities in high unmet medical need cancer types. Successful completion of Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 studies with favorable safety and efficacy data. Received Orphan Drug Designation for key ingredients in INT230-6 for soft tissue sarcoma treatment. Closed an up-sized IPO on Nasdaq, raising over $22 million in gross proceeds. Bolstered management team with key additions in finance, clinical operations, regulatory affairs, and manufacturing engineering. Anticipated near-term milestones include initiating Phase 3 sarcoma study and Phase 2/3 program in presurgical breast cancer. Financial results show increased research and development expenses but strong cash position to fund operations. Overall net loss increased due to non-cash items, including loss on debt conversion and preferred stock dividend. Negative None. Oncology Clinical Research Analyst The advancement of Intensity's INT230-6 into late-stage clinical programs notably impacts the oncology sector, specifically for sarcoma and breast cancer treatments. The drug's progression to a Phase 3 trial is a pivotal step, often acting as a precursor to potential FDA approval and commercialization. The reported efficacy, with 95% necrosis in tumors and a favorable safety profile, suggests a promising therapeutic alternative that could reshape current treatment paradigms. The successful IPO, resulting in a fortified cash position, provides the necessary capital to sustain operations and advance clinical trials. However, the true measure of success will hinge on the outcome of the Phase 3 trials and their ability to demonstrate significant survival benefits over current standard-of-care options. Biotech Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Intensity's year-end cash position of $14.8 million, following a successful IPO, offers a buffer to navigate the costly late-stage trial process. The company's burn rate and operational efficiency will be under scrutiny, as investors gauge the sustainability of their financial runway. The decrease in R&D expenses year-over-year indicates a strategic allocation of resources towards pivotal studies. However, increased G&A expenses reflect the costs associated with scaling up operations as a public entity. The non-cash losses reported are not uncommon in biotech IPOs and need to be considered in the context of long-term value creation. The stock market typically responds to such clinical and financial milestones, but it is the long-term trial outcomes and potential market penetration that will ultimately define the return on investment. Healthcare Market Research Analyst The market for cancer treatments remains highly competitive, with unmet medical needs driving innovation. Intensity's focus on cancers with high unmet needs, such as soft tissue sarcoma, positions the company in a niche yet critical segment. The Orphan Drug Designation is a strategic advantage, potentially offering market exclusivity and regulatory incentives. The company's technology, which leverages immune system activation, aligns with current trends in personalized medicine and immuno-oncology. Market adoption, however, will depend on comparative effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses against existing therapies. The upcoming clinical milestones will be closely watched by stakeholders as they will provide insights into the drug's market potential and impact on Intensity's valuation. 03/14/2024 - 04:09 PM INT230-6, Intensity's lead drug candidate, advances into late-stage clinical programs in sarcoma and breast cancerYear-end cash and investments of $14.8 million expected to fund operations through the end of Q1 '25Focusing on clinical operational and regulatory progress for a new technology to treat cancerMultiple clinical opportunities in cancer types having high unmet medical needUpcoming clinical milestonesSHELTON, Conn., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Intensity Therapeutics, Inc. (""Intensity"" or ""the Company"") (Nasdaq: INTS), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary, novel immune-based intratumoral cancer therapies designed to kill tumors and increase immune system recognition of cancers, announces full year 2023 financial results and provides a review of 2023 accomplishments and anticipated upcoming developments. 2023 and Other Recent Highlights Study May Proceed letter received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") for the Company's Phase 3 protocol in soft tissue sarcoma using INT230-6 (the ""INVINCIBLE-3"" study)Completed IT-01 study, a 110-patient Phase 1/2 study using INT230-6 in refractory cancersDosing completed in over 20 different cancers, with favorable safety and strong signals of efficacy shown with immune activationCompleted dosing, database lock and tables, listings and figures for a 91-patient Phase 2 study using INT230-6 in pre-adjuvant breast cancer (the ""INVINCIBLE-2"" study)Presented INVINCIBLE-2 data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (""SABCS"") in an oral podium spotlight discussion sessionINT230-6 induced up to 95% necrosis in tumors following a single injectionFavorable safety profile observedIncrease in CD4 T-cells and NK cells observed within tumorsData presented at Connective Tissue Oncology Society (""CTOS"") Annual Meeting showing INT230-6 extended survival in refractory soft tissue sarcoma subjects by 15 months compared to a synthetic control group with a 93% disease control rate when used as monotherapyReceived Orphan Drug Designation for the three key ingredients in INT230-6 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomaPresented two posters at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (""ASCO"") Annual Meeting reporting anti-cancer immune activation in both breast cancer and sarcoma, which are cancers that are considered to be non-immunogenicClosed an up-sized initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange with a full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option at the top of the range, raising over $22 million in gross proceedsBolstered management team by adding Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Clinical Operations, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and manufacturing engineering staff""We had a pivotal year in 2023 culminating with the receipt of an FDA 'Study May Proceed' letter to enter into Phase 3 clinical trials for our lead drug candidate, INT230-6 for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma,"" said Lewis H. Bender, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our selection this year by the review committees at ASCO, CTOS and SABCS, including oral podium presentations, validated our science and indicated interest by oncologists in our results. We are on track to initiate our Phase 3 sarcoma study in mid-2024. Following our IPO, our cash position remains strong, and we believe we have sufficient runway to meet near term milestones."" In the INVINCIBLE-3 study, the Company plans to enroll 333 patients with an endpoint of overall survival. ""Current U.S. standard-of-care drugs used for sarcoma after progression of the first line therapies require extensive safety monitoring. The standard-of-care (""SOC"") medicines cause severe toxicities and provide median overall survival of only between 12 to 15 months depending on the drug and sarcoma subtype,"" stated Mr. Bender. ""Our data suggests the potential for a significant survival increase with fewer and less severe toxicities. Sarcoma patients are in need of new and meaningful ways to treat their disease. A successful outcome of our Phase 3 survival study could be critical in treatment of other fatty, dense tumor types such as breast and pancreatic cancers."" The Company also plans to initiate a Phase 2/3 program in presurgical breast cancer with the start of a Phase 2 randomized controlled trial testing two doses of INT230-6 prior to SOC compared to the SOC alone (the ""INVINCIBLE-4"" study). The endpoint for this portion of the study is the change in the pathological complete response rate for the combination, which is an accepted FDA endpoint for accelerated approval. The Company expects to initiate INVINCIBLE-4 in mid-2024, which will provide data to size the Phase 3 portion of the program. As Dr. Angel Arnout M.D., MSc., and the Principal Investigator from the INVINCIBLE-2 study stated in San Antonio, ""the ability for INT230-6 to induce necrosis and noted immune effects prior to a patient's surgery, while maintaining a favorable safety profile, would be a major move forward for the treatment paradigm of breast cancer and potentially many other cancers."" The Company will provide further updates on the progress of this study in the coming months. Anticipated Near-Term Milestones Initiate INVINCIBLE-3 Study in certain metastatic soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. The Company plans to enroll 333 patients with an endpoint of overall survival. The study will compare INT230-6 as a monotherapy treatment to the three current SOC drugs in 2nd and 3rd line soft tissue sarcoma subtypes.Initiate the Phase 2/3 program in presurgical breast cancer with the start of INVINCIBLE-4, a Phase 2 randomized controlled trial testing two doses of INT230-6 prior to SOC (immune-chemotherapy) compared to the SOC alone. The endpoint for this portion of the study is the change in the pathological complete response rate for the combination. The Company expects to initiate INVINCIBLE-4 in mid-2024, which will provide data to size the Phase 3 portion of the program.Year-End 2023 Financial Results Research and development expenses were $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of enrollment in the IT-01 study in mid-2022. This decrease was partially offset by higher 2023 expenses for start-up work on the INVINCIBLE-3 study and a new manufacturing batch of INT230-6. General and administrative expenses were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to salary and bonus increases, including the hiring of a new chief financial officer in the fourth quarter of 2023, higher stock-based compensation expense, and overall higher accounting fees, consulting, directors and officers insurance and other expenses as we transitioned into a publicly traded company. In 2023, the Company also recognized a non-cash $2.3 million loss on debt conversion at the time of the initial public offering, along with a non-cash preferred stock deemed dividend of $1.3 million, representing the value that was transferred to the Series B and C preferred stockholders upon triggering of anti-dilution provisions. Overall, net loss was $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaled $14.8 million, which the Company expects will be sufficient to fund operations through the end of the first quarter in 2025. About INT230-6 INT230-6, Intensity's lead proprietary investigational product candidate, is designed for direct intratumoral injection. INT230-6 was discovered using Intensity's proprietary DfuseRx℠ technology platform. The drug is composed of two proven, potent anti-cancer agents, cisplatin and vinblastine, and a penetration enhancer molecule (SHAO) that helps disperse potent cytotoxic drugs throughout tumors for diffusion into cancer cells. These agents remain in the tumor resulting in a favorable safety profile. In addition to local disease control, direct killing of the tumor by INT230-6 releases a bolus of neoantigens specific to the patient's malignancy, leading to engagement of the immune system and systemic anti-tumor effects. Importantly, these effects are mediated without immunosuppression that so often occurs with systemic chemotherapy. About Intensity Therapeutics Intensity Therapeutics is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company that applies novel engineered chemistry to turn ""cold"" tumors ""hot"" by enabling its aqueous cytotoxic-containing drug product, INT230-6, to mix and saturate the dense, high-fat pressurized environment of the tumor. As a result of the saturation, Intensity's clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of INT230-6 to kill tumors and elicit an adaptive immune response within days of injection, representing a novel approach to cancer cell death that holds the potential to shift the treatment paradigm and turn many deadly cancers into chronic diseases. INT230-6 has completed enrollment of over 200 patients in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial (NCT03058289) and Phase 2 randomized control clinical trial in breast cancer (the INVINCIBLE 2 study) (NCT04781725). The Company is initiating a Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma (the INVINCIBLE 3 study) (NCT06263231), testing INT230-6 as second or third line monotherapy compared to the standard of care with overall survival as an endpoint. The Company is also planning a Phase 2/3 program in presurgical triple negative breast cancer testing INT230-6 in combination with standard of care compared to standard of care alone.

Positive Revenue declined in Q4 2023 by 2.4% YoY and 4.0% on a currency neutral basis, with Creative revenue up 0.5% YoY and Editorial revenue down 7.9% YoY. Net Income for Q4 was $39.1 million compared to a Net Loss of $23.3 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $72.2 million, down 4.5% YoY, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 31.9%. Annual Subscription Revenue as a percentage of total revenue grew to 54.5% in Q4 2023.

Key Performance Indicators for the last twelve months showed growth in total purchasing customers, active annual subscribers, and image collection. The company provided a financial outlook for 2024, with revenue expected to be between $928 million to $947 million and Adjusted EBITDA around $298 million. Getty Images maintained fiscal discipline and strong profitability despite revenue challenges. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Getty Images' financial results reveal a mixed picture. On the one hand, revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and full year suggests market challenges, possibly due to external factors like the Hollywood strikes. However, the increase in annual subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue indicates a strategic shift towards more stable, recurring income streams. This shift may improve predictability and stability in earnings, which could be viewed favorably by investors looking for long-term value.The company's ability to generate healthy free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet amidst revenue declines demonstrates financial resilience. It's also worth noting the significant net income margin improvement from the previous year. This turnaround, partly due to a substantial tax benefit, might be a one-off event, but it also reflects cost management efforts that could lead to sustainable profitability improvements. Financial Analyst The reported net income improvement is significant, especially considering the previous year's net loss. However, investors should be cautious about the non-recurring tax benefit that contributed to this result. The underlying operational performance, as indicated by the Adjusted EBITDA, shows a modest decline, which could be a better indicator of the company's ongoing profitability.Getty Images' debt levels are substantial, with over $1 billion in term loans and senior notes. The debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios would be key figures to assess the company's financial leverage and risk. The liquidity position seems adequate with the available revolver, but the cost of capital and refinancing risk in the current economic environment could impact future profitability and strategic flexibility. Legal Expert The loss on litigation and the subsequent recovery from the D&O insurance policy are notable items that affected the financial results. Investors should consider the implications of such legal disputes on the company's reputation and operational focus. While the recovery is positive, the frequency and magnitude of legal expenses could signal underlying risks in the company's business practices or industry challenges.Additionally, the change in fair value of the euro term loan indicates exposure to currency risk. Companies operating globally, like Getty Images, must manage foreign exchange risk effectively, as adverse movements can impact debt servicing costs and overall financial stability. 03/14/2024 - 04:07 PM NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Getty Images Holdings, Inc. “Getty Images” or the “Company”) (NYSE: GETY), a preeminent global visual content creator and marketplace, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “In a difficult 2023, Getty Images continued to lay a strong foundation grounded in our core value propositions of helping our customers create at a higher level, saving them time and money and eliminating risk,” said Craig Peters, Chief Executive Officer at Getty Images. “Central to this foundation is Getty Images’ high-quality content and coverage derived from industry-leading talent, committed and long-standing partnerships, exclusive access, extensive research and rare expertise.” “In 2023, we remained fiscally disciplined, generated healthy levels of free cash flow, and ended the year with a strong balance sheet,” said Jenn Leyden, Chief Financial Officer at Getty Images. “And as we look to 2024, we believe that we are well positioned to return to top line growth while remaining fiscally disciplined to continue to deliver healthy profitability.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Summary: Revenue of $225.9 million declined 2.4% year over year and 4.0% on a currency neutral basis.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. We also evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP) and currency neutral basis. We believe presenting currency neutral information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided below. The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information, such as foreign currency impacts necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.

Financial Analyst Brilliant Earth's performance demonstrates a notable deviation from industry standards with a significant outperformance in net sales growth. The 750 basis points lead over the industry average is a strong indicator of the company's competitive edge and market share capture. However, the decline in adjusted EBITDA by 32.8% year-over-year raises questions about the sustainability of profitability amidst this growth. The reduction in average order value (AOV) by 13.0% could signal a shift in consumer behavior or pricing strategies that warrant further scrutiny.Investors should consider the implications of the company's gross margin improvement, which surpasses the industry norm and could reflect operational efficiency or a higher mix of premium product sales. The reported net sales increase of 1.5% juxtaposed with a net income decline of 75.1% suggests a deeper analysis of cost management and expense allocation is required to understand the underlying factors affecting profitability. Market Research Analyst The jewelry industry is witnessing a dynamic shift with omnichannel strategies becoming increasingly important. Brilliant Earth's expansion with 12 new showrooms aligns with this trend, potentially enhancing customer experience and reinforcing brand loyalty. The company's focus on ethically sourced fine jewelry also taps into growing consumer demand for sustainability, which could be a driving force behind their impressive sales growth.However, the decrease in net income despite growing net sales and orders points to potential inefficiencies or increased costs that could be related to the expansion of physical showrooms. The long-term impact of these investments on operational costs and the balance between online and offline sales channels will be critical to monitor for future profitability. Sustainability Expert Brilliant Earth's commitment to ethically sourced products is not only a moral choice but also a strategic business decision. As consumers become more conscious of the origins of their purchases, companies like Brilliant Earth that prioritize ethical sourcing could benefit from increased customer loyalty and willingness to pay a premium. This ethical stance is likely contributing to the company's strong gross margin figures.However, the company's ability to maintain its ethical sourcing standards while scaling up and potentially facing supply chain pressures will be a challenge. Stakeholders should assess how these factors might influence cost structures and the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge in a market where sustainability is becoming increasingly important. 03/14/2024 - 04:10 PM Growth Rate Exceeded the Industry by an Estimated 750 bps in 2023Exceeded Profitability Expectations and Increased 2023 Gross Margin by 430 bps to 57.6%Generated 2023 GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.04 and 2023 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.17Provides Q1 and Full Year 2024 Guidance SAN FRANCISCO, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brilliant Earth Group, Inc.

Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA margin. These non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful information in evaluating our operating performance and exclude certain items from net income that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period to period. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, costs to fund the Brilliant Earth Foundation and transaction costs and other expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA calculated as a percentage of net sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define Adjusted Net income as net income adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, costs to fund the Brilliant Earth Foundation and transaction costs and other expenses. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net income, divided by the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. The diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding is derived from the historical diluted weighted average shares of common stock assuming such shares were outstanding for the entirety of the period presented. We believe Adjusted Net income and Adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share, which eliminate the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provide useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. Please refer to “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” located in the financial supplement in this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. This release includes forward-looking guidance for certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. These measures will differ from net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, in ways similar to those described in the reconciliations at the end of this release. We are not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, guidance for net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because the Company is not able to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or nature of all items that will be included in net income. This press release also contains certain key business metrics which are used to evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We define total orders as the total number of customer orders delivered less total orders returned in a given period (excluding those repair, resize, and other orders which have no revenue). We view total orders as a key indicator of the velocity of our business and an indication of the desirability of our products to our customers. Total orders, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net sales we expect to recognize in a given period. Total orders may fluctuate based on the number of visitors to our website and showrooms, and our ability to convert these visitors to customers. We believe that total orders is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. We define average order value, or AOV, as net sales in a given period divided by total orders in that period. We believe that AOV is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. AOV varies depending on the product type and number of items per order. AOV may also fluctuate as we expand into and increase our presence in additional product categories and price points, and open additional showrooms.

Financial Analyst The reported financials from Smartsheet indicate a substantial growth in revenue and a significant improvement in operating cash flow and free cash flow. The transition from a GAAP operating loss to a non-GAAP operating income highlights the company's ability to manage costs and improve profitability. The increase in subscription revenue by 23% year over year is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a stable and growing customer base. The annualized recurring revenue surpassing $1 billion is a critical milestone, reflecting the company's market position and potential for sustainable growth.Investors should note the improved dollar-based net retention rate of 116%, indicating existing customers are spending more year over year. This metric, along with the growth in the number of customers with higher ARR, suggests increased product penetration and customer loyalty. However, the projected ARR year-over-year growth of 14% for fiscal year 2025 might signal a deceleration in growth, which could be a point of concern for long-term growth expectations. Market Research Analyst Smartsheet's positioning as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Collaborative Work Management and the release of new generative AI capabilities are strategic moves to differentiate its offerings in a competitive market. The investment in enhanced security and platform scalability addresses enterprise needs for robust solutions, potentially increasing its appeal to larger organizations. The expansion into Australia with local data hosting can be seen as a targeted growth strategy to capitalize on regional market opportunities.While the company's financial outlook for fiscal year 2025 forecasts solid revenue growth, the tech sector is known for rapid changes. Innovations like generative AI tools could either provide a competitive edge or require further investment to keep up with evolving customer expectations and tech advancements. The company's ability to execute on its product roadmap and maintain its market leadership will be critical for continued investor confidence. Legal Expert The mention of non-GAAP financial measures is significant for stakeholders as these figures often exclude one-time expenses and other non-recurring items, providing a clearer picture of the company's operational performance. It is important to recognize that while non-GAAP measures can be useful for analysis, they are not standardized and can vary widely between companies. Stakeholders should consider both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when evaluating the company's financial health.The lack of reconciliation for free cash flow and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding guidance due to uncertainty and variability is not uncommon, but it does introduce an element of risk. Investors should be aware of this and might seek additional clarity on potential reconciling items as they could materially impact the financial outlook. 03/14/2024 - 04:07 PM Surpassed $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue in the fourth quarter Fourth quarter total revenue grew 21% year over year to $256.9 million Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $59.7 million and free cash flow of $56.3 million Ended the year with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $628.8 million BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR), the enterprise work management platform, today announced financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. “Strong demand from our enterprise customers helped us achieve the major milestone of $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue in Q4,” said Mark Mader, CEO of Smartsheet. “Looking forward, we’re setting the foundation for the next era of profitable growth with proven, more efficient go-to-market motions paired with enterprise-grade product innovation informed by decades of data, work patterns, and customer use cases.” Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights Revenue: Total revenue was $256.9 million, an increase of 21% year over year.

The section titled ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information. The section titled ""Definitions of Key Business Metrics"" contains definitions of certain non-financial metrics provided within this earnings release. Financial Outlook For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company currently expects: Total revenue of $257 million to $259 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17% to 18% Non-GAAP operating income of $32 million to $34 million Non-GAAP net income per share of $0.26 to $0.27, assuming diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 141.0 million For the full fiscal year 2025, the Company currently expects: Total revenue of $1,113 million to $1,118 million, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 17% Non-GAAP operating income of $135 million to $145 million Non-GAAP net income per share of $1.06 to $1.13, assuming diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 142.2 million ARR year-over-year growth of 14% Free cash flow of $200 million We have not reconciled free cash flow or diluted weighted-average shares outstanding guidance to their most directly comparable GAAP measure due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, the related reconciling items. For those reasons, we are also unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Accordingly, a reconciliation for free cash flow and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding guidance is not available without unreasonable effort. _________________ 1Gartner® is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and Magic Quadrant™ and Gartner Peer Insights™ are registered trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and are used herein with permission.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about Smartsheet’s outlook for the first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2024 and the full fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, and Smartsheet’s expectations regarding possible or assumed business strategies, potential growth and innovation opportunities, new products, and potential market opportunities. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “potential,” “remain,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to: our ability to achieve future growth and sustain our growth rate; our ability to attract and retain customers and increase sales to our customers; our ability to develop and release new products and services and to scale our platform; our ability to increase adoption of our platform through our self-service model; our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with strategic partners; the highly competitive and rapidly evolving market in which we participate; our ability to identify targets for, execute on, or realize the benefits of, potential acquisitions; and our international expansion strategies. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results is included in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 to be filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to such GAAP measures can be found in the accompanying financial statements included with this press release. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial metrics to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP operating loss excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, one-time costs associated with mergers and acquisitions, lease restructuring costs, and litigation expenses and settlements related to matters that are outside the ordinary course of our business, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss excluding non-recurring income tax adjustments associated with mergers and acquisitions and the same exclusions that are used to derive non-GAAP operating income (loss). We define basic non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted-average shares outstanding (""WASO""). We define diluted non-GAAP net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted WASO. Diluted WASO includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities, which include stock options, restricted share units, performance share units, and shares subject to our 2018 employee stock purchase plan. If there is a non-GAAP net loss, basic and diluted loss per share are the same number as all potentially dilutive securities would have an antidilutive impact. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures as compared to GAAP operating loss and net loss, including that the non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, which is defined as GAAP net cash flows from operating activities, reduced by cash used for purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of spend on internal-use software) and principal payments on finance lease obligations. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures and operational expenses, for investment in our business and to make acquisitions. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. There are a number of limitations related to the use of free cash flow as compared to net cash from operating activities, including that free cash flow includes capital expenditures, the benefits of which are realized in periods subsequent to those when expenditures are made. We define calculated billings as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue in the period. Because we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription term, calculated billings can be used to measure our subscription sales activity for a particular period, to compare subscription sales activity across particular periods, and as an indicator of future subscription revenue. Definitions of Key Business Metrics In the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, management re-evaluated its key business metrics and as a result annualized contract value (“ACV”) will now be referred to as annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”). We believe the change will result in key business metrics that more closely align with our industry peers and with how management views growth in the business and evaluates financial performance. The change from ACV to ARR did not have a material impact to our key business metrics in the current or any prior reporting period. The definition and calculation of the key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies. Annualized recurring revenue We define annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, as the annualized recurring value of all active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. We exclude the value of non-recurring revenue streams, such as our professional services revenue, that are recognized at a point in time. We use ARR as one of our operating measures to assess the strength of the Company’s subscription services. ARR is a performance metric and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue, and is not intended to be a substitute for, or combined with, any of these items. Both multi-year contracts and contracts with terms less than one year are annualized by dividing the total committed contract value by the number of months in the subscription term and then multiplying by twelve. Annualizing contracts with terms less than one year results in amounts being included in our ARR calculation that are in excess of the total contract value for those contracts at the end of the reporting period. The value of subscription contracts that are sold through third-party resellers, wherein we do not have visibility into the pricing provided, is based on the list price. ARR growth is calculated by dividing the ARR as of a period end by the ARR for the corresponding period end of the prior fiscal year. Average ARR per domain-based customer We use average ARR per domain-based customer to measure customer commitment to our platform and sales force productivity. We define average ARR per domain-based customer as total outstanding ARR for domain-based subscriptions as of the end of the reporting period divided by the number of domain-based customers as of the same date. We define domain-based customers as organizations with a unique email domain name. Dollar-based net retention rate We calculate dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”). Current Period ARR includes any upsells and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing 12 months, but excludes subscription revenue from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Any ARR obtained through merger and acquisition transactions does not affect the dollar-based net retention rate until one year from the date on which the transaction closed. The dollar-based net retention rate is used by us to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships and is driven by our ability to retain and expand the subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.

(EVOK) reported a significant 107% increase in net product sales for fiscal year 2023, totaling $5.2M, with projected net revenue of $14M for 2024. The company focused on expanding market share for GIMOTI nasal spray, resulting in a rise in prescribers, prescription fills, and patient enrollments. Recent developments include reduced healthcare resource utilization with GIMOTI, transition to ASPN Pharmacies for enhanced prescription processes, strengthened patent estate, and improved cash position through a $7.5M public offering. Positive Fiscal year 2023 net product sales increased by 107% to $5.2M compared to 2022. Company projects $14M in net revenue for 2024. GIMOTI nasal spray saw a 66% rise in cumulative prescribers, totaling 1,689 by the end of 2023. Prescription fills and patient enrollments increased by 100% and 88% respectively, year-over-year. Reduced healthcare resource utilization data demonstrated cost savings benefits of GIMOTI over oral metoclopramide. Transitioned Pharmacy Service Partnership to ASPN Pharmacies to improve prescription processes and revenues. Issued two patents in 2023 for GIMOTI, strengthening intellectual property position. Closed a $7.5M public offering in February 2024, with potential for up to an additional $22.5M through common stock warrants. Real-world evidence showed GIMOTI's superiority over traditional treatments, leading to decreased hospitalizations and ER visits, saving over $15,000 per patient in six months. Strong market trust in GIMOTI was reinforced at major gastroenterology conferences like Digestive Disease Week 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 107% increase in net product sales to $5.2M for Evoke Pharma signifies a robust year-over-year growth, surpassing the biotech industry's average growth rate. This surge is indicative of effective commercial strategies and could be a positive signal to investors regarding the company's revenue-generating capabilities. The projection of $14M in net revenue for 2024 suggests a confident outlook on the company's part, potentially due to the increased adoption of GIMOTI. However, the reliance on a single product can be a risk factor, as it exposes the company to market volatility and competitive pressures.From a financial perspective, the improved cash position through a $7.5M public offering extends the company's operational runway, which is crucial for maintaining R&D and marketing efforts. The availability of an additional $22.5M if warrants are exercised could provide further financial stability. However, investors should be aware of the potential for dilution.It's also worth noting that cost savings of over $15,000 per patient could make GIMOTI an attractive option for payors, potentially leading to increased market penetration and sustained revenue growth. The partnership transition to ASPN Pharmacies could also be a strategic move to expand distribution channels and improve the prescription process, which may positively impact future sales. Market Research Analyst The significant increase in prescription fills and patient enrollments for GIMOTI, along with the 66% rise in cumulative prescribers, reflects a growing acceptance of the product in the market. This data points to successful marketing efforts and the potential for GIMOTI to capture a larger share of the gastroparesis treatment market. The emphasis on operational excellence and the addition of new prescribers are key indicators of a company strategically positioning its product.Furthermore, the presentation of healthcare resource utilization data at prominent gastroenterology conferences has likely contributed to the product's credibility among medical professionals. The evidence suggesting a decrease in healthcare resource burdens by using GIMOTI could lead to its endorsement as a standard of care for diabetic gastroparesis, which would significantly enhance its market potential.The decision by Teva Pharmaceuticals not to pursue a paragraph 4 certification challenge against GIMOTI is a positive development, as it removes a potential barrier to market exclusivity. This fortification of Evoke's patent estate is an important aspect for investors, as it provides a more secure competitive advantage and could deter generic competition in the near term. Healthcare Industry Analyst The real-world evidence presented regarding GIMOTI's effectiveness and cost savings for patients and payors is a strong endorsement of the product's value proposition in the healthcare market. The data presented at DDW 2023 and ACG 2023 could influence prescribing habits, especially in a healthcare environment increasingly focused on cost-effectiveness and outcomes.Moreover, the transition to ASPN Pharmacies could improve access to GIMOTI, which is a positive development for patient care. The broader PBM agreements might streamline the prescription process, potentially improving treatment adherence and patient outcomes.It is also significant that the company has secured additional patents and Orange Book listings for GIMOTI in 2023. These developments not only protect the product from generic competition but also signal to the market that the company is serious about defending its intellectual property, a key factor for long-term sustainability in the pharmaceutical industry. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Fiscal year 2023 net product sales from prescriptions totaled approximately $5.2M, a 107% increase from 2022 Company projects $14M in net revenue for 2024 SOLANA BEACH, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evoke Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an emphasis on GIMOTI® (metoclopramide) nasal spray, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and recent corporate developments. ""In 2023, we focused on operational excellence to expand GIMOTI’s market share and ensure its availability for patients requiring an improved gastroparesis treatment. Our commercial team’s dedicated efforts yielded a 107% increase in year-over-year revenue,” stated Dave Gonyer, R.Ph., CEO of Evoke Pharma. “The new Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) data has only been available to our commercial team since near the end of the year. We believe it is just starting to drive growth beginning with the addition of new prescribers, a rise in prescription fills, and an uptick in patient enrollments, solidifying 2023 as an important year for our product’s market presence. As of December 31, 2023, we’ve seen a 66% rise in cumulative prescribers from the previous year, totaling 1,689. Prescription fills and patient enrollments also climbed significantly by 100% and 88% respectively, year-over-year,” Mr. Gonyer added. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Developments and Recent Highlights: Continued Advocacy for GIMOTI as the Standard of Care for Diabetic Gastroparesis Treatment Healthcare resource utilization data presented at DDW 2023 revealed that there is statistically signficantly less burden on healthcare resources and facilities such as hospitical admissions, emergency department and physician office visits with patients who are being prescirbed GIMOTI versus those on oral metoclopramide.Based on the reduced utilization data, additional compelling cost data presented in a distinguished plenary session at ACG 2023 demonstrated financial savings benefits of GIMOTI for patients and payors compared to oral metoclopramide.Abstract focused on the HCRU of diabetic gastroparesis care in women using nasal metoclopramide to be presented at DDW 2024. Transitioned Pharmacy Service Partnership to ASPN Pharmacies Aiming to enhance patient prescription process and enhance revenues through ASPN’s extensive network of partners with broader PBM agreements. Fortified Patent Estate for GIMOTI Two patents issued in 2023 covering the methods of use for GIMOTI including two Orange Book listings.Teva Pharmaceuticals determination not to pursue a paragraph 4 certification against Gimoti without financial or other consideration further enhanced Evoke’s intellectual property position and eliminated 180-day exclusivity opportunity for later possible generic seeking entities for the future. Improved Cash Position In February 2024, the Company closed a $7.5M public offering with fundamental, healthcare-oriented institutional investors providing the company runway into the fourth quarter of 2024 with up to an additional $22.5M available if common stock warrants are exercised in full. Mr. Gonyer concluded, “2023 was a milestone year for GIMOTI with new real-world evidence demonstrating its superiority over traditional treatments and data showing a marked decrease in hospitalization and ER visits for GIMOTI over oral metoclopramide which translated into savings of over $15,000 per patient in only six months. Our results at major gastroenterology conferences including Digestive Disease Week 2023 have strengthened market trust in GIMOTI, bolstering our goal to make it the standard treatment for diabetic gastroparesis. Current and new IP protections, coupled with new inquiries about the prevalence GLP-1 associated diabetic gastroparesis, and the recent capital boost from our public offering further position us to scale our operations and achieve sustained business growth.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Review and Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2023, net product sales were approximately $1.7 million compared with $0.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, and the net loss was approximately $2.0 million, or $0.59 per share compared with $1.8 million, or $0.54 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022.

The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to higher net product sales in 2023, resulting from: Prescription sales through pharmacy service partnership with ASPN Pharmacy;Recapture of prescriptions sent to retail pharmacies without ability to order product; andMarketing of head-to-head real-world data comparing Gimoti to oral metoclopramide showing improvements in fewer hospitalizations and ER visits with GIMOTI. Research and development expenses totaled approximately $23,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $27,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, research and development expenses were approximately $0.2 million compared with approximately $0.3 million for the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2023 selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were approximately $3.5 million compared with $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $12.2 million versus approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in SG&A costs year-over-year resulted primarily from higher marketing and Eversana profit sharing costs. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue to progress with the commercialization of GIMOTI. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately $3.6 million compared with $2.3 million for the same period of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total operating expenses were approximately $12.6 million compared with approximately $10.3 million for the full year of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.7 million. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds of approximately $6.1 million from the public offering closed in February 2024, as well as future cash flows from net product sales of Gimoti, will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. Evoke projects net revenue in 2024 of approximately $14 million. Evoke’s 2024 guidance is dependent on its current business and expectations, including recent growth rates in net sales, assumptions regarding reimbursements and prescription fills, as well as factors that are outside of our control, such as the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, continued supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. About Evoke Pharma, Inc. Evoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The company developed, commercialized and markets GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults. Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.

We believe building a system at the NQCC could enable even more innovative discoveries to deepen our understanding of how to improve superconducting quantum computers with the goal of solving practical problems currently intractable by classical resources alone,” said Dr. Subodh Kulkarni, Rigetti CEO. On-Premise QPU Capabilities Mature with Novera™ QPU LaunchIn December 2023, Rigetti launched the Novera QPU (quantum processing unit), a 9-qubit QPU based on the Company’s Ankaa™-class chip architecture. The Novera QPU is Rigetti’s first commercially available QPU. After identifying an emerging market of researchers needing hands-on access to a quantum computer with high performing qubits, Rigetti made the strategic decision to meet the anticipated growing demand with its in-house quantum foundry capabilities and years of experience building 9-qubit QPUs for internal R&D. Rigetti designs and manufactures its QPUs at Fab-1, the industry’s first dedicated and integrated quantum device and manufacturing facility, located in Fremont, California. Rigetti has now completed two Novera QPU sales, both to leading national labs. The first sale was to the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center (SQMS) led by Fermilab in the second quarter of 2023 as part of the Company’s partnership with SQMS as its lead industry partner. QPU Sales Grow with Delivery of Novera QPU to AFRLIn the third quarter of 2023, Rigetti delivered its second Novera QPU to the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Information Directorate as part of the Company’s Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The IDIQ contract enables AFRL to harness Rigetti’s fabrication capabilities for quantum networking hardware research and development. “A key objective of AFRL's Information Directorate quantum networking program is to develop interfaces between leading quantum technologies to enhance the functionality, scalability, and application space of quantum networking hardware. This includes innovating new interfaces to enable the operation of superconducting qubit platforms with telecom light,"" said Matthew LaHaye, Senior Research Physicist at AFRL Information Directorate. “AFRL researchers plan to utilize the Novera QPU, in conjunction with photonic integrated circuitry, for novel investigations of light delivery and collection in the control and measurement of superconducting quantum processors. This work will entail fundamental studies of light-matter interactions and engineering of new, reduced-footprint techniques for cryogenic optical i/o,” LaHaye added.

Awarded Phase 2 of DARPA Quantum Benchmarking Program Building on the work completed in Phase 1 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum Benchmarking program aiming to develop a resource estimation framework to provide insight into the requirements of a superconducting quantum computing system necessary for solving large-scale, complex problems, Rigetti was awarded Phase 2, the goal of which is refining and optimizing the estimates for selected utility-scale problems, delivering new upper bounds on these requirements. Phase 2 is expected to be heavily focused on researching fault-tolerant quantum applications. Of particular interest are dynamical chemistry simulations and modeling the dynamics of quantum systems. The University of Technology Sydney, Aalto University, and the University of Southern California will continue to be project partners in Phase 2. Partners with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Riverlane to Integrate and Benchmark Rigetti Quantum Computers with ORNL’s Summit SupercomputerRecently, Rigetti announced that it is partnering with Riverlane and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to work to improve HPC-quantum integration. To develop the integration of quantum computers into HPC environments, the project partners plan to build the first-ever benchmarking suite for measuring the performance of a joint HPC + quantum system, to be run on ORNL’s Summit supercomputer. For the quantum components, researchers plan to use simulated hardware based on key elements of Riverlane’s quantum error correction stack and real remote hardware located at Rigetti’s headquarters in California. Technology Roadmap and QPU Performance Milestones Deploys 84-Qubit Ankaa-2 System with a 2.5X Increase in Error PerformanceFollowing the internal deployment of the 84-qubit Ankaa-1 system in March 2023, Rigetti’s 84-qubit Ankaa-2 system was made publicly available in December 2023 — making it the Company’s highest qubit count QPU available to the public. In addition to the new chip architecture that features a square lattice and tunable couplers, Rigetti implemented several technology updates to the system, including a new chip fabrication process, new printed circuit board technology, and electronics improvements, that contributed to Ankaa-2 achieving a 98% median 2-qubit gate fidelity — a 2.5X increase in error performance compared to the Company’s previous QPUs. Building on Performance Success of Ankaa-2; Announces Ankaa-3 Launch Plan The Company plans to develop and deploy its anticipated 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system with the goal of achieving a 99% median 2-qubit gate fidelity by the end of 2024, and to develop the 336-qubit Lyra™ system thereafter. “We are confident in our ability to build better performing QPUs, as evidenced by our impressive Ankaa-2 performance. We believe we have laid the groundwork for building scalable, high performing QPUs with our proven modular chip architecture and the innovative Ankaa chip design that resulted in a 98% median 2-qubit gate fidelity. We are excited for the anticipated development and deployment of our Ankaa-3 system, which we believe will demonstrate the excellence and ingenuity of our engineering, software, and hardware teams,” said David Rivas, Rigetti CTO. “We believe our leadership and expertise in full-stack quantum systems paired with our strong collaborations with researchers around the world across academia, industry, and government, puts us in a unique position to tackle the challenges of building a quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. With Rigetti QPUs now in two research labs internationally, we are even more optimistic that practical quantum computing is in reach,” said Dr. Kulkarni.

The company acquired oil and gas assets, increasing book value per share to $5.90. Acacia's strategic acquisitions and IP initiatives are poised to generate future cash flows and shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Acacia Research Corporation indicate a substantial increase in revenue, primarily driven by the Intellectual Property (IP) operations which surged from $2.5 million to $82.8 million in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This remarkable growth in IP revenue is a strong indicator of the company's successful licensing initiatives, particularly concerning their WiFi-6 technology. The sale of Arix Bioscience Plc shares and the subsequent capital gain reflect a strategic divestment that has contributed to the company's liquidity, enhancing its ability to pursue further acquisitions.From an investment perspective, the company's shift towards acquiring cash flow-generating oil and gas assets is a noteworthy diversification strategy that could hedge against the volatility of IP income. However, the energy sector's inherent risks, such as fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory challenges, must be taken into account. The company's zero total indebtedness at the parent company level and the minimal non-recourse debt at Benchmark are positive signs of a strong balance sheet, which is crucial for supporting future growth and withstanding industry downturns. Market Research Analyst The significant increase in book value per share, from $5.04 to $5.90, signals a robust financial position and could be attractive to investors seeking companies with a strong equity base. The company's strategic acquisitions, especially in the oil and gas sector, suggest a pivot towards stable, long-term asset growth. This move may appeal to investors looking for companies with diversified revenue streams beyond their core IP business. The entry into the energy market, particularly the Western Anadarko Basin, is a calculated step into a mature and prolific resource play, potentially offering steady cash flows and growth opportunities.However, the energy sector's performance is tied to geopolitical and environmental factors which could introduce volatility to the company's earnings. Investors should also consider the scalability of Acacia's business model and its ability to integrate and manage its diverse portfolio, which now spans IP, industrial operations and energy. Legal Expert The substantial revenue from IP licensing suggests that Acacia has a strong portfolio of patents, especially in the WiFi-6 space, that are highly marketable and legally robust. The ability to generate significant income from these assets indicates effective intellectual property management and a strategic approach to licensing. The legal landscape for IP is complex and constantly evolving, so Acacia's success in this area could be seen as a testament to their legal and strategic expertise.Moreover, the company's involvement in various settlements and licensing agreements requires careful legal navigation to avoid potential disputes and litigation, which can be costly and time-consuming. Investors should appreciate the legal acumen required to manage such a diverse and potentially litigious portfolio. 03/14/2024 - 04:06 PM Intellectual Property Licensing and Settlement Agreements Drive Q4 Income; Company Continues to Advance Capital Allocation and Business Strategy, Announced Agreement to Acquire Cash Flow-Generating Oil and Gas Assets with a Goal of Driving Book Value per Share NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acacia Research Corporation (Nasdaq: ACTG) (“Acacia” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023. Martin (“MJ”) D. McNulty, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Through the last quarter of 2023 and into the beginning of 2024 we continued to meaningfully advance our business strategy in an effort to drive earnings and book value per share growth in disciplined and unique ways. For example, in the fourth quarter our Intellectual Property team generated $82 million in gross revenue from its WiFi-6 licensing initiatives. We were able to commit a portion of this income as well as proceeds from the sale of a life science asset into a highly attractive near-team addition to our oil and gas business, which we expect to close in Q2. We expect to execute on additional acquisitions, including in the oil and gas space, and anticipate further IP-related income setting the stage for meaningful future cash flows while preserving our capital base. Our scale, including more than $430 million in cash as of today, gives us significant advantages as we seek to acquire future cash flows to continue to drive value for shareholders.” Mr. McNulty continued, “I am pleased with the progress we have made. In particular, our book value increased from $5.04 per share at September 30, 2023 to $5.90 at December 31, 2023. Additional opportunities are moving forward, including both public and private targets, demonstrating the significant optionality built into our model, and enabling us to exploit inefficiencies and unlock value from a diverse variety of assets. I believe we enter 2024 with accelerating momentum in our existing stable of businesses and our M&A activity.” Key Business Highlights Generated $92.3 million in consolidated revenue for the quarter compared to $13.1 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, including $82.8 million in license fee revenue from the Company’s intellectual property operations. Entered into an agreement to sell our shares of Arix Bioscience Plc for a cash purchase price of $57.1 million (which represents a purchase price of 1.43 British pounds (or GBP) per share, based on the exchange rate on the date that the parties agreed to the purchase price). The share sale closed on January 19, 2024. Recorded $11.9 million of net realized and unrealized gains during the quarter, inclusive of unrealized gains as of December 31, 2023 related to the Arix shares.

Outlook for 2024 includes revenue ranging from $38 million to $40 million and NOI ranging from $22.5 million to $23.25 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net operating income (NOI) by over 27% signifies a robust operational performance for Mobile Infrastructure, which is indicative of efficient asset management and cost containment. The conversion of a significant portion of the portfolio to management contracts suggests a strategic shift towards greater control and flexibility in pricing and utilization, potentially enhancing margins. However, the net loss widening from the prior year raises concerns about the sustainability of growth and the impact of non-recurring expenses related to the merger and listing.Investors should note the company's deleveraging efforts, with a $29.1 million debt paydown, improving the balance sheet. The forward guidance projecting mid-single-digit organic growth and increased NOI for 2024 could signal confidence in the company's operational strategy. Yet, the lack of reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis may obscure the clarity of these projections, warranting a cautious interpretation of future performance. Market Research Analyst The transition from leased to managed contracts aligns with industry trends towards more flexible and technology-driven asset management. Mobile Infrastructure's use of proprietary technology and data analytics to tailor offerings and optimize rates could be a differentiator in the competitive parking industry. The company's outlook also capitalizes on macro trends such as the return to office and residential conversions of office spaces, suggesting a strategic positioning to capture emerging market opportunities.However, the company's growth strategy hinges on market conditions, including the pace of return to office trends and the health of the commercial real estate market. The mention of a pipeline for potential acquisitions indicates an appetite for growth through consolidation, which could be advantageous in a fragmented industry, but also adds a layer of execution risk and potential for increased debt or dilution. Economist The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape, where interest rates and economic activity significantly influence the parking asset sector. The reduction in interest expenses reflects a positive step in a rising interest rate environment. However, the economic outlook, including potential recessionary pressures, could affect the demand for parking assets, particularly in the corporate and hospitality sectors.While the company's deleveraging is prudent, the parking industry's sensitivity to economic cycles means that Mobile Infrastructure's growth and profitability may be challenged by external economic factors. The anticipation of organic net operating income growth could be contingent on sustained economic recovery and urban revitalization post-pandemic. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM --Fourth Quarter and Full Year Parking Asset Portfolio Performance Substantially Ahead of Year-Ago Levels-- --Converted Two-Thirds of Portfolio to Management Contracts-- --2024 Guidance Anticipates Accelerating Growth in Parking Asset Portfolio Performance-- CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mobile Infrastructure Corporation (NYSE American: BEEP), (“Mobile”, “Mobile Infrastructure” or the “Company”), owners of a diversified portfolio of parking assets throughout the United States, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Management Commentary Commenting on the results, Manuel Chavez III, Chief Executive Officer, said “Our asset portfolio performed well in the fourth quarter, with net operating income up over 27% from the prior year quarter, reflecting positive leasing trends and reduced operating expenses. These results capped a transformative year for Mobile Infrastructure in which we completed a merger transaction, deleveraged the balance sheet, and provided liquidity to shareholders by listing the Company on the New York Stock Exchange American. “Mobile’s strategy of actively managing our asset portfolio led to accelerating organic revenue growth in the second half of 2023. Our asset management team is leveraging our proprietary technology platform and working directly with service providers to customize offerings that address the dynamic parking needs of our corporate, hospitality, and transient customers. Additionally, in the first quarter, we converted 26 of our portfolio assets from leased to management contracts. This action will give us greater flexibility to optimize rates and utilization, while also executing strategies to contain operating expenses. “Full year results were impacted by substantial non-cash charges, primarily associated with our merger and listing, that are not expected to recur in future periods. We ended the year with an improved financial position, highlighted by $29.1 million of debt paydown. Our parking asset portfolio was valued at over $520 million in late 2022 by an independent national real estate services firm. Since that time, our net operating income has increased by 9.5%.” Fourth Quarter Business and Financial Highlights Total revenue was $7.9 million as compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $9.2 million as compared to $5.2 million in the prior year period. NOI* was $5.5 million as compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA* was $3.4 million as compared to $2.5 million in the prior year period. *An explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are presented later in this press release. Financial Results Total revenue of $7.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 14.3% from $6.9 million in the prior year quarter. Total property taxes and operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $2.4 million, as compared to $2.6 million during the same period in 2022. Net loss attributable to common stockholders of $9.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $5.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year period. Net Operating Income (“NOI”), defined by the Company as total revenues less property taxes and operating expenses, was $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a 27.7% increase from the fourth quarter of 2022, and demonstrating the model’s inherent operating leverage from higher revenue and lower property operating expenses. General and administrative expenses of $3.9 million reflected $2.4 million of non-cash compensation. Interest expense for the fourth quarter 2023 was $3.0 million, as compared to $3.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, benefiting from the repayment of debt in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a 36.5% increase over the same year-ago period. The increase reflects the benefit of NOI improvement, partially offset by an increase in professional fees related to the transition to management contracts and general and administrative expenses due to increased insurance costs and compensation expense. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $17.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As of December 31, 2023, total debt outstanding, including outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and notes payable, was $192.9 million, compared to total debt outstanding of $219.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Summary and Outlook** “Mobile Infrastructure ended 2023 with positive momentum, and we expect the investment made over the last eighteen months to result in accelerating organic net operating income growth in 2024. Our priorities are to drive operating efficiencies across our portfolio by utilizing proprietary data analytics, together with on-site relationships, to tailor our offerings to specific markets and evaluate opportunities for ancillary revenue. Based on the visibility in our current parking asset portfolio, we expect revenues to range from $38 million to $40 million for 2024, reflecting mid-single-digit organic growth and the shift from leased to managed contracts. Net operating income is expected to range from $22.5 million to $23.25 million for full year 2024. “Longer term, we expect return to office trends and the conversion of commercial office buildings to residences in several of our markets to serve as growth tailwinds. At the same time, Mobile Infrastructure intends to build on its successful operating model to become the acquirer of choice in the fragmented parking industry. We have a pipeline of potential acquisitions which could be completed once financial market conditions improve. “2023 was a transformational year for our company, and 2024 will be a year in which we focus on operational improvements as we work to further strengthen the performance of our existing asset portfolio. We appreciate the dedication of the Mobile team, the quality of our service providers, and the support of our shareholders and look forward to delivering strong returns in the periods ahead,” Mr. Chavez concluded. ** The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis, where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort.

The Company believes that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations, as it highlights operating trends such as pricing and demand for our portfolio at the property level as opposed to the corporate level. NOI is calculated as total revenues less property operating expenses and property taxes. The Company uses NOI internally in evaluating property performance, measuring property operating trends, and valuing properties in our portfolio. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company’s NOI may not be comparable to other real estate companies. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of financial performance as it does not reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income and expenses, or the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company’s properties that could materially impact results from operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of the following items: interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and the provision for income taxes, for all periods presented. When applicable, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain recurring and non-recurring items from EBITDA, including, but not limited to gains or losses from disposition of real estate assets, impairment write-downs of depreciable property, non-cash changes in the fair value of the Earn-Out liability, merger-related charges and other expenses, gains or losses on settlements, and stock-based compensation expense. The use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparison with results from other companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude depreciation and amortization expense because differences in types, use, and costs of assets can result in considerable variability in depreciation and amortization expense among companies. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense in all periods presented to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use stock-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance which allows for comparison of earnings and evaluation of debt leverage and fixed cost coverage. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. Forward-Looking Basis The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis, where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amount of various items that would impact net income which is the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. This includes, for example, external growth factors and balance sheet items, that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

The study aims to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose for NUV-1511 and evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical activity in patients with various advanced solid tumors. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The initiation of a Phase 1/2 study for NUV-1511, Nuvation Bio Inc.'s first drug-drug conjugate (DDC), is a pivotal step in the drug's development pathway. DDCs represent a novel class of oncology therapeutics that aim to deliver anti-cancer agents directly to cancer cells, potentially reducing harm to healthy tissues. The focus on diseases with significant unmet needs, such as HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, positions NUV-1511 as a potential game-changer if clinical efficacy and safety are demonstrated.The study's flexible design, allowing for the exploration of two dosing schedules, is strategic. It may expedite the determination of the optimal dosing regimen, which is critical for the success of subsequent trials. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy data will be the key determinants of NUV-1511's future development and potential impact on Nuvation Bio's valuation. It's important to note that the transition from preclinical to clinical stages often comes with a significant increase in investment and risk, as clinical trial outcomes are highly unpredictable. Biotech Financial Analyst The dosing of the first patient with NUV-1511 is a noteworthy event for investors, as it marks the transition of Nuvation Bio's proprietary DDC from research to a clinical setting. This transition often serves as a catalyst for biopharmaceutical stocks, as it reflects progress in the drug development pipeline. However, the market's response may vary based on the perceived potential of the drug and the competitiveness of the therapeutic landscape.Investors should monitor the trial's progress closely, as early safety and tolerability results can provide insights into the drug's risk profile. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data will inform on how the drug is metabolized and cleared, which has implications for dosing frequency and patient convenience. Clinical activity signs, even in early stages, can significantly influence investor sentiment. Nevertheless, given the early phase of the trial, the financial impact is speculative at this stage and the true value will only be realized upon successful completion of later-stage trials and potential market approval. Market Research Analyst Entering clinical trials with a new oncology drug, such as NUV-1511, has implications for the broader market, especially within the segments targeted by the study. The diseases mentioned – HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, advanced pancreatic cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer – are areas with high unmet medical needs and often limited treatment options. If NUV-1511 demonstrates efficacy, it could disrupt existing treatment paradigms.Market dynamics in oncology are influenced by innovation and drug-drug conjugates are at the forefront of this. The potential of NUV-1511 to provide a new therapeutic option could be significant. However, it will be essential to track the competitive landscape, as other companies may also be developing similar technologies. Market penetration will depend not only on clinical outcomes but also on factors such as pricing, reimbursement and the ability to differentiate from other therapies. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM NUV-1511 is the Company’s first drug-drug conjugate (DDC) to enter the clinic NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nuvation Bio Inc. (NYSE: NUVB), a biopharmaceutical company tackling some of the greatest unmet needs in oncology by developing differentiated and novel therapeutic candidates, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1/2 study of NUV-1511, the Company’s first DDC to enter the clinic. “Dosing the first patient with NUV-1511 marks a significant milestone for our proprietary DDC platform, from which we are developing potent oncology-focused chimeric small molecules designed to selectively deliver anti-cancer therapeutics to cancer cells, while mitigating effects on healthy non-target tissues,” said David Hung, M.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Nuvation Bio. “DDCs are the core technology upon which the Company was founded and we are excited to bring our first DDC clinical candidate to patients.” The dose escalation portion of the study employs a flexible design that allows for the potential to explore two dosing schedules for NUV-1511 with the goal of establishing the recommended Phase 2 dose. The study will initially evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and assess for signs of clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors who previously received and progressed on or after treatment with Enhertu® and/or Trodelvy® per approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), advanced pancreatic cancer, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC).

The company reported a net loss of $(34.5) million, or $(1.16) loss per share for fiscal 2023. Financial Analyst The reported GAAP and non-GAAP loss per share for Tilly's Inc. reflect a challenging fiscal period for the company. The decline in total net sales by 4.1% in Q4 and 7.3% for the full fiscal year, coupled with a decrease in comparable net sales, indicates a contraction in consumer demand or a possible loss of market share. This is a key indicator of a company's health and can influence investor sentiment.From a cost perspective, the gross profit margin contraction and SG&A expense increase are concerning. The 140 basis point decline in product margins due to increased markdowns suggests pricing pressure, while the SG&A increase is partly due to an extra fiscal week. The operating loss widening to (4.9)% of net sales in Q4 from (0.8)% last year further stresses the operational challenges faced.On the balance sheet, the slight increase in inventories per square foot may indicate either an intentional buildup or slower inventory turnover. The decrease in cash and marketable securities year-over-year raises questions about liquidity management and capital allocation strategies. Market Research Analyst The retail sector has been experiencing significant headwinds due to changing consumer behaviors and economic pressures. Tilly's acknowledgment of macro environmental challenges aligns with broader industry trends. However, the increase in e-commerce sales, which now represent a larger percentage of total net sales, is a positive sign, indicating a successful adaptation to the shift towards online shopping.It's important to note that the company's operating loss and net loss have increased substantially, which may affect investor confidence. The forward-looking statements for Q1 2024 project a continued decline in comparable net sales, which could further impact the company's stock performance. The anticipated capital expenditures suggest a conservative investment in growth, focusing on a small number of new stores and technology upgrades. Retail Industry Consultant The results highlight the importance of inventory management and the impact of markdowns on profitability within the retail industry. Tilly's has experienced a significant decrease in product margins, which is a common issue for apparel retailers in a competitive discounting environment. The company's strategy to improve business performance will likely focus on optimizing inventory levels, enhancing product assortment and improving supply chain efficiency.The company's pivot towards e-commerce could be a strategic move to align with consumer shopping preferences. However, the physical store sales decline outpaces e-commerce growth, suggesting a need for a more aggressive digital transformation strategy. The stabilization of store count indicates a cautious approach to physical retail expansion, which may be prudent given the current retail landscape. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM GAAP Loss Per Share of $(0.69); Non-GAAP Loss Per Share of $(0.17) Non-GAAP Net Loss Beats Prior Outlook IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tilly’s, Inc. (NYSE: TLYS, the ""Company"") today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 ended February 3, 2024. ""Our business currently faces many headwinds from the macro environment. Despite these headwinds, we are challenging ourselves to improve our business performance by carefully reconsidering everything we do,"" commented Hezy Shaked, Co-Founder and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We see opportunities for improvement, but we expect it may take some time to see the benefits from our efforts in this environment."" Operating Results Overview Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Operating Results Overview The following comparisons refer to the Company's operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (14 weeks) ended February 3, 2024 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (13 weeks) ended January 28, 2023. Total net sales were $173.0 million, a decrease of $7.3 million or 4.1%, compared to $180.4 million last year. Total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-commerce (""e-com""), decreased by 8.8%. The extra week in this year's fourth quarter accounted for $5.7 million in total net sales. Net sales from physical stores were $125.6 million, a decrease of $9.5 million or 7.0%, compared to $135.0 million last year, with a comparable store net sales decrease of 11.8%. Net sales from physical stores represented 72.6% of total net sales this year compared to 74.9% of total net sales last year. The Company ended the fourth quarter with 248 total stores compared to 249 total stores at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Net sales from e-com were $47.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 4.7%, compared to $45.3 million last year. E-com net sales represented 27.4% of total net sales this year compared to 25.1% of total net sales last year. Gross profit, including buying, distribution, and occupancy costs, was $46.7 million, or 27.0% of net sales, compared to $52.4 million, or 29.0% of net sales, last year. Product margins declined by 140 basis points primarily due to increased markdowns. Buying, distribution, and occupancy (""BDO"") costs deleveraged by 70 basis points collectively, despite being $0.5 million lower than last year, primarily due to carrying these costs against a lower level of net sales this year. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses were $55.2 million, or 31.9% of net sales, compared to $53.8 million, or 29.8% of net sales, last year. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to the extra week in this year's fourth quarter, which added an estimated $2.6 million to SG&A expenses. Operating loss was $(8.5) million, or (4.9)% of net sales, compared to $(1.4) million, or (0.8)% of net sales, last year, due to the combined impact of the factors noted above. Other income was $1.6 million compared to $1.1 million last year, primarily attributable to earning significantly higher rates of return on our marketable securities compared to last year. Income tax expense, which includes a non-cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $15.4 million, was $13.6 million or 195.9% of pre-tax loss, compared to an income tax benefit of $(0.2) million, or 61.7% of pre-tax loss last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, income tax benefit was $(1.8) million, or 25.8% of pre-tax loss. This quarter's non-GAAP effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax income and discrete income tax items associated with stock-based compensation. Last year's income tax benefit was primarily attributable to certain allowable deductions and tax credits. Net loss, including the non-cash valuation allowance charge noted above, was $(20.6) million, or $(0.69) loss per share, compared to $(0.1) million, or $(0.00) loss per share, last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, this year's net loss was $(5.2) million, or $(0.17) loss per share. Weighted average shares were 29.9 million this year compared to 29.8 million shares last year. Fiscal 2023 Full Year Operating Results Overview The following comparisons refer to the Company's operating results for fiscal 2023 (53 weeks) ended February 3, 2024 versus fiscal 2022 (52 weeks) ended January 28, 2023. Total net sales were $623.1 million, a decrease of $49.2 million or 7.3%, compared to $672.3 million last year. Total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-com, decreased by 10.6%. The extra week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $5.7 million in total net sales. Net sales from physical stores were $485.6 million, a decrease of $45.5 million or 8.6%, compared to $531.1 million last year, with a comparable store net sales decrease of 12.2%.

E-com net sales represented 22.1% of total net sales compared to 21.0% of total net sales last year. Gross profit, including buying, distribution, and occupancy costs, was $165.7 million, or 26.6% of net sales, compared to $202.7 million, or 30.2% of net sales, last year. BDO costs deleveraged by 210 basis points collectively, primarily due to carrying these costs against a lower level of net sales this year. BDO costs increased by $1.8 million collectively, predominantly due to increased occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in distribution costs resulting primarily from reduced freight costs. Product margins declined by 150 basis points primarily due to increased markdowns. SG&A expenses were $196.6 million, or 31.6% of net sales, compared to $191.6 million, or 28.5% of net sales, last year. The $5.1 million increase in SG&A was primarily attributable to non-cash store asset impairment charges of $3.4 million and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2023 which added an estimated $2.6 million to SG&A expenses. Operating loss was $(31.0) million, or (5.0)% of net sales, compared to operating income of $11.2 million, or 1.7% of net sales, last year, due to the combined impact of the factors noted above. Other income was $5.2 million compared to $2.0 million last year, primarily due to earning significantly higher rates of return on our marketable securities compared to last year. Income tax expense, including the previously noted non-cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $15.4 million, was $8.7 million, or 33.8% of pre-tax loss, compared to $3.5 million, or 26.5% of pre-tax income, last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the valuation allowance, income tax benefit was $(6.7) million, or 25.9% of pre-tax loss. Net loss, including the non-cash valuation allowance charge noted above, was $(34.5) million, or $(1.16) loss per share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.32 income per diluted share, last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, this year's net loss was $(19.1) million, or $(0.64) loss per share. Weighted average shares were 29.8 million this year compared to 30.3 million diluted shares last year. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), the Company is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures including ""non-GAAP income tax (benefit) expense,"" ""non-GAAP net (loss) income,"" and ""non-GAAP (loss) earnings per share."" These amounts are not in accordance with, and should not be construed as an alternative to, the most directly comparable corresponding GAAP measure. The Company’s management believes that these measures help provide investors with insight into the underlying comparable financial results, excluding items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s core day-to-day operating results. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please see the accompanying table titled “Supplemental Financial Information; Reconciliation of Select GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” contained in this press release.

Based on current quarter-to-date comparable net sales results and current and historical trends, the Company currently estimates that its fiscal 2024 first quarter net sales will be in the range of approximately $109 million to $119 million, translating to an estimated comparable net sales decrease in the range of approximately (14)% to (7)%, respectively, compared to last year. The Company currently estimates its SG&A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to be approximately $42 million to $43 million, pre-tax loss to be in the range of approximately $(17) million to $(22) million, and estimated income tax rate to be approximately 27%.

Financial Analyst The announcement of Kandi Technologies Group's financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, highlights a significant recovery in profitability and a positive net revenue growth. The increase in net revenues by 4.9% to $123.6 million indicates a modest growth trajectory. However, the substantial growth in gross profit by 112% to $41.4 million is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a successful reorientation towards higher-margin products. This pivot, reflected in the doubling of the gross margin percentage from 16.6% to 33.5%, points to a strategic improvement in the company's product mix and operational efficiency.It is essential to analyze the sustainability of this profitability. The off-road vehicle segment's exceptional growth of 51.5% is impressive but raises questions about the company's reliance on a single product line and its vulnerability to market fluctuations within this niche. Investors should monitor the company's diversification strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with such dependency. The net income of $1.7 million, compared to the previous year's net loss of $12.9 million, is a clear indicator of a turnaround, yet it's critical to assess whether these figures are a result of one-time gains or a reliable indicator of future performance.Operating expenses increased by 15.3%, which could be a concern if the growth rate in expenses consistently outpaces revenue growth. The reduction in operating loss from $27.7 million to $13.1 million is positive, but the company still operates at a loss, which investors should consider when evaluating the company's path to consistent profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Kandi's strategic partnerships and expansion efforts, such as the acquisition of Northern Group and the strengthened partnership with Lowe's, demonstrate a proactive approach to broadening market coverage in North America. The focus on off-road electric vehicles (EVs) aligns with the increasing demand for environmentally friendly transportation options and the specific market trend towards fuel-to-electric conversion in off-road vehicles.Investors should take note of the company's commitment to increasing R&D investment, which indicates a focus on innovation and the development of competitive products. This is a positive signal for future growth, but it also requires careful monitoring to ensure R&D efforts translate into profitable products and do not overly strain financial resources.While the company projects significant growth in 2024, it will be important to evaluate the feasibility of these projections, especially in the context of the broader EV market and potential economic headwinds. The company's performance should be compared to industry benchmarks and competitors to understand its position in the market landscape. Economist From an economic standpoint, Kandi's return to profitability could be seen as a microcosmic indicator of broader economic recovery, particularly in the post-pandemic context where supply chain disruptions and economic uncertainties have impacted many industries. The company's strong working capital position, with cash and equivalents totaling $252.1 million, provides a cushion against potential economic volatility and offers the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities.However, the company's future performance will likely be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as consumer spending power, interest rates and international trade policies. Given that a significant portion of Kandi's revenue comes from exports to the U.S., shifts in trade relations or tariffs could have material implications. Additionally, the EV market's responsiveness to economic cycles, with potential subsidies or regulatory changes affecting demand, should be considered when projecting the company's growth.The overall economic environment, including competition for raw materials and the cost of labor, will also play a role in determining the company's ability to maintain its improved margins and profitability. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM $123.6 million net revenue hits a three-year high, marking a return to profitabilityJINHUA, China, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kandi Technologies Group, Inc.

Dr. Xueqin Dong, CEO of Kandi commented, “We concluded the challenging year of 2023, and it's with great pride that we overcame the challenges in 2023 and made significant strides.

Moreover, we further strengthened our partnership with Lowe’s, expanding to more than 10 super centers in 2024, thereby broadening our market coverage in North America.

Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 31% year-over-year revenue growth and 176% increase in Adjusted EBITDA for Despegar indicate a robust financial performance, likely reflecting a strong recovery in the travel sector post-pandemic. The company's focus on operational efficiencies and the expansion in high-margin areas such as Travel Packages are positive indicators for investors looking at the company's ability to manage costs while growing revenue. The emphasis on B2B and White Label services, which are growing faster than the company's overall bookings, suggests a strategic pivot that could lead to diversified income streams and reduce reliance on direct consumer sales.Additionally, the technology-led approach and the introduction of an AI-powered travel assistant, SOFIA, highlight Despegar's investment in innovation, which could improve customer engagement and drive future growth. However, one must consider the competitive landscape and the fact that technology investments can take time to translate into financial returns. The 2024 financial guidance projecting at least 16% YoY revenue growth and 28% YoY growth in Adjusted EBITDA is ambitious and suggests confidence in the company's strategic direction, but it should be weighed against the risks inherent in forward-looking statements, especially in a volatile industry like travel. Financial Analyst Despegar's record high gross bookings and substantial year-over-year growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are indicative of a strong market position in the Latin American travel industry. The increase in loyalty program members and app transactions suggests that Despegar is effectively leveraging its platform to retain customers and drive sales through mobile channels, which is crucial given the increasing trend of mobile commerce. The positive operating cash flow represents a turnaround from the previous year, signaling improved liquidity and financial health.Investors should take note of the company's total cash position, which has seen a modest increase. This financial cushion is vital for sustaining operations and funding future growth initiatives. However, the travel industry is susceptible to macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes, which could impact Despegar's performance. The provided financial guidance for 2024 is a useful benchmark for investors, but it's important to acknowledge the uncertainties mentioned by the company, such as those related to the evolving factors that can affect the industry. The lack of detailed reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures due to insufficient data adds an element of risk to these projections. Economist The impressive growth figures reported by Despegar are reflective of a broader economic recovery in the travel sector, particularly in Latin America. The company's strategic milestones, including its penetration into the B2B market and the development of its White Label offerings, demonstrate a keen understanding of the region's economic dynamics and consumer behavior. The travel industry's strong secular tailwinds, such as increasing middle-class income and digital penetration in the region, are likely contributing to Despegar's performance.However, the travel industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles and while the current growth is promising, external shocks such as currency fluctuations, political instability, or health crises could quickly alter the landscape. Despegar's growth strategy appears to be well-calibrated to the current environment, but investors should remain cognizant of the potential for sudden changes in economic conditions that could impact the company's operations and financial targets. The forward-looking statements regarding revenue and EBITDA growth for 2024, while positive, should be interpreted within the context of these broader economic risks. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Robust FY23 Performance with Revenue Growing 31% YoY and Adjusted EBITDA Increasing 176% YoY 4Q23 Adjusted EBITDA Increased 248% YoY to $43.6 million, with Improving Operating Efficiency and Strong Revenue Rising 40% YoY to a Record $203.7 Million BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Despegar.com, Corp.

It marks an inflection point for Despegar and reflects our ability to effectively exploit the travel market’s strong secular tailwinds through a well-designed and executed growth strategy, backed by our deep understanding of the region’s local markets, commercial prowess, strong brand identity, and superior technology platform. These distinct strengths not only sharpen our competitive edge but also fortify our brand presence region-wide. Longer term, our technology-led B2B and White Label offerings are unlocking new growth avenues, and these will also enable us to effectively extend our reach beyond Latin America. Innovation and reinvention remains at the heart of Despegar and drives us to continually redefine and elevate the customer experience. This is embodied in our new AI-powered travel assistant, SOFIA, which revolutionizes travel planning in the region. SOFIA rapidly, easily and seamlessly assists customers from the inspiration stage of planning a trip, to exploring thoughtful options to creating bespoke travel packages, signifying a major leap forward for the travel industry and placing Despegar at the forefront of championing travel technology.” Amit Singh, the Company’s CFO, added: “With 40% revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA increasing 248% year over year in the quarter, we believe our growth remains at industry leading levels globally. As we look ahead, we remain sharply focused on executing our commercial strategy to continue driving robust top line growth while increasing cost efficiencies. The combination of these factors are expected to drive industry leading growth, additional margin expansion and operating leverage in the foreseeable future, given the effectiveness of our strategies to improve revenue mix, drive organic traffic and further penetrate the sizable B2B market segments.” 2024 Financial Guidance The Company announces 2024 annual guidance of: Revenue: at least $820 million, representing at least 16% YoY growth Adjusted EBITDA: at least $150 million, representing at least 28% YoY growth See our Investor Relations website at investor.despegar.com. Disclaimer: The 2024 financial guidance reflects management’s current assumptions regarding numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict, including those discussed in the Risk Factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, specifically the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance, to the relevant forward-looking GAAP measures are not being provided, as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such guidance and reconciliations. Due to this uncertainty, the Company cannot reconcile projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort. The 2024 financial guidance constitutes forward-looking statements. For more information, see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section in this release.

To access Despegar’s financial results call via telephone, callers need to press # to be connected to an operator. Webcast: CLICK HERE Definitions and concepts Average Selling Price (“ASP”): reflects Gross Bookings divided by the total number of Transactions. Foreign Exchange (“FX”) Neutral: calculated by using the average monthly exchange rate of each month of the quarter and applying it to the corresponding months in the current year, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates remained constant. These calculations do not include any other macroeconomic effects such as local currency inflation effects. Net Promoter Score (“NPS”): a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company, product, or service to others. Gross Booking, net (“GB”): Gross Bookings is an operating measure that represents the aggregate purchase price of all travel products booked by the Company’s travel customers through its platform during a given period related to our travel business. In its quarterly earnings releases, Despegar presents Gross Bookings net of withholding taxes on international trips in Argentina which have been in effect since 2020. The Company generates substantially all of its revenue from commissions and other incentive payments paid by its suppliers and service fees paid by its customers for transactions through its platform, and, as a result, the Company monitors Gross Bookings as an important indicator of its ability to generate revenue. Seasonality: Despegar’s financial results experience fluctuations due to seasonal variations in demand for travel services. Despegar’s most significant market, Brazil, and much of South America where Despegar operates, are located in the southern hemisphere where summer travel season runs from December 1 to February 28 and winter runs from June 1 to August 31. Despegar’s most significant market in the Northern hemisphere is Mexico where summer travel season runs from June 1 to August 31 and winter runs from December 1 to February 28. Accordingly, traditional leisure travel bookings in the Southern hemisphere are generally the highest in the third and fourth quarters of the year as travelers plan and book their summer holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the first quarter of the year. In the Northern hemisphere, bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of variable cost of revenue and direct S&M costs, which are typically timed with booking volumes, and the more stable nature of fixed costs. Packages: refers to custom packages formed through the combination of two or more travel products, which may include airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, or a combination of these. By bundling these items together and securing them in a single transaction, we can present customers with a unified package at a single, quoted price. This approach not only enables us to provide travelers with more affordable options compared to purchasing individual products separately but also facilitates the cross-selling of multiple products within a single transaction. Total Adjusted EBITDA: is calculated as net income/(loss) exclusive of financial result, net, income tax, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition transaction costs. Total Adjusted Net Income: is calculated by adjusting net income/loss, excluding: (a) foreign exchange gains or losses, (b) acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles, (c) share-based compensation for RSUs and SOPs, (d) impairment of long-lived assets, (e) restructuring and related reorganization charges, (f) disposal costs of discontinued operations, (g) amortization of intangible assets not related to acquisitions, (h) legal reserves for transactional tax issues, settlements, and litigation advances, (i) extraordinary items outside normal operations, (j) adjustments affecting non-controlling interests, and (k) tax effects of these adjustments, tax estimate changes, and non-recurring income tax charges. Total Revenue: The Company reports its revenue on a net basis for the majority of its transactions, deducting cancellations and amounts collected as sales taxes. The Company presents its revenue on a gross basis for some transactions when it pre-purchases flight seats. These transactions have been limited to date. Despegar derives substantially all of its revenue from commissions and incentive fees paid by its travel suppliers and service fees paid by the travelers for transactions through its platform. To a lesser extent, Despegar also derives revenue from advertising, its installment loans and Buy Now, Pay Later offered through the company’s fintech platform Koin and other sources (i.e. destination services, loyalty and interest revenue). For more additional information regarding Despegar’s revenue recognition policy, please refer to “Summary of significant accounting policies” note of Despegar’s Financial Statements. Total Revenue Margin (also “Take Rate”): calculated as revenue divided by the sum of Gross Bookings and Total Payment Volume. Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): is an operating measure that represents the US dollar loan volume processed by ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" financing solution during a specific period of time. Reporting Business Segments: The Company operates a Travel Business and a Financial Services Business which are structured as follows: Our travel business is comprised of two reportable segments: “Air” and “Packages, Hotels and Other Travel Products. Our “Air” segment primarily consists of facilitation services for the sale of airline tickets on a stand-alone basis and excludes airline tickets that are packaged with other non-airline flight products. Our “Packages, Hotels and Other Travel Products” segment primarily consists of facilitation services for the sale of travel packages (which can include airline tickets and hotel rooms), as well as stand-alone sales of hotel rooms (including vacation rentals), car rentals, bus tickets, cruise tickets, travel insurance and destination services. Both segments also include the sale of advertisements and incentives earned from suppliers. Our financial services business is comprised of one reportable segment: “Financial Services”. Our “Financial Services” segment primarily consists of loan origination to our travel business’ customers and to customers of other merchants in various industries. Our “Financial Services” segment also consists of processing, fraud identification, credit scoring and IT services to our travel business, and to third-party merchants. Transactions: We define the number of transactions as the total number of travel customer orders completed on our platform or the financing merchant customers (excluding Decolar) of the “Buy Now, Pay Later” solution during a given period. The number of transactions is an important metric because it is an indicator of the level of engagement with the Company’s customers and the scale of our business from period to period. However, unlike Gross Bookings, the number of transactions is independent of the average selling price of each transaction, which can be influenced by fluctuations in currency exchange rates among other factors.

About This Press Release This press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute a complete set of interim financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial information is this earnings release has not been audited. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This earnings release includes certain references to Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted Net Income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Despegar changed the calculation of Total Adjusted EBITDA reported to the chief operating decision maker to exclude restructuring charges and acquisition costs. The Company defines: Total Adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss) exclusive of financial result, net, income tax, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition transaction costs. Total Adjusted Net Income: is calculated by adjusting net income/loss, excluding: (a) foreign exchange gains or losses, (b) acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles, (c) share-based compensation for RSUs and SOPs, (d) impairment of long-lived assets, (e) restructuring and related reorganization charges, (f) disposal costs of discontinued operations, (g) amortization of intangible assets not related to acquisitions, (h) legal reserves for transactional tax issues, settlements, and litigation advances, (i) extraordinary items outside normal operations, (j) adjustments affecting non-controlling interests, and (k) tax effects of these adjustments, tax estimate changes, and non-recurring income tax charges. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income are a measure recognized under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information and should note that these measures as calculated by the Company, differ materially from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including its competitors. To supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company presents foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measure are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. On page 12 of this earnings release the company shows FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes that comparing FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2022 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2023, so as to calculate what results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate for local currency inflation or devaluations.

Ulta also highlighted new store openings and a positive outlook for future growth. Positive Ulta Beauty reported a substantial increase in net sales to $3.6 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the previous year's quarter. The company experienced a 2.5% growth in comparable sales, showcasing positive consumer demand and engagement. Ulta achieved a net income of $394.4 million, translating to $8.08 per diluted share, reflecting strong profitability. Operating income improved to 14.5% of net sales, indicating efficient cost management and operational performance. Ulta's new store openings demonstrate a commitment to expansion and strategic growth initiatives. CEO Dave Kimbell expressed confidence in the company's performance and future prospects, emphasizing a focus on sustainable growth and innovation. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ulta Beauty's report exhibits a robust financial performance with net sales climbing from $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This indicates a positive trajectory in consumer spending within the beauty sector. The reported net income of $394.4 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, surpasses the prior year's figures, signaling strong profitability and operational efficiency.However, the comparable sales growth of 2.5% in the fourth quarter, though positive, marks a deceleration from the 15.6% growth in the same period last year. This could point to a maturing market or increased competition. Investors should consider the sustainability of growth rates as comparable sales are a key indicator of a retailer's health.Operating income as a percentage of net sales also shows a slight increase, which could be interpreted as the company effectively managing its costs or benefiting from economies of scale. The expansion with 30 new store openings, while lower than the previous year's 47, suggests a strategic approach to growth, focusing on profitability over mere expansion. Market Research Analyst Ulta Beauty's strategic positioning in the market is evident from its record brand awareness and strong member growth. Their holiday strategies and product curation seem to have resonated well with consumers, suggesting that their marketing and merchandising efforts are aligning with customer preferences. This is crucial in the highly competitive beauty industry where brand loyalty and consumer engagement are key drivers of success.Despite a dynamic macroeconomic environment, Ulta's optimism for 2024 could be underpinned by their multi-year investment agenda, hinting at a focus on innovation and capability enhancement. Their differentiated model, which may include a mix of in-store and online retail strategies, loyalty programs and exclusive product offerings, is likely providing a competitive edge.Stakeholders should monitor how these investments translate into long-term value creation, particularly in the context of consumer behavior shifts and digital transformation within the retail sector. Economist The beauty retailer's performance offers insights into broader economic trends. The increase in net sales and controlled store openings reflect a cautious yet positive consumer spending environment. Ulta's results could suggest that discretionary spending in the beauty segment remains resilient, even as other sectors may be experiencing headwinds from macroeconomic factors such as inflation or shifts in consumer confidence.However, the deceleration in comparable sales growth year-over-year requires attention. It may be indicative of a plateauing demand or the beginning of market saturation. As Ulta navigates the 'dynamic' macro environment, the company's agility in responding to economic changes will be pivotal in maintaining growth momentum.Investors should be aware of the potential impact of external economic factors on Ulta's performance, such as changes in disposable income, consumer trends and the competitive landscape, which can all influence the company's future results. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Net Sales of $3.6 Billion Compared to $3.2 Billion in the Year-Ago Quarter Comparable Sales Increased 2.5% Net Income of $394.4 Million or $8.08 Per Diluted Share BOLINGBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ulta Beauty, Inc.

Net sales in the 53rd week were approximately $181.9 million. Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 2.5% compared to an increase of 15.6%, driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions and a 1.9% decrease in average ticket. Gross profit increased 10.6% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 7.6% to $820.4 million compared to $762.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.1% compared to 23.6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and store expenses. Operating income increased 15.5% to $517.1 million, or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales. Net interest income decreased to $3.3 million compared to $4.4 million due to interest paid on borrowings during the quarter. The tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Net income increased 15.7% to $394.4 million compared to $340.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 21.0% to $8.08, including $0.46 due to the extra week of sales, compared to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Full Year of Fiscal 2023 Compared to Full Year of Fiscal 2022 Net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion compared to $10.2 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, strong growth in other revenue, and the benefit of the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales increased 5.7% compared to an increase of 15.6%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. Gross profit increased 8.3% to $4.4 billion compared to $4.0 billion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 39.1% compared to 39.6%, primarily due to lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrink, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. SG&A expenses increased 12.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 24.0% compared to 23.5%, primarily due to higher corporate overhead due to strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, higher marketing expenses, and higher store expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Operating income increased 2.4% to $1.7 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, compared to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales. Net interest income increased to $17.6 million compared to $4.9 million, due to higher average interest rates on cash balances. The tax rate decreased to 23.9% compared to 24.4%, primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes and benefits from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Net income increased 3.9% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 8.4% to $26.03, including a $0.14 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation and a $0.46 benefit due to the 53rd week, compared to $24.01, including a $0.07 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.

Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brand launches, 30 net new stores, increase in distribution center inventory primarily due to the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer, SC, and product cost increases. As previously announced, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company borrowed $195.4 million on its revolving credit facility to support ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures, and merchandise inventory growth.

The company achieved $5.18 billion in revenue, 11% YoY growth, and announced a $25 billion share repurchase program. Digital Media segment revenue was $3.82 billion, and Digital Experience segment revenue was $1.29 billion. Adobe provided second quarter targets with revenue expected to be $5.25-$5.30 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Adobe's Q1 fiscal year 2024 results exhibit a robust performance with an 11 percent year-over-year revenue growth. The introduction of generative AI into their products seems to be a strategic move to maintain competitive advantage in the creative software industry. Additionally, the announcement of a $25 billion share repurchase program signals confidence in future cash flows and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy.However, investors should consider the sustainability of Adobe's growth rates in the context of the broader economic environment. The company's forward-looking statements, particularly regarding second quarter fiscal targets, suggest an expectation of continued growth, but these projections are contingent on macroeconomic and foreign exchange conditions, which can be volatile. Financial Analyst The 18 percent year-over-year growth in Document Cloud revenue is particularly noteworthy, outpacing the growth in Creative revenue. This could indicate a successful expansion in a market with high growth potential. The Digital Media segment remains a strong contributor to Adobe's ARR, a key metric that reflects the predictable nature of its revenue streams and the health of its subscription-based model.Adobe's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) provide insight into the company's profitability. The significant difference between the GAAP EPS of $1.36 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.48 suggests substantial adjustments for non-recurring items, which investors should examine to understand the company's core earnings. Economist Adobe's performance and outlook should be contextualized within the current macroeconomic climate. The company's ability to grow in constant currency terms is indicative of strong underlying demand for its services, which may be resilient to economic headwinds. However, the reliance on foreign exchange rates for revenue projections introduces an element of risk, as currency volatility can impact reported earnings.The RPO growth of 16 percent is a forward-looking indicator that suggests a healthy pipeline of future revenue, which is crucial for long-term planning and investment. The company's operational cash flows of $1.17 billion reflect its efficiency in converting earnings into cash, a positive sign for liquidity and investment capacity. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Record Q1 Net New Document Cloud ARR; Enterprise strength drives RPO growth of 16 percent year over year SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its first quarter fiscal year 2024 ended March 1, 2024. “Adobe drove record Q1 revenue demonstrating strong momentum across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud,” said Shantanu Narayen, chair and CEO, Adobe. “We’ve done an incredible job harnessing the power of generative AI to deliver groundbreaking innovation across our product portfolio.” “Adobe’s Q1 results and record RPO reflect strong customer adoption of our innovative products and services,” said Dan Durn, executive vice president and CFO, Adobe. “As a result of our strong trajectory of growth and profitability, we are announcing a new $25 billion share repurchase program, which demonstrates Adobe’s continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.” First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights Adobe achieved revenue of $5.18 billion in its first quarter of fiscal year 2024, which represents 11 percent year-over-year growth or 12 percent in constant currency.

Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.

The CFO highlights prudent management, quarterly improvements in Adjusted EBITDA loss, and strong cash position of over $300 million at year-end 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Skillz Inc. present a mixed picture of the company's performance. While the revenue figures for both the fourth quarter and the full year indicate a level of stability, the net losses and negative Adjusted EBITDA raise concerns about the company's current profitability and cost management strategies. The significant net loss of $106.7 million for the year, alongside a negative Adjusted EBITDA, suggests that the company is still in a phase of heavy investment and has yet to reach a break-even point.However, the CEO's statement regarding the improvement in user economics and a shorter payback period on customer acquisition costs is positive. It indicates that the company's strategic initiatives may be beginning to bear fruit. Furthermore, the strong cash position of over $300 million gives Skillz a considerable runway to continue investing in growth and product development. This is a critical factor for investors, as it provides some assurance against immediate liquidity risks despite the ongoing losses. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the paying monthly active users (PMAU) metric is a vital sign of the company's market penetration and customer retention. The reported decrease in PMAUs during 2023, followed by a stabilization in early 2024, could indicate that Skillz's efforts to retain its user base are starting to pay off, although it's too early to call it a trend. The Average Revenue Per Paying Monthly Active User (ARPPU) of $70.0 remains robust, suggesting that the company's monetization strategies are effective among its paying user base.It's also noteworthy that Skillz is focusing on enhancing player engagement and monetization through new features. This strategy could lead to increased user lifetime value and lower churn rates, which are critical for sustainable growth. Investors should monitor these user metrics closely, as they will be key indicators of the company's ability to scale and eventually turn a profit. Gaming Industry Analyst Analyzing Skillz's performance within the mobile gaming industry, the introduction of new product features aimed at increasing player engagement is a strategic move to differentiate itself in a competitive market. The gaming industry is known for its high customer acquisition costs and Skillz's reported improvement in the payback period for these costs is a positive development.However, the overall net loss and negative Adjusted EBITDA highlight the challenges of achieving profitability in the gaming sector, where user acquisition and retention are costly. Skillz's focus on transitioning towards scaling the business for future profitable growth is essential, as the industry rewards companies that can achieve scale with a loyal user base. Investors should consider the long-term viability of Skillz's growth strategy, including the potential risks associated with the high costs of user acquisition and the need for continuous innovation to maintain user engagement. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Skillz Inc. (NYSE: SKLZ) (“Skillz” or the “Company”), the leading mobile games platform bringing fair competition to players worldwide, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights: Revenue of $29.1 million Gross profit of $25.7 million Net loss of $20.8 million Adjusted EBITDA1 of $(12.3) million Paying monthly active users (PMAU)2 of 137,000 Average Revenue Per Paying Monthly Active User (ARPPU)3 of $70.3 Total operating expenses of $48.3 million Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights: Revenue of $150.1 million Gross profit of $134.7 million Net loss of $106.7 million Adjusted EBITDA1 of $(70.1) million Paying monthly active users (PMAU)2 of 179,000 Average Revenue Per Paying Monthly Active User (ARPPU)3 of $70.0 Total operating expenses of $250.7 million Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $302.0 million as of December 31, 2023 Total outstanding debt of $123.9 million as of December 31, 2023 “We made steady progress throughout 2023 with our strategic initiatives to position Skillz to deliver consistent top-line growth and positive Adjusted EBITDA,” said Andrew Paradise, Skillz’ CEO. “This progress includes improving user economics, which have benefitted from the introduction of new features that increase player engagement and monetization. In addition, the payback period on our customer acquisition costs exiting the year was significantly shorter than it was entering 2023 and it has continued to improve to-date in 2024. Importantly, after declines in our paying audience throughout 2023, we significantly slowed the decline in the beginning of 2024, and are tracking to a more stable audience. We are now beginning to transition our efforts toward scaling the business to generate future profitable growth. Our continued execution on our strategic initiatives puts Skillz on track to achieve our goal of generating positive Adjusted EBITDA on a run-rate basis by the fourth quarter of this year.” Gaetano Franceschi, Skillz’ CFO, added, “We continue to demonstrate prudent management of the business as reflected in the quarterly sequential improvements in our Adjusted EBITDA loss for every quarter of 2023, with the fourth quarter loss being 41% less than in the first quarter. Our focus on managing operating expenses is similarly driving improvement in our quarterly operating cash burn and, combined with our strong cash position of more than $300 million at 2023 year-end, provides us with the flexibility to invest in our key initiatives such as new product features that provide our players with a better experience which in turn will create value for our shareholders.” 1.

The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating its operating performance and is a similar measure reported by publicly-listed U.S. competitors, and regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. By providing this non-GAAP measure, the Company’s management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company’s profitability for the periods presented. Non-GAAP operating expense is also included in this press release, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company’s management believes non-GAAP operating expense is useful to investors and analysts as a supplement to its financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP for analyzing operating performance and identifying operating trends in its business. The Company uses non-GAAP operating expense internally to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis in order to make operating decisions. As required by the rules of the SEC, the Company has provided herein a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expense to the most directly comparable measures under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expense are not intended to be substitutes for any U.S. GAAP financial measures and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, net; (benefit) or provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization, and other income or expense, net; as further adjusted for stock-based compensation and other special items determined by management, including, but not limited to, change in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities, acquisition-related expenses, impairment charges, loss contingency accruals, restructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring expenses. The Company defines and calculates non-GAAP operating expense as GAAP operating expense adjusted for stock-based compensation, one-time transaction expenses and other special items determined by management, including, but not limited to acquisition-related expenses for transaction costs, certain loss contingency accruals and restructuring charges, as they are not indicative of business operations. The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis as it is unable to provide a meaningful calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking U.S. GAAP financial measures that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures. Preliminary Results and 10-K Extension The Company is in the process of completing its financial statements and other disclosures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, the Company will file an extension for the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we are announcing preliminary results for the year, which are based on currently available information and are subject to revision as management completes its internal review. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not finalized its review of these preliminary financial results or its audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual results may differ from these preliminary financial results and other financial information due to the completion of our internal procedures, the audit of our financial statements, final adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time the results are finalized. Further disclosure is included in the Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 by March 29, 2024.

(TRIN) announced a 2.0% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.51 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The company aims to distribute dividends approximating 90% to 100% of its taxable quarterly income to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Trinity Capital Inc. of a dividend increase for the 13th consecutive quarter is indicative of the company's consistent performance and commitment to shareholder returns. The incremental rise of 2.0% over the previous quarter's dividend is modest yet symbolizes stability in the company's earnings and cash flow capabilities. Given that dividends are often seen as a reflection of a company's financial health, this consistent increase could be perceived positively by the market.However, it is important for investors to assess the sustainability of such dividend payments. Trinity Capital's strategy to distribute 90% to 100% of its taxable quarterly income aligns with its status as a regulated investment company, which can offer tax advantages. The ability to pay supplemental dividends or carry over excess income for future payments provides flexibility in managing cash flows, which is a prudent approach to financial management. Tax Expert From a taxation perspective, the structure of Trinity Capital's dividends is a key consideration for investors. The dividends being paid from taxable earnings, including a possible return of capital or capital gains, impacts investor's individual tax liabilities. The reporting of dividends' tax characteristics on Form 1099-DIV is essential for stockholders to understand their tax obligations.Furthermore, Trinity Capital's adherence to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for regulated investment companies ensures that it avoids corporate-level taxes, which can be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders. The tax implications of these dividends, particularly the classification between ordinary income and capital gains, can significantly affect an investor's net return and should be carefully evaluated. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, Trinity Capital's regular dividend increases can be a signal to investors that the company is confident in its future earnings. In the financial services industry, where Trinity Capital operates, such signals can influence investor sentiment and potentially attract income-focused shareholders. The company's performance in providing diversified financial solutions to growth stage companies is a key factor in its ability to sustain such dividends.It's also worth noting the competitive landscape, where consistent dividend growth can differentiate Trinity Capital from its peers. However, investors should also consider the company's payout ratio and compare it with industry benchmarks to ensure that the dividends are not compromising the firm's ability to reinvest in its own growth. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM 13th Consecutive Quarter of a Dividend Increase PHOENIX, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Trinity Capital Inc. (Nasdaq: TRIN) (""Trinity Capital"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of diversified financial solutions to growth stage companies, today announced that on March 14, 2024, its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2024.

Summary of First Quarter 2024 Dividend: Declaration date March 14, 2024 Record Date March 28, 2024 Payment Date April 15, 2024 The Company's objective is to distribute four quarterly dividends in an amount that approximates 90% to 100% of its taxable quarterly income or potential annual income for a particular year in order to qualify for tax treatment as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition, during any particular year, the Company may pay additional supplemental dividends, so that the Company distributes approximately all its annual taxable income in the year it was earned, or it may spill over the excess taxable income into the coming year for future dividend payments. Dividends are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The specific tax characteristics of the dividends will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Legal proceedings related costs affecting cash usage in 2023. Estimation of settlement amounts for lawsuits related to predecessor company XL Fleet Corp. Financial Analyst The reported year-on-year growth of nearly 50% in customer contracts for Spruce Power Holding Corporation signifies a robust expansion in its customer base. This growth trajectory is a positive indicator of the company's market penetration and could potentially lead to increased future revenue streams. However, the decline in fourth-quarter revenues due to weather fluctuations points to the inherent risks associated with the solar power industry, where output and profitability can be significantly impacted by external environmental factors.From a financial perspective, the net total cash costs and reserves tied to legacy XL Fleet items are noteworthy. The subtraction of these costs to arrive at a pro-forma cash balance suggests a strategic move to provide a clearer picture of the company's available capital for growth initiatives. The Operating EBITDA guidance for 2024 and the Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance offer investors a forecast of the company's expected operational performance and liquidity, which are critical for evaluating the company's ability to sustain operations and fund future growth.Lastly, the share repurchase activity demonstrates confidence in the company's valuation and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. However, the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program should be monitored as it represents a potential future use of cash that could impact liquidity. Market Research Analyst The launch of the 'Spruce Pro' brand marks Spruce Power's entry into the commercial solar market, which is a significant strategic move given the current growth trends in this sector. The commercial solar market has been experiencing an uptick due to increasing energy costs and a shift towards sustainable energy solutions. By leveraging its residential servicing technology platform, Spruce Power could potentially gain a competitive edge in this new market segment.However, it's important to consider the capital expenditures associated with this brand extension. Although deemed negligible for 2024, the long-term investment and operational costs to maintain and grow market share in the commercial sector will be an area to watch. The company's ability to replicate its success in residential services in the commercial space could be a key driver of its future valuation. Legal Expert The resolution of legal proceedings related to Spruce's predecessor company, XL Fleet Corp., removes a layer of uncertainty that has been overhanging the company. The settlements with the SEC and the securities class action lawsuit represent a financial burden, but they also close contentious chapters that could have distracted management and affected investor confidence. It is essential for investors to understand the impact of these settlements on the company's financials, including the reduction in cash reserves.Looking forward, the company's ability to avoid further legal entanglements will be critical in maintaining investor trust and focusing on core business operations. The accrual for estimated exposure in three lawsuits as of the end of 2023 should be noted as a proactive measure in managing potential liabilities. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spruce Power Holding Corporation (NYSE: SPRU) (“Spruce” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the United States, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Business Highlights Added approximately 25,000 customer contracts in 2023, for nearly 50% year-on-year growth, to reach over 75,000 home solar assets and contracts. Launched 'Spruce Pro' brand, expanding Spruce Power's best-in-class residential servicing technology platform to the fast-growing commercial solar market. Total cash of $173 million at year end. Subtracting $17 million of net total cash costs and reserves tied to legacy XL Fleet items results in pro-forma cash of $156 million. Initiated 2024 Operating EBITDA guidance between $68 - $86 million and 2024 Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance between $0 - $5 million. Management Commentary and Outlook ""Spruce's strategy is to be the dominant owner and operator of distributed solar assets. We entered 2024 with an enviable level of cash liquidity to continue our disciplined growth,” said Christian Fong, Spruce’s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fong continued, ""Just as important is the pipeline of products that have emerged, such as Spruce Pro and an early customer renewal program, which we see accelerating organic growth. And with most XL Fleet legacy matters behind us, we enter 2024 from a position of strength."" Sarah Wells, Spruce's Chief Financial Officer, added ""Closing of the Spruce Power 4 Portfolio and Tredegar acquisitions solidified 2023 as a year of significant growth and transformation. With a full-year contribution from these acquired portfolios, Spruce is providing annual guidance in which we expect positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow in 2024."" Consolidated Financial Results Revenues totaled $15.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $18.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in fourth quarter revenues is a result of reduction in output caused by weather fluctuations. Core operating expenses (excluding depreciation), including both selling, general & administrative expenses (""SG&A"") and operations & maintenance, were $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $31.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2022 was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of combined restructuring and related charges and legal fees related to the previously disclosed legacy XL Fleet legal proceedings. Net loss attributable to stockholders was $30.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Management considers Operating EBITDA as a key measure in evaluating Spruce's operating performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Operating EBITDA was $9.9 million. Balance Sheet and Liquidity The Company's total principal amount of outstanding debt as of December 31, 2023, was $646.7 million with a blended interest rate of 5.7%, including the impact of hedge arrangements. All debt consists of project finance loans that are non-recourse to the Company itself. Total cash as of December 31, 2023, was $172.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $141.4 million and restricted cash of $31.6 million. This is down from $240.1 million of total cash as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to the wind down of XL Fleet activities, notably costs associated with previously disclosed legal proceedings and cash usage for acquisitions and share repurchases in 2023. Initiating 2024 Guidance Spruce Power expects 2024 Operating EBITDA in the range of $68 - $86 million and 2024 Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the range of $0 - $5 million. Growth and Capital Allocation Spruce is committed to maximizing long-term value for our shareholders through a disciplined approach that includes strategic acquisitions, capital expenditure projects, debt repayment, and shareholder return initiatives. During January 2024, the Company announced the launch of 'Spruce Pro', a brand that extends Spruce's distributed solar energy servicing capabilities into a new growth area of commercial solar. The Company estimates initial capital expenditures associated with this brand extension in 2024 to be negligible. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Spruce repurchased 0.1 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $4.37 for a total cost of $0.3 million, inclusive of transaction costs. There was $44.7 million remaining under the Company's authorized $50.0 million common share repurchase program at the end of 2023. Legal Proceedings As previously disclosed, in September 2023, Spruce settled a civil enforcement action filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") related to the 2020 merger of Spruce's predecessor company, XL Fleet Corp. In October 2023, in connection with the settlement, the Company paid a civil monetary penalty of $11.0 million to close the matter. As previously disclosed, in September 2023, Spruce reached an agreement in principle with respect to the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York related to the 2020 merger of Spruce's predecessor company, XL Fleet Corp., to settle the matter with a payment of $15.0 million from Spruce, net of insurance proceeds. On January 18, 2024, the Court preliminarily approved settlement and in February 2024, the Company made a payment in the amount of $15.0 million to the settlement claims administrator, with a hearing scheduled for April, 30, 2024, in which the court will consider final approval. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Spruce was able to estimate its exposure in three previously disclosed lawsuits related to Spruce's predecessor company, XL Fleet Corp. Spruce estimates in aggregate settlement amounts for these lawsuits of approximately $1.8 million. The Company accrued for this settlement amount as of December 31, 2023. Key Operating Metrics As of December 31, 2023, Spruce owned cash flows from over 75,000 home solar assets and contracts across 18 U.S. States with an average remaining contract life of approximately 12 years. Combined portfolio generation for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately 417 thousand MWh of power. In addition, the Company also serviced approximately 5,000 third-party owned home solar systems and third-party loans as of December 31, 2023. Gross Portfolio Value, on a PV6 basis as described below, was $784.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitate a meaningful evaluation of current period performance on a comparable basis with prior periods. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the GAAP financial measures presented in this press release, our financial statements, and other publicly filed reports. This prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or U.S. GAAP with respect to forward-looking financial information. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Information Earnings (Loss) Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”): We define EBITDA as our consolidated net income (loss) and adding back interest expense, net, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA provides meaningful information to the performance of our business and therefore we use it to supplement our GAAP reporting. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain identified items that we do not consider to be part of our ongoing business, improves the comparability of year-to-year results, and is representative of our underlying performance. Management uses this information to assess and measure the performance of our operating segment. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the below reconciliations, and to provide an additional measure of performance. Operating EBITDA: We define Operating EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus Proceeds from Investment in Lease Agreement, Net, Proceeds from Buyouts / Prepayments and Interest Earned on Cash Investments. Proceeds from Investment in Lease Agreement, Net, represent cash flows from the Company's Spruce Power 4 Portfolio, which holds the 20-year use rights to customer payment streams of approximately 22,500 solar lease and PPAs, net of servicing costs. Proceeds from Buyouts / Prepayments represent cash inflows from the early buyout of customer solar contracts and cash inflows from the prepayment of customer solar contracts. Interest Earned on Cash Investments represent cash interest received on investments in money market funds / U.S. Treasury securities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow: We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Operating EBITDA less Project Finance Debt Service, Platform Capital Expenditures, and Other non-cash items. Project Finance Debt Service represents principal and interest payments, including sweeps where applicable, on Spruce's non-recourse, project finance debt facilities. Other non-cash items represent miscellaneous non-cash income or expense associated with our various operating portfolios of residential solar assets. Portfolio Value Metrics: We believe Portfolio Value Metrics are helpful to management, investors, and analysts to understand the value of our business and to evaluate the estimated remaining value of our customer contracts, including present value implied from future, uncontracted sales of solar renewable energy credits generated from assets that the Company owns today. Gross Portfolio Value reflects the remaining projected net cash flows from current customers discounted at 6% (“PV6”) Projected cash flows include the customer’s initial agreement plus renewal ($ in millions) As of December 31, 2023 Contracted Portfolio Value (1) 709 Renewal Portfolio Value (2) $ 59 Uncontracted Renewable Energy Credits (3) 17 Gross Portfolio Value (4) $ 784 (1) Contracted Portfolio Value represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows discounted at 6% per annum during the initial term of the Company’s customer agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows discounted at 6% that the Company expects to receive from customers in future periods as set forth in customer agreements, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to third-party project equity investors. The calculation includes cash flows the Company expects to receive in future periods from state incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utilities or grid operators. (2) Renewal Portfolio Value is the forecasted net present value the Company would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial customer agreement term, but before the 30th anniversary of the system’s activation in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period for customers as of the measurement date. The Company calculates the Renewal Portfolio Value amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming that, on average, Spruce's customers choose to renew 50% of the time at a contract rate representing a 35% discount to the contract rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term, for a term of 7-years. (3) Uncontracted sales of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) based on forward market REC pricing curves, adjusted for liquidity discounts. (4) Gross Portfolio Value represents the sum of Contracted Portfolio Value, Renewal Portfolio Value and Uncontracted SRECs.

Full-year revenue for fiscal 2024 was $430.7 million, up by 16.2% year over year. The company also highlights growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and customer base expansion. Positive PagerDuty achieved a 10.1% increase in fourth-quarter revenue to $111.1 million. GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $33.4 million, while non-GAAP operating income reached $11.0 million. Full-year revenue for fiscal 2024 amounted to $430.7 million, showing a 16.2% year-over-year growth. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew by 10% year over year to $451.9 million. The company reported 804 customers with ARR over $100,000 and 58 customers with ARR over $1,000,000 as of January 31, 2024. PagerDuty announced key business developments, including the acquisition of Jeli, Inc., and new appointments to the leadership team. Financial outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 includes expected total revenue and non-GAAP net income per diluted share estimates. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 10.1% year-over-year revenue growth for PagerDuty in Q4 fiscal 2024 indicates a solid performance, particularly in the context of a competitive digital operations management market. The company's ability to expand its non-GAAP operating margin by over 1,200 basis points is impressive and suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. However, the GAAP operating loss of $33.4 million raises concerns about the sustainability of current business practices under GAAP standards.From an investment standpoint, the non-GAAP profitability is a positive signal, showing the company's ability to generate profit when excluding certain expenses typically considered non-recurring or not directly related to core operations. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP results should be carefully examined for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health.PagerDuty's cash and cash equivalents position of $571.2 million provides a robust buffer for strategic initiatives or to weather potential downturns. The free cash flow of $19.6 million is also a positive indicator of liquidity. Investors should monitor the company's future earnings guidance closely, as the projected growth rate for fiscal 2025 suggests a deceleration which could impact the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst PagerDuty's growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and its expansion in enterprise customers reflect a strong market position and product offering. An ARR increase of 10% year over year, coupled with the growth in customers with ARR over $100,000 and $1,000,000, demonstrates the company's success in penetrating the high-value customer segment. However, the decline in the dollar-based net retention rate from 120% to 107% suggests potential challenges in customer upsell or retention that need to be addressed.The acquisition of Jeli, Inc. and the appointment of key personnel such as the Chief Product Development Officer and a new board member, indicate strategic moves to enhance product capabilities and governance. These developments could lead to improved product offerings and market positioning in the long term.PagerDuty's involvement in BSA | The Software Alliance and the release of the 2024 State of Digital Operations study are strategic for thought leadership but may not directly influence immediate financial performance. The company's ability to land and expand with notable clients like Netflix and Nvidia is a testament to its competitive offering and could signal further growth opportunities. Technology Industry Analyst The technology sector, particularly in digital operations management, is rapidly evolving with a significant push towards AI adoption. PagerDuty's focus on modernizing operations for real-time customer experiences aligns well with industry trends. The company's investment in AI through its State of Digital Operations study highlights its commitment to innovation, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.The operational margin expansion and strong free cash flow are indicative of PagerDuty's ability to scale efficiently, a key factor for technology companies. However, the total paid customer count decrease is a concern that should be monitored as it may indicate market saturation or competitive pressures.The forward-looking statements regarding revenue and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for fiscal 2025 suggest cautious optimism. The projected growth rates, while positive, indicate a potential slowdown in momentum. Investors should consider the implications of this on the company's valuation and future growth trajectory. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue increased 10.1% year over year to $111.1 million Fourth quarter GAAP operating loss of $33.4 million, non-GAAP operating income of $11.0 million SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PagerDuty, Inc.

Please refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. PagerDuty has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders to GAAP net loss per share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders because certain items are out of its control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation for forward-looking non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information: PagerDuty will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on March 14, 2024. This news release with the financial results will be accessible from PagerDuty’s website at investor.pagerduty.com prior to the conference call. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the PagerDuty investor relations website at investor.pagerduty.com. Supplemental Financial and Other Information: Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through PagerDuty’s investor relations website at investor.pagerduty.com. PagerDuty uses the investor relations section on its website as the means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, we recommend that investors monitor PagerDuty’s investor relations website in addition to following PagerDuty’s press releases, SEC filings, social media, including PagerDuty’s LinkedIn account (https://www.linkedin.com/company/482819), X (formerly Twitter) account @pagerduty, the X account @jenntejada and Facebook page (facebook.com/pagerduty), and public conference calls and webcasts. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders, and free cash flow. PagerDuty believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and can assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in PagerDuty’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by PagerDuty’s management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, PagerDuty excludes the following from its historical and prospective non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable: Stock-based Compensation: PagerDuty utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period. Employer Taxes Related to Employee Stock Transactions: PagerDuty views the amount of employer taxes related to its employee stock transactions as an expense that is dependent on its stock price, employee exercise and other award disposition activity, and other factors that are beyond PagerDuty’s control. As a result, employer taxes related to employee stock transactions vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets: PagerDuty views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Acquisition-Related Expenses: PagerDuty views acquisition-related expenses, such as transaction costs, acquisition-related retention payments, and acquisition-related asset impairment, as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. In particular, PagerDuty believes the consideration of measures that exclude such expenses can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such expenses. Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs: The imputed interest rates of the Convertible Senior Notes (the ""Notes"") was approximately 1.91% for the 2025 Notes and 2.13% for the 2028 Notes. This is a result of the debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt instruments. The debt issuance costs are amortized as interest expense. The expense for the amortization of the debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods. Restructuring Costs: PagerDuty views restructuring costs, such as employee severance-related costs and real estate impairment costs, as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. In particular, PagerDuty believes the consideration of measures that exclude such expenses can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such expenses. Gains (or losses) on partial extinguishment of convertible senior notes: PagerDuty views gains (or losses) on partial extinguishment of debt as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. PagerDuty believes that the consideration of measures that exclude such gain (or loss) impact can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such gains (or losses). Adjustment Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest: PagerDuty adjusts the value of redeemable non-controlling interest of its joint venture PagerDuty K.K. according to the operating agreement. PagerDuty believes this adjustment is not reflective of operational performance during a period and exclusion of such adjustments can assist in comparison of operational performance in different periods. Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: Based on PagerDuty's financial outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025, PagerDuty is utilizing a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% effective February 1, 2024 in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the impact of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency. PagerDuty's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that PagerDuty believes materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenue and expenses and other significant events. PagerDuty defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring costs. PagerDuty defines non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue. PagerDuty defines non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring costs. PagerDuty defines non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders (which is used in calculating non-GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders) as GAAP net loss attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. common stockholders excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes related to employee stock transactions, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, which include transaction costs, acquisition-related retention payments, and gain on partial extinguishment of convertible senior notes, which are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a given period, restructuring costs, adjustment attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest, and income tax adjustments. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP measures as compared to GAAP operating loss and net loss, including that the non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in PagerDuty’s business and an important part of its compensation strategy. PagerDuty defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs. In addition to the reasons stated above, PagerDuty believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures PagerDuty’s ability to generate or use cash in excess of its capital investments in property and equipment in order to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and further invest in its business and potential strategic initiatives. PagerDuty uses free cash flow in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures as part of its overall assessment of its liquidity, including the preparation of PagerDuty’s annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, and to assess its liquidity. There are a number of limitations related to the use of free cash flow as compared to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, including that free cash flow includes capital expenditures, the benefits of which are realized in periods subsequent to those when expenditures are made. PagerDuty encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate PagerDuty’s business. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results.

(1) On October 13, 2023, the Company provided written notice to the trustee and the note holders of the 2025 Notes that it had irrevocably elected to settle the principal amount of its convertible senior notes in cash and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect to the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. The Company uses the if-converted method to calculate the non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to PagerDuty, Inc. related to the convertible notes due 2025 prior to the election on October 13, 2023. As such, approximately 5.0 million shares related to the convertible notes due 2025 were included in the non-GAAP diluted outstanding share number for the twelve months ended January 31, 2024, related to the period prior to the election on October 13, 2023. Similarly, the numerator used to compute this measure was increased by $- million and $2.5 million for after-tax interest expense savings related to our convertible notes for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2024, respectively.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Adobe's new $25 billion stock repurchase program represents a significant financial strategy that can influence investor sentiment and stock performance. Stock buybacks are often seen as a positive signal to the market, indicating that a company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued and that they are confident in the company's future profitability. This can lead to an increase in the stock price as the supply of shares decreases, potentially creating shareholder value.However, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of such a large capital allocation. The funds used for repurchasing shares could alternatively be invested in research and development, acquisitions, or other strategic initiatives that might offer long-term growth prospects. Investors might question whether this is the best use of the company's cash reserves, especially in a landscape where innovation is key to staying ahead. Financial Analyst Adobe's decision to authorize a stock buyback of up to $25 billion represents a substantial commitment to managing its capital structure. Share repurchases can improve financial metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares, which could make the company more attractive to value investors. It's also a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders compared to dividends, as it offers investors the flexibility to realize gains on their own terms.From a financial planning perspective, this move suggests that Adobe's management is confident in its cash flow generation capabilities. The buyback program's size relative to Adobe's market capitalization could have a material impact on its share price. Investors will be closely monitoring Adobe's balance sheet and cash flow statements in subsequent quarters to assess the sustainability of this program. Legal Expert When a company like Adobe announces a stock repurchase program, it's crucial to understand the regulatory environment and compliance requirements. The repurchases must be conducted under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which provides a safe harbor for companies to repurchase their own stock under certain conditions and limitations to protect against market manipulation. This includes limitations on the timing, price and volume of repurchases.Additionally, the announcement of such a program must be carefully managed to ensure it does not violate insider trading laws. The timing of Adobe's announcement—coinciding with its earnings conference call and investor meeting—appears to be strategically planned to ensure transparency and maintain investor confidence. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) announced that its board of directors has approved a new stock repurchase authorization, granting the company authority to repurchase up to $25 billion in common stock through March 14, 2028. Under the program, which is designed to return value to Adobe’s stockholders, minimize dilution from stock issuances, and reduce share count over time, the company may repurchase shares in the open market and enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. “Our new $25 billion share repurchase authorization underscores what a special company Adobe is, with the profitability and cash flows to drive growth and invest in innovation while returning significant capital to our shareholders,” said Dan Durn, executive vice president and CFO, Adobe.

Negative None. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM SILICON SLOPES, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Domo (Nasdaq: DOMO) announced that Outcast, a leading integrated communications and marketing agency, is using Domo’s data experience platform to measure the impact of its campaigns and make real-time, informed decisions about where to focus client resources. Outcast serves clients across a wide variety of tech industries, ranging from e-commerce to consumer products to artificial intelligence. Each client requires a customized program with a unique mix of campaigns across earned, social, owned and paid channels. To better serve its clients in the fast-paced tech industry, Outcast turned to Domo to automatically capture - in near real-time - data for each of these channels to deliver insights into campaign performance, as well as produce fast and accurate reporting. Prior to implementing Domo, the agency had tried rolling out a different business intelligence (BI) tool, but a complicated UX resulted in poor adoption rates. Instead, Outcast employees manually logged client campaign performance data, a time-consuming process that often led to data silos, and prevented them from making quick, real-time decisions about where to focus their resources. This problem was amplified for larger clients who often have several different agencies and stakeholders involved within a campaign. Outcast was able to eliminate the manual reporting and completely recreate its reporting infrastructure with Domo’s out-of-the-box integrations and connectors. Now the agency automatically captures real-time data for the earned, owned and paid campaigns of each client. This simplicity has increased data literacy across the agency, giving teams the confidence to automatically capture data and glean insights for owned and paid channels, as well as the ability to deliver instant insights into campaign performance with the click of a button. “Our teams were frustrated daily, manually pulling data from various platforms. This manual work led to error and inconsistencies in key metrics,” said Aaron Lemley, Senior Director of Marketing Analytics at Outcast. “Reporting on campaign performance has gotten exponentially easier, quicker and more accurate since we’ve turned to Domo. Domo allows us to have higher data integrity, while discovering insights from our clients’ data in real-time, and then directly empower our clients to take action based on those insights.” Beyond Outcast’s internal teams, Domo Everywhere – Domo’s embedded analytics solution – enables the agency’s clients to get answers immediately through personalized dashboards and insights available on web or mobile. Self-serve analytics help clients monitor their campaign performance in real time rather than waiting for a report, increasing their confidence in the agency’s work while saving time previously spent on ad hoc reporting requests. “Outcast demonstrates how attainable impactful data experiences can be for anyone – within an agency or as a client,” said Mark Maughan, SVP of customer success, Domo. “When you have the right connectors and solutions at your fingertips and the power to share data externally, in real-time, you can scale data experiences without diverting precious time away from other priorities.” To learn more about how innovative organizations like Outcast are using Domo to put data to work for everyone, visit www.domo.com/customers.

(STKS) reported revenue growth and increased Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Total GAAP revenues rose by 1.8% to $89.9 million in Q4 and by 5.1% to $332.8 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11.3% in Q4 and stood at $40.1 million for the year. The company opened four new restaurants in Q4 and plans to open six to eight more in 2024. Despite a decrease in comparable sales, the company remains optimistic about its expansion plans and revenue targets for 2024. Positive Total GAAP revenues increased in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA saw a significant increase in the fourth quarter and remained stable for the full year. The company opened new restaurants in Q4 and plans further expansion in 2024. Comparable sales decreased in Q4 but showed significant growth compared to 2019. The company's CEO expressed confidence in the long-term earnings power of their pipeline. Negative Consolidated comparable sales decreased in both Q4 and the full year of 2023. Restaurant Operating Profit decreased slightly for the full year of 2023. Adjusted Net Income decreased for both Q4 and the full year of 2023. Financial Analyst The ONE Group's financial report indicates a modest revenue growth of 1.8% in Q4 and 5.1% for the full year, which is a positive sign for investors as it shows the company is growing despite market challenges. However, the decrease in comparable sales by 4.3% for the quarter and 2.7% for the year signals potential concerns in customer retention or market competition. The increase in adjusted EBITDA by 11.3% for the quarter suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. Investors should note the company's strategy to improve margins and reduce G&A expenses as a positive move towards profitability. The share repurchase program, with an additional $5 million authorized, reflects management's confidence in the company's value proposition and could provide a lift to EPS figures. Market Research Analyst The expansion strategy of The ONE Group, with the opening of six new restaurants in 2023 and plans for six to eight more in 2024, is an aggressive growth plan that can significantly increase the company's market presence. Their focus on operational efficiencies and best practices could streamline costs and improve margins in the long run. However, it's important to monitor how new locations perform and contribute to the overall financial health of the company. The strong performance of newly opened locations is a positive indicator, but it will be crucial to maintain this momentum. The company's target of a total addressable market of 400 venues suggests ambitious long-term growth plans that could be attractive to growth-oriented investors. Economist The ONE Group's financial results reflect broader economic trends, such as inflationary pressures on wages and operating costs, which have affected the restaurant industry as a whole. The company's ability to increase restaurant operating profit margins despite these pressures is commendable. However, the slight decrease in restaurant operating profit year-over-year indicates that inflationary pressures may be outpacing price increases and cost reduction initiatives. This could be a concern if inflation continues to rise. The effective income tax rate guidance of 5% to 10% for 2024 could have a notable impact on net income and should be considered when evaluating the company's future profitability. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Grows Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the Quarter Opens Four Restaurants in the Quarter; Introduces 2024 Targets and Authorizes Additional Share Repurchase DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.

In this press release, we also make references to the following non-GAAP financial measures: total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant Operating Profit and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units. Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units represents our total revenue from our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure represents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies total sales associated with our brands and hospitality services that we provide. Accordingly, we include this non-GAAP measure so that investors can review financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing performance of restaurants and other services we operate, whether or not the operation is owned by us. However, because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, this measure as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. This non-GAAP measure is presented as supplemental information and not as an alternative to any GAAP measurements. The following table includes a reconciliation of our GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at our owned and managed units (in thousands): For the three months ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) Owned restaurant net revenue (1) $ 85,165 $ 83,874 $ 317,366 $ 300,859 Management, license and incentive fee revenue 4,772 4,437 15,403 15,779 GAAP revenues $ 89,937 $ 88,311 $ 332,769 $ 316,638 Food and beverage sales from managed units (1) 29,805 34,985 119,024 125,904 Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units $ 114,970 $ 118,859 $ 436,390 $ 426,763 _________________________ (1) Components of total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, non-cash rent expense, pre-opening expenses, non-recurring gains and losses, stock-based compensation, COVID-19 related expense and certain transactional costs. Not all the aforementioned items defining Adjusted EBITDA occur in each reporting period but have been included in our definitions of terms based on our historical activity. Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this press release and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (in thousands): For the three months ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 4,643 $ 5,078 $ 4,718 $ 13,534 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (109 ) (98 ) (692 ) (215 ) Net income 4,534 4,980 4,026 13,319 Interest expense, net of interest income 1,927 726 7,028 2,113 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (1,533 ) 153 (1,760 ) 874 Depreciation and amortization 4,770 3,562 15,664 12,134 EBITDA 9,698 9,421 24,958 28,440 Pre-opening expenses 2,850 1,687 8,855 5,519 Stock-based compensation 1,234 1,195 5,032 3,985 Transaction costs 207 72 207 123 COVID-19 related expenses — — — 2,534 Lease termination expense (1) — 2 — 257 Non-cash rent (2) (61 ) (4 ) (340 ) (164 ) Other expenses 543 630 1,021 630 Adjusted EBITDA 14,471 13,003 39,733 41,324 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest (13 ) (5 ) (339 ) 72 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 14,484 $ 13,008 $ 40,072 $ 41,252 _________________________ (1) Lease termination expense are costs associated with closed, abandoned and disputed locations or leases. (2) Non-cash rent expense is included in owned restaurant operating expenses and general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Restaurant Operating Profit. We define Restaurant Operating Profit as owned restaurant net revenue minus owned restaurant cost of sales and owned restaurant operating expenses. We believe Restaurant Operating Profit is an important component of financial results because: (i) it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance, and (ii) we use Restaurant Operating Profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared to our competitors. We use these metrics to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period, to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business and to evaluate the performance of our restaurants. The following table presents a reconciliation of Operating income to Restaurant Operating Profit for the period indicated (in thousands): For the three months ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating income as reported $ 4,928 $ 5,859 $ 9,294 $ 16,306 Management, license and incentive fee revenue (4,772 ) (4,437 ) (15,403 ) (15,779 ) General and administrative 7,947 8,495 30,751 29,081 Depreciation and amortization 4,770 3,562 15,664 12,134 COVID-19 related expenses - - - 2,534 Pre-opening expenses 2,850 1,687 8,855 5,519 Lease termination expense - 2 - 257 Transaction costs 207 72 207 123 Other expenses 543 630 1,021 630 Restaurant Operating Profit $ 16,473 $ 15,870 $ 50,389 $ 50,805 Restaurant Operating Profit as a percentage of owned restaurant net revenue 19.3 % 18.9 % 15.9 % 16.9 % Restaurant Operating Profit by brand is as follows (in thousands): For the three months ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 STK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) $ 12,547 $ 11,740 $ 38,531 $ 37,259 STK restaurant operating profit (Company owned) as a percentage of STK revenue (Company owned) 24.5 % 22.6 % 20.9 % 21.5 % Kona Grill restaurant operating profit $ 4,117 $ 4,151 $ 12,305 $ 13,695 Kona Grill restaurant operating profit as a percentage of Kona Grill revenue 12.2 % 13.1 % 9.3 % 10.8 % Adjusted Net Income. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income before COVID-19 costs, lease termination expenses, one-time stock-based compensation, non-recurring costs, non-cash rent during the pre-opening period and the income tax effect of any adjustments. We believe that Adjusted Net Income is an appropriate measure of operating performance, as it provides a clear picture of our operating results by eliminating certain one-time expenses that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. Adjusted Net Income is included in this press release because it is a key metric used by management, and we believe that it provides useful information facilitating performance comparisons from period to period. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also showed significant increases. CEO Ross Dove highlighted the success in the Financial Asset and Industrial divisions, attributing the growth to macro-economic trends. The company's strong balance sheet and stock repurchase program demonstrate financial stability and shareholder value. Positive Heritage Global Inc. achieved a full year growth of 83% in operating income for 2023. Operating income for the year was $14.3 million, with net income reaching $12.5 million. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA showed substantial increases compared to the previous year. CEO Ross Dove emphasized the company's success in the Financial Asset and Industrial divisions. The growth was attributed to macro-economic trends driving increased volumes in these divisions. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with stockholders' equity of $61.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Heritage Global repurchased 152,707 shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company's net working capital was $11.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 83% growth in operating income for Heritage Global Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. This figure surpasses typical industry growth rates and suggests that the company has effectively capitalized on market opportunities, particularly in the financial asset and industrial divisions. The conservative approach to credit reserves, as mentioned in the report, reflects prudent risk management, which is reassuring for investors concerned about the sustainability of returns amidst economic pressures.Moreover, the company's decision to release additional valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets indicates confidence in future profitability, which can be attractive to long-term investors. The share repurchase activity, with shares bought back at an average price below the current market value, could be perceived as a signal that the company believes its stock is undervalued, which might encourage investor optimism regarding future stock performance. Market Research Analyst Heritage Global's performance in the context of macro-economic tailwinds such as increased consumer debt and non-performing loans is noteworthy. Their success in securing new brokerage contracts and specialty lending opportunities in a challenging economic environment demonstrates strong competitive positioning and adaptability. The mention of increased volumes due to businesses scaling down operations and closing offices could indicate a robust pipeline for the company's auction business, suggesting potential for sustained growth in this area.However, it's important to watch for potential market saturation or a downturn in the industrial sector, which could impact the volume of assets coming to auction. Keeping an eye on economic indicators and industry trends will be essential for predicting the company's performance in these segments moving forward. Economist Heritage Global's performance reflects broader economic trends, such as the rise in consumer debt levels and the subsequent increase in charged-off credit cards and non-performing loans. The company's ability to thrive in this environment suggests a strong alignment with market demands. However, investors should consider the cyclical nature of debt markets and the possibility of regulatory changes that could impact the volume and profitability of debt-related transactions.The company's strategy to maintain a conservative balance sheet is prudent, especially in light of potential economic headwinds. This approach may provide a buffer against market volatility and enable the company to navigate through uncertain economic conditions with greater resilience. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM - Financial Assets Division Reports Full Year Growth of 83% in Operating Income for 2023 - SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Heritage Global Inc. (NASDAQ: HGBL) (“Heritage Global,” “HG” or “the Company”), an asset services company specializing in financial and industrial asset transactions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Summary of Financial Results (unaudited): ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating income $ 4,555 $ 3,147 $ 14,319 $ 11,120 Net income $ 4,890 $ 9,970 $ 12,475 $ 15,493 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.27 $ 0.33 $ 0.42 (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) (1) EBITDA $ 4,696 $ 3,283 $ 14,833 $ 11,656 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,890 $ 3,439 $ 15,609 $ 12,196 (1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used non-GAAP financial measures utilized by management as a supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis and should be considered together with Heritage Global’s GAAP financial measures. Definitions and disclosures regarding non-GAAP financial information including reconciliations are included at the end of the press release. Heritage Global Chief Executive Officer Ross Dove commented, “2023 was the best year in our history, as demonstrated by our ability to achieve full-year 2023 operating income of $14.3 million. During the year, our business continued to capitalize on the macro-economic environment, where heightened economic pressures drove increased volumes in our Financial Asset and Industrial divisions. “It’s been widely reported that consumer debt reached record levels in 2023, and with that, the volume of charged-off credit cards and non-performing loans increased. Accordingly, our Financial Asset division saw impressive momentum during the year, as we continued to successfully leverage our experience and expertise to win new brokerage contracts and specialty lending opportunities. In the third quarter we increased our credit reserve to account for increased risk with specific clients given their declining collection rates. We did not materially increase our credit reserve in the fourth quarter and will continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet to support the long-term growth opportunity of our Financial Asset division. “In the current economic landscape, with many businesses continuing to scale down their operations, we are seeing increased office and facility closures. These activities drive volumes to the industrial side of our business as companies look to sell their surplus equipment and assets. While our auction business can see variability quarter to quarter, our pipeline remains strong and we expect continued strong auction activity as we move through 2024. “I am pleased with our team’s efforts and execution this year, exemplified by our full-year operating income of $14.3 million. As we look forward to new growth opportunities in 2024, we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on macro-economic tailwinds as we leverage our extensive industry experience and longstanding relationships to win new opportunities and further penetrate the market,” Mr. Dove concluded. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: The Company achieved operating income of $4.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to operating income of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. EBITDA totaled $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus EBITDA of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and Adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 million compared to $3.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Based on the past several years of taxable income and projected operating results for the next five years, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that it will utilize a significant portion of its net operating loss carryforwards and thus released an additional $2.2 million of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, as compared to $7.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $0.4 million compared to an income tax benefit of $6.8 million a year ago. Net income totaled $4.9 million (including a $0.4 million income tax benefit), or $0.13 of diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to net income of $10.0 million (including a $6.8 million income tax benefit), or $0.27 of diluted earnings per share in the prior-year quarter. Heritage Global maintains a strong balance sheet, with stockholders’ equity of $61.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $48.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Net working capital was $11.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held a gross balance of investments in notes receivable of $38.4 million, recorded in both notes receivable and equity method investments.

Management Commentary “During the fourth quarter, we experienced headwinds in our foodservice and grocery channels from a revenue perspective and our gross margins were negatively impacted by a one-time inventory write-off, which led to less-than-ideal top-line financial results to close out the year, however, I believe we continued to make progress towards positioning Jones Soda for exciting long-term growth opportunities,” said David Knight, President and CEO of Jones Soda. Revenues from our Mary Jones cannabis products more than doubled during the fourth quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis as we continued to expand our geographies and introduced new products, and we maintained strict cost discipline with our operating expenses, which allowed us to reduce our net loss. “As we move into 2024, I’m highly encouraged by the growth opportunities at hand. We are transitioning the Company from a soda company to a beverage company. We have created a new foodservice division led by a market veteran and announced several partnerships that we believe will significantly improve the sales results for this channel going forward. We recently announced our expansion into the ready-to-drink malt beverage space with Spiked Jones in the Pacific Northwest, and our innovation team is working on developing additional new beverage products. Mary Jones has continued to expand its product offerings with the introduction of Hemp Delta-9 and expanded internationally into the Canadian regulated market. “I would also like to thank Eric Chastain, our veteran COO, for his 22 years of service and the legacy he has built on Jones Soda. Eric has decided to step aside and take a well-deserved break. We welcome Eric Bittner to the team as our new COO. He is a seasoned beverage operator with time at PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper, Niagara Bottling and Fever Tree. I am excited to have him on board to help drive growth into new categories, gain scale and improve margins. “Overall, I believe the future remains bright here at Jones Soda. We see ample growth opportunities for our core soda business, our Mary Jones business and extensions into adjacent beverage categories as we transition to a beverage company. We believe we have set the stage for growth in 2024 and are now working hard to capitalize on these opportunities. Overall, we are making progress towards our long-term strategic goals that we believe will unlock significant shareholder value. We believe we are off to a great start so far in 2024, and we look forward to what the year will bring.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales in the Company’s food service and grocery channels. The Company’s cannabis brand, Mary Jones, generated approximately $438,000 in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to approximately $220,000 in revenue in the third quarter of 2023 and approximately $239,000 revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 19.5% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 24.8% in the year-ago period. This decline was primarily driven by a one-time inventory write-off associated with the Company’s Lemoncocco product line. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 improved to $2.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the year-ago period primarily as a result of non-cash stock consideration paid by the Company in connection with sponsorship agreements entered into by the Company during 2022 that did not occur again in 2023. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 improved to $1.5 million, or $(0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million, or $(0.02) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the decrease in total operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA1 was $(1.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $(1.3) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue in 2023 was $16.7 million compared to $19.1 million in the prior year period. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in the Company’s food service channel and decreased sales velocity within its grocery channel during the second half of the year. The Company’s cannabis brand, Mary Jones, generated approximately $1.2 million in revenue in 2023 compared to approximately $353,000 in revenue in 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 220 basis points to 29.1% for 2023 compared to 26.9% in the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by continued enhancements in the Company’s supply chain to better manage raw material costs, along with continued strategic pricing adjustments. The Company reduced total operating expenses throughout the year primarily due to less general business start-up costs and up-front marketing costs associated with the development of the Company’s Mary Jones brand in 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss for 2023 improved to $4.9 million, or $(0.05) per share, compared to a net loss of $6.4 million, or $(0.07) per share, in 2022. The improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the expansion in gross profit margin and a decrease in total operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA1 improved to $(4.1) million in 2023 compared to $(4.6) million in 2022, mostly as a result of the aforementioned gross profit margin expansion and lower total operating expenses. At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.9 million compared to $5.2 million at September 30, 2023, and $8.0 million at December 31, 2022. 2024 Activity Update CEO David Knight provided the following update regarding the Company’s growth initiatives in 2024: “We believe the Company is gearing up for growth in 2024, supported by organizational leadership changes as well as an exciting road map of product innovation and news for both Jones Soda and Mary Jones. “Jerry Goldner joined the organization to lead the new growth team. This team is focused on our key 2024 growth opportunities, including food service, Mary Jones, the convenience channel, and innovation. Our food service team is led by Victor Petrone, and we have secured the necessary distribution infrastructure through DOT Foods and Green Nature. “Eric Bittner has recently joined the Jones Company as our new COO and will lead the operations and product development agenda going forward. Mary Money has also joined the team as the Director of New Product Development and Commercialization. Both are seasoned executives with deep beverage and consumer packaged goods experience. “Loic Tomei has been promoted to General Manager Canada and is leading our new go-to-market strategy in Canada. We have transitioned into a new broker system with North South and Dot Foods Canada as our product delivery pipeline. We believe we will see revenue and margin upside in Canada in 2024 and beyond. “In the first quarter of 2024, we began to implement our 2024 innovation and channel development plan. During this quarter, we launched Nuka Cola Victory, a collaboration with Amazon Prime Video, Kilter Films and Bethesda Game Studio. Nuka Cola Victory is from the universe of the video game Fallout, and the product supports the streaming series launching in early April on Prime Video. Bottlecaps are the currency in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, and our unique bottlecaps on Nuka Cola Victory can be traded for gear in our Caps4Gear website. The product sold out at both Amazon and our Company’s e-comm platform within 15 minutes of its initial release, and a restock also sold out immediately. As this is one of our rotational flavors in our special release program, we are focused on distributing this product in key retailers around the country. “Another exciting initiative for Jones is the launch of Spiked Jones in the Pacific Northwest starting in our hometown of Seattle. We have four great flavors being launched in 12oz and 19.2oz cans. There has been an exciting response to this new launch, and we have secured distribution with key retailers in Washington. The first production is expected to roll off them line next week and is designed to deliver on the Company’s promise of great taste. “Moving to Mary Jones, we are seeing increased revenue opportunities in 2024 as we expand our geographies and product lines. Our Washington launch has been a great success, and Mary Jones Berry Lemonade and Mary Jones Root Beer were, according to our sources in Washington, the top selling cannabis beverages in the state during the past 4-week period. In California, we launched our Fizzy Tabs this week. Our launch in Canada with our partner Tilray is also off to a great start, and we have had to accelerate the production of our next load of inventory. We are planning the extension into the other provinces based on our early success. “I believe another key driver of our expected growth in 2024 is the development of Mary Jones products in the hemp derived Delta 9 THC beverage category. This is a new and developing category across the country and we believe the Company is well primed to emerge as one of the market leaders. Our new e-commerce platform is up and running and our online sales are a month in, and we are off to a great start. Check out gomaryjones.com. “Overall, I am really proud of the team at Jones Soda. We have started the transition from a craft soda company to a beverage corporation. Our new leadership is focused on growth through innovation and new channels, as well as driving scale and margin improvement.

Toll-free replay number: 1-844-512-2921International replay number: 1-412-317-6671Replay ID: 13744443 Presentation of Non-GAAP InformationThis press release contains disclosure of the Company's Adjusted EBITDA which is not a United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (“GAAP”) financial measure. The difference between Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and Net Loss (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) is the exclusion of interest expense and income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss under “Jones Soda Co. Non-GAAP Reconciliation” at the end of this press release. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company's results attributable to operations, in particular by eliminating the impact of non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization and depreciation that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates the Company's performance. These adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and provide supplemental information regarding the Company’s current ability to generate cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a replacement for, or superior to Net Loss as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or cash flow, as a measure of its liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with Net Loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. About Jones Soda Co.

Financial results for Q4 2023 and full year released.","Verastem Oncology Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Highlights Recent Business Updates Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Verastem Oncology (VSTM) reports progress in developing combination therapies for cancer, including Phase 3 trials and FDA Fast Track designation. Financial results for Q4 2023 and full year released. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent announcement by Verastem Oncology regarding the initiation of the Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial for the avutometinib and defactinib combination addresses an urgent need in the treatment of recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). LGSOC is a relatively rare and indolent subtype of ovarian cancer, often characterized by a poor response to conventional chemotherapy. The combination therapy, if successful, could offer a new line of treatment for patients who have limited options.The Fast Track designation granted by the FDA for the avutometinib and sotorasib combination for KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is significant. This mutation is present in a subset of NSCLC patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. Fast Track status can expedite the review process, potentially bringing a new therapy to market more quickly.It is important to note that the efficacy of these treatments must be demonstrated in larger, confirmatory trials and safety profiles must be well-characterized. The anticipation of multiple data readouts in 2024 will be critical in determining the potential impact of these therapies on patient care. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Verastem Oncology's progress in advancing its pipeline is a positive indicator for investors. The initiation of the Phase 3 trial and the planned New Drug Application (NDA) submission for the avutometinib and defactinib combination could lead to a significant milestone payment and future revenue streams upon approval and commercial launch. The market for ovarian cancer treatments is competitive, but the potential approval of a new therapy for LGSOC can capture a niche market segment.The Fast Track designation for another of their drug combinations could potentially lead to quicker revenue generation, given the expedited review process. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks in biotech investing, as clinical trial outcomes are uncertain and can significantly impact the company's valuation.It is also worth monitoring the company's burn rate and cash reserves as they prepare for potential commercial launch in 2025. The cost of clinical trials and the ramp-up for commercialization can be substantial and the company may need additional capital infusions or partnerships to sustain operations. Market Research Analyst Looking at the market dynamics, Verastem Oncology's strategic focus on RAS/MAPK driven cancers taps into a growing segment of the oncology market. The specificity of targeting genetic mutations like KRAS G12C and G12D positions the company in a favorable niche that is gaining attention for personalized medicine approaches. The collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics on the oral KRAS G12D inhibitor GFH375 (VS-7375) indicates a proactive approach in pipeline expansion and diversification.Given the competitive landscape, the company's success will depend not only on clinical outcomes but also on effective marketing and sales strategies post-approval. The patient and healthcare professional programs initiated by Verastem Oncology suggest an awareness of the importance of stakeholder engagement in the oncology field.Furthermore, the anticipation of multiple data readouts in 2024 could serve as catalysts for the company's stock price, making it an interesting year for potential investors and current stakeholders. The company's ability to meet its clinical development timelines and manage regulatory interactions will be key factors in maintaining investor confidence. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Initiated confirmatory Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib combination in recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer; on track to submit rolling NDA for accelerated approval in H1 2024; preparations underway for potential commercial launch in 2025 Granted FDA Fast Track designation for avutometinib and sotorasib combination for the treatment of KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer Announced oral KRAS G12D inhibitor GFH375 (VS-7375) as lead program in discovery and development collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics Multiple data readouts evaluating combination therapies in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer anticipated in 2024 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM), a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing new medicines for patients with cancer, today reported financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent progress. “In 2023, we made significant progress toward expanding the opportunities for avutometinib combination therapies across RAS/MAPK driven cancers and I am extremely proud of the team’s accomplishments,” said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. “2024 is expected to be a pivotal year with the planned NDA submission for our avutometinib and defactinib combination in recurrent LGSOC, and multiple clinical data readouts across our programs including initial data from the RAMP 205 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer and data from the combination with G12C inhibitors in NSCLC. We look forward to continuing to deliver results across our programs.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Highlights Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC) Initiated international confirmatory Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial evaluating the avutometinib and defactinib combination versus standard of care chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent LGSOC in December 2023 to support potential full approval. Reported results of a planned subgroup analysis of Part A of the Phase 2 RAMP 201 trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib combination in recurrent LGSOC, which demonstrated promising efficacy in patients regardless of number and class of prior therapies including after poor response to prior therapy at the Annual Global Meeting of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society meeting in November 2023. Launched patient and healthcare professional programs, including Let’s Talk About LGSOC, to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of LGSOC and provide information and resources to patients. Received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2024 for avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC. Verastem anticipates the following milestones for avutometinib and defactinib combination in LGSOC in 2024: On track to submit a rolling New Drug Application (NDA) for Accelerated Approval for the avutometinib and defactinib combination in LGSOC in H1 2024. Preparations for a potential U.S. commercial launch in 2025 are ongoing and plans to initiate discussions with European and Japanese regulatory authorities to address patient needs outside the U.S. continue to advance. Plan to announce updated topline data from RAMP 201 trial in LGSOC in H1 2024. Avutometinib in Combination with KRAS G12C Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Received Fast Track designation from the FDA for avutometinib, in combination with Amgen’s G12C inhibitor, LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib), for the treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-mutant metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy and have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor, in January 2024. Presented initial results from Phase 1/2 RAMP 203 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avutometinib and sotorasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC who have or have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in October 2023. The confirmed objective rate of response (ORR) was 25% with responses observed in both KRAS G12C inhibitor resistant and naïve patients, and a recommended Phase 2 dose was selected. Added defactinib to RAMP 203 trial of avutometinib with sotorasib based on stronger tumor regressions in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC preclinical models when FAKi is added along with G12Ci + avutometinib. Verastem anticipates the following milestones for avutometinib in combination with KRAS G12C inhibitors in 2024: Data updates from patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC in the Phase 1/2 RAMP 203 trial evaluating avutometinib and sotorasib and the Phase 1/2 RAMP 204 trial evaluating avutometinib and adagrasib are planned for mid-2024. Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in Frontline Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Plan to present initial safety and efficacy results from RAMP 205 trial of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with current standard of care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in frontline metastatic pancreatic cancer in H1 2024. GFH375 (VS-7375): Oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) Inhibitor Completed investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies for oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor GFH375 (VS-7375), the lead program in the collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics (“GenFleet”). GenFleet is expected to submit an IND application for GFH375 (VS-7375) in China in H1 2024 with plans to begin a Phase 1 trial in H2 2024. Discovery/lead optimization continues for second and third programs. Upcoming Presentations Verastem previously announced the acceptance of multiple abstracts for presentation at upcoming medical conferences: Multiple abstracts were selected for oral and poster presentations at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 2024 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer on March 16-18 in San Diego. These presentations will include a late-breaking oral presentation on a planned subgroup analysis of Part A of the Phase 2 RAMP 201 trial of avutometinib and defactinib combination of heavily pretreated patients with LGSOC and a plenary oral presentation of preclinical efficacy data of avutometinib in combination with a FAK inhibitor in recurrent LGSOC as well as a trials-in-progress poster about the Phase 3 RAMP 301 trial. See press release here. Five preclinical data abstracts were accepted for poster presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 on April 5-10 in San Diego. These presentations will highlight anti-tumor efficacy data of GFH375 (VS-7375), data on RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib and FAK inhibition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models supporting the ongoing RAMP 205 trial, and avutometinib and a FAK inhibitor combination in cutaneous melanoma models to overcome resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, resistance to immunotherapy, and brain metastasis. See press release here. Corporate Updates Strengthened the executive leadership team with appointments of Mike Crowther to Chief Commercial and Business Strategy Officer and the promotion of Dan Calkins to Chief Financial Officer in October 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Verastem Oncology ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $137.1 million. Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Quarter”) were $31.1 million, compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Quarter”). Research & development expenses for the 2023 Quarter were $22.5 million, compared to $10.7 million for the 2022 Quarter.

Selling, general & administrative expenses for the 2023 Quarter were $8.6 million, compared to $6.1 million for the 2022 Quarter. The increase of $2.5 million, or 41.0%, was primarily related to increased personnel costs, including non-cash stock compensation, increased consulting and professional fees, and additional costs in anticipation of a potential launch of avutometinib and defactinib in LGSOC. Net loss for the 2023 Quarter was $27.4 million, or $1.02 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $16.8 million, or $0.99 per share (basic and diluted, each as adjusted for the Company’s reverse stock split), for the 2022 Quarter.

Selling, general & administrative expenses for the 2023 Period were $30.7 million, compared to $25.0 million for the 2022 Period. The increase of $5.7 million, or 22.8%, was primarily related to increased personnel costs, including non-cash stock compensation, additional costs in anticipation of a potential launch of avutometinib and defactinib in LGSOC, and increased consulting and professional fees. Net loss for the 2023 Period was $87.4 million, or $3.96 per share (basic and diluted, each as adjusted for the Company’s reverse stock split), compared to $73.8 million, or $4.57 per share (basic and diluted, each as adjusted for the Company’s reverse stock split) for the 2022 Period. For the 2023 Period, non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $85.2 million, or $3.86 per share (diluted, as adjusted for the Company’s reverse stock split), compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $67.4 million, or $4.18 per share (diluted, as adjusted for the Company’s reverse stock split), for the 2022 Period. Please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation attached to this press release. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Verastem Oncology’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts or expenses from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency and period-over- period comparability with respect to the Company’s operating performance and can enhance investors’ ability to identify operating trends in the Company’s business. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company’s operating results as reported under GAAP, not in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in the tables accompanying this press release after the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination Avutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of Verastem Oncology’s investigational RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, with defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC. Verastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with its RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its (Raf And Mek Program). RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) is a Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and enrollment has been completed in each of the dose optimization and expansion phases and the low-dose evaluation. Verastem Oncology has established clinical collaborations with Amgen and Mirati to evaluate LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib and KRAZATI™ (adagrasib) in combination with avutometinib in KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC as part of the RAMP 203 (NCT05074810) and RAMP 204 (NCT05375994) trials, respectively. Supported by the “Therapeutic Accelerator Award” received from PanCAN, Verastem Oncology is conducting RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. About GFH375 (VS-7375) GFH375 (VS-7375) is a potential best-in-class, potent and selective oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor, identified as the lead program from the Verastem Oncology discovery and development collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics. GenFleet plans to submit an IND in China for GFH375 (VS-7375) in the first half of 2024, and upon approval GenFleet is expected to initiate a Phase 1 trial in China in the second half of 2024. The collaboration includes three discovery programs, the first being the KRAS G12D inhibitor, and will provide Verastem Oncology with exclusive options to obtain licenses to each of the three compounds in the collaboration after successful completion of pre-determined milestones in Phase 1 trials. The licenses would give Verastem Oncology development and commercialization rights outside of the GenFleet territories of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

The company raised $161.6 million in recent financing, extending its operating runway.

Positive Positive Phase 2 data for nomlabofusp in treating Friedreich's ataxia Successful completion of Phase 2 dose exploration study Raised $161.6 million in recent financing Extended operating runway into 2026 Ongoing discussions with FDA for accelerated approval BLA submission targeted for 2H 2025 Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement from Larimar Therapeutics concerning their successful Phase 2 study and the subsequent initiation of discussions with the FDA for accelerated approval represent a significant milestone with potential implications for the company's valuation. The positive data on nomlabofusp, particularly the dose-dependent increase in tissue frataxin levels, may bolster investor confidence in the drug's efficacy. The initiation of an open label extension (OLE) study further demonstrates the company's commitment to addressing Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), a rare disease with limited treatment options.The successful raising of approximately $161.6 million in net proceeds through a public offering of common stock is a strong indicator of market confidence and provides the company with an extended operating runway into 2026. This financial cushion is critical for a biotech firm in the clinical stage, as it assures investors that the company has sufficient funds to continue its research and development activities without the immediate need for additional capital raising that could dilute existing shares.From a financial perspective, the increased R&D expenses reflect the company's investment in advancing their drug pipeline, which is a typical pattern for clinical-stage biotech companies. However, the net loss widening year-over-year could be a point of concern if the trend continues without a clear path to profitability. Investors should monitor the company's burn rate and assess whether the potential market for nomlabofusp justifies the current investment in its development. Medical Research Analyst The use of tissue frataxin levels as a novel surrogate endpoint for a Biologics License Application (BLA) is a strategic regulatory approach that could expedite the approval process for nomlabofusp. If the FDA agrees to this endpoint, it could significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional endpoints, such as clinical outcomes, which often require longer and larger studies. The interim data from the OLE study expected in Q4 2024 will be crucial in providing additional evidence on the long-term safety and efficacy of the drug.For stakeholders in the medical community, particularly those involved in the treatment of FA, the development of nomlabofusp could represent a breakthrough. FA is a debilitating genetic condition and the increase in frataxin levels suggests a potential therapeutic benefit that addresses the underlying cause of the disease. The potential for nomlabofusp to improve clinical outcomes for FA patients could lead to significant demand for the treatment, assuming regulatory approval and favorable pricing and reimbursement conditions. Market Research Analyst The rare disease market, particularly for conditions like Friedreich’s ataxia, is often characterized by high unmet medical needs and a willingness to adopt novel therapies. Larimar's focus on this niche market could position them favorably in terms of pricing power and market penetration. The successful Phase 2 results and the alignment with the FDA on a novel surrogate endpoint may serve as a competitive advantage, attracting potential partnerships or buyout interest from larger pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their rare disease portfolios.However, the success of Larimar in the stock market will depend on their ability to navigate the complex regulatory environment, manage their cash burn effectively and eventually deliver a marketable product. The interim data from the OLE study and the outcome of discussions with the FDA will be critical in shaping investor perceptions and the company's market valuation in the near term. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Positive top-line data from Phase 2 dose exploration study of nomlabofusp, which was generally well-tolerated, with dose-dependent increases in tissue frataxin levels observedInitiated discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the potential use of tissue frataxin levels as a novel surrogate endpoint to support a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submission for accelerated approval targeted for 2H 2025In January 2024, initiated open label extension (OLE) study with 25 mg daily dosing of nomlabofusp, with first patient dosed in March 2024; interim data expected in Q4 2024 Recent successful financing that raised $161.6 million extends expected operating runway into 2026. BALA CYNWYD, Pa., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. (“Larimar”) (Nasdaq: LRMR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for complex rare diseases, today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating and financial results. “This year we made tremendous progress across key clinical and regulatory milestones for our nomlabofusp program. We were thrilled to recently report positive top-line data and successful completion of our Phase 2 dose exploration study. Nomlabofusp was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent increases in skin and buccal cell frataxin levels. Importantly, skin frataxin levels as a percentage of levels in healthy volunteers more than doubled in all patients after 14 days of daily treatment with 50 mg. The clear dose-response and the magnitude of increase in tissue frataxin levels further reinforces the therapeutic potential of nomlabofusp to address frataxin deficiency, the known root cause of disease in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia (FA),” said Carole Ben-Maimon, MD, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Larimar. “Additionally, the first patient in our OLE study has been dosed. The OLE study will inform on the long-term safety profile and long-term tissue frataxin levels. We remain on track to report interim data from the OLE study in the fourth quarter of 2024.” Dr. Ben-Maimon continued, “On the regulatory front, we are continuing discussions with the FDA on the potential use of frataxin as a novel surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval. We are also beginning to plan for a global double-blind placebo-controlled confirmatory study expected to be initiated prior to a potential BLA submission. The BLA submission is targeted for the second half of 2025. We believe our clinical datasets supporting nomlabofusp’s differentiated mechanism of action, coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and expected runway into 2026, strongly position us for execution of our upcoming pivotal milestones designed to help address the urgent unmet needs of the FA community.” Recent Highlights In February 2024, Larimar announced positive top-line data and successful completion of its four-week, placebo-controlled Phase 2 dose exploration study of nomlabofusp (CTI-1601) in patients with FA. Nomlabofusp was generally well-tolerated up to 4-weeks, had a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, and led to dose-dependent increases in frataxin in skin and buccal cells after daily dosing of 14 days followed by every other day dosing until day 28 in the 25 mg and 50 mg cohorts. Increases in frataxin levels in skin cells were seen in all treated patients, and in buccal cells for the majority of patients. At Day 14, all patients (with quantifiable levels at baseline and Day 14) treated with 50 mg of nomlabofusp achieved frataxin levels in skin cells greater than 33% of the average level found in healthy volunteers, with 3 patients achieving levels greater than 50% of the average healthy volunteer level.In February 2024, Larimar announced that it had initiated discussions with the FDA on use of tissue frataxin levels as a potential novel surrogate endpoint. Larimar received FDA acknowledgement that frataxin deficiency appears to be critical to the pathogenic mechanism of FA, and that there continues to be an unmet need for treatments that address the underlying disease pathophysiology. Discussions to support an accelerated approval are ongoing with a BLA submission targeted for 2H 2025.In February 2024, Larimar raised net proceeds of approximately $161.6 million through a public offering of common stock. In March 2024, the first patient in the OLE study evaluating daily subcutaneous injections of 25 mg of nomlabofusp self-administered or administered by a caregiver was dosed. Participants who completed treatment in the Phase 2 dose exploration trial, or who previously completed a prior clinical trial of nomlabofusp, are potentially eligible to screen for the OLE study. The OLE study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and frataxin levels in peripheral tissues as well as other exploratory pharmacodynamic markers (lipid profiles and gene expression data) following long-term subcutaneous administration of nomlabofusp. Clinical assessments collected during the trial will be compared to data from a matched control arm derived from participants in the Friedreich’s Ataxia Clinical Outcome Measures Study (FACOMS) database. Interim data is expected in Q4 2024. To potentially escalate dose in the OLE study, data from the 50 mg cohort of the Phase 2 study, as well as available data from the 25 mg dose in the OLE study will be submitted for FDA review due to continued partial clinical hold. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $86.8 million. As noted above, in February 2024, we raised approximately $161.6 million in net proceeds through a public offering of common stock. The Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $13.0 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to a net loss of $9.4 million, or $0.21 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $10.6 million compared to $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by an increase of $1.1 million in drug manufacturing costs, an increase of $0.8 million in consulting expenditures, an increase of $0.7 million in personnel expense, an increase of $0.4 million in clinical costs related to an increase in the OLE study partially offset by a decrease in clinical costs associated with the Phase 2 nomlabofusp trial discussed above. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $3.5 million compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily driven by an increase of $0.2 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants made in 2023, an increase of $0.1 million in personnel expense and an increase of $0.1 million in operational costs primarily related to technology, partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in legal fees. For the full year 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $36.9 million, or $0.84 per share, compared to a net loss of $35.4 million, or $1.37 per share for the same period in 2022. Research and development expenses for the full year 2023 were $27.7 million compared to $24.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by an increase of $1.9 million in personnel expense, an increase of $1.3 million in clinical expense, an increase of $1.1 million in consulting expenditures, an increase of $0.5 million in nonclinical development costs, an increase of $0.5 million in internal lab costs, and an increase of $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants made in 2022 and 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in drug manufacturing costs and a decrease of $0.2 million in royalty fees associated with the milestone achieved in 2022. General and administrative expenses for the full year 2023 were $14.1 million compared to $12.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily driven by an increase of $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants made in 2022 and 2023, an increase of $0.5 million in personnel expense, an increase of $0.5 million in operational costs primarily related to technology and an increase of $0.4 million in professional fees primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting services, partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in insurance expense.

Revenues, net were $13.2 million, with a $1.9 million decrease in TCE revenues. Net income for Q4 2023 was $21.6 million, a significant increase from $6.5 million in Q4 2022. The company sold one MR tanker and recognized a $17.1 million gain. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The financial results reported by Pyxis Tankers Inc. indicate a mixed performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. While net income increased significantly due to a one-time gain from vessel sales, core operating metrics such as Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) revenues experienced a decline. The sale of the MR tanker and the recognition of a substantial gain is a strategic move, likely aimed at capitalizing on high asset values and optimizing the company's fleet in response to market conditions.From a market perspective, the strategic pivot to the dry-bulk sector and the acquisition of eco-efficient vessels suggest a long-term vision to diversify and tap into different market cycles. However, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and lower TCE revenues raise concerns about the company's day-to-day operational profitability, especially since these measures are critical indicators of a shipping company's underlying performance.The company's actions reflect a broader industry trend towards eco-efficiency and a response to global economic shifts, such as those caused by geopolitical events. Investors might interpret the vessel sales and acquisitions as proactive management, but they will also be watching closely to see if these changes translate to sustained profitability. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial health of Pyxis Tankers Inc., the significant increase in net income is primarily due to the sale of the MR tanker ""Pyxis Epsilon"". This one-off event skews the profitability picture and investors should consider the core operating income, which has seen a decline. The company's strategy to divest older assets and invest in the dry-bulk sector with the purchase of the ""Konkar Asteri"" is noteworthy, as it indicates a shift in asset allocation that could potentially offer better returns in the future.The funding of the new vessel through a combination of secured bank debt and cash on hand demonstrates a balanced approach to financing. The company's current cash position and the potential for modest bank debt usage provide a cushion for future investments or to weather any market downturns. However, given the volatile nature of the shipping industry, the company's ability to maintain profitability and manage debt levels will be critical for financial stability. Economist The shipping industry, as indicated by Pyxis Tankers Inc.'s recent financial results, is influenced by macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions. The reported strong chartering activity and the impact of the war in Ukraine on trade patterns are examples of external factors driving demand for tanker services. The company's performance is a microcosm of the broader economic landscape, where global GDP growth can directly affect cargo demand.The company's mention of the IMF's global economy growth estimate and Drewry's MR2 orderbook analysis provides context for the industry's supply-demand dynamics. While the current outlook appears positive, uncertainties such as inflation, monetary policy changes and geopolitical unrest could pose risks to the shipping sector. The company's strategic decisions, such as fleet diversification, are efforts to mitigate these risks and capitalize on the anticipated global economic growth. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Maroussi, Greece, March 14, 2024 – Pyxis Tankers Inc. (NASDAQ Cap Mkts: PXS), (the “Company” or “Pyxis Tankers”), an international shipping company, today announced unaudited results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. SummaryFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, our Revenues, net were $13.2 million. For the same period, our time charter equivalent (“TCE”) revenues were $12.0 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 13.6%, over the comparable period in 2022 when we operated more vessels. Our net income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $21.6 million, an increase of $15.1 million from net income of $6.5 million in the comparable period of 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we sold one MR tanker and recognized a $17.1 million gain. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the net income per common share was $2.04 basic and $1.76 diluted compared to the net income per common share of $0.61 basic and $0.53 diluted for the same period in 2022. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $7.7 million, a decrease of $2.0 million over the comparable period in 2022. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” below. On November 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with an unaffiliated third party to purchase an 82,013 dwt dry-bulk vessel built in 2015 at Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding, fitted with a ballast water treatment system and scrubber. The eco-efficient Kamsarmax, delivered on February 15, 2024, had a purchase price of $26.6 million which was funded by a combination of secured bank debt of $14.5 million and cash on hand. The five year amortizing bank loan is priced at SOFR plus 2.35% and is secured by, among other things, the vessel. We have named the vessel the “Konkar Asteri” and it commenced commercial operations on February 29, 2024. This acquisition of this mid-sized modern scrubber-fitted eco-vessel represents our second investment of our recent strategic expansion into the dry-bulk sector. On December 15, 2023, the vessel “Pyxis Epsilon”, a 2015 built 50,295 dwt. product tanker, was sold for $40.75 million in cash. After the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness secured by the vessel and the payment of various transaction costs, we received cash proceeds of $26.4 million, which will be used for general corporate purposes. A non-cash gain from asset disposition of $17.1 million was recognized in the fourth quarter, of 2023. Valentios Valentis, our Chairman and CEO, commented: “We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth fiscal quarter, 2023 with Revenues, net of $13.2 million and Net Income attributable to common shareholders of $21.6 million, which included a gain of $1.36 per fully diluted share on the sale of our eight-year-old MR. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the product tanker sector experienced strong chartering activity due to good global demand for transportation fuels, relatively low inventories of many petroleum products, healthy refinery margins, combined with the impact of the ongoing war in the Ukraine which has led to continued market dislocation of shifting trade patterns and ton-mile expansion of seaborne cargo transportation. During the fourth quarter, we reported an average daily TCE for our MR’s of almost $30,500. Recent hostilities in the Red Sea have further supported the strong product tanker environment and as of March 12, 2024, 92% of our MR available days in Q1 2024, were booked at an average TCE of $30,300 per day. Following the recent sale of the “Pyxis Epsilon”, we now own and operate three modern eco-efficient MR’s, two of which currently employed under short-term time charters and one on spot. Tanker asset values have continued to be exceptionally strong. In 2023, we took advantage of the market conditions to sell two of our MR’s, which had an average age of 11 years, to realize total capital gains of over $25 million and, most importantly, generate over $44 million in net cash proceeds after repayment of associated debt and transaction costs. In addition to strengthening our balance sheet, this cash infusion has given us the opportunity to diversify into the dry-bulk shipping. Our senior management team and Board of Directors have significant experience in this sector which, we believe, has a positive outlook given supply/demand fundamentals and may provide a counter-cyclical and seasonal balance to product tankers. In the later part of the third quarter of 2023, we acquired a 2016 Japanese built scrubber-fitted Ultramax, the “Konkar Ormi”, and last month completed the acquisition of 2015-built scrubber-fitted Kamsarmax, the “Konkar Asteri”. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the “Konkar Ormi” reported a daily TCE of over $16,900. With the commencement of operations of the “Konkar Asteri” in the current quarter, 70% of available days for our bulkers are booked at an average TCE of $19,600 per day as of March 12, 2024. At this junction, we expect the chartering environment for product tankers and dry-bulk carriers to remain constructive for the remainder of 2024. Solid global demand for seaborne cargoes of a broad range of refined petroleum products and dry-bulk commodities is expected to continue with the orderbook remaining highly manageable. Historically, demand growth for many refined products and dry-bulk commodities has been reasonably correlated to global GDP growth. The IMF recently estimated the global economies to increase 3.1% in 2024. According to Drewry, as of February 29, 2024, the MR2 orderbook stood at 181 or 10.7% of global fleet with similar 11% or 187 MR2 over 20 years of age. Net supply growth for MR2 of approximately 2% this year is a fair estimate in our opinion. Separately, in February 2024 Howe Robinson forecasted net fleet growth in the dry-bulk sector of 2.2% in 2024. Fundamental cargo demand is further supported by the ton-mile effects stemming from the continued hostilities of the Russian-Ukrainian war and in the Middle East, as well as the drought limiting transits at the Panama Canal which only boost the strength of our markets. While moderating inflation and the prospect of softening monetary policies by many central banks later this year promote more optimism, the growing complexity within our sectors and the uncertainty surrounding macro-economic conditions and global events necessitate continued prudent management. Given the current high asset value environment and positive outlook for our markets, developing accretive opportunities for fleet expansion of mid-sized vessels should continue to be challenging, especially for the purchase of modern eco-efficient MRs. In light of this, we expect to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation until more attractive situations materialize which may further enable us to enhance shareholder value. The current available cash on hand and short-term deposits of almost $48 million, combined with potential modest bank debt should provide us the funds and flexibility to pursue the acquisition of up to three additional mid-sized vessels at reasonable terms when the opportune moments arise. In the short-term, we expect to continue to use free cash flow to further increase balance sheet liquidity, repay debt and repurchase our common shares.” Results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 Amounts relating to variations in period–on–period comparisons shown in this section are derived from the unaudited consolidated financials presented below. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we reported Revenues, net of $13.2 million, or 27.9% lower than $18.4 million in the comparable 2022 period. Our net income attributable to common shareholders was $21.6 million, or $2.04 basic and $1.76 diluted net income per common share, compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders of $6.5 million, or $0.61 basic and $0.53 diluted net income per common share, for the same period in 2022. A $17.1 million gain on the sale of the MR vessel “Pyxis Epsilon” was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. The weighted average number of basic shares decreased slightly to remain at 10.6 million in the most recent period versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The weighted average number of diluted common shares in 2023 of 12.4 million shares assumes the full conversion of all the outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the most recent period. The average MR daily TCE rate during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $30,484 or 8.1% lower than the $33,182 MR daily TCE rate for the same period in 2022, due to lower demurrage income from lower spot chartering activity. The new dry-bulk carrier acquired in Fall 2023 had average an TCE rate of $16,932 for the fourth quarter. The revenue mix of the MR vessels for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 64% from short-term time charters and 36% from spot market employment, while the dry-bulk was hired in short-term time charter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2.0 million to $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $9.7 million for the same period in 2022 due to a lower average TCE and fewer operating MR’s. Results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 For the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported Revenues, net of $45.5 million, a decrease of $12.9 million, or 22.1%, from $58.3 million in the comparable period of 2022. During the twelve months of 2023, our MR’s were contracted for 1,101 days or 74% under short-term time charters and for the rest of the year employed in the spot market resulting in an overall MR average daily TCE rate of $26,633. The new dry-bulk “Konkar Ormi” contributed 88 additional operating days and was employed under a short-term time charter with an average daily TCE rate of $15,323. Our net income attributable to common shareholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $36.2 million, or income of $3.38 per common share basic and $2.94 per common share diluted, compared to a net income attributable to common shareholders of $12.5 million, or income of $1.18 per common share basic and $1.06 per common share diluted for the same period in 2022. During 2023, we recognized an aggregate gain from vessel sales of $25.1 million which includes an $8.0 million gain from “Pyxis Malou” sale in the first quarter of 2023 and $17.1 million gain from “Pyxis Epsilon” sale in the fourth quarter. Higher MR daily TCE rates of $26,633 and higher MR fleet utilization of 95.7% for our MR’s during the year ended December 31, 2023, were compared to a MR daily TCE rate of $25,739 and MR fleet utilization of 87.5% during the same period in 2022. During 2023, we operated on average one fewer MR, but ran one dry-bulk carrier for a portion of the year with the acquisition of the “Konkar Ormi” in the Fall.

Both vessels were under spot employment for 7 and 36 days, respectively, in 2022 as of the delivery date to their buyer. For the year ended December 31, 2022, “Revenues, net” attributable to these vessels was $595 thousand and “Voyage related costs and commissions” was $386 thousand. Also, a $8 thousand write-off of “MR Voyage related costs and commissions” related to the previous year’s voyage commissions of the “Pyxis Delta” has been excluded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The vessel was sold to an unaffiliated third party on January 13, 2020. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the same expenses attributable to these vessels were nil and $10 thousand, respectively. Also, a $19 thousand write-off of “MR Voyage related costs and commissions” related to the previous year’s voyage commissions of the “Pyxis Delta” has been excluded in the year ended on December 31, 2023. b) The eco-modified MR “Pyxis Malou” was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on March 23, 2023.c) The eco-efficient MR “Pyxis Epsilon” was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on December 15, 2023.2 The dry-bulker “Konkar Ormi” was delivered on September 14, 2023 and commenced her initial charter on October 5, 2023. 3 Subject to rounding; please see “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” below. Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Results for the Three Months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except as otherwise noted) Revenues, net: Revenues, net of $13.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, represented a decrease of $5.1 million, or 27.9%, from $18.4 million in the comparable period of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our MR average daily TCE rate for our fleet was $30,484, a $2,698 per day decrease from $33,182 for the same period in 2022. These changes were the result of operating one less MR as well as lower demurrage income due to lower spot chartering activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, which were offset by the higher utilization of 97.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 in comparison to the 90.7% in the same period of 2022. Total fleet ownership days in the fourth quarter of 2023 were 443 or on average 4.8 vessels compared with 460 days or on average 5.0 vessels for the same period of 2022. This decrease was due to the sales of the “Pyxis Malou” in March 2023 and “Pyxis Epsilon” in December 2023 counterbalanced by the acquisition of the new dry-bulk carrier “Konkar Ormi” in September 2023. Voyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, represented a decrease of $3.3 million, or 71.7%, from $4.5 million in the same period of 2022, primarily as a result of lower spot employment for our MRs from 180 days in the fourth quarter in 2022 to 88 days in the same period of 2023. Under spot charters, all voyage expenses are typically borne by us rather than the charterer and a decrease in spot employment results in decreased voyage related costs and commissions. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $3.1 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, remained stable compared to 2022 and reflected slightly less vessel ownership days offset by the effects of inflationary cost pressures. General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 remained relatively stable compared to the same period of 2022. Management fees: For the three months ended December 31, 2023, management fees charged from our tanker ship manager, Pyxis Maritime Corp. (“Maritime”), our dry-bulk ship manager Konkar Shipping Agencies S.A. (“Konkar Agencies”), both affiliated entities with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Valentis, and from International Tanker Management Ltd. (“ITM”), the technical manager of our MRs, remained relatively constant to $0.4 million compared to the same period in 2022. Amortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs of $0.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, remained flat compared to the same period of 2022. Depreciation: Depreciation of $1.6 million for the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, remained relatively constant compared to 1.5 million for the quarter that ended December 31, 2022, as a result of ceasing depreciations of the sold tankers “Pyxis Malou” and “Pyxis Epsilon”, offset by the addition of bulker vessel “Konkar Ormi”. Interest and finance costs, net: Interest and finance costs, net of $1.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, increased $0.2 million or 15.2% compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2022. Despite lower average debt levels, higher LIBOR/SOFR indexed rates drove to higher interest costs on all the floating rate bank debt. Gain from the sale of vessels, net: During the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a gain of $17.1 million from the sale of the “Pyxis Epsilon”, which was delivered to her new owners on December 15, 2023. Interest income: Interest income, $0.4 million received during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to nil for the same period in 2022, due to larger balances of short-term time deposits. Gain assumed by non-controlling interest: Gain assumed by the non-controlling interest for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, of $0.1 million represented the 40% share of the gain which is attributable to the Non-Controlling Interest in the dry-bulk joint venture for the “Konkar Ormi” (the “NCI”). Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Results for the Years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except as otherwise noted) Revenues, net: Revenues, net of $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, represented a decrease of $12.9 million, or 22%, from $58.3 million in the comparable period of 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our MR average daily TCE rate was $26,633, a $894 per day or 3.5% increase from $25,739 per day for the same 2022 period primarily due to the improved fleet utilization from 87.5% to 95.7%. Voyage related costs and commissions decreased by $11.0 million as discussed below. Ownership days in 2023 were 1,634 for an average of 4.5 vessels in our total fleet compared with 1,912 days for an average of 5.2 vessels in the same period of 2022. This decrease in 2023 reflects the sales of the “Pyxis Malou” and “Pyxis Epsilon”, partially offset by the acquisition of the “Konkar Ormi” dry-bulk carrier. In 2023, the “Konkar Ormi” contributed 109 ownership days and her maiden voyage was a short-term time charter at a daily TCE rate of $15,323. Voyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, represented a decrease of $11.0 million, or 63.4%, from $17.4 million for the same period of 2022. We operated one fewer MR on average during 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our MRs were employed on spot charters for 381 days in total, compared to 919 days in 2022. Lower spot chartering activity for our MRs contributes to lower voyage costs which are typically borne by us rather than the charterer, thus an increase in spot employment results in increased voyage related costs and commissions. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, represented a $0.9 million or 6.9% decrease compared to $12.5 million for the same period ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was mainly attributed to the sale of the “Pyxis Malou” during the first quarter of 2023. Fleet ownership days for the year ended December 31, 2023, aggregated 1,634 days consisting of 1,525 days for our MR’s plus 109 days for the dry-bulk vessel compared to 1,912 days for the same period in 2022, including the “Northsea Alpha”, “Northsea Beta” which were sold in the first quarter of 2022. General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, represented an increase of $0.9 million or 37.5%, from $2.5 million in the comparable period in 2022, mainly due to the performance bonus of $0.6 million paid to Maritime. The increase also includes the non-cash $171 thousand charge of the common shares granted under the Company’s existing Employee Incentive Program (the “EIP”). In May 2023, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors approved the issuance of a total of 55,000 restricted common shares under the EIP to 24 employees, board members and Company affiliates. The restricted shares have vesting periods through November 2024. In addition, certain administrative fees were adjusted by 9.65% to reflect the 2022 inflation rate in Greece. Management fees: For the year ended December 31, 2023, management fees paid to Maritime, ITM and Konkar Agencies of $1.5 million in the aggregate, represented a decrease of $0.1 million compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was the result of the sales of “Northsea Alpha” and “Northsea Beta” during 2022 and the sales of “Pyxis Malou” and “Pyxis Epsilon” during 2023, partially offset by the acquisition “Konkar Ormi”, and by a 9.65% increase in ship management fees due Maritime for the inflationary effects in Greece from the prior year. Amortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, remained flat compared to the same period in 2022. Depreciation: Depreciation of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased by $0.6 million or 9.8% compared to $6.1 million in the comparable period of 2022. The decrease was attributed to the sales of vessels “Pyxis Malou” and “Pyxis Epsilon” during the first and the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the acquisition of the “Konkar Ormi” in the third quarter of 2023. Gain from the sale of vessels, net: During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded total gains of $25.1 million, including an $8.0 million gain from the sale of the “Pyxis Malou”, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023, and $17.1 million gain from the sale of the “Pyxis Epsilon”, which occurred in December 2023. In the comparable period in 2022, we recorded a loss of $0.5 million related to reposition costs for the deliveries of the “Northsea Alpha” and “Northsea Beta” to their buyer. Loss from debt extinguishment: During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a loss from debt extinguishment of $0.4 million reflecting the write-off of the remaining unamortized balance of deferred financing costs, which were associated with the loan repayments of the sold vessels, “Pyxis Malou”, “Pyxis Epsilon” and the debt refinancing of the “Pyxis Karteria”. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss from debt extinguishment of $34 thousand reflecting the write-off of the remaining unamortized balance of deferred financing costs, which were associated with the repayments of the “Northsea Alpha” and “Northsea Beta” loans. Gain/(Loss) from financial derivative instruments: On January 27, 2023, we sold our $9.6 million 2% interest rate cap and we recorded a $59 thousand loss while we realized $0.6 million in net cash. For the comparable year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a $0.6 million valuation gain related to this interest rate cap purchased in July 2021. Interest and finance costs, net: Interest and finance costs, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $5.8 million, compared to $4.4 million in the comparable period in 2022, an increase of $1.4 million, or 31.4%. Despite lower average debt levels, this increase was primarily attributable to higher LIBOR/SOFR indexed rates paid on all the floating rate bank debt. In addition to scheduled loan amortization, we prepaid the $6.0 million 7.5% Promissory Note in full during the first quarter of 2023. On March 13, 2023, we completed the debt refinancing of the “Pyxis Karteria”, our 2013 built vessel, with a $15.5 million five year secured loan from a new lender. The loan is priced at SOFR plus 2.7%. Interest income: Interest income from time deposits, $1.2 million received during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to nil for the same period in 2022, due to larger balances of short-term time deposits. Loss assumed by non-controlling interest: Loss assumed by non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $0.2 million represented the 40% share of the loss which is attributable to the NCI in the single ship dry-bulk joint venture.

Our next loan maturity is scheduled for July 2025 with a balloon principal payment of $9.55 million due on the “Pyxis Theta”. On December 31, 2023, we had a total of 10,542,547 common shares issued and outstanding of which Mr. Valentis beneficially owned 54.3%, 403,631 Series A Preferred Shares (NASDAQ Cap Mkts: PXSAP), which have conversion price of $5.60, and 1,591,062 warrants (NASDAQ Cap Mkts: PXSAW), which have an exercise price of $5.60, (excluding non-tradeable underwriter’s common stock purchase warrants of which 107,143 and 3,460 have exercise prices of $8.75 and $5.60, respectively, and 2,000 and 2,683 Series A Preferred Shares purchase warrants which have an exercise price of $24.92 and $25.00 per share, respectively). In the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 331,591 common shares at an average price of $3.75 per share, including brokerage commissions, utilizing $1.2 million under the authorized $2.0 million re-purchase program. In November 2023 our Board of Directors authorized a six-month extension through May 2024 of the program which may also include the re-purchase of Series A Preferred Shares. As of March 12, 2024, we had spent an additional $192 thousand for the repurchase of 43,357 common shares. Dry-dockings In 2023, we completed the second special survey for the 2013-built “Pyxis Karteria” and “Pyxis Theta”, the latter of which we installed a ballast water treatment system. In aggregate, during 2023, we incurred 43 dry-docking days and capital costs of $1.5 million. Our next special survey is scheduled for the “Konkar Asteri” in 2025. Subsequent Events On February 15, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of an 82,013 dwt dry-bulk vessel built in 2015 at Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding. The $26.625 million purchase price of the eco-efficient Kamsarmax, fitted with a ballast water treatment system and scrubber, was funded by a combination of secured bank debt of $14.5 million and cash on hand. The five year amortizing bank loan is priced at SOFR plus 2.35% and is secured by, among other things, the vessel. The vessel has been named the “Konkar Asteri” and commenced its commercial operations on February 29, 2024. Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) represent the sum of net income, interest and finance costs, depreciation and amortization and, if any, income taxes during a period. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before certain non-operating or non-recurring charges, such as interest income, loss from debt extinguishment, loss or gain from financial derivative instrument and loss or gain from sales of vessels. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented in this press release as we believe that they provide investors with means of evaluating and understanding how our management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect: our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our funded debt. In addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have standardized meanings and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles net income, as reflected in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: (Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three months endedDecember 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2022 2023 2022 2023Reconciliation of Net Interest to Adjusted EBITDA Net income$6,706 $21,886 $13,392 $36,836 Depreciation 1,538 1,552 6,100 5,503 Amortization of special survey costs 118 114 384 388 Interest and finance costs 1,419 1,634 4,441 5,835 EBITDA$9,781 $25,186$24,317 $48,562 Interest income — (441) — (1,240) Loss from debt extinguishment — 92 34 379 Loss/(Gain) from financial derivative instrument (44) — (555) 59 (Gain)/Loss from the sales of vessels, net — (17,108) 466 (25,125) Adjusted EBITDA$9,737 $7,729 $24,262 $22,635 Daily TCE is a shipping industry performance measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Daily TCE is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We utilize daily TCE because we believe it is a meaningful measure to compare period-to-period changes in our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which our vessels may be employed between the periods. Our management also utilizes daily TCE to assist them in making decisions regarding the employment of the vessels. We calculate daily TCE by dividing Revenues, net after deducting Voyage related costs and commissions, by operating days for the relevant period. Voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage commissions, port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract. Vessel operating expenses (“Opex”) per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel, which primarily consist of crew wages and related costs, insurance, lube oils, communications, spares and consumables, tonnage taxes as well as repairs and maintenance, divided by the ownership days in the applicable period. We calculate utilization (“Utilization”) by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the same period. We use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable employment for our vessels and minimize the number of days that our vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings or vessel positioning. Ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the vessels in our fleet. Available days are the number of ownership days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the respective period for such repairs, upgrades and surveys. Operating days are the number of available days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire or out of service due to any reason, including technical breakdowns and unforeseen circumstances. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Opex and daily TCE are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and should not be regarded as substitutes for Revenues, net and Net income. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Opex and daily TCE does not imply, and should not be construed as an inference, that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

During 2022 and 2023, the vessels in our fleet were employed under time and spot charters. * a) Our two small tankers “Northsea Alpha” and “Northsea Beta” were sold on January 28, and March 1, 2022, respectively. Both vessels had been under spot employment for 7 and 36 days, respectively, in 2022 as of the delivery date to their buyer. The small tankers have been excluded from the table calculations for the 2022 period. b) In February 2022, the “Pyxis Epsilon” experienced a brief grounding at port which resulted in minor damages to the vessel. The vessel was off-hire for 43 days including shipyard repairs and returned to commercial employment at the end of March 2022. The respective vessel was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on December 15, 2023. c) The Eco-Modified “Pyxis Malou” was sold to an unaffiliated buyer on March 23, 2023. d) The “Konkar Ormi” commenced the initial charter on October 5, 2023 and was fixed on a time charter for 65 days, at $16,250 per day and an additional ballast bonus payment of $625,500. e) The “Konkar Asteri” commenced the initial charter on February 29, 2024 and was fixed on a time charter for $20 – 25 days, at $17,750 per day.

Fury now holds approximately 19.99% of Dolly Varden's common shares, well-positioned for future activities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent transaction involving Fury Gold Mines Limited's sale of Dolly Varden Silver Corp. shares is significant for several reasons. Firstly, the liquidity infusion from this sale provides Fury with additional capital to further its exploration projects, potentially increasing the company's asset value over time. The choice of institutional investors as buyers indicates a level of confidence in Fury's long-term strategy and the quality of the assets being explored.From a market perspective, the sale modifies Fury's stake in Dolly Varden, which could have implications for shareholder dynamics and voting power. The slight reduction in ownership post the anticipated closing of Dolly Varden's bought deal offering suggests a strategic decision to diversify holdings while maintaining significant influence. Investors should monitor Fury's ongoing evaluation of its investment, as future transactions could signal changes in the company's strategy or financial health. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of Fury's sale, the gross proceeds of C$4,005,750 are a noteworthy injection of capital. However, the price per share of C$0.735 should be compared against the current market valuation of Dolly Varden's stock to assess the deal's attractiveness. If the shares were sold at a premium or discount, it could reflect on Fury's negotiation capability and the immediate impact on its cash reserves.For investors, the use of proceeds for exploration and working capital is a double-edged sword. While it could lead to discovery of valuable resources, exploration is inherently risky and capital-intensive. The success of these projects will be a critical factor in Fury's future revenue and growth potential. Investors should consider the company's track record in exploration and resource management when evaluating this investment. Mining Sector Analyst The sale's impact on Fury's operational strategy is clear; it underscores the company's commitment to its Eau Claire and Éléonore South projects. These projects are located in Quebec, a region known for its mineral wealth and supportive mining regulatory environment. The strategic allocation of funds towards exploration rather than holding a larger stake in Dolly Varden suggests a focus on core competencies and resource development.However, maintaining a 19.99% stake pre-offering and approximately 18.99% post-offering in Dolly Varden indicates Fury's ongoing interest in Dolly's performance. This stake is substantial enough to be influential, possibly providing Fury with strategic leverage in Dolly Varden's operational decisions. Investors should be aware of the symbiotic relationship between the two companies and how it might affect Fury's market position and risk profile. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2024 / Fury Gold Mines Limited (TSX:FURY)(NYSE American:FURY) (""Fury"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has completed the previously announced sale of 5,450,000 common shares of Dolly Varden Silver Corp.

Recent events include progress in clinical trials for AK006, publication of preclinical research, and restructuring to focus on AK006 development. The company expects cash runway extension till mid-2026. Financially, Q4 2023 saw increased R&D expenses, a net loss of $62.6 million, and ending with $170.8 million in cash. Positive Progress in clinical trials for AK006 and publication of preclinical research showcase Allakos' commitment to developing treatments for allergic and inflammatory diseases. Restructuring activities to focus on AK006 development demonstrate cost-saving measures and strategic planning for the company's future. Cash runway extension till mid-2026 provides financial stability and confidence in the company's ability to fund ongoing operations and clinical trials. Ending Q4 2023 with $170.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments indicates a strong financial position for Allakos. Net loss of $62.6 million in Q4 2023, along with increased R&D expenses, highlights the challenges faced by the company in terms of financial performance. Negative Increased research and development expenses in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 indicate rising operational costs that may impact profitability. Net loss of $62.6 million in Q4 2023 raises concerns about the company's ability to achieve sustainable profitability in the near future. Ending Q4 2023 with a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.1 million suggests potential cash flow challenges or significant expenditures during the quarter. Financial Analyst The financial update from Allakos Inc. indicates a significant increase in research and development expenses, primarily due to manufacturing costs and clinical study expenses. This could be seen as a strategic investment in their pipeline, especially with the focus shifting towards AK006's clinical development after halting lirentelimab-related activities. However, investors should note the increased burn rate, with the company's net loss widening from the previous year. The projected cash runway extension into mid-2026, following restructuring, may offer some reassurance, but the estimated net cash used in operating activities for 2024 suggests a substantial outflow. It's essential to monitor the upcoming milestones for AK006, as positive results could be a catalyst for the company's valuation. Conversely, any setbacks could exacerbate financial strain. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the cessation of lirentelimab development and the shift in focus to AK006 is a critical strategic decision. AK006's targeting of multiple activating receptors and key signaling pathways in mast cells could make it a novel treatment for allergic and inflammatory diseases. The upcoming milestones, including safety and efficacy data from Phase 1 trials, will be pivotal in assessing the potential of AK006. For industry stakeholders, the ability of AK006 to successfully occupy the Siglec-6 receptor in skin biopsy samples could signify a breakthrough in treating conditions like chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, it's important to remain cautious until the data from the trials are fully disclosed and peer-reviewed. Market Research Analyst Within the biotechnology sector, Allakos's strategic pivot is noteworthy. The focus on a single candidate, AK006, may streamline resources but also increases risk concentration. The biotech market is highly responsive to clinical trial outcomes, which means upcoming results could significantly influence investor sentiment. The company's ability to extend its cash runway into mid-2026 is positive, showing prudent financial management amidst restructuring. However, the market will keep a close eye on the cash burn rate and any potential need for future capital raises, which could dilute current shareholders' equity. Long-term, the success of AK006 is crucial for Allakos's market positioning and growth prospects. 03/14/2024 - 04:02 PM SAN CARLOS, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allakos Inc.

About Allakos Allakos is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics that target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergy, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows for the direct targeting of cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. The Company’s most advanced product candidate is AK006. AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed on mast cells. Mast cells are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. In preclinical studies, AK006 appears to provide deep mast cell inhibition and, in addition to its inhibitory activity, reduce mast cell numbers.

Negative Net loss in the fourth quarter and fiscal year, Decrease in total net sales for fiscal 2023, Negative comparable sales performance, Expected loss in earnings per share for the first quarter, Slowing store growth in Europe, Closing underperforming stores in the U.S. Financial Analyst The reported net sales increase of 0.6% for Zumiez in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, ending February 3, 2024, indicates a relatively stable revenue stream year-over-year. However, the net loss of $33.5 million for the quarter, compared to a net income in the prior year, is a significant downturn, heavily influenced by a $41.1 million goodwill impairment charge. This charge suggests a strategic reassessment of the company's European operations, specifically the Blue Tomato business. The impairment reflects revised future cash flow projections and a pivot to focus on profitability rather than expansion.From an investment standpoint, the company's cash position remains robust with $171.6 million in cash and marketable securities, which is reassuring despite the slight decrease from the previous year. The capital expenditures being offset by operating cash flows demonstrate prudent financial management. However, the 8.6% decrease in total net sales for the fiscal year and the net loss inclusive of the goodwill impairment charge highlight challenges that the company faces.The provided fiscal outlook for the first quarter of 2024, with expected net sales of $167 to $172 million and an anticipated loss per share, indicates that the company is still in a period of adjustment. The strategic decision to slow store growth and close underperforming stores, while focusing on operational efficiencies, labor cost alignment and brand investment, is a response to the challenging global operating environment. Market Research Analyst Zumiez's performance reflects broader industry trends in specialty retail, where consumer behavior and market dynamics are rapidly evolving. The mention of stronger-than-anticipated fourth quarter results, particularly in the North American men's business, suggests a potential rebound in specific market segments. However, the overall decrease in comparable store sales, especially the steep 17.8% drop in other international markets, underscores the volatility and regional disparities within the retail sector.Investors should note the company's strategic shift towards enhancing productivity over expansion, which aligns with industry best practices in the current economic climate. The focus on launching new brands and maintaining service levels indicates an effort to differentiate and strengthen customer loyalty. These initiatives could potentially lead to improved performance in the long term, despite the current downturn in sales and profitability.It is also important to consider the company's initiatives to drive efficiencies and reduce labor costs, which could improve margins over time. However, the short-term impact of these changes, along with the anticipated net sales decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, may continue to affect investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. Retail Industry Consultant The fiscal year results for Zumiez Inc. reflect the strain on the retail industry, particularly for businesses operating internationally. The decision to slow store growth in Europe and focus on increasing the productivity of existing stores is a strategic move that many retailers consider when faced with a challenging operating environment. This strategy is often adopted to optimize the profitability of each location and to ensure that expansion does not outpace the company's ability to support new stores effectively.Furthermore, the closure of underperforming stores in the U.S. and the reduction of labor costs are indicative of a broader industry trend towards streamlining operations. Such measures are typically employed to align expenses with current revenue levels and can help stabilize financial performance in the short term. However, the long-term success of these initiatives will depend on the company's ability to balance cost-cutting with investments in consumer engagement and brand development.The emphasis on winning with the consumer through new brands and service levels is a critical aspect of retail success. Zumiez's commitment to this approach, despite the immediate financial challenges, could position the company well for future growth as market conditions improve. However, investors should monitor the effectiveness of these consumer-centric initiatives and their impact on sales and profitability. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM LYNNWOOD, Wash., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2024 (14 weeks) increased 0.6% to $281.8 million from $280.1 million in the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2023 (13 weeks). Net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was $33.5 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to net income of $11.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2023 fourth quarter results reflect a goodwill impairment charge of $41.1 million, or $2.13 per share after-tax, related to the Company’s decision to slow store growth and focus on profitability in Europe and the corresponding impact on the future cash flow projections of its Blue Tomato business. Total net sales for the twelve months (53 weeks) ended February 3, 2024 decreased 8.6% to $875.5 million from $958.4 million reported for the twelve months (52 weeks) ended January 28, 2023. Net loss for fiscal 2023 inclusive of the $41.1 million goodwill impairment charge was $62.6 million, or $3.25 per share, compared to net income for fiscal 2022 of $21.0 million, or $1.08 per diluted share. At February 3, 2024, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $171.6 million compared to cash and current marketable securities of $173.5 million at January 28, 2023. The slight decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures, offset by cash flow from operating activities. Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc., stated, “We concluded a difficult year with stronger than anticipated fourth quarter results as our consolidated monthly sales trend accelerated in January. Within our recent performance, there were multiple areas that showed a marked improvement, led by our North American men’s business which grew year-over-year in the fourth quarter. While we are encouraged by our stronger than anticipated fourth quarter and sustained quarterly improvements as we moved through the year, the global operating environment remains challenging and therefore we are further adjusting our strategies to balance the interests of our shareholders and customers. For 2024, this includes slowing store growth in Europe and focusing on increasing the productivity of our current footprint in the region. We are also continuing to close underperforming stores in the U.S., reducing labor costs to align with lower revenue levels, and looking to drive even greater efficiencies throughout the organization. At the same time, we’ll invest to ensure we are winning with the consumer by launching new, highly sought-after brands, maintaining our best-in-class service levels, and strengthening our customer connections. We have successfully navigated down cycles before and I am confident in our teams’ ability to return the Company to growth and enhanced profitability both in the near-term and the years ahead.” Fiscal First Quarter-to-Date Sales Total first quarter-to-date sales for the four weeks ended March 2, 2024 decreased 3.1%, from the four weeks ended February 25, 2023. Comparable sales for the four weeks ended March 2, 2024 decreased 6.2% from the four weeks ended March 4, 2023. From a regional perspective, comparable sales for North America decreased 2.6% and other international comparable sales decreased 17.8%.

Financially, the company reported $201.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023. Positive Kezar Life Sciences is making significant progress with its zetomipzomib programs for autoimmune disorders. The PALIZADE Phase 2b trial for lupus nephritis and PORTOLA Phase 2a trial for autoimmune hepatitis are actively enrolling patients. The company expects topline data from the PALIZADE and PORTOLA trials in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The KZR-261 dose escalation study is currently enrolling its ninth cohort with a data update expected by year-end. Kezar reported $201.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023. Negative Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $32.3 million, compared to $18.2 million in the same period in 2022. Total shares of common stock outstanding were 72.8 million shares as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to operational expenses. Medical Research Analyst The ongoing PALIZADE and PORTOLA clinical trials conducted by Kezar Life Sciences are significant in the field of autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus nephritis (LN) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The trials' progress is essential to understanding the efficacy and safety of zetomipzomib, a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor. The drug's novel mechanism of action, which targets protein degradation pathways in immune cells, may offer a new therapeutic option for patients who have limited treatment choices. The collaboration with Everest Medicines to develop and commercialize zetomipzomib in Asia indicates a strategic move to expand the drug's market reach and is a positive step towards global development.From a research perspective, the primary efficacy endpoints of the trials are robust and clinically relevant. For LN, achieving a complete renal response and for AIH, normalization of liver enzyme levels with successful corticosteroid tapering are meaningful outcomes that could translate into significant patient benefits. The data from these trials will be critical in determining the drug's potential impact on treatment paradigms in these conditions. Financial Analyst Kezar Life Sciences' financial results reflect a strategic investment in their clinical-stage programs, with R&D expenses increasing due to the costs associated with advancing the PALIZADE and PORTOLA trials. The company's cash reserves of $201.4 million, while lower than the previous year, still provide a runway to continue its research activities. However, investors should note the net loss increase in 2023 compared to 2022, indicating higher expenditure as the company progresses through costly clinical development phases.The upfront payment from the Everest Medicines collaboration adds a non-dilutive revenue stream, which is encouraging, but it's important to monitor the company's burn rate and future funding needs. The restructuring and impairment charges suggest a strategic pivot or cost-saving measures, which are not uncommon in the biotech industry, especially when companies are pre-revenue and focusing resources on their most promising programs. Market Research Analyst Autoimmune diseases represent a significant market with unmet medical needs and Kezar's focus on LN and AIH positions the company in a niche yet potentially lucrative segment. The positive IND approval from China's NMPA for the PALIZADE trial in China is a pivotal step for market expansion and can serve as a catalyst for future growth in the Asian markets. In addition, the broad-spectrum Sec61 translocon inhibitor, KZR-261, targeting solid tumors, diversifies Kezar's pipeline and addresses a more extensive market in oncology.The company's strategic alignment with Everest Medicines could facilitate quicker patient enrollment in Asia and potentially expedite the trials' completion. This partnership could also offer leverage in negotiating future commercialization agreements, given Everest's established presence in the region. As the company approaches the data readout milestones in mid-2025 and mid-2026, anticipation from the market is likely to increase, potentially affecting the stock's volatility and investor interest. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM PALIZADE Phase 2b clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with active lupus nephritis actively enrolling; reiterating guidance of topline data in mid-2026 PORTOLA Phase 2a clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with autoimmune hepatitis actively enrolling; reiterating guidance of topline data in mid-2025 KZR-261 dose escalation study currently enrolling ninth cohort; data update by year-end Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $201.4 million as of December 31, 2023 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kezar Life Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: KZR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing breakthrough treatments for immune-mediated and oncologic disorders, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. ""The efforts over the past year by the team at Kezar have put us in a strong position as we advance our promising, first-in-class immunology and oncology programs,"" said Chris Kirk, Kezar’s Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused with the zetomipzomib program on bringing this important new agent to patients with autoimmune hepatitis and lupus nephritis, both severe and poorly treated autoimmune disorders. Our PORTOLA and PALIZADE trials remain on track for readouts in 2025 and 2026, which we expect to demonstrate the potential of zetomipzomib as a promising new agent for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders. Additionally, we are eager to share data from the KZR-261 program in solid tumors in the fourth quarter of 2024, which will include dose escalation and initial dose expansion safety, PK/PD, and exploratory efficacy analyses. With our strong team and solid balance sheet, we are well positioned to deliver meaningful results across our programs, for the patients and our shareholders.” Zetomipzomib: Selective Immunoproteasome Inhibitor Clinical Development: PALIZADE – Phase 2b clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with active LN (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05781750) PALIZADE is a global, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two dose-levels of zetomipzomib in patients with active LN. Target enrollment will be 279 patients, randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 30 mg of zetomipzomib, 60 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks, in addition to standard background therapy. Background therapy can, but will not be mandated to, include standard induction therapy. Over the initial 16 weeks, there will be a mandatory corticosteroid taper to 5 mg per day or less. End-of-treatment assessments will occur at Week 53. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve a complete renal response (CRR) at Week 37, including a urine protein-to-creatine ratio (UPCR) of 0.5 or less without receiving rescue or prohibited medications. PORTOLA – Phase 2a clinical trial of zetomipzomib in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who have not benefited from standard-of-care treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05569759) PORTOLA is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH that are insufficiently responding to standard of care or have relapsed. Target enrollment will be 24 patients, randomized (2:1) to receive 60 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo in addition to background corticosteroid therapy for 24 weeks, with a protocol-mandated steroid taper by Week 14. The primary efficacy endpoint will measure the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response measured as normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels with a successful corticosteroid taper by Week 24. Collaboration with Everest Medicines: In September 2023, Kezar entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Everest Medicines to develop and commercialize zetomipzomib in Greater China, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Everest Medicines is joining Kezar on the PALIZADE clinical trial and will contribute their local regulatory and clinical trial expertise to enroll patients in these geographies. In February 2024, the Centre for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved the investigational new drug (IND) application for the initiation of PALIZADE in China. In addition to PALIZADE, Kezar and Everest Medicines have the opportunity to collaborate on future clinical trials and indications for the continued development of zetomipzomib. KZR-261: Broad-Spectrum Sec61 Translocon Inhibitor KZR-261-101 – Phase 1 clinical trial of KZR-261 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05047536) The Phase 1 clinical trial of KZR-261 is being conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion in tumor-specific solid tumors. The study is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, identify a recommended Phase 2 dose and to explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity of KZR-261 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The KZR-261 trial is currently enrolling Cohort 9 (80 mg/m2). Previously, Cohort 1 (1.8 mg/m2) through Cohort 8 (60 mg/m2) enrolled a total of 35 patients and completed rapid dose escalation without significant safety concerns. To date, KZR-261 has shown dose-proportional exposure and no signs of accumulation or altered pharmacokinetics with repeated dosing. Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $201.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $276.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operations to advance clinical-stage programs and preclinical research and development. Revenue for the year of 2023 was $7.0 million resulting from the upfront payment under the collaboration and license agreement with Everest Medicines. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $7.7 million to $22.6 million, compared to $14.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year R&D expenses increased by $34.7 million to $85.7 million in 2023, compared to $51.0 million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to clinical trial costs related to the PALIZADE and PORTOLA trials, a milestone payment made to Onyx Therapeutics, and an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation and facility-related expenses. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $0.6 million to $5.8 million compared to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year G&A expenses increased by $6.4 million to $26.5 million in 2023, compared to $20.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional service expense in connection with the collaboration and license agreement with Everest Medicines and an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation, personnel and facility-related expenses. Restructuring and impairment charges for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $6.2 million. The charges comprised primarily of one-time employee termination benefits and long-lived assets impairment costs related to the right-of-use asset and certain property and equipment no longer utilized. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $32.3 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for 2023 was $101.9 million, or $1.40 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $68.2 million, or $1.01 per basic and diluted common share, in 2022. Total shares of common stock outstanding were 72.8 million shares as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, there were options to purchase 13.1 million shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.60 per share and 0.2 million restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

(NASDAQ: CDLX) reported its financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, showing positive growth in revenue and key metrics. The company achieved a positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time since 2019, with plans for double-digit billings growth in 2024 and positive operating cash flow. Despite a net loss attributable to common stockholders, Cardlytics improved its financial performance and aims to enhance its platform for partners and advertisers. Positive Positive growth in Total Revenue, Billings, and Adjusted Contribution for Q4 and full year 2023. Achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time since 2019. Plans for double-digit billings growth in 2024 and positive operating cash flow. Improved cost structure and focus on building a best-in-class platform for partners and advertisers. Increase in Cardlytics MAUs and stable ARPU for Q4 and full year 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst Cardlytics' financial performance indicates a positive trajectory, evidenced by an 8.1% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenue and a 3.6% increase for the full year. The shift to positive Adjusted EBITDA after several years is a pivotal moment, reflecting improved operational efficiency and cost management. The reported net loss reduction from $(378.3) million to $(100.8) million is substantial. However, the continued net loss raises questions about the company's long-term profitability and the sustainability of its growth model. The increase in MAUs is a positive sign of market penetration, but the stagnant ARPU suggests a need for improved monetization strategies. Market Research Analyst Cardlytics' focus on enhancing its digital advertising platform resonates with current industry trends towards targeted and personalized ad experiences. The reported growth in billings and adjusted contribution indicates that advertisers find value in Cardlytics' offerings. The company's forward guidance suggests confidence in continued growth, but it's essential to monitor if this translates into sustained positive free cash flow, which remains a critical metric for assessing the health of a business in the competitive ad tech landscape. Investment Advisor Investors should note the mixed signals in Cardlytics' report. On one hand, the positive Adjusted EBITDA and operational cash flow point to a potentially brighter financial future. On the other hand, the company's net losses and the slight decrease in ARPU year-over-year warrant caution. The guidance for Q1 2024, with Adjusted EBITDA ranging from a loss to breakeven, suggests that while the company is making progress, there's still uncertainty ahead. Investors should weigh these factors against the backdrop of the broader economic environment and the performance of the digital advertising sector. 03/14/2024 - 04:03 PM ATLANTA, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardlytics, Inc.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.

These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics To supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”). A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. We define Adjusted Contribution as a measure by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, delivery costs, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs. Adjusted contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. We define Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net Loss before income tax benefit; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefits); change in fair value of contingent consideration; foreign currency (gain) loss; impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; and restructuring and reduction of force. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; acquisition, integration and divestitures costs (benefits); amortization of acquired intangibles; change in fair value of contingent consideration; impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of patents and capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available to invest in the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance. We believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results, and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance. We define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We define ARPU as the total Revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.

Market Research Analyst The announcement by Harte Hanks regarding the 'Project Elevate' initiative is poised to significantly restructure the company's sales and marketing strategy. The projected $6 million cost reduction in 2024 and $16 million over two years could potentially improve the company's operating margins. This is a strategic move to enhance efficiency and reduce overhead costs, which is often well-received by investors as it can lead to improved profitability and shareholder value in the long-term.Moreover, the company's position with $18 million in cash and no debt provides a strong balance sheet that can support the costs associated with the transformation without compromising liquidity. This fiscal prudence is essential for executing long-term growth strategies and could make the company more resilient to market fluctuations. The focus on organic growth through revamping the go-to-market strategy and investing in lead generation is also a positive signal for future revenue streams. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Harte Hanks' fourth quarter results show a decline in revenue by 9.7% compared to the previous year, which may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's current market performance. However, the operating loss and net loss figures include substantial restructuring charges related to 'Project Elevate'. When these are excluded, the underlying performance suggests a potential improvement in profitability.The extension of the $25 million line of credit until mid-2025 enhances the company's financial flexibility, allowing it to pursue growth initiatives without immediate pressure to repay debts. The strategic decision to terminate Pension Plan 1 aligns with the broader objective to optimize the cost structure, which may be viewed positively in terms of future cost savings. Corporate Strategy Expert Strategically, Harte Hanks is embracing a transformation that focuses on organic growth and cost optimization. The addition of experienced sales leadership and the development of new sales divisions indicate a proactive approach to expanding market reach and enhancing customer relationships. The revised incentive structure for the sales team and the alignment between business units are critical for driving consistent pipeline growth and sales performance.The company's efforts to grow through strategic partnerships and events, as well as targeting the SMB and mid-market segments, demonstrate a clear strategy to tap into new revenue opportunities. This approach, if executed effectively, can lead to sustained growth and market share expansion. Stakeholders should monitor the implementation of these strategies and their impact on sales and profitability in the coming quarters. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM Project ""Elevate"" Sales and Marketing Transformation Revamped for Strategic Growth;Anticipate approximately $6 Million in 2024 Cost Reductions, $16 Million over Two Years;Ends Year with $18 Million of Cash and No DebtCHELMSFORD, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2024 / Harte Hanks, Inc.

However, the Company may use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance in order to provide investors with a better understanding of operating results and underlying trends to assess the Company's performance and liquidity in this press release and our related earnings conference call. We have presented herein a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure ""Adjusted Operating Income"" as a useful measure to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial results because it facilitates a period-to-period comparison of Operating Income excluding stock-based compensation and severance. The most directly comparable measure for this non-GAAP financial measure is Operating Income.The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure ""EBITDA"" as a supplemental measure of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. The Company defines ""EBITDA"" as Net Income adjusted to exclude income tax expense, other expense (income), net, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company defines ""Adjusted EBITDA"" as EBITDA adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and severance. The most directly comparable measure for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is Net Income. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are an important performance metric because it facilitates the analysis of our results, exclusive of certain non-cash items, including items which do not directly correlate to our business operations; however, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Income, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's financial performance.The use of non-GAAP measures do not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for GAAP performance but should provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful. The Company evaluates its operating performance based on several measures, including these non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and earnings conference call presentations are useful supplemental financial measures of operating performance for investors because they facilitate investors' ability to evaluate the operational strength of the Company's business. However, there are limitations to the use of these non-GAAP measures, including that they may not be calculated the same by other companies in our industry limiting their use as a tool to compare results. Any supplemental non-GAAP financial measures referred to herein are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the most comparable GAAP financial measures.Investor Relations Contact:Rob Fink or Tom Baumann646.809.4048 / 646.349.6641FNK IRHHS@fnkir.comHarte Hanks, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, In thousands, except per share amounts 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating revenue $49,491 $54,778 $191,492 $206,278 Operating expenses Labor 23,884 26,205 97,968 104,620 Production and distribution 16,410 19,530 59,568 61,930 Advertising, selling, general and administrative 4,602 4,650 20,673 21,893 Restructuring expense 5,687 - 5,687 - Depreciation and amortization expense 1,186 964 4,237 2,728 Total operating expenses 51,769 51,349 188,133 191,171 Operating income (2,278) 3,429 3,359 15,107 Other expense (income), net Interest (income) expense, net 15 125 (135) 438 Other expense (income), net 1,653 1,307 5,413 (4,644)Total other expense (income), net 1,668 1,432 5,278 (4,206)(Loss) income before income taxes (3,946) 1,997 (1,919) 19,313 Income tax benefit (1,969) (19,807) (349) (17,463)Net (loss) income (1,977) 21,804 (1,570) 36,776 Less: Loss from redemption of Preferred stock - 1,380 - 1,380 (Loss) income attributable to common stockholders $(1,977) $20,424 $(1,570) $35,396 (Loss) earnings per common share Basic $(0.27) $2.81 $(0.21) $4.98 Diluted $(0.27) $2.70 $(0.21) $4.75 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 7,221 7,267 7,310 7,101 Diluted 7,303 7,566 7,456 7,457 Comprehensive income, net of tax Net (loss) income $(1,977) $21,804 $(1,570) $36,776 Adjustment to pension liability 243 7,967 1,664 10,274 Foreign currency translation adjustments 903 870 2,548 (5,248)Total other comprehensive income, net of tax 1,146 8,837 4,212 5,026 Comprehensive (loss) income $(831) $30,641 $2,642 $41,802 Harte Hanks, Inc.

Full-year 2023 revenues reached $31.6 million, driven by product sales and royalty revenues of $26.1 million, a 132% increase from 2022. Successful results from ET-400's pivotal bioequivalence study were announced, with an NDA submission planned for Q2 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 109% year-over-year increase in Q4 2023 revenue for Eton Pharmaceuticals is a robust indicator of the company's growth, especially considering it marks the twelfth consecutive quarter of sequential product sales growth. Such performance is noteworthy in the pharmaceutical industry where product lifecycle and market penetration can be slow due to regulatory hurdles and competition. The positive cash flow from operations, albeit modest at $0.4 million, suggests efficient management of operating costs relative to revenue, which is essential for sustaining growth without excessive reliance on external financing. The successful bioequivalence study for ET-400 and planned NDA submission are significant milestones. The potential FDA approval in Q1 2025 could unlock new revenue streams. However, investors should be aware of the risks inherent in the FDA approval process, which can be unpredictable and could impact the company's financial projections if delays or denials occur. The securing of a U.S. patent for ET-400 until 2043 provides a competitive edge and long-term revenue protection, assuming market success post-approval. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst Eton's strategy to focus on rare diseases is a targeted approach that leverages high-value, low-volume products. The launch of Nitisinone capsules and the anticipation of capturing a substantial share of the $50 million market shows the company's assertiveness in carving out niches within the specialty pharmaceuticals sector. The sampling program for ALKINDI SPRINKLE could enhance market penetration, but it's crucial to monitor how this translates into actual sales growth. While the growth in product sales is impressive, the one-time payment of $1.0 million to Diurnal PLC indicates that milestone payments can significantly affect profit margins. This underscores the importance of scrutinizing the terms of licensing agreements and their financial implications. Additionally, the increase in G&A expenses due to personnel additions is a common trend in expanding companies but should be balanced against the need for operational efficiency to maintain profitability. Legal Expert The patent award for ET-400 is a strategic win for Eton Pharmaceuticals, as it not only secures exclusivity but also potentially enhances the company's valuation through intellectual property assets. The listing in the FDA's Orange Book upon approval will be a deterrent against generic competition, a critical factor for investors to consider when evaluating the long-term viability of Eton's product portfolio. However, the presence of additional patent applications under review also suggests that the company's legal position could further solidify, provided these patents are granted. It is also important to note that the R&D expenses have remained relatively flat, which might indicate a streamlined focus on advancing key products rather than a broad, resource-intensive pipeline. This could be a strategic approach to mitigate risk and concentrate resources on the most promising candidates. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM Q4 2023 revenue of $7.3 million, representing a 109% increase from Q4 2022, marking the twelfth consecutive quarter of sequential product sales growthFull year 2023 revenues reached $31.6 million with product sales and royalty revenues of $26.1 million, a 132% increase from 2022Announced successful results from ET-400’s pivotal bioequivalence study, NDA submission planned for Q2 2024Management to hold conference call today at 4:30pm ET DEER PARK, Ill., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We finished 2023 by delivering our twelfth straight quarter of sequential product sales growth and another quarter of positive operating cash flow. The growth trajectory continues for ALKINDI SPRINKLE® and Carglumic Acid, and we are excited for the Company’s prospects for 2024 and beyond,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals. “In addition to the strong performance of our commercial products, we are pleased to report favorable developments in our pipeline. In recent weeks, we received positive study results for both ET-400 and ET-600, which brings both products one step closer to NDA submission. We look forward to submitting our NDA for ET-400 in the second quarter of this year and ET-600 early next year,” concluded Brynjelsen. Fourth Quarter and Recent Business Highlights Twelfth straight quarter of sequential growth in product sales. Eton reported fourth quarter 2023 product sales and royalty revenue of $7.3 million, representing a 109% year-over-year increase and 4% growth over the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by the ongoing momentum of ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid. The Company anticipates continued growth of product sales in 2024. Recorded positive cash flow from operations. Eton generated $0.4 million of operating cash during the fourth quarter of 2023, with total cash and cash equivalents of $21.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Passed pivotal bioequivalence study for ET-400. In February, Eton received preliminary data showing that ET-400, its proprietary formulation of oral hydrocortisone, passed its pivotal bioequivalence study. All other major filing pre-requisites have been completed, and the Company expects to submit the NDA to the FDA for ET-400 when the final clinical study report is available in the second quarter of 2024. This would allow for a potential FDA approval as early as the first quarter of 2025. Awarded U.S. patent for ET-400. The patent, which covers the Company’s proprietary formulation, expires in 2043 and is expected to be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book upon the product’s approval. The Company has additional patent applications related to the product under review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Passed pilot bioequivalence study for ET-600. The Company plans to run the pivotal study in the second half of 2024, which would allow for a potential NDA submission in early 2025. Initiated ALKINDI SPRINKLE sampling program. The Company’s sampling program went live in February 2024, allowing pediatric endocrinology offices to stock ALKINDI SPRINKLE samples so that newly diagnosed or converting patients can immediately start therapy on ALKINDI SPRINKLE in the presence of their physician. Eton has already seen strong demand for samples from physicians and expects the sampling program to have a positive impact on adoption and 2024 revenue growth. Launched ultra-rare disease product Nitisinone capsules. The product was launched in February 2024 with full patient and provider support services. Eton believes its commercial advantages, existing relationships with prescribers, and experienced sales force will allow the Company to capture a meaningful percentage of the $50 million market. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Net Revenue: Net product sales and royalty revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 109% to $7.3 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid. Total net revenues were $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $8.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The prior year period included $5.0 million in licensing revenue resulting from a milestone payment received from Azurity Pharmaceuticals. Gross Profit: Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.6 million. Fourth quarter 2023 gross profit was negatively impacted by a $1.0 million one-time payment to Diurnal PLC as a result of ALKINDI SPRINKLE net sales triggering a commercial success-based milestone under terms of the product’s licensing agreement. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $6.4 million and benefited from a $5.0 million milestone payment received from Azurity Pharmaceuticals. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.0 million compared to $0.9 million in the prior year period. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $4.6 million compared to $4.4 million in the prior year period. The slight increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to personnel additions. Net Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.3 million or $0.09 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $0.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year period. Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $21.4 million.

Decline in net income attributed to higher commission expenses and policyholder liability remeasurement expenses. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Citizens, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 reflect a mixed performance. Despite an increase in total revenues year-over-year, net income has declined. This suggests that while the company is growing its top line, it's facing challenges in translating that growth into net profitability. The reported increase in book value per share is a positive indicator of the company's asset value growth, but the decrease in net income could raise concerns about the company's operational efficiency and cost management.Investors should note the strategic exit from the Louisiana property insurance business, which could imply a more focused approach to core operations but also raises questions about the impact of such strategic shifts on long-term revenue streams. Additionally, the reported increase in the global network of producing agents by 85% in 2023 is a significant expansion, potentially indicating a strong future sales pipeline, yet it comes with the cost of increased commission expenses that have impacted net income. Market Research Analyst The growth in first year life and A&H premiums for five consecutive quarters, driven by new products and marketing campaigns, shows Citizens, Inc.'s ability to innovate and attract new customers. However, the slight decrease in total insurance premium revenues due to lower renewal premiums points to potential issues with customer retention or market saturation. The planned introduction of new products or major product enhancements in 2024 could be a move to address this and stimulate further growth.It's also important to consider the broader economic context, particularly the impact of inflationary pressures and increasing interest rates on policyholder behavior. The report indicates higher surrenders in the international business, which could be a response to these macroeconomic factors, suggesting that the company's performance is not immune to external economic conditions. Insurance Industry Expert The insurance industry is traditionally sensitive to economic cycles and Citizens, Inc.'s performance reflects this. The increased benefits and expenses due to higher surrenders in the international business are indicative of the challenges faced when policyholders reassess the value of their policies in light of changing economic circumstances. The company's shift from Bermuda to Puerto Rico for its international business could be a strategic move to optimize tax and regulatory conditions, which could have long-term financial benefits.The focus on expanding the global network of producing agents aligns with industry trends towards increasing distribution channels to drive sales. However, the impact on the company's expenses, particularly commissions, needs to be monitored closely to ensure that this expansion doesn't erode profitability. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM Austin, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - March 14, 2024) - Citizens, Inc. (NYSE: CIA), a leading diversified financial services company specializing in life, living benefits and final expense insurance, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter 2023 and full year ended December 31, 2023.""We achieved another quarter of significant progress on our strategic roadmap, designed to deliver sustainable increased book value per share and enhanced operating results, and that progress has continued into 2024.

Total revenues of $66.8 million in Q4 2023, from $67.3 million in the year-ago quarter.First year life and A&H premiums increased 4% in Q4 2023, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in first year premiums, driven by new products and focused marketing campaigns.Net income of $24.4 million, $0.48 per fully diluted Class A share, in the full year 2023, from $26.0 million, $0.51 per share, in the full year 2022. Net income of $10.7 million, $0.21 per share, in Q4 2023, from $13.7 million, $0.27 per share, in Q4 2022.Positive net cash provided by operating activities of $22.1 million in the full year 2023 and $6.6 million in Q4 2023. The Company has had positive net cash provided by operating activities annually since 2004. Cash and cash equivalents of $27.0 million and no debt at December 31, 2023.Book value per Class A share of $3.47 increased 36% over the year-ago quarter. Book value per Class A share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) of $5.85 increased 10% over the year-ago quarter.Recent Business HighlightsInsurance issued increased 10% in Q4 2023 and increased 10% in the full year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily from new products and an increase in producing agent count. Over $4.9 billion of direct insurance in force at December 31, 2023.Increased global network of producing agents by 85% in 2023.Expanded existing white-label partnership to deliver unique products through established fast-growing distribution channels. 2024 MilestonesFor 2024, the Company has set the following milestones:Increase first year life and A&H premium revenues at least 6%Improve policyholder retention metrics at least 4%Expand global network of producing agents at least 20%Introduce 2 to 3 new products or major product enhancements. Citizens delivered a new product in Q1 2024Fourth Quarter 2023 Performance and HighlightsTotal revenues of $66.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, from $67.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by lower renewal year premium revenues, partially offset by the improved fair value of limited partnership investments, higher first year premium sales and net investment income.First year life and A&H premiums increased 4% to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same year-ago period, with growth in both the Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance segments. Despite higher first year premium revenues, total insurance premium revenues decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $47.0 million, compared to $48.3 million in the same period in 2022, due to lower renewal premiums. Renewal premiums were $41.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $42.8 million in the same year-ago period. The decrease was due in part to the residual impact of the levels of surrenders and matured endowments over the last several years, which led to fewer policies generating renewal premiums, as well as, the Company's strategic exit from its Louisiana property insurance business on June 30, 2023.Total benefits and expenses increased by $2.2 million to $58.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, from $55.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to higher surrenders in the international business, negatively impacting benefits and expenses. We believe this is due to several factors, including policies nearing maturity that no longer carry surrender fees; the loss of one of our biggest distributors in Venezuela several years ago; increasing interest rates, which may encourage policyholders to seek higher rates of returns in different investment products; post-pandemic beliefs that life insurance may not be as important as it was during the pandemic; and inflationary pressures, which may cause policyholders to want the cash values of their policies due to decreased purchasing power elsewhere. Costs related to moving our international business from Bermuda to Puerto Rico and investing in growth initiatives also contributed to the increase.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $10.7 million, or $0.21 per fully diluted Class A share, decreased from net income of $13.7 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted Class A share, in the prior year quarter. In addition to the increases to benefits and expenses paid discussed above, the decline in net income was due to $1.3 million of higher commission expense due to accrual of expense for renewal commissions the Company may owe to former independent consultants in Venezuela and higher first year sales (which have higher commission payments), $0.4 million higher policyholder liability remeasurement expenses, which were primarily due to the higher than expected level of surrenders, and $0.3 million lower federal income tax benefit. Adjusted operating income before taxes totaled $7.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $10.7 million in the same period in 2022. Adjusted operating income does not include investment related gains or losses, which improved by $0.9 million in the current year fourth quarter, or income (loss) related to our ceased property insurance business.InvestmentsNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $17.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in net investment income was driven by higher income from fixed maturity securities resulting from rising interest rates and growth in the Company's limited partnership asset base. The average pre-tax yield on the investment portfolio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 16 basis points compared to the prior year period.Investment related gain of $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a $0.3 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement was primarily due to changes in fair market value in the Company's limited partnership portfolio.The carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity securities investment portfolio at December 31, 2023 was $1.2 billion, a 5.0% increase compared to the same year ago period. The increase reflects the impact of interest rate sensitivity on the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity securities. Cash Flow/Capital/Share RepurchasePositive net cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 million in Q4 2023. The Company has had positive net cash provided by operating activities annually since 2004 reflecting the strength and consistency of the Company's liquidity. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $27.0 million and no debt at December 31, 2023.The Board of Directors is confident in the Company's strategy and future and authorized a share repurchase program in May 2022 under which the Company may repurchase up to $8 million of its outstanding shares of Class A common stock. $4.4 million of available repurchases remain on the current authorization at December 31, 2023.About Citizens, Inc.Citizens, Inc.

While the new guidance has had a significant impact on existing GAAP financial statements and disclosures, it does not impact the cash flows or underlying economics of the business, business strategy, statutory net income (loss) or management of capital. All prior periods presented in this press release have been recast in accordance with the new standard.Explanatory Notes on Use of Non-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted Operating IncomeAdjusted Operating Income is a non-GAAP measure that is computed as pre-tax GAAP operating income with discrete adjustments that exclude net investment related gains (losses) and income and loss from ceased businesses. Management believes that this metric is meaningful, as it allows investors to evaluate underlying profitability and enhances comparability across periods, by excluding items that are heavily impacted by investment market fluctuations and other economic factors and are not indicative of operating trends. Management believes that the pre-tax metric is a more useful comparison than the post-tax metric, as the Company's effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter.Adjusted Book Value Per Class A Common ShareAdjusted book value per Class A common share is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing actual Class A common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, by the number of Class A common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Management believes this metric is meaningful, as it allows investors to evaluate underlying book value growth by excluding the impact of interest rate volatility.Selected Consolidated Financial DataAs of and for the periods endedThree Months Ended December 31,Years Ended December 31,(In thousands, except per share data)2023202220232022Balance sheet data Total assets$1,668,9281,590,703$1,668,9281,590,703 Total liabilities1,495,5031,462,9131,495,5031,462,913 Total stockholders' equity173,425127,790173,425127,790 Life insurance in force, net4,306,4294,257,1484,306,4294,257,148 Operating items Insurance premiums$47,03848,251$167,039173,714 Net investment income17,56717,44369,25465,426 Investment related gains (losses), net1,237298760(10,291) Total revenues66,84967,257240,680232,524 Claims and surrenders35,19533,675135,993119,935 Other general expenses11,65412,18847,13145,177 Total benefits and expenses58,07555,846214,506205,147 Income (loss) before federal income tax8,77411,41126,17427,377 Federal income tax expense (benefit)(1,967)(2,248)1,7371,370 Net income (loss)10,74113,65924,43726,007 Per share data Book value per share$3.472.56$3.472.56 Diluted income (loss) per Class A share0.210.270.480.51 Definition of Reported SegmentsThe Company is comprised of two operating business segments and other non-insurance enterprises as detailed below.

Significant increase in GAAP operating loss in Q4. Reduction in revenue for fiscal year 2023 by 2% year over year. Financial Analyst The reported financials from Urgent.ly Inc. indicate a mixed performance. While the gross profit increase of 88% and 10-point margin improvement are positive indicators of cost management and operational efficiency, the revenue decline of 2% year over year for the full fiscal year raises concerns. A revenue decrease can often signal a reduction in market demand or competitive pressures, which may require strategic adjustments.Moreover, the significant reduction in net principal debt from $142.2 million to $71.8 million demonstrates a concerted effort to improve the balance sheet and reduce financial risk. This proactive approach to capital management can be favorable for the company's credit profile and future investment prospects. However, the increase in GAAP and non-GAAP operating losses year over year for the fourth quarter suggests that there might be underlying issues that could affect the company's profitability in the short term. Market Research Analyst Urgent.ly's acquisition of Otonomo and its public listing are strategic moves that could potentially open up new markets and revenue streams. These developments, along with the reported consumer satisfaction score of 4.6 out of 5 stars, suggest that the company is focused on customer service quality, which is a critical factor in the digital roadside and mobility assistance industry.Despite the reported decrease in revenue, the increase in gross margins indicates that Urgent.ly is becoming more efficient in its operations. However, it's important to consider the competitive landscape and the potential impact of economic factors on consumer spending in the mobility assistance sector. The company's ability to continue expanding its margins in a challenging economic environment will be key to its long-term success. Debt Management Expert The aggressive debt reduction strategy that Urgent.ly has undertaken is noteworthy. Reducing the principal debt balance by over $87.9 million in a year is a significant achievement that can improve the company's interest expense and overall financial health. Extending the maturity date of the remaining debt also indicates that the company has successfully negotiated with creditors to secure more favorable terms, which can provide additional financial flexibility.However, it is crucial to analyze the source of funds used for debt repayment. If the repayment is largely driven by cash on hand, it may impact the company's liquidity position and its ability to invest in growth opportunities. Stakeholders should closely monitor the company's cash flow statements in subsequent quarters to assess the sustainability of its capital structure enhancements. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM Company Continues to Make Progress on Strategic Initiatives to Enhance Profitability and Drive Margin ExpansionVIENNA, Va., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Urgent.ly Inc.

We use the non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measure, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook.

In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate a similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measure differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, which could reduce the usefulness of the non-GAAP financial measure presented herein as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We define Non-GAAP Operating Loss as operating loss, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, and non-recurring charges (or income) such as transaction and restructuring costs.

(“TILT"" or the “Company”) (Cboe: TILT) (OTCQB: TLLTF), a global provider of cannabis business solutions that include inhalation technologies, cultivation, manufacturing, processing, brand development and retail, is reporting its financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. All financial information is reported in U.S. dollars and prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) unless otherwise indicated. “It has been less than one year since my return to TILT, and we have made foundational progress in that time,” said TILT’s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Conder. “Despite the many challenges we faced throughout the year, our team has meaningfully improved operating efficiency, reduced operating expenses, and begun to restructure our debt to strengthen our balance sheet. Further, we have executed a refined brand partnership strategy in our plant-touching business, and now offer a more concentrated portfolio of strong, inhalation-focused brands that better align with our Jupiter hardware platform. In the fourth quarter, we experienced one of the largest periods of order volume in Jupiter’s history ahead of Chinese New Year. To support this volume and in anticipation of future growth, we came to an agreement with our primary supplier, Smoore Technology Limited (“Smoore”), to expand our trade payable line and provided a guarantee to secure the continued shipment of product on credit, which is necessary to meet our customer needs and grow our business. A portion of these Chinese New Year orders were delivered in the first quarter of 2024, which negatively impacted revenue and profitability for the fourth quarter of 2023. Nevertheless, demand for Jupiter products remains strong and the opportunity for hardware sales in North America and beyond is growing. Conder continued, “Our cost savings efforts and right-sizing initiatives have led to approximately $8 million in annualized savings in 2023 as compared to 2022. We now have a more efficient operating structure in place that will enable us to shift our attention from cost savings to revenue growth in 2024. We have a great team, and it has been exciting to execute on our plan together in 2023 and see their alignment around our refined vision come into focus for 2024 and beyond.” Q4 2023 Financial Summary Revenue was $37.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $44.3 million in the prior year period. The expected decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the timing of Jupiter order shipments from Smoore, a portion of which was recovered in the first quarter of 2024.Gross profit was $3.6 million and gross margin was 9.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.3 million or 18.8% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by non-cash inventory adjustments, product mix in Jupiter and lower pricing in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP), or gross margin excluding non-cash inventory adjustments, in the three months ended December 31, 2023 was 14.1% compared to 18.8% in the prior year period.Net loss was $22.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $73.1 million in the prior year period. These results include a non-cash impairment charge of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as a $54.6 million [non-cash] impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted net loss (non-GAAP), which excludes non-cash impairment charges, was $14.5 million compared to adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) of $18.5 million in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $(1.6) million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $(0.4) million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales related to the timing of Jupiter order shipments. Q4 2023 & Recent Operational Highlights Partnered with Edie Parker, a nationally recognized, female founded and operated lifestyle cannabis brand, to launch and distribute their products in Pennsylvania.Announced on January 31, 2024, the Company entered into a Debt and Security Agreement, Guaranty, and related collateral security documents (the “Agreements”) with Smoore to expand the Company’s existing trade payable credit line. The Company is currently working with its noteholders on a forbearance agreement to assist the Company in achieving the short-term goal of placing the Smoore trade payable on a more sustainable footing.Launched a hardware partnership with Travis Barker’s new cannabis company, Barker Canna Co., to sell products including live rosin and full-gram rechargeable all-in-one vaporizers featuring unique flavor and strain combinations.Announced the mass market launch of THREDZ™, a stackable cartridge that prioritizes portability and personalization, allowing consumers to blend two oil cartridges to create the perfect fusion, and a customized experience.Partnered with Level, a leading pressed tablet brand in CA to launch the brand in Pennsylvania in the coming weeks and Massachusetts later in the year. FY 2023 Financial Summary Revenue was $166.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $174.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned order shipment timing and lower average price in certain Jupiter product lines.Gross profit was $24.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, or approximately 14.7% of revenue, compared to $38.2 million or 21.9% of revenue in the prior year.

Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, ""will"", “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “seeks”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved”. These statements should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results. These statements are based upon certain material factors, assumptions and analyses that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including TILT’s experience and perceptions of historical trends, the ability of TILT to maximize shareholder value, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Although such statements are based on management’s reasonable assumptions at the date such statements are made, there can be no assurance that such forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking information. TILT assumes no responsibility to update or revise forward-looking information to reflect new events or circumstances unless required by applicable law. By its nature, forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties, and there are a variety of risk factors, many of which are beyond the control of TILT, and that may cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, the inability or failure of the federal government to reschedule cannabis as Schedule III and the state regulators to implement adult-use conversions by certain states in which TILT operates or plans to operate, TILT’s ability to continue as a going concern, TILT’s ability to operate its business without encountering any unforeseen delays and interruptions, unexpected geological or other effects, including failures to ship or shipping delays, weather conditions, shipping transportation, equipment failures, permitting delays or labor or contract disputes, TILT’s reliance on third-party suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of key materials necessary to satisfy customer demand for its products, TILT’s ability to enter into a forbearance agreement with its existing noteholders on acceptable terms or at all and achieve compliance with its debt covenants, TILT’s ability to generate sufficient liquidity, TILT’s ability to execute on its cost saving measures and initiatives, and those risks described under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, and other subsequent reports filed by TILT with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov and on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Non-GAAP Financial and Performance Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on GAAP, the Company provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company’s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate the Company’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may also exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating results. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, the Company’s methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by others. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures, and believes they enhance an investor’s understanding of the Company’s financial and operating performance from period to period, because they exclude certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations and performance. The Company calculates Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit plus non-cash inventory adjustments. The Company calculates Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is calculated as Net Income (Loss), plus (minus) non-cash impairment charges. EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA net income (loss), plus (minus) income taxes (recovery), plus (minus) finance expense (income), plus depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding certain one-time, non-cash or non-operating expenses, as determined by management, including stock compensation expense, debt issuance costs and severance.

As the pandemic situation evolves, the need for such tests is decreasing, impacting companies that thrived during the peak of COVID-19. The financial health of Co-Diagnostics is a concern, evidenced by the operating loss widening from $27.0 million to $42.7 million. The share repurchase program seems to be an attempt to signal confidence in the company's future, yet it contrasts with the substantial net loss. Looking forward, the success of the new Co-Dx PCR platform, including the EUA submission for the Co-Dx PCR Pro instrument, could be pivotal. However, the market for at-home testing is highly competitive and regulatory approval is uncertain. The expansion of manufacturing capabilities is a strategic move, potentially reducing costs and preparing for increased production should their new tests gain market traction. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the significant net loss increase to $35.3 million raises concerns about Co-Diagnostics' profitability and cash burn rate. The adjusted EBITDA loss of $33.0 million further underscores the company's current lack of operational profitability. Despite this, the company's cash reserves of $58.5 million provide a cushion for continued research and development. Investors should note the grants totaling $12.6 million, which offset some R&D costs and signal institutional support for the company's test development. The strategic appointment of Ivory Chang as Chief Regulatory Affairs Officer could streamline the regulatory process, potentially reducing the time to market for new products. The stock repurchase at an average price of $1.41 per share also presents a mixed signal, as it may reflect management's belief in undervaluation or alternatively, a lack of better investment opportunities for the company's capital. Medical Research Analyst The clinical evaluations and regulatory submissions for Co-Diagnostics' new testing platforms, including tests for tuberculosis, upper respiratory infections and HPV, reflect the company's pivot from COVID-19 to other infectious diseases. The NIH and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grants suggest that the company's research is aligned with broader public health goals. However, the actual impact on the company's bottom line will depend on the successful commercialization of these tests. The expansion of the manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City and the planned capacity in India for test cup and instrument manufacturing are strategic for scaling up production. However, the regulatory challenges faced by in-vitro diagnostics, especially for at-home tests, should not be underestimated. The success of the EUA submission for the Co-Dx PCR Pro instrument and associated tests will be critical for the company's future revenue streams and market position. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM SALT LAKE CITY, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Co-Diagnostics, Inc.

We are currently building expanded capacity for test cup and instrument manufacturing lines in India as well, in addition to capability to support Co-Primers manufacturing in the near future.""

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release contains adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income excluding depreciation, amortization, income tax (benefit) expense, net interest (income) expense, stock-based compensation, and one-time transaction related costs. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors relating to its results of operations. The Company's management uses this non-GAAP measure to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company believes that the use of adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and that it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Management does not consider the non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of the non-GAAP financial measure is that it excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents the non-GAAP financial measure together with GAAP results. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. A reconciliation table of the net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA, is included at the end of this release. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company's business.

(ELVN) provided updates on their Phase 1a trial for ELVN-001 in chronic myeloid leukemia, FDA clearance for ELVN-002 in HER2+ cancers, and strong financial results for 2023. Positive Positive progress in Phase 1 trial for ELVN-001 with initial data expected in Q2 2024. FDA clearance for ELVN-002 in combination therapy for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Strong financial position with $253 million in cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023. Negative Significant increase in R&D expenses in 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 was higher than the previous year. Financial Analyst Enliven Therapeutics' announcement indicates a strong cash position, with $253 million in reserves. This is a positive indicator for investors, as it suggests the company can sustain its operations and research activities into early 2026 without the immediate need for additional financing. However, the doubling of R&D and G&A expenses year-over-year reflects the company's aggressive investment in its clinical pipeline. This increase in spending is expected in a growth phase, especially when advancing clinical trials, but it's essential to monitor whether these investments will lead to successful outcomes and regulatory approvals.The projected timeline for initial data from ELVN-001 and ELVN-002 trials is a critical milestone. Positive results could act as catalysts for the company's stock price. However, investors should be cautious about the inherent risks of clinical trials, as any negative outcomes could significantly impact the company's valuation. The net loss widening from 2022 to 2023 is not unusual for a clinical-stage biotech company, but it is vital to assess ongoing losses against potential future revenues from successful drug candidates. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's clearance of the IND application for ELVN-002 combined with trastuzumab in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer is noteworthy. HER2+ cancers represent a segment with substantial unmet medical needs and dual HER2 targeting has shown promise in clinical improvements. If ELVN-002 demonstrates efficacy and safety, it could significantly impact treatment paradigms. The focus on CNS penetrant qualities indicates an understanding of the need for therapies that address metastases in the central nervous system, a common complication in advanced breast cancer.For ELVN-001, targeting the BCR-ABL gene fusion in CML with a highly selective kinase inhibitor could offer a more tailored treatment approach, potentially reducing side effects associated with less selective treatments. The anticipation of proof of concept data in the second quarter of 2024 means stakeholders should watch for the potential impact on the standard of care for CML if the results are positive. Oncology Doctor The advancements in precision oncology are exemplified by Enliven's focus on small molecule kinase inhibitors. These treatments are designed to interfere with specific enzymes involved in cancer cell growth and survival. The BCR-ABL gene fusion targeted by ELVN-001 is a well-established marker in chronic myeloid leukemia and a more selective inhibitor could improve on the efficacy and tolerability of current treatments.Furthermore, the combination approach of ELVN-002 with trastuzumab addresses the redundancy in signaling pathways that often leads to treatment resistance in HER2+ cancers. If the upcoming trials demonstrate positive outcomes, it could mean a significant advancement in the management of these cancers, particularly for patients who have limited options due to resistance or intolerance to existing therapies. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Initial proof of concept data from Phase 1a trial evaluating ELVN-001 in adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is expected in the second quarter of 2024 IND application to evaluate ELVN-002 in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer received U.S. FDA clearance Strong balance sheet, closing the year with $253 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities BOULDER, Colo., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enliven Therapeutics, Inc. (Enliven or the Company) (Nasdaq: ELVN), a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation small molecule kinase inhibitors, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, provided updated guidance on parallel lead product candidates and highlighted pipeline progress. “We are pleased with the ongoing momentum of our clinical pipeline. Our Phase 1 trial of ELVN-001 is on track, and we are excited to share our initial proof of concept data in the second quarter of 2024,” said Sam Kintz, MBA, Enliven’s Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Furthermore, the FDA’s acceptance of our second ELVN-002 IND application paves the way to evaluate combination therapy in patients with HER2+ cancers, for which there remains a significant unmet need, particularly in patients who progress on or are intolerant to Enhertu. We are focused on getting the trial up and running and dosing the first patient by mid-2024.” Recent Research and Development Highlights and Upcoming Milestones ELVN-001, a highly selective, small molecule kinase inhibitor designed to specifically target the BCR-ABL gene fusion Patient enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trial in adults with CML (NCT05304377) remains ongoing, and the Company has nearly completed the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the trial.The first clinical data disclosure is expected in the second quarter of 2024. The Company expects this data to include more than 20 patients enrolled at an efficacious dose range, with 10 to 20 of those patients having been treated for over three months at the time of disclosure. ELVN-002, a potent, highly selective, central nervous system (CNS) penetrant and irreversible HER2 inhibitor with activity against wild type HER2 and various HER2 mutations The Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application to evaluate ELVN-002 in combination with trastuzumab +/- chemotherapeutic agents in adults with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. Dosing of the first patient is expected by mid-2024.Precedent clinical evidence suggests that dual HER2 targeting results in clinically meaningful improvements in patients with HER2+ MBC and CRC.The ongoing Phase 1a dose escalation (NCT05650879) is nearly complete, and the data from that ongoing trial supports the additional Phase 1 combination trial. The initial data disclosure for ELVN-002 is expected in 2024.

While the company has experienced a fifth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill, indicating a healthy demand for its products, the actual revenue figures have declined in both the fourth quarter and the full year compared to the previous periods. This decline is primarily attributed to decreased sales in defense, industrial and consumer product revenues.From a market perspective, the positive book-to-bill ratio is a strong indicator of future revenue potential, as it suggests that Kopin is receiving more orders than it can fulfill in the current period. This could signal to investors that despite the current dip in revenue, there is potential for growth, particularly with the company’s expectation of at least 20% revenue growth in 2024.However, the impact of pausing production for retooling and automation to meet anticipated demand could be a cause for concern. While this positions the company to potentially improve efficiency and meet future demand, it has had an immediate negative impact on revenue for the quarter. Investors would need to weigh the short-term revenue decline against the potential for increased future efficiency and production capacity.Additionally, the increase in SG&A expenses, particularly due to legal fees, suggests that there are external factors that could be affecting the company's bottom line. It is essential to monitor how these expenses will influence future profitability. Financial Analyst Kopin Corporation's report of a net loss for both the fourth quarter and the full year, despite a strong order book, points to underlying challenges in cost management and production efficiency. The cost of product revenues exceeding net product revenues is a concern, as it indicates that the company is selling products at low margins or possibly at a loss.Investors should note that the company’s strategy to increase prices on several key programs might help improve margins, but it also carries the risk of affecting demand if customers are sensitive to price changes. The company’s decision to invest in automation and retooling should be seen as a long-term strategy to reduce the cost of goods sold and improve margins. However, the immediate impact on revenue and the ongoing capital expenditures will need to be closely monitored to ensure they translate into improved financial performance.The reported increase in cash and equivalents and successful capital raise through the sale of common stock provides the company with a cushion to manage its operational needs and invest in growth initiatives. Nevertheless, the net cash used in operating activities is significant and suggests that the company is still far from achieving operational cash flow positivity, an essential milestone for long-term sustainability. Defense Industry Analyst Kopin’s focus on the defense sector, particularly through its thermal weapon sight programs, is noteworthy. The follow-on orders and new contracts for thermal weapon sights suggest that the company has a reliable and growing presence in this niche market. The potential tripling of thermal weapon sight production volumes in fiscal year 2024 could be a significant driver of revenue for Kopin, given the global increase in defense spending.However, the dependency on defense contracts can be a double-edged sword. While lucrative, these contracts are often subject to government budget cycles and geopolitical factors that can introduce volatility into Kopin's revenue streams. The transition of OLED fabrication to U.S. DoD-approved facilities is a strategic move that aligns with the current push for domestic production and supply chain security in the defense sector, which could provide a competitive advantage and potentially open doors to new contracts.The introduction of the Software Defined, AI enabled NeuralDisplay™ Architecture could represent a significant technological advancement, but its commercial success will depend on its adoption within the defense industry and the ability to meet the stringent requirements of military applications. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM Fourth quarter revenues of $8.6 million and 2023 revenues of $40.4 million Fifth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill Expects double digit revenue growth in 2024 WESTBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kopin Corporation (Nasdaq: KOPN), a leading provider of application-specific optical solutions for defense, enterprise, industrial, and consumer products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Company Highlights Fifth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill with greater than $55 million of orders for 2024 as of January 2024 Paused production in Westborough manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 2023 for additional automation and retooling in anticipation of greater 2024 demand, impacting fourth quarter 2023 revenue New branding and website unveiled in January 2024 Expect 2024 revenue growth of at least 20% compared to 2023 Continued OLED fabrication transition to U.S. DoD approved facilities Announced Software Defined, AI enabled NeuralDisplay™ Architecture “2023 was a transitional year for Kopin, successfully evolving from a leading provider of microdisplay solutions to becoming an application-specific optical solutions provider,” said Michael Murray, Kopin's Chief Executive Officer. “This shift was underscored in the fourth quarter and into 2024 with additional partnerships and multiple new and follow-on orders, supported by strong new and existing customer engagement and satisfaction. Performance and outlook were supported by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive book to bill, marking a new record for orders. “We saw continued positive momentum with follow-on orders in the fourth quarter, including a $6.0 million follow-on order for a Thermal Weapon Sight Program. This follow-on order is a testament to our responsiveness and reliability in delivering weapon sights and targeting products in this fast-changing global environment, and the improvements in our manufacturing processes and equipment. Combined with a $20.5 million contract for new thermal weapon sight configuration and several other orders in the first quarter of 2024, the increase in demand would potentially triple our thermal weapon sight production volumes in fiscal year 2024, as compared to 2023. “As a result of our strong order book, we plan for a significant production increase in 2024. As we discussed in our third quarter of 2023 financial results call, to ensure we execute on this anticipated production ramp in 2024, we took additional steps and extended our planned 2023 holiday shut down period to improve production flow for long-term profitability. These preparations included a temporary pause in production to retool, adding new automation, and clean our manufacturing facilities at the end of the fourth quarter, which had an impact on the quarter’s revenues. Mr. Murray concluded: ""We start 2024 with a strong order book, new customer engagements and positive internal morale, strengthening Kopin for significant and sustainable revenue growth needed to achieve profitability. We have increased our 2024 order cover with higher prices on several key programs and believe there are opportunities for additional follow-on orders and several new customer development orders which we expect to receive soon. Our sales funnel is strong and our increased emphasis and resources focused on business development are paying off. As we look forward, our foundation of innovation paired with our core capabilities serve as the bedrock for our progression into application-specific optical solutions and advanced software-defined AI-enabled microdisplays. We believe Kopin is well positioned to deliver these exciting new technologies and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.” Fourth Quarter Financial Results Total revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2023, were $8.6 million, compared to $12.2 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Product revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2023, were $6.8 million, compared to $8.7 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in product revenues was a result of lower defense and industrial product revenues, which decreased by $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, year over year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, funded research and development revenues decreased by $1.6 million due to the completion of certain programs. Cost of Product Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.2 million, or 106% of net product revenues, compared with $8.9 million, or 103% of net product revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2022. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $2.2 million compared to $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in R&D expense is attributable to a decrease in funded research and development expense as certain programs were completed and lower internal expense related to OLED development. SG&A expenses were $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to legal fees associated with our litigation. Net Loss Attributable to Kopin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was ($6.5) million, or ($0.06) per share, compared with Net Loss Attributable to Kopin of ($6.2) million, or ($0.07) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenues for the year ended December 30, 2023, were $40.4 million, compared to $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Product revenues for the year ended December 30, 2023, were $25.9 million, compared to $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in product revenues was a result of lower defense, industrial and consumer product revenues, which decreased by $2.2 million, $3.4 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, year over year. Revenues from the sale of products for defense declined due to lower revenues from thermal weapon sight applications which were partially offset by higher revenues from avionic applications. Revenues from industrial applications declined to lower revenues for products for 3D automated optical inspection (3DAOI) due to continued weakness in the Chinese 3D automated test market and lower revenues from industrial headset applications. Consumer revenues declined in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to lower sales of OLED displays for consumer applications. In the full year 2023, funded research and development revenues decreased by $0.9 million due to decreased funding for new display technology development for U.S. defense programs and OLED display development, which was partially offset by increased funding for armor vehicle targeting system and medical headset development. Cost of Product Revenues for 2023 was $25.0 million, or 96% of net product revenues, compared with $32.6 million, or 100% of net product revenues in the prior year. Cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products for defense applications in 2023 versus 2022 and decreased sales of lower margin products for defense applications in 2023 versus 2022. The Company also implemented several programs and hired additional employees to improve manufacturing quality and efficiency. R&D expenses for 2023 were $10.8 million compared to $18.7 million for 2022, a 42% decrease year over year. The decrease in R&D expense as compared to the prior year was seen in both funded and internal R&D. Funded R&D expenses were $7.2 million for 2023 as compared to $10.3 million for 2022, a 30% decrease, primarily due to the completion of contracts for defense programs awarded prior to 2023. Internal R&D expenses were $3.6 million for 2023 as compared to $8.4 million for 2022, a 57% decrease, primarily due to decreased OLED development. Selling, General and Administration (SG&A) expenses were $21.8 million for 2023, compared to $18.0 million for 2022. SG&A for 2023 increased as compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase of approximately $5.0 million in legal and professional fees and $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in compensation and benefits. Net Loss Attributable to Kopin Corporation for the year 2023 was $19.7 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with Net Loss Attributable to Kopin Corporation of $19.3 million, or $0.21 per share, for the year 2022. Net Cash Used in Operating Activities for 2023 was approximately $15.3 million. Kopin’s cash and equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $17.9 million at December 30, 2023 as compared to $12.6 million at December 31, 2022. In the first quarter of 2024 the Company sold 3.1 million shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $7.5 million under its At The Market (ATM) program.

Research and development expenses decreased to $68.1 million in 2023, while general and administrative expenses were $22.6 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Vaxart, Inc. regarding their progress in vaccine development and the appointment of a new CEO, Steven Lo, has several implications for investors. The financial performance of the company shows a reduction in net loss from $107.8 million in 2022 to $82.5 million in 2023, which indicates a potential improvement in operational efficiency. Furthermore, the increase in revenue from $0.1 million to $7.4 million, primarily driven by the grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and royalty revenue, suggests a growing recognition of the company's vaccine candidates and could signal future revenue streams. However, investors should be mindful of the company's cash runway, which is anticipated to last into the fourth quarter of 2024. The successful completion of upcoming clinical trials and the subsequent commercialization of vaccine candidates will be critical to ensuring long-term financial stability and growth for Vaxart. Medical Research Analyst Vaxart's progress in advancing their oral pill XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate into a Phase 2b study is noteworthy, especially considering the support from BARDA. This reflects confidence in the potential of Vaxart's platform, which could revolutionize vaccination methods by offering a non-invasive, scalable alternative to traditional injectables. The preclinical data demonstrating cross-reactive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants is promising, but the true test will be the vaccine's performance in human clinical trials. Similarly, the Phase 1 norovirus study in lactating mothers, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, could have significant implications for infant health if the vaccine successfully induces transferable antibodies. The outcomes of these studies will be critical in assessing the efficacy and safety of Vaxart's vaccine candidates, which, if positive, could lead to substantial market opportunities and partnerships. Market Research Analyst The appointment of Steven Lo as CEO introduces new leadership at a pivotal time for Vaxart. His biopharma experience could be instrumental in navigating the company through the upcoming clinical trials and potential commercialization phases. The oral vaccine market has room for growth and Vaxart's differentiated approach could capture significant market share if their vaccine candidates prove to be effective and gain regulatory approval. However, the competitive landscape includes several established players with mRNA vaccines and Vaxart will need to demonstrate clear advantages in efficacy, safety and distribution to gain a foothold. Market reception to these developments will likely be reflected in stock performance, contingent on the successful execution of the company's strategic initiatives and clinical outcomes. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM Significant progress made in preparing for a Phase 2b study evaluating Vaxart’s oral pill XBB COVID-19 vaccine against an approved mRNA vaccine comparator Topline data from Phase 1 norovirus study in lactating mothers expected in mid-2024 Steven Lo appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and Board Member Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxart, Inc. (Nasdaq: VXRT) today announced its business update and financial results for the full year 2023. “We are excited to welcome Steve Lo as Vaxart’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Steve brings extensive biopharma leadership experience, and we look forward to his contributions in executing on our strategy and creating value for our shareholders,” said Dr. Michael Finney, Vaxart’s Interim Chief Executive Officer. “Steve’s arrival comes as we made important progress on our oral vaccine platform in 2023. We now have established proof of concept in two challenge studies, for both respiratory and GI viruses,” Dr. Finney said. “Our recent COVID-19 BARDA Project NextGen contract award is supportive of our differentiated approach. Our oral pill vaccines offer several advantages compared with injectables, including the ability to vaccinate more people faster, easier and painlessly. Steve’s leadership will guide Vaxart in accelerating the development of a platform that has the potential to revolutionize how people are vaccinated.” Recent Business Highlights COVID-19 Vaccine Developments The United States Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded Vaxart a $9.27 million contract in January to prepare for a 10,000-subject, Phase 2b clinical study evaluating the Company’s oral pill XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate against an approved mRNA vaccine comparator as part of its “Project NextGen” initiative designed to support the development of vaccines and treatments to stay ahead of COVID-19. Vaxart believes the Phase 2b trial may initiate as soon as the second quarter of 2024. In February 2024, Vaxart published preclinical non-human primate (NHP) data showing strong cross-reactive immune responses, thus demonstrating the potential of its COVID-19 vaccine to protect against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). Norovirus Vaccine Developments Vaxart plans to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the second quarter of 2024 to discuss data on correlates of protection, which will inform potential next steps, such as potentially conducting a Phase 2b study and potentially a GII.4 challenge study. The Company expects the Phase 2b study will generate sufficient safety data to have an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. The End-of-Phase 2 meeting will allow the Company to gain concurrence on the scope and design of the Phase 3 pivotal efficacy study in adults over 18 years of age. In December 2023, Vaxart completed enrollment in the Phase 1 norovirus study in lactating mothers. With support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the study is designed to evaluate the ability of Vaxart’s norovirus vaccine candidate to induce antibodies in breast milk and transfer of antibodies to young infants. The Company expects to announce topline results in mid-2024. Corporate Update In March 2024, Vaxart appointed Mr. Lo as President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective March 18, 2024. Dr. Finney will continue to serve as Chair of the Board of Directors. Financial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $39.7 million as of December 31, 2023. This cash balance does not include approximately $15 million in net proceeds raised in early 2024 from a registered direct offering and at-the-market equity offerings. Currently, the Company anticipates cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2024.Vaxart reported a net loss of $82.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to $107.8 million for the full year 2022. Net loss per share for 2023 was $0.57, compared to a net loss of $0.84 per share for 2022.Revenue for the full year 2023 was $7.4 million, compared to $0.1 million for 2022. Revenue in 2023 was primarily from revenue recognized for work performed under Vaxart’s grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and non-cash royalty revenue from increased sales of Inavir in Japan.Research and development expenses were $68.1 million for 2023, compared to $81.1 million for 2022. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in manufacturing costs, personnel related costs and clinical trial expenses related to Vaxart’s COVID-19 vaccine candidates, partially offset by increased facilities and depreciation expense.General and administrative expenses were $22.6 million for 2023, compared to $29.4 million for 2022. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in legal and professional fees, litigation settlement costs and directors' and officers' insurance, partially offset by an increase in personnel stock-based costs.

The dividend will be paid on April 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Ralph Lauren Corporation represents a direct cash return to shareholders and is a key indicator of the company's financial health and stability. Dividends are often seen as a sign of a company's confidence in its current profitability and future prospects. The size of the dividend, $0.75 per share, should be evaluated against the company's earnings per share (EPS) to assess the payout ratio which could inform on the sustainability of the dividend.Investors typically look at dividend yields, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, as a measure of the return on investment. Stable or increasing dividends over time can also be a sign of a company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and can support the stock price by providing a steady income stream. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Ralph Lauren's dividend declaration can influence investor sentiment and can be reflective of the company's position within the retail industry. The apparel sector is subject to consumer demand and economic cycles and a consistent dividend may suggest that Ralph Lauren is managing these industry challenges effectively.Comparing the dividend announcement to industry peers can provide additional context; for instance, if Ralph Lauren's dividend yield is higher than average, it could attract income-focused investors. However, it's important to consider that high dividend yields can sometimes be a red flag if they are not supported by strong fundamentals. Economist In the broader economic context, dividend policies can be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic growth. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividends become more attractive relative to fixed-income securities, potentially increasing demand for dividend-paying stocks.Moreover, the ability of Ralph Lauren to pay dividends may signal underlying economic strength in consumer discretionary spending. This could have positive implications for the retail sector and the economy as a whole, suggesting a level of resilience in the face of economic headwinds. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) announced that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share on Ralph Lauren Corporation Common Stock.

Canterbury Park Holding Corporation Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-03-14T19:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (CPHC) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, totaling $0.28 annually, to be paid on April 12, 2024. This announcement reflects the Company's commitment to its dividend policy.","Canterbury Park Holding Corporation Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (CPHC) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, totaling $0.28 annually, to be paid on April 12, 2024. This announcement reflects the Company's commitment to its dividend policy. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation's quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share is a tangible return to shareholders and could be indicative of the company's financial health. Dividends are often a sign of a company's stable earnings and cash flow, which in turn can attract income-focused investors. The annual dividend rate of $0.28 per common share allows us to calculate the dividend yield, which is an important metric for comparing the income-generating potential of stocks within the same sector.However, it's essential to consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio typically ranges from 35% to 55% for healthy companies. Ratios significantly higher can signal potential issues, such as limited growth opportunities or future dividend cuts if earnings decline. Market Research Analyst Canterbury's dividend declaration can influence investor perception, especially in the context of the broader gaming and entertainment industry where Canterbury operates. If the dividend is in line with or exceeds industry averages, it may suggest competitive strength. Conversely, if it's below average, investors might question the company's growth prospects or industry position.Additionally, dividends can impact stock liquidity. Regular and predictable dividends can lead to a more stable shareholder base and potentially reduce stock volatility. Investors should also be aware of the ex-dividend date, which is March 29, 2024, in this case. Share purchases must be made before this date to be eligible for the dividend payment, which can lead to short-term increases in stock trading volume. 03/14/2024 - 03:30 PM SHAKOPEE, Minn., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (“Canterbury” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CPHC), today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors, pursuant to its dividend policy, approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share that will be paid on April 12, 2024 to stockholders of record on March 29, 2024.

The company ended 2023 with $101.7 million in cash. Key highlights include an Individual Patient Expanded Access Program, Phase 2 EFZO-CONNECT™ study, and upcoming presentations at medical conferences. Positive Successful progress in clinical development of efzofitimod for ILD treatment. Company ended 2023 with over $100 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

Presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society 2024 International Conference. Appointment of Wayne A. I. Frederick, M.D., as an advisor to the Company. Positive financial position with cash resources to fund operations through BLA filing. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study's anticipated completion of enrollment in Q2 2024 for efzofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis represents a significant milestone in aTyr Pharma's clinical development. Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can lead to lung scarring and poor quality of life. The availability of new treatment options could potentially address a significant unmet medical need. The study design, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is the gold standard for determining drug efficacy and safety, which, if positive, could lead to a strong value proposition for the company.Moreover, the initiation of the Individual Patient Expanded Access Program (EAP) suggests confidence in efzofitimod's safety profile and may provide early real-world data on its effectiveness. This could also have implications for patient retention and brand loyalty ahead of commercialization. However, the financial implications of running an EAP must be considered, as it could increase operational costs prior to revenue generation from the product. Financial Analyst The reported cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $101.7 million as of the end of 2023 indicate a robust financial position for aTyr Pharma. This cash runway is projected to sustain operations through the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for efzofitimod, which is a positive signal for investors regarding the company's financial health. Research and development expenses of $42.3 million reflect significant investment in the clinical trials and manufacturing of efzofitimod, which is expected given the stages of the clinical programs.However, investors should monitor the burn rate and subsequent fundraising needs, as the costs associated with late-stage trials and potential commercialization can escalate. The company's ability to manage these expenses and potentially secure partnerships or additional funding will be critical to avoid dilutive financing that could impact shareholder value. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the development of efzofitimod for interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) such as pulmonary sarcoidosis and SSc-ILD (systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease) taps into a market with a high degree of unmet need. The positive outlook on enrollment projections and the continuation of the Phase 3 study without modifications following a data and safety monitoring board review may indicate a favorable risk-benefit profile thus far.Additionally, the scientific presentations at conferences like the American Thoracic Society and the Keystone Symposia are strategic for raising awareness within the medical community and can facilitate future adoption by healthcare providers. However, it's important to consider the competitive landscape, as there may be other treatments in development that could impact efzofitimod’s market share. Understanding prescriber attitudes, patient advocacy and market access barriers will be key to successful commercialization. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM Phase 3 EFZO-FIT™ study of efzofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis anticipated to complete enrollment in the second quarter of 2024.

Interim data from Phase 1 trials of TERN-701 and TERN-601 expected in the second half of 2024. Cash position of $263 million to support operations into 2026. Positive Positive financial results reported by Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Interim data from Phase 1 trials of TERN-701 (allosteric BCR-ABL) for CML and TERN-601 (oral GLP-1) for obesity expected in the second half of 2024. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $263 million are expected to provide runway into 2026 for Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Global Phase 1 trial of TERN-701 for CML initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023, with positive early clinical data supporting a safe starting dose. Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. continues preclinical efforts to identify promising oral, small-molecule combination candidates for obesity. Appointment of Amy Burroughs as chief executive officer and board member of Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced in February 2024. Net loss for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, was $21.0 million and $90.2 million, respectively, compared to $15.8 million and $60.3 million for the same periods in 2022. Negative Net loss increased for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. Research and Development (R&D) expenses and General and Administrative (G&A) expenses also increased for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased from $283.1 million as of December 31, 2022, to $263.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst Examining the financial results of Terns Pharmaceuticals, the increase in R&D expenses from $39.6 million to $63.5 million year-over-year indicates a significant investment in their product pipeline. This is a strategic move to accelerate their clinical programs, particularly the TERN-701 and TERN-601 trials. The company's cash position, with $263.4 million on hand, suggests a robust runway into 2026, which is essential for a clinical-stage company that does not yet have revenue from product sales. However, the net loss widening from $60.3 million to $90.2 million reflects the cost-intensive nature of the R&D phase, which investors should consider when evaluating the company's near-term profitability potential. Medical Research Analyst The clinical progress of Terns Pharmaceuticals, specifically the initiation of the global Phase 1 CARDINAL trial for TERN-701, could be a game-changer in the CML treatment landscape. The inclusion of second-line CML patients addresses an unmet medical need, as there are currently no allosteric inhibitors approved for this patient group. The Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for TERN-701 could provide regulatory and financial incentives, including market exclusivity upon approval. However, the efficacy and safety data are crucial, with interim data expected in the second half of 2024. The success of the trial could significantly impact the company's valuation and future prospects. Market Research Analyst In the context of the obesity treatment market, TERN-601's progress as an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist is noteworthy. Oral administration could offer a competitive advantage over injectable peers, potentially improving patient compliance and expanding market share. The anticipation of top-line data, including 28-day body weight loss, will be a critical milestone for the company. If the data are positive, it could position TERN-601 favorably in a lucrative market. Nevertheless, the success of TERN-601 will depend not only on its efficacy but also on its safety profile and market dynamics, including competition from other pharmaceutical companies and the potential for combination therapies. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Interim data from initial dose escalation cohorts from Phase 1 trial of TERN-701 (allosteric BCR-ABL) for treatment of CML expected in second half of 2024 Top-line data from Phase 1 trial of TERN-601 (oral GLP-1) for obesity expected in second half of 2024 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $263 million, expected to provide runway into 2026 FOSTER CITY, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Terns” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TERN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology and obesity, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided corporate updates. “I joined Terns last month at a pivotal stage in the company’s growth as we advance towards initial data readouts from our Phase 1 clinical programs for TERN-601, our oral small molecule GLP-1 agonist for obesity, and TERN-701, our allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor for CML. Importantly, our global Phase 1 trial of TERN-701 allows for the enrollment of second line CML patients, which makes the study attractive for participants given that there is no allosteric inhibitor currently approved for 2L CML patients,” said Amy Burroughs, chief executive officer of Terns. “Terns made meaningful progress throughout 2023, as highlighted by the initiation of these two clinical programs, the positive Phase 2 data readout from our potentially best in class THR-β and the advances in discovery for our small-molecule GIPR modulators for obesity.” Recent Pipeline Developments and Anticipated Milestones TERN-701: Oral, allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Global Phase 1 CARDINAL trial initiated in fourth quarter 2023 and is progressing CARDINAL is a global, multicenter, open-label, two-part Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of TERN-701 in patients with previously treated CMLThe study design leverages insights from the ongoing Phase 1 trial in China, which support a starting dose that appears safe and clinically active based on emerging early clinical data The CARDINAL trial design provides multiple opportunities to potentially differentiate TERN-701 in the CML treatment landscape Opportunity to efficiently develop TERN-701 as a dose-optimized allosteric inhibitor for CMLInclusion of second-line (2L) chronic phase CML patients, which better positions Terns to potentially move directly into a 2L (or earlier line) pivotal studyReduced competition for trial enrollment as no allosteric inhibitor is currently approved for 2L CML patients Interim data from initial CARDINAL dose escalation cohorts expected in the second half of 2024In March 2024, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation for TERN-701 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemiaTerns plans to host a virtual KOL event in mid-2024 to focus on the interpretation of early CML datasets TERN-601: Oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for obesity Phase 1 clinical trial of Terns’ lead oral GLP-1 receptor agonist in healthy obese or overweight participants is ongoing Primary endpoints include safety and tolerability assessmentsSecondary and exploratory endpoints include PK and change in body weight over 28 days Top-line data, including 28-day body weight loss, expected in the second half of 2024Terns continues preclinical efforts to identify promising oral, small-molecule combination candidates for obesity (e.g., GLP-1 + THR-β, GLP-1 + GIPR agonist / antagonist) TERN-501: Oral, thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonist Terns continues to evaluate opportunities for TERN-501 in metabolic diseases Based on non-clinical studies, THR-β is an orthogonal mechanism to GLP-1, potentially providing broader metabolic and liver benefits in addition to increased weight lossNon-clinical data suggests that TERN-501 may augment the weight loss effects of a GLP-1 receptor agonist, as demonstrated in a diet-induced obese mouse model Terns has decided to limit spend in MASH given the current regulatory and clinical development requirements for the indication TERN-800 Series: Oral, small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators Discovery efforts are ongoing for the TERN-800 series of small molecule GIPR modulators for obesityGIPR modulators (agonists and antagonists) have the potential for combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as TERN-601 Corporate Updates In February 2024, Terns announced the appointment of Amy Burroughs as chief executive officer and board member of Terns Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $263.4 million, as compared with $283.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Based on its current operating plan, Terns expects these funds will be sufficient to support its planned operating expenses into 2026. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $17.5 million and $63.5 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared with $10.7 million and $39.6 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $6.6 million and $39.1 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared with $6.2 million and $22.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Net Loss: Net loss was $21.0 million and $90.2 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared with $15.8 million and $60.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.

Financial Analyst The reported 89% increase in Q4 revenues and 130% increase in full-year revenues for Blink Charging Co. reflects a significant growth trajectory, indicative of the burgeoning demand in the electric vehicle (EV) charging market. The company's strategic initiatives, such as the expansion of its manufacturing facility and the launch of a new network interface, appear to be paying off. This growth is further substantiated by the 112% and 138% increases in product revenues for the quarter and full year, respectively.Investors should note the improved liquidity position due to capital raised, which stands in stark contrast to the repayment of promissory notes, suggesting a proactive approach to debt management. The gross profit margins, at 25% for Q4 and 29% for the full year, although solid, may be scrutinized for their scalability as the business expands. The growth in service revenues by 40% and 111% for Q4 and the full year, respectively, highlights the company's ability to monetize its services effectively alongside its hardware sales. Market Research Analyst The EV charging sector is experiencing rapid growth, driven by global electrification efforts and increasing EV adoption. Blink Charging Co.'s substantial increase in contracted, deployed, or sold charging stations signals a strong market position and customer trust. The mention of prominent clients like the United States Postal Service and Mack Trucks validates the company's product portfolio diversity and its appeal in the fleet segment, a critical area for EV infrastructure expansion.However, it's essential to consider market saturation and competitive dynamics. With more players entering the market, differentiation and maintaining growth rates will be challenging. The company's 'made in America' initiative may resonate well with domestic policy shifts and consumer sentiment, potentially offering a competitive edge in the US market. Economist The substantial revenue growth reported by Blink Charging Co. is a microcosm of the broader economic shift towards sustainable transportation. This shift is likely to continue receiving governmental support, as seen in various incentives for clean energy solutions. The company's strategic positioning near the nation's capital may facilitate better alignment with policy changes and potential governmental contracts.Long-term, the company's investment in infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities could yield cost efficiencies and support domestic job creation. However, the capital-intensive nature of this industry requires continuous investment and the company must manage its capital allocation efficiently to sustain growth without overleveraging. The balance between aggressive expansion and financial prudence will be critical for the company's continued success and investor confidence. 03/14/2024 - 04:02 PM 89% increase in 4Q23 revenues to $42.7 million; 130% increase in full year 2023 revenues to $140.6 million112% increase in 4Q23 product revenues to $33.4 million; 138% increase in full year product revenues to $109.4 million40% increase in 4Q23 service revenues to $7.9 million; 111% increase in full year service revenues to $26.4 million4Q23 gross profit of $10.6 million or 25% of revenues; record full year 2023 gross profit of $40.2 million or 29% of revenuesStrengthened balance sheet and improved liquidity by raising $113 million in gross proceeds via ATM and paid off $45.5 million in promissory notes and accrued interest 5,100 charging stations contracted, deployed or sold in fourth quarter of 2023; 23,347 in full year 2023 Bowie, MD, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co.

Total revenue grew 130% compared to 2022, and represents a 671% increase over 2021, fueled by strong demand and our ability to deliver operational excellence, with an intent focus on continuously improving and optimizing our products and services. This year we began to see the benefits of our new Blink network, which has a significantly improved user interface and experience, resulting in a more seamless charging ecosystem for our valued customers.

Additionally, we established our corporate global headquarters near our nation’s capital to better align with our operational activities, consolidate facilities and reduce corporate overhead. We have developed and continue to expand a diverse and robust product portfolio, which continues to attract prominent clients such as the United States Postal Service and Mack Trucks, illustrating the appeal of our charging solutions for fleet applications,” commented Brendan S. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blink Charging. “We are very optimistic about Blink's future and remain committed to our target of achieving a positive adjusted EBITDA run rate by December 2024. Since the third quarter 2023, we have raised $113 million in gross proceeds via our ATM under favorable market conditions. As a result, we paid off promissory notes and accrued interest of $45.5 million, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our trajectory toward reaching a positive adjusted EBITDA run rate. Blink is the only fully vertically integrated U.S.-based EV charging company and a well-recognized provider of charging hardware, software, and services on a global scale. Our distinctive owner/operator model positions us to generate revenue from the sale of charging equipment and to benefit from increased charging utilization, both in the U.S. and Europe. As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to gain momentum, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the anticipated expansion of the EV charging infrastructure, both domestically and internationally.” 2024 Company Targets For the full year 2024, the Company targets the generation of between $165 million to $175 million in revenues and reiterates its target of achieving a positive adjusted EBITDA run rate by December 2024.

Total Revenues for the full year of 2023 increased 130% to $140.6 million, an increase of $79.5 million compared to the full year of 2022. Product Sales increased 112% to $33.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $17.6 million from the same period in 2022, primarily driven by strong demand for our charging equipment and services and our ability to satisfy demand. Product Sales for the full year of 2023 increased 138% to $109.4 million, an increase of $63.4 million compared to the full year of 2022. Service Revenues, which consist of charging service revenues, network fees, and car-sharing service revenues, increased 40% to $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $2.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by greater utilization of chargers in the U.S. and internationally, an increased number of chargers on the Blink networks, and revenues associated with the Blink Mobility car-sharing service program. Service Revenues for the full year of 2023 increased 111% to $26.4 million, an increase of $13.9 million compared to the full year of 2022. Other Revenues, which are comprised of warranty fees, grants and rebates, and other revenues, increased 21% to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $239,000.

Operating expenses for the full year of 2023 were $239.9 million compared to $104.1 million in the full year of 2022. The increase in operating expenses for the full year is primarily driven by $105.9 million related to a non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge as well as the impact of a one-time, non-recurring payment to our former CEO and a non-recurring bonus expense related to the performance milestone achieved by our CTO relating to the design and launch of Blink’s recently implemented new network. Net Loss and Loss Per ShareNet Loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $19.7 million, or $(0.28) per share, compared to a net loss of $28.1 million, or $(0.55) per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.

To facilitate external analysis of the Company’s operating performance, Blink Charging also presents financial information that is considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Regulation G and related reporting requirements promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, Net Income (Loss) or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than those presented by other companies, including Blink Charging’s competitors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are therefore considered non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation tables are presented above. EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) attributable to Blink Charging before interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Blink Charging believes EBITDA is useful to its management, securities analysts, and investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s operations, including its ability to obtain and maintain its customers, its ability to operate its business effectively, the efficiency of its employees and the profitability associated with their performance. It also helps Blink Charging’s management, securities analysts, and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the Company’s operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of its merger and acquisition expenses, financing transactions, and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from its operating results. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring items such as acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of intangible assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, one-time non-recurring expenses, non-cash impairment charges, and non-cash loss on extinguishment of notes payable, is useful to securities analysts and investors to evaluate the Company’s core operating results and financial performance because it excludes items that are significant non-cash or non-recurring expenses reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as Net Loss, and Diluted Earnings per Share.

The company announced a strategic collaboration with Orano Med, updated data from the Phase 1 trial of MP0317, and highlighted financial results for 2023, showing a strong financial position and an optimistic outlook for 2024. Positive Positive initial data from the Phase 1/2a trial of MP0533 for relapsed/refractory AML and AML/MDS patients were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting, demonstrating acceptable safety profile and initial anti-tumor activity. Introduced the Switch-DARPin concept and platform at PEGS Europe, with the first multispecific Switch-DARPin program targeting cKIT x CD16a x CD47 for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Presented positive preclinical data for the Radio-DARPin Therapy platform at scientific conferences and announced a collaboration with Orano Med for 212Pb-based RDTs for oncology targets, including DLL3. Updated positive data from the Phase 1 trial of MP0317 for advanced solid tumors at the SITC Annual Meeting, showing CD40 activation in the tumor microenvironment. Maintained a strong financial position with CHF 186.9 million in cash and short-term deposits as of December 31, 2023, supporting operations until 2026. 2024 outlook includes operating expense guidance of CHF 70-80 million, data presentation from the Phase 1/2a trial of MP0533, advancement of Switch-DARPin program, and initiation of clinical studies for RDT candidates. Dr. Philippe Legenne assumed the role of acting Chief Medical Officer, bringing extensive clinical development experience to the company. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by Molecular Partners AG indicate a significant shift from a net profit in 2022 to a net loss in 2023, which is a substantial financial event for the company and its stakeholders. The decrease in total revenues from CHF 189.6 million in 2022 to CHF 7.0 million in 2023 highlights a dramatic drop in income, primarily due to the cyclical nature of biotech funding and possibly the conclusion of partnerships or milestones achieved in the previous year. Operating expenses remained relatively stable, indicating ongoing investment in research and development. The company's strong cash position, with CHF 186.9 million as of December 31, 2023, suggests financial stability and the ability to fund operations into 2026 without the immediate need for additional capital raises. This can be reassuring for investors concerned about dilution in the short term. However, the net loss might raise questions about the company's revenue-generating capabilities moving forward, especially considering the heavy reliance on the success of clinical trials and strategic collaborations. Medical Research Analyst The initial positive data from the Phase 1/2a trial of MP0533 for AML patients is a promising development in the field of oncology therapeutics. The fact that responses were observed at dose levels below those predicted as therapeutically active indicates that MP0533 could be effective at lower, potentially safer doses. This could differentiate the treatment in the market and provide a competitive advantage. The unique avidity-driven mode of action of MP0533, which preferentially targets AML cells over healthy cells, addresses a critical need for precision in cancer therapy to minimize collateral damage. The strategic collaboration with Orano Med to co-develop 212Pb-based Radio-DARPin Therapies (RDTs) for multiple oncology targets, including DLL3, represents an expansion into targeted radiotherapy, an area of high interest in oncology due to its potential for delivering highly potent treatments directly to tumor cells. The advancement of the lead RDT candidate into IND-enabling studies is a critical step toward clinical trials, which will be closely watched by industry observers for its implications on the company's pipeline value. Market Research Analyst Molecular Partners AG's introduction of the Switch-DARPin platform and progression of its Radio-DARPin Therapy (RDT) platform reflect the company's commitment to innovation in targeted therapies. The market for such therapies is growing, as they can potentially offer improved efficacy and safety profiles compared to traditional treatments. The emphasis on multispecific candidates like the cKIT x CD16a x CD47 program demonstrates an understanding of the market's move towards more personalized and precise treatments. The positive preclinical data supporting the RDT platform and the expansion of the RDT pipeline at leading scientific conferences may boost the company's reputation in the scientific community and potentially attract partnership opportunities. Advancing the lead RDT candidate into IND-enabling studies and the planned presentation of new data sets in H1 2024 could create anticipation in the market and may influence investor sentiment. However, it's important to note that the preclinical and early clinical phases are highly speculative and the company's value will be significantly affected by the outcomes of these studies. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM Research & Development Highlights Presented encouraging initial data from first four dosing cohorts of ongoing Phase 1/2a trial of MP0533 for patients with relapsed/refractory AML and AML/MDS at the ASH Annual Meeting, reporting an acceptable safety profile and initial anti-tumor activityIntroduced the Switch-DARPin concept and platform at PEGS Europe.

ZURICH-SCHLIEREN, Switzerland and CONCORD, Mass., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR Molecular Partners AG (SIX: MOLN; NASDAQ: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotech company developing a new class of custom-built protein drugs known as DARPin therapeutics, today announced its corporate highlights and audited financial results for the full year 2023. “2023 was a year of successful innovation and execution on our strategy, focusing on novel mechanisms that we believe only DARPin therapies can deliver. The encouraging new clinical and preclinical data across our portfolio illustrate the versatility and differentiated promise of DARPin therapies and our long-term leadership in this field,” said Patrick Amstutz, Ph.D. Molecular Partners’ Chief Executive Officer. “In 2024, we look forward to presenting further clinical data from our lead oncology program MP0533, and translating our significant progress across the Radio-DARPin Therapy and Switch-DARPin platforms into initiation of IND-enabling studies.” Research & Development MP0533In December 2023, the Company presented positive initial data from the first four dosing cohorts of its ongoing Phase 1/2a trial of MP0533 at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. Results from the first 11 patients treated with MP0533 indicated an acceptable safety profile as of the data cut-off across all four dosing regimens (DRs), with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. Two responders were observed at the time of presentation, including a patient achieving a complete response (CR) in DR 4 and another patient with morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS) in DR 3. These responses are particularly notable for having occurred at dose levels below those predicted as therapeutically active. MP0533 is a novel tetra-specific T cell-engaging DARPin, which simultaneously targets the antigens CD33, CD123, and CD70 on AML cells as well as the immune activator CD3 on T cells. AML cells display higher co-expression at least two of these target antigens as compared with healthy cells. MP0533 binds with increasing avidity as the number of its target antigens present increases, dramatically favoring binding to AML cells over healthy cells. This unique avidity-driven mode of action is designed to enable T cell-mediated killing of AML cells while preserving a therapeutic window that minimizes damage to healthy cells. The Phase 1/2a study is on track with dosing in DR 6 currently ongoing. The Company expects to present data from further cohorts receiving MP0533 in H1 2024. Based on current safety and tolerability data from the ongoing study, and based on discussion with treating investigators and key opinion leaders, a protocol amendment is being filed to expand enrollment to additional higher dose cohorts of MP0533 beyond the initially planned highest cohort (DR 7). The goal of the additional higher doses will be to explore the full potential efficacy of MP0533. The Company expects to enroll patients in the added higher cohorts seamlessly in H2 2024. Switch-DARPin PlatformIn 2023, the Company introduced the Switch-DARPin platform and presented data evidencing its mechanism-of-action. The Switch-DARPin platform represents a further evolution of the Company’s capabilities to deliver multispecific candidates to address different disease needs. The Switch-DARPin platform provides a logic-gated “on/off” function (the “Switch”) to multispecific DARPin candidates leading to activation only in the presence of defined antigens. The objective is conditional activation of a targeted immune response. In January 2024, the first program from the Switch-DARPin platform was introduced at the 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, namely a cKIT x CD16a x CD47 multispecific Switch-DARPin candidate designed as next-generation targeted conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in AML and other diseases benefiting from HSCT such as genetic diseases. The cKIT x CD16a x CD47 Switch-DARPin program is designed to induce exhaustive killing of stem cells to increase long-term disease control post HSCT for AML patients, including those with a poor cytogenetic risk profile, and those currently not eligible for standard high-intensity conditioning. Our intent is to extend the access to potentially curative HSCT for more patients with AML and beyond. The target-by-target rationale for this program’s design is: cKIT is critical for stem cell maintenance and renewal and thus expressed on both hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells.The CD16a DARPin engages NK cells and macrophages to selectively kill cKIT-positive cells.The Switch-DARPin will block the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal only when the molecule binds on cKIT-positive cells, leveraging the power of CD47 inhibition without its associated toxicity to healthy cells. The Company expects to present initial pre-clinical data from the first Switch-DARPin program cKIT x CD16a x CD47 in H1 2024 and to run preclinical proof-of-concept studies in H2 2024, which should provide strong translational efficacy data. Radio-DARPin Therapy (RDT) PlatformIn September 2023, Molecular Partners presented preclinical data from its RDT platform at the 36th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) demonstrating a substantially increased tumor uptake of RDT candidates through an adjustment of systemic half-life, achieved by binding to the human serum albumin protein. These results expand on preclinical data that were previously reported at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting and Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) Annual Meeting in 2023 and highlight that surface engineering of the DARPin backbone into a “Stealth” DARPin can lead to marked reduction of RDT candidate reabsorption by kidneys, addressing a key challenge for protein-based radionuclide delivery vectors. At the 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2024, Molecular Partners presented data showing the reduction of kidney absorption through novel engineered Stealth DARPins as well as enhanced tumor uptake via half-life engineering for several targets. Achieving improved tumor uptake and reduced kidney reabsorption has enabled the expansion of the RDT pipeline and strategy for the RDT portfolio. Furthermore, in January 2024, Molecular Partners and Orano Med entered a strategic collaboration to co-develop 212Pb-based RDTs for patients with solid tumors. The deal combines the power of DARPins, as a highly differentiated modality for tumor-targeted delivery of radioisotopes, with Orano Med’s leading capabilities in Targeted Alpha Therapy and supply to further advance the RDT platform and expand Molecular Partners’ RDT portfolio. The tumor-associated protein Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) was selected as the target of the Company’s lead RDT program to be advanced into IND-enabling studies in H1 2024. Expression of DLL3 is low in healthy tissue but significantly increased in certain tumor types, providing an opportunity for selective targeting through the high affinity and specificity offered by DARPins. The initiation of clinical studies and first-in-human data are expected in 2025 through co-development with Orano Med. Molecular Partners also expects to nominate additional targets and RDT candidates in 2024. In addition to the above updates, Molecular Partners continued to progress its RDT portfolio of projects in partnership with Novartis. MP0317In November 2023, the Company presented additional positive dose-escalation data from its Phase 1 study of MP0317 in patients with advanced solid tumors at the 38th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). These data from 46 patients corroborated earlier reported findings of MP0317-induced CD40 activation and related remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME). At the time of the presentation, MP0317 monotherapy continued to display a favorable safety profile across all dosing cohorts up to the highest planned dose. MP0317 enables tumor-localized immune activation through simultaneously targeting the immunostimulatory protein CD40 and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). FAP is expressed in high amounts around tumors. Through this proposed mechanism of action, MP0317 is designed to activate immune cells specifically within the tumor microenvironment, potentially delivering greater efficacy with fewer side effects compared to systemic CD40-targeting therapies. The Company expects to report the full dataset from the Phase 1 study dose-escalation in H1 2024.

The company ended 2023 with $448.7 million in cash and investments, projecting cash runway into 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Allogene Therapeutics of their end-of-year financial position, with $448.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, is a significant indicator of the company's fiscal health. This figure, alongside their reiteration of a cash runway projection into 2026, suggests a stable financial outlook for the medium term. Investors should note that the ability to fund ongoing trials without the immediate need for additional capital raises or debt financing reduces dilution risk for shareholders and provides a buffer against potential setbacks in clinical development.However, it is also important to consider the burn rate and how it may accelerate as the company ramps up its trial activities. Given the projected start and enrollment dates for various trials, the capital allocation strategy will be a key factor to watch. The balance between investing in promising trials and maintaining fiscal prudence will be critical in determining the company's future financial health and its ability to deliver shareholder value. Medical Research Analyst Allogene Therapeutics' update on its clinical pipeline is noteworthy for stakeholders interested in the development of AlloCAR T™ therapies. The initiation of the ALPHA3 trial and the continued enrollment in the ALPHA2 trial represent progress in the company's efforts to address Large B-Cell Lymphoma (LBCL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), both of which are areas with significant unmet medical needs. The potential of these therapies, particularly if they can eliminate the need for lymphodepletion, could position the company at the forefront of next-generation treatments.Initial data from the ALPHA2 trial is projected for year-end 2024, which will be a critical milestone. Positive results could serve as a catalyst for the company's valuation, while any setbacks might have a converse effect. Moreover, the differentiation strategy for ALLO-329 in Autoimmune Disease (AID) suggests a focus on competitive advantage in a crowded market. The timeline for these developments will be essential for investors monitoring the company's research efficacy and potential market impact. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly competitive, with investor sentiment often swayed by clinical trial updates and financial health. Allogene Therapeutics' strategic focus on both cancer and autoimmune diseases with its AlloCAR T™ products positions it within two lucrative markets. The update on the safety algorithm for the ALLO-316 trial in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) could influence perceptions of the company's commitment to safety and efficacy, potentially affecting its market positioning.Furthermore, the scheduled conference call and webcast provide a platform for the company to articulate its vision and progress, which can be instrumental in shaping investor confidence. The transparency and frequency of such communications are key factors that can differentiate a company in the eyes of investors, especially in an industry where the timeline from clinical trials to marketable products is often protracted and fraught with regulatory hurdles. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM Cema-cel Pivotal ALPHA3 First Line (1L) Consolidation Trial in Large B-Cell Lymphoma (LBCL): Start-Up Activities Underway; Enrollment to Begin Mid-2024Cema-cel Phase 1 ALPHA2 Trial in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): Enrolling Patients with Initial Data Projected YE 2024ALLO-329 in Autoimmune Disease (AID): Differentiated Next-Generation CD19 Dagger® Program Designed for AID will Focus on Eliminating Lymphodepletion and Meeting Demand; Phase 1 Clinical Trials in Early 2025ALLO-316 Phase 1 TRAVERSE Trial in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): Update on Safety Algorithm Planned for Publication in Q2 2024Ended 2023 with $448.7 Million in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments; Reiterates Cash Runway Projection into 2026Conference Call and Webcast Scheduled for Today at 2:00 PM PT/5:00 PM ET SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of allogeneic CAR T (AlloCAR T™) products for cancer and autoimmune disease, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We are more enthusiastic than ever about the potential for allogeneic CAR T to transform the field,” said David Chang, M.D., Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Allogene. “From our innovative ALPHA3 trial which is designed to embed cema-cel as part of a curative first-line regimen for patients with large B cell lymphoma, to specifically creating a CAR T that can meet the unique needs of patients with autoimmune disease and reduce reliance on lymphodepletion, our development approach focuses on the distinctive attributes of an off-the-shelf alternative and creates an advantage for our AlloCAR T™ programs.” Core Program Updates Cema-Cel: Pivotal ALPHA3 1L Consolidation Trial in Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL)The Company continues to focus on the development of its investigational product cemacabtagene ansegedleucel, or cema-cel (previously known as ALLO-501A) as part of the first line (1L) treatment plan for LBCL patients who are likely to relapse following 1L chemoimmunotherapy. This innovative trial takes advantage of the unique attributes of cema-cel, the only allogeneic cell therapy product with Phase 1 data comparable to that of an autologous therapy. With off-the-shelf availability and convenience, cema-cel will be administered as a one-time infusion immediately upon detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the completion of six cycles of R-CHOP or equivalent 1L chemoimmunotherapy. The potential outcome of this consolidation treatment could improve the cure rate and uniquely position cema-cel to become the standard “7th cycle” of frontline treatment available to all eligible patients with MRD. The design of the ALPHA3 1L consolidation trial builds upon the results demonstrated in the cema-cel Phase 1 ALPHA2 trial and will leverage an investigational, cutting-edge diagnostic test for MRD developed by Foresight Diagnostics. ALPHA3 will randomize approximately 230 patients who are in clinical remission but remain MRD positive at the end of standard 1L chemoimmunotherapy to either consolidation with cema-cel or the current standard of care, observation, which means to “watch and wait” for the disease to relapse. The primary endpoint of the ALPHA3 trial is event free survival (EFS). The trial will initially test two lymphodepletion regimens (one with standard fludarabine and cyclophosphamide plus ALLO-647 and one without ALLO-647). One lymphodepletion arm will be discontinued following a planned interim analysis in mid-2025 designed to select the most appropriate regimen for this patient population. Start-up activities for the ALPHA3 trial are underway and the trial is expected to begin in mid-2024. The ALPHA3 trial will be conducted in a wide array of cancer treatment centers, including community cancer centers where most earlier line patients seek care. Cema-Cel: Phase 1 ALPHA2 Trial in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)In the first quarter, the Company began enrollment in the ALPHA2 trial of the investigational product cema-cel in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL. While recent autologous CD19 CAR T data has been a positive step for patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL, T cell dysfunction and high circulating leukemia burden often found in patients with CLL, make the isolation of functional T cells for autologous CAR T manufacturing difficult. As a result, this trial has been driven by investigator enthusiasm for an allogeneic CAR T to potentially boost the curative power of CAR T. Initial data readout from Phase 1 ALPHA2 CLL cohort (n=12) is projected by year-end 2024. ALLO-329: CD19 Dagger® in Autoimmune Disease (AID)The Company has applied its deep understanding of CAR T research and development to design next-generation allogeneic CAR T investigational products that the Company believes can sustain the scale of the AID market while also meeting the unique requirements for these patients where they seek care. ALLO-329, the Company’s first AlloCAR T investigational product for AID, incorporates the Dagger® technology which is intended to reduce or eliminate the need for lymphodepletion while targeting CD19+ B-cells and CD70+ activated T-cells, both of which play a role in AID. As part of its overarching AID 2.0 platform, the Company also announced a non-exclusive, global gene editing licensing agreement with Arbor Biotechnologies, Inc. for use of their proprietary CRISPR-based gene-editing technology. ALLO-329 is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical trials in early 2025. ALLO-316: TRAVERSE Trial in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)Building upon the field’s understanding of how certain drugs can act as a “safety key” to mitigate treatment-associated adverse events without compromising CAR T function or efficacy, the Company has developed and implemented a diagnostic and treatment algorithm in its solid tumor trial that may mitigate the treatment-associated hyperinflammatory response without compromising the CAR T function needed to eradicate solid tumors with ALLO-316 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Details on this potentially cornerstone discovery in the Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is planned for a publication in Q2 2024.

Positive SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNT) achieved a 21.2% increase in total revenue, reaching $54,516,941 in fiscal year 2023. Gross profit rose by 20.3% to $21,613,809 compared to the previous year. EBITDA plus share-based compensation increased to $2,716,154, showing significant growth from 2022. The company incurred an expense of $2,986,107 related to a terminated merger agreement with Rhodium Enterprises. Despite a net loss per share of ($0.20) in 2023, the company maintained a healthy cash position of $6,143,298 as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue by 21.2% for SilverSun Technologies is a positive indicator of the company's growth and its ability to scale up operations. This growth rate surpasses the average for many technology solution providers, which often aim for a year-over-year increase in the mid-to-high single digits. The corresponding rise in gross profit by 20.3% suggests that the company is maintaining a consistent cost of goods sold (COGS) ratio, which is beneficial for its financial health.However, the net loss per share widening from ($0.05) to ($0.20) raises a red flag. It indicates that despite higher gross profits, other expenses are increasing at a faster rate, potentially due to operational inefficiencies, increased marketing spend, or other strategic initiatives that have yet to yield financial returns. The expense related to the terminated merger agreement is a one-time event, but it has a significant impact on the net loss. Investors should consider whether this is a sign of potential issues in the company's strategic decision-making or merely an isolated incident.Lastly, the EBITDA increase is noteworthy. It reflects improved operational profitability, excluding non-cash expenses and one-off items, which could be a signal of underlying business strength. However, investors should be aware that EBITDA does not account for the cost of capital investments, which are crucial for a technology company's long-term growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, SilverSun Technologies' substantial revenue growth suggests that it is gaining market share or expanding its market. This could be due to the introduction of new products, expansion into new markets, or the success of its existing services. The technology solutions sector is highly competitive and such growth might indicate that SilverSun has effectively differentiated itself from competitors.However, the terminated merger could signal to the market a potential instability or change in strategic direction. Mergers and acquisitions are often pursued to achieve synergies and enhance market position. The termination of such a process could be interpreted as a missed opportunity or a sign of misalignment between the entities involved. Market participants will be interested in management's future plans to compensate for this setback.The company's cash position and long-term liabilities will also be scrutinized. A strong cash position is essential for weathering economic downturns and investing in innovation, while manageable long-term liabilities suggest a sustainable debt level. The ratio between these two figures can provide insight into the company's financial resilience. Legal Expert Regarding the legal implications of the terminated merger, shareholders and potential investors should consider the possibility of litigation or arbitration, which could result from such a termination. While the expense has been quantified in the financial statement, the ongoing impact of any legal proceedings could have further financial repercussions and distract management from core business activities.Additionally, the termination of a merger agreement often results in scrutiny from regulatory bodies, especially if the companies are publicly traded. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may investigate the circumstances surrounding the termination to ensure all disclosure requirements were met and that there was no market manipulation involved.Investors should also be aware of the potential for reputational damage following a failed merger. Such events can affect stakeholder confidence and may influence future partnership or acquisition opportunities. The company will need to communicate effectively with shareholders to mitigate these risks. 03/14/2024 - 03:15 PM EAST HANOVER, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2024 / SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNT), a national provider of transformational business technology solutions and services, today announced its financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.Fiscal 2023 Financial HighlightsTotal revenue was $54,516,941, compared with $44,985,276 in 2021, an increase of 21.2%.Gross profit was $21,613,809, compared with $17,960,736 in 2021, an increase of 20.3%.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) plus share-based compensation, were $2,716,154, compared with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus share-based compensation of $914,280 in 2022, an increase of $1,801,874.The Company incurred an expense of $2,986,107 related to the terminated merger agreement with Rhodium Enterprises.Net loss per share in 2023 (on a diluted basis) was ($0.20), compared to net loss per share of ($0.05) in 2022.As of December 31, 2023, cash totaled $6,143,298, and the Company had $1,241,383 in long term liabilities.For more detailed information about SilverSun's 2022 financial results, please refer to the Company's Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov) on Friday, March 15, 2024.Commenting on the results, Mark Meller, Chairman and CEO of SilverSun, stated, ""2023 was a record year for the Company. We were able to successfully execute on our growth plan, as evidenced by our 19.8% increase in software revenue and our 21.7% increase in service revenue in 2023 versus 2022. We remain hopeful that we can continue to scale at an even more rapid pace in 2024. Our customers and prospects seem to feel confident about their economic outlook and continue to invest in their systems and infrastructure for the future.""Meller continued, ""Our expenses have been impacted by the higher costs associated with increasing pay and benefits to retain and recruit employees. These issues appear to be prevalent throughout our industry, but we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and believe we can sustain our needed level of recruiting under any reasonable circumstances. """"In addition, our non-payroll operating expenses rose as a result of inflation increasing our costs of doing business. But we have and will continue to increase our investment in our sales and marketing efforts, which has led to our increased sales volume.""""The Company remains on the acquisition hunt. In 2023, we acquired JCS Computer Resources, a Midwest-based reseller of Sage 100 and Sage 50 software. The acquisition added several hundred new customers to our installed base, and provides us with new migration, upsell and cross-sell opportunities. We continue to review acquisition candidates and are hopeful we can close on several transactions in 2024.""Meller further continued, ""In September 2022, we announced our planned merger with Rhodium Enterprises, Inc., an industrial bitcoin mining company. After a year of failing to clear regulatory hurdles, we announced the termination of our merger agreement with Rhodium Enterprises on October 13, 2023. As a result, the Company was forced to take a charge to earnings equal to the accrued transaction expenses of roughly $3 million. This is a one-time charge and will not hamper the Company's ability to continue to fund its growth.""""On December 4, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into an investment agreement with Jacobs Private Equity II, LLC (""JPE"") and minority co-investors pursuant to which JPE and the minority co-investors will invest $1 billion cash into the Company. The investment agreement also provides that SilverSun will, shortly after the closing of the investment, separate the existing SilverSun business as SilverSun Technologies Holdings, Inc. (""spin-off company"") and distribute all shares of the spin-off company to SilverSun stockholders as of a record date that is expected to be one day prior to the closing of the investment. In addition, SilverSun will declare a $2.5 million aggregate cash dividend to its stockholders as of the same record date, to be funded from proceeds received under the investment agreement. It is anticipated that the spin-off company, which will be named SilverSun Technologies Holdings, Inc., will trade on the OTCQX. The remaining Company will be renamed QXO, Inc. and will become a standalone platform for significant acquisitions in the building products distribution industry. The transaction is expected to close in 2024.""Meller concluded, ""We are pleased with the success we achieved in 2023. We believe that we are well positioned for continued growth and success as we have a strong team, experienced resources, and a strong financial position to support our initiatives. We look forward to delivering even more positive results in the coming quarters and years.""About SilverSun Technologies, Inc.We are a business application, technology and consulting company providing software and IT solutions to meet our clients' information, technology and business management needs.

Oncology Doctor The recent data on INB-100 and INB-200 therapies from IN8bio are promising, showing high remission rates in leukemia patients and exceeding progression-free survival in glioblastoma patients. This suggests a potential advancement in treatment options for these aggressive cancers. Gamma-delta T cell therapies are a novel approach in oncology, leveraging the immune system's capability to fight cancer with fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapies. The long-term remission observed with INB-100 could represent a significant improvement over current leukemia treatments, which often involve bone marrow transplants and come with high risks. The extended progression-free survival seen with INB-200 in glioblastoma, a cancer known for poor prognosis and limited treatment options, could mean a new hope for patients. Financial Analyst The financial results and business highlights from IN8bio indicate a strategic positioning for the company in the biopharmaceutical market. The successful private placement, raising $14.4 million with the potential for additional capital, suggests investor confidence and provides a runway into the first quarter of 2025. While the increase in R&D expenses reflects the company's commitment to advancing its clinical programs, it is also indicative of the high costs associated with biopharmaceutical development. The decrease in G&A expenses shows effective cost management, which is crucial for a company that is yet to generate revenue from its products. The net loss figures are typical for clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies, but the cash position improvement year-over-year is a positive sign for the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst The landscape of cancer treatment is rapidly evolving, with immunotherapies gaining traction. The positive clinical trial results for IN8bio's gamma-delta T cell therapies could position the company as a key player in the oncology segment, especially given the unmet medical needs in leukemia and glioblastoma. The market for cancer immunotherapies is expected to grow and IN8bio's advancements could capture a significant share if the therapies receive regulatory approval. The strategic timing of data presentations at major medical meetings throughout 2024 could further enhance the company's visibility and potentially attract partnership opportunities. However, the high attrition rate in oncology drug development and the competitive landscape must be considered when evaluating the company's long-term market potential. 03/14/2024 - 04:00 PM Reported the First-Ever Durable Persistence of an Allogeneic Cellular Therapy from a Phase 1 Study of INB-100 in Leukemia where 100% of Evaluable Patients (n=10) Treated Remained in Remission, including six Patients Alive and Progression Free Past 12 Months Presented Positive Results from a Phase 1 Study in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM) Demonstrating All Patients Treated with INB-200 Exceeded Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of Seven Months at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) 28th Annual MeetingAppointed Dr. Corinne Epperly, M.D., M.P.H. to Board of DirectorsClosed Private Placement in December 2023 with Initial Gross Proceeds of $14.4 Million to Provide Cash Runway into 1Q 2025 NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IN8bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: INAB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative gamma-delta T cell therapies, today reported financial results and business highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. “IN8bio entered 2024 with significant momentum behind the company,” said William Ho, CEO and co-founder of IN8bio. “Despite the difficult environment in 2023, the IN8bio team executed operationally and successfully advanced our programs. We presented positive data across our major clinical programs in leukemia and GBM, broadened our clinical portfolio, and strengthened our financial position by securing funding into 1Q 2025. We presented updated data from our INB-100 study at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, which was the first time any allogeneic cellular therapy has reported sustained efficacy and long-term cell persistence through 365 days. This showcases the potential of gamma-delta T cells to provide long-term durable remissions for patients with leukemia. We believe that IN8bio is well-positioned for significant near- and long-term catalysts as we advance our pipeline of gamma-delta T cell therapies to potentially extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.” Business Highlights and Recent Developments Announced positive INB-100 data at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition demonstrating that 100% of evaluable leukemia patients (n=10) treated remained alive, progression-free, and in durable complete remission (CR) as of November 3, 2023. The data showed long-term in-vivo expansion and persistence of allogeneic gamma-delta T cells 365 days following a single administration of INB-100. The study demonstrated the first-ever durable persistence of an allogeneic cellular therapy.Reported positive data on INB-200 at the 28th SNO Annual Meeting. All patients who completed mandated doses surpassed a median PFS of seven months, exceeded the standard-of-care median PFS of four to seven months, with one patient in Cohort 2 remaining alive and progression free past 28.5 months as of October 20, 2023. In addition, most patients exceeded the expected PFS based on their age and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status of their tumors.Announced a private placement totaling up to $46.9 million in potential gross proceeds. The initial closing of $14.4 million is expected to support operational execution and extended the Company’s cash runway into 1Q 2025 with the potential for up to $32.5 million in additional capital at increasing valuations, subject to certain conditions.Initiated enrollment for the Phase 2 study of INB-400 in newly diagnosed GBM.Announced publication in Frontiers in Immunology on IN8bio’s DeltEx Drug Resistant Immunotherapy (DRI) as a rational therapeutic approach to newly diagnosed glioblastoma titled, “Adoptive Cell Therapy for High Grade Gliomas using Simultaneous Temozolomide and Intracranial MGMT-Modified γδ T cells Following Standard Post-Resection Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy: Current Strategy and Future Directions.”Appointed Dr. Corinne Epperly, M.D., M.P.H., an internationally recognized immuno-oncology and cell therapy executive with 20 years of experience, to the Board of Directors. Upcoming Anticipated Pipeline Milestones and Events INB-100: Enroll an additional 10 patients in an expansion cohort at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and report Phase 1 long-term follow-up results at multiple medical meetings throughout 2024; potentially submit investigational new drug (IND) application for Phase 3 randomized control trial in 2024.INB-200: Report Phase 1 long-term follow up results at multiple medical meetings in 2024.INB-300: Present additional preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-concept for the nsCAR platform targeting CD33 and CD123 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April 2024.INB-400: Dose first patient and treat up to 15 patients at multiple sites across the United States in the Phase 2 trial in newly diagnosed GBM; potentially submit IND for Phase 1b allogeneic gamma-delta T cell study in relapsed GBM in 2024. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Research and Development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses were $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.0 million for the comparable prior year period. R&D expenses were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $14.1 million in the prior year. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and non-cash stock-based compensation due to increased headcount, as well as increased third-party clinical trial-related activities for the INB-100 and INB-200 programs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in contract research organization expenses for INB-400 related to the IND filing in the prior year.General and administrative (G&A) expenses: G&A expenses were $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.9 million for the comparable prior year period. G&A expenses were $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $14.5 million in the prior year. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to cost savings related to D&O insurance premiums and reductions in professional services.Net loss: The company reported a net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.22 per basic and diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $7.8 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted common share, for the comparable prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss was $30.0 million, or $1.00 per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $28.5 million, or $1.36 per basic and diluted common share, for the prior year.Cash position: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $21.3 million, compared to $18.2 million as of December 31, 2022.

Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Clipper Realty Inc. (CLPR) announces financial results for Q4 2023, with revenues of $34.9 million, NOI of $20.0 million, and AFFO of $6.3 million. Despite a net loss of $2.9 million, the company sees positive trends in rental revenue and occupancy rates. Positive Quarterly revenues increased to $34.9 million, up 5.6% from the previous year. Residential revenue surged by 9.3%, driven by higher rental rates at all properties. Net loss decreased to $2.9 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $3.4 million in Q4 2022. AFFO rose to $6.3 million, or $0.15 per share, showcasing growth in rental revenue and reduced real estate taxes. The company declared a dividend of $0.095 per share for Q4 2023, consistent with the previous quarter. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in quarterly revenues by Clipper Realty Inc. and the record adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) are positive indicators of the company's operational performance. The growth in residential revenue, driven by higher rental rates, suggests a robust demand in the New York metropolitan real estate market. However, the net loss reported, despite the revenue increase, raises concerns about the company's cost management and the impact of non-operational factors such as depreciation and interest expense.The stability of the dividend at $0.095 per share reflects management's confidence in the company's cash flow and financial health, despite the net loss. This could be reassuring to investors seeking income stability. The balance sheet's increase in notes payable, primarily due to new financing and development draws, indicates an aggressive growth strategy, which could lead to higher revenues in the long term but may also increase financial leverage and associated risks. Real Estate Market Analyst The strategic developments mentioned by Clipper Realty, such as the Dean Street new development and the Article 11 transaction at Flatbush Gardens, indicate a proactive approach to capitalizing on New York City's housing market. The mention of renewing leases at a 7% increase and nearly 6% for renewals is a testament to the strength of the market and the company's asset quality. Nevertheless, the early termination of the NYC lease at 250 Livingston Street introduces a potential vacancy risk that could affect short-term earnings.Clipper Realty's engagement with New York City housing agencies to enhance rental recoveries under Section 610, while undertaking capital improvements, is a strategic move to optimize revenue from regulated properties. However, it is essential to monitor the execution of these capital improvements and the associated recovery of enhanced rentals to assess the long-term impact on the company's financials. Construction and Development Analyst The completion of the Dean Street building superstructure ahead of schedule is an encouraging sign of the company's efficiency in project management. This early completion could lead to cost savings and earlier revenue generation from the 2025 leasing season. It is important to consider the risks associated with new developments, such as construction delays or cost overruns, which could offset the current progress.The termination of the lease by NYC at 250 Livingston Street presents a challenge but also an opportunity for redevelopment or re-leasing to potentially higher-paying tenants. The company's active pursuit of opportunities at this location will be critical in mitigating the short-term impact of the lease termination on revenues. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clipper Realty Inc. (NYSE: CLPR) (the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area, today announced financial and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Quarterly revenues of $34.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Quarterly income from operations of $9.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Net operating income (“NOI”)1 of $20.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Quarterly net loss of $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Record adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”)1 of $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Declared a dividend of $0.095 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 David Bistricer, Co-Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The fourth quarter of 2023 for the Company has continued to produce solid results after recent record-breaking quarters, with AFFO continuing to increase. We continue to have high occupancy and rents in our buildings with good renter demand for our product. For all our properties, new leases continue to rent at more than 7% over previous rents and renewals at almost 6%. At our Dean Street new development, we have completed the building superstructure ahead of schedule, and are working to an on-time completion next year to capture the 2025 leasing season. At Flatbush Gardens, under the new Article 11 transaction, we continue to make progress in working with various New York City housing agencies to collect enhanced rental recoveries under Section 610 as we undertake the committed capital improvements. At our 250 Livingston St property, we recently announced that NYC will exercise their option to terminate their lease in late August 2025 as they had previously said they might do. While we believe re-leasing the 250 Livingston Street space is a challenge in the short term, and, indeed, we are actively pursuing opportunities at the moment, we believe the benefits we will get from Flatbush Gardens, the 1010 Pacific Street development now completed, the Dean Street development once completed, and our other buildings set us up for strong performance in the future.” Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues increased by $1.9 million, or 5.6%, to $34.9 million and $0.7 million, or 2.1% excluding revenue from Pacific House. This compares to revenue of $33.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Residential revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 9.3%, and $1.0 million, or 4.2%, excluding revenue from Pacific House in the fourth quarter of 2023; driven by higher rental rates at all our residential properties. Commercial income decreased $0.3 million, or 3.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to a small number of commercial leases that expired during 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net loss was $2.9 million, or $0.09 per share or $1.8 million, or $0.06 per share excluding the net loss attributable to Pacific House operations, compared to net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The adjusted change was primarily attributable to increased rental revenue discussed above and lower real estate taxes due to the Flatbush Gardens Article 11 transaction entered at the end of the second quarter, net of higher insurance, depreciation and interest expense. For the fourth quarter of 2023, AFFO was $6.3 million, or $0.15 per share, or $6.6 million or $0.16 per share excluding the impact of Pacific House, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.11 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The adjusted change was primarily attributable to increased rental revenue discussed above and lower real estate taxes due to the Flatbush Gardens Article 11 transaction entered at the end of the second quarter, net of higher insurance and interest expense. __________ 1 NOI and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of these financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” at the end of this release. Balance Sheet At December 31, 2023, notes payable (excluding unamortized loan costs) was $1,219.0 million, compared to $1,171.2 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the permanent financing on the Pacific House loan entered in 2023 and draws made on Dean Street development in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dividend The Company today declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.095 per share, the same amount as last quarter, to shareholders of record on March 27, 2024, payable April 4, 2024.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Non-GAAP Financial Measures We disclose and discuss funds from operations (“FFO”), adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”), adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and net operating income (“NOI”), all of which meet the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. While management and the investment community in general believe that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors, neither FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, nor NOI should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income from operations as an indication of our performance. We believe that to understand our performance further, FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and NOI should be compared with our reported net income (loss) or income from operations and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment adjustments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by NAREIT. AFFO is defined by us as FFO excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles incurred in property acquisitions, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization costs incurred in originating debt, interest rate cap mark-to-market adjustments, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, loss on modification/extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, gain on termination of lease and non-recurring litigation-related expenses, less recurring capital spending. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. FFO is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income. We consider FFO useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance. We further consider AFFO useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent net income or cash flows from operations computed in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to net income (loss) as reliable measures of our operating performance; nor should you consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity. Neither FFO nor AFFO measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including loan principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Further, FFO and AFFO as disclosed by other REITs might not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and AFFO. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO for the periods presented to net loss, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 FFO Net loss $ (2,856 ) $ (3,354 ) $ (15,565 ) $ (12,571 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 7,563 6,764 28,939 26,985 FFO $ 4,707 $ 3,410 $ 13,374 $ 14,414 AFFO FFO $ 4,707 $ 3,410 $ 13,374 $ 14,414 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 120 121 481 481 Amortization of above- and below-market leases - (9 ) (18 ) (35 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 148 57 214 (163 ) Amortization of debt origination costs 607 313 1,705 1,252 Amortization of LTIP awards 801 856 3,015 2,920 Transaction pursuit costs - - 357 506 Loss on extinguishment of debt - - 3,868 - Certain litigation-related expenses - - (10 ) 188 Recurring capital spending (61 ) (50 ) (436 ) (326 ) AFFO $ 6,322 $ 4,698 $ 22,550 $ 19,237 AFFO Per Share/Unit $ 0.15 $ 0.11 $ 0.53 $ 0.45 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before allocation to non-controlling interests, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of identifiable intangibles, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, interest expense (net), acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, loss on modification/extinguishment of debt and non-recurring litigation-related expenses, less gain on involuntary conversion and gain on termination of lease. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income (loss). We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful financial measure of our core operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Adjusted EBITDA, and accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other REITs. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented to net loss, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (2,856 ) $ (3,354 ) $ (15,565 ) $ (12,571 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 7,563 6,764 28,939 26,985 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 120 121 481 481 Amortization of above- and below-market leases - (9 ) (18 ) (35 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 148 57 214 (163 ) Amortization of LTIP awards 801 856 3,015 2,920 Interest expense, net 11,871 10,131 44,867 40,207 Transaction pursuit costs - - 357 506 Loss on extinguishment of debt - - 3,868 - Certain litigation-related expenses - - (10 ) 188 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,647 $ 14,566 $ 66,148 $ 58,518 Net Operating Income We believe that NOI is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as income from operations plus real estate depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, amortization of identifiable intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, less gain on termination of lease. We believe that this measure is widely recognized and provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income (loss). We use NOI to evaluate our performance because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our company by measuring the core operations of property performance and capturing trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. NOI is also a widely used metric in valuation of properties. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of NOI for the periods presented to income from operations, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 NOI Income from operations $ 9,015 $ 6,777 $ 33,170 $ 27,636 Real estate depreciation and amortization 7,563 6,764 28,939 26,985 General and administrative expenses 3,140 3,404 13,169 12,752 Transaction pursuit costs - - 357 506 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 120 121 481 481 Amortization of above- and below-market leases - (9 ) (18 ) (35 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 148 57 214 (163 ) NOI $ 19,986 $ 17,114 $ 76,312 $ 68,162 View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240314920149/en/ Lawrence Kreider Chief Financial Officer (718) 438-2804 x2231 larry@clipperrealty.com Source: Clipper Realty Inc.

The company extended the stock repurchase program by $50.0 million. Q1 2024 revenue is expected to be $160.5-$163.5 million, with Adjusted EBITDA of $36-$38 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue increase of 4.7% for EverCommerce is a modest gain, which may suggest that the company is maintaining a steady growth trajectory in a potentially challenging market. However, the reported net loss widening from the previous year raises some concerns about the company's cost management and profitability strategies. The increase in net loss could indicate higher operating costs or investment in growth that has not yet yielded proportional financial benefits.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% is a positive indicator of the company's operational efficiency and ability to generate profits from its core business activities. The margin expansion by 370 basis points year-over-year reflects improved cost control or a favorable shift in the company's revenue mix. Investors should consider whether these improvements are sustainable and what impact they might have on long-term profitability.The share repurchase program expansion and extension signal that management is confident in the company's intrinsic value and is taking steps to return value to shareholders. This may be perceived positively by the market, as it often suggests a belief by management that the stock is undervalued. However, investors should also be cautious and assess whether the repurchases are the best use of capital in comparison to other investment opportunities or debt reduction. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of EverCommerce's fitness assets could be seen as a strategic move to streamline operations and focus on core segments that offer higher growth potential or margins. This simplification can make the company more agile and may improve operational efficiency. However, it's essential to analyze the potential impact on the company's overall market position and whether the divestiture will result in a loss of synergies or market share.EverCommerce's guidance for the upcoming quarters, excluding the fitness assets, provides transparency and allows investors to set expectations accordingly. The provided ranges for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA offer a glimpse into management's confidence in the company's performance. It is crucial to monitor how the exclusion of the fitness assets will affect the company's financials moving forward and whether the guidance suggests an underlying growth trend or potential stagnation. Legal Expert The use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, requires careful consideration, as these measures exclude certain expenses that are realized in GAAP accounting. The company's inability to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income due to variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to charges excluded from this non-GAAP measure, especially stock-based compensation, warrants attention. Investors should be aware of the limitations of non-GAAP measures and consider the potential material impact of these charges when evaluating the company's financial health. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM DENVER, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EverCommerce Inc. (""EverCommerce"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: EVCM), a leading service commerce platform, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue of $169.4 million, an increase of 4.7% compared to $161.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.YoY Pro forma revenue growth rate of approximately 4.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.Net loss was $23.3 million, or ($0.12) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net loss of $17.8 million, or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was $43.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $35.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. “Despite experiencing some continuing headwinds to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, EverCommerce delivered Adjusted EBITDA results that were above the top end of guidance and represented 22% growth and 370 basis points of YoY margin expansion,” said Eric Remer, EverCommerce’s Founder and CEO. “Looking ahead, we are focused on driving balanced growth with profitability as well as delivering improved shareholder returns. The sale of our fitness assets announced yesterday is an initial step towards simplifying, transforming and optimizing our business.” A reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Share Repurchases On November 5, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $50.0 million increase in the previously announced stock repurchase authorization and extended the authorization through December 31, 2024. The total authorization since the repurchase program began allows for the purchase up to $150.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company repurchased and retired 2,692,747 shares of common stock for $26.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company expects to fund repurchases with cash on hand. Business Outlook Based on information as of today, March 14, 2024, the Company is issuing the following financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. Note that this guidance excludes EverCommerce’s fitness assets, which the company announced its divestiture of on March 13, 2024, and as such is non-GAAP. First Quarter 2024: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $160.5 million to $163.5 million.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $36 million to $38 million. Full Year 2024: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $676 million to $696 million.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $167 million to $176 million. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to certain charges excluded from this non-GAAP measure; in particular, the measures and efforts of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price. It is important to note that these charges could be material to EverCommerce's results computed in accordance with GAAP. Conference Call Information EverCommerce’s management team will hold a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and outlook today, March 14, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EverCommerce has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). EverCommerce uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing EverCommerce’s financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with EverCommerce’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of EverCommerce’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. Adjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operational performance, as it represents the results of revenues and direct costs, which are key components of our operations. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it reflects the gross profitability of our operations, and excludes the indirect costs associated with our sales and marketing, product development, general and administrative activities, and depreciation and amortization, and the impact of our financing methods and income taxes. Gross profit is calculated as total revenues less cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), amortization of developed technology, amortization of capitalized software and depreciation expense (allocated to cost of revenues). We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization allocated to cost of revenues. Adjusted Gross Profit should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss) or profitability. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates, and/or different forms of employee compensation. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by our management team as additional measures of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees. Our Management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude interest and other expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, other amortization, stock-based compensation, and transaction-related and other non-recurring costs. Other amortization includes amortization for capitalized contract acquisition costs. Transaction-related costs are specific deal-related costs such as legal fees, financial and tax due diligence, consulting and escrow fees. Other non-recurring costs are expenses such as impairment charges, system implementation costs, severance expense related to planned restructuring activities, and costs associated with integration and transformational improvements. Transaction-related and other non-recurring costs are excluded as they are not representative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss).

The effective interest rate on the Term Loan is 4.89%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) regarding the new $85 million term loan is a strategic financial move that deserves attention. By paying down the $50 million of private notes due in June 2024, FCPT is effectively managing its debt profile, which can be seen as a proactive step in liquidity management. This action not only improves the company's near-term financial flexibility but also reduces potential refinancing risk associated with the upcoming debt maturity.Furthermore, the decision to lock in the interest rate at 3.94% through interest rate swaps is a prudent hedge against potential rising interest rates, which can be a significant concern for real estate investment trusts (REITs) as they often carry a substantial amount of interest-bearing debt. The effective interest rate of 4.89%, given the company's current investment grade ratings, appears competitive in the current economic environment, potentially leading to interest savings over the term of the loan.Investors should note that the company's emphasis on maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet is indicative of a conservative financial strategy, which could be favorable for the stock's risk profile. The additional capital for acquisitions also signals potential growth, albeit it's important to monitor how effectively this capital is deployed to generate returns. Market Research Analyst FCPT's entry into a new term loan and the subsequent interest rate swap transaction indicate a strategic move to optimize its capital structure within the real estate market. Given the company's focus on net-leased restaurant and retail properties, the additional capital for acquisitions could allow FCPT to take advantage of market opportunities and expand its portfolio in a sector that has been experiencing a post-pandemic recovery.It's important to consider the broader market implications of such financial maneuvers. Access to capital at a fixed interest rate provides FCPT with a predictable cost of debt, which is essential for long-term budgeting and investment planning. This stability can be an attractive quality for investors who are risk-averse, especially in an industry where cash flow predictability is highly valued.The involvement of multiple reputable financial institutions in this deal also serves as a positive signal to the market regarding FCPT's creditworthiness and the trust these institutions have in the company's financial health and management. Real Estate Investment Expert From a real estate investment perspective, FCPT's actions reflect a strategic approach to capital management within the REIT sector. The use of the accordion feature in their Credit Agreement to secure additional funds demonstrates a well-planned financial structure that provides flexibility for future growth. The term loan's maturity in 2027, with an option for a twelve-month extension, offers a timeline that aligns well with the typical investment horizon in real estate, allowing for potential property acquisitions and value-add strategies to materialize.Investors should recognize that the company's strategy to address its only near-term debt maturity effectively reduces the risk of a liquidity crunch. This is particularly relevant in the real estate sector where cash flow management is critical due to the cyclical nature of property markets. The commitment to a strong balance sheet and the focus on maintaining investment grade ratings are positive indicators of FCPT's risk management practices, which are essential for sustaining investor confidence in a REIT. 03/14/2024 - 04:05 PM MILL VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE:FCPT), a real estate investment trust primarily engaged in the ownership and acquisition of high-quality, net-leased restaurant and retail properties (“FCPT” or the “Company”), announced today that the Company entered into an Incremental Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement with a group of existing lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Company utilized the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement to enter into a new $85 million term loan (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan matures in March 2027 with one twelve-month extension exercisable at the Company’s option, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan will be fully drawn at close and will be used to pay down the $50 million of private notes maturing in June 2024 as well as for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Bill Lenehan, Chief Executive Officer of FCPT, commented “We are very appreciative of the support of our existing bank partners. This Term Loan allows us to pay down our only near-term debt maturity at a favorable borrowing cost and provides additional capital for acquisitions. This transaction highlights FCPT's commitment to a strong, investment grade-balance sheet, and positions the Company well with our next maturity not scheduled until November 2025.” In conjunction with the Term Loan, the Company entered into $85 million of interest rate swaps to fix the reference rate at 3.94% through maturity. Including a credit margin of 0.95% determined under the Credit Agreement by FCPT’s current investment grade ratings of BBB/Baa3 (Fitch/Moody’s), the effective interest rate on the Term Loan is 4.89%. Barclays Bank PLC acted as Syndication Agent and Joint Lead Arranger on the Term Loan with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. remaining as administrative agent. The additional lenders acting as Joint Lead Arrangers and Co-Documentation Agents were The Huntington National Bank, Mizuho Bank, Ltd, Raymond James Bank, Truist Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.. About FCPT FCPT, headquartered in Mill Valley, CA, is a real estate investment trust primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition and leasing of restaurant and retail properties.

Electric Grid Upgrades Underway in Lorain County,2024-03-14T18:12:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"FirstEnergy Corp.'s subsidiary, American Transmission Systems, Inc., is replacing insulator assemblies along high-voltage power lines in Lorain County to prevent outages for over 3,600 Ohio Edison customers. The project will enhance the regional transmission system's reliability and safety.","Electric Grid Upgrades Underway in Lorain County Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FirstEnergy Corp.'s subsidiary, American Transmission Systems, Inc., is replacing insulator assemblies along high-voltage power lines in Lorain County to prevent outages for over 3,600 Ohio Edison customers. The project will enhance the regional transmission system's reliability and safety. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The strategic initiative by FirstEnergy Corp. to upgrade its transmission infrastructure by replacing insulator assemblies is a proactive measure that bolsters the reliability of power delivery to customers. This project, part of the larger Energize365 program, signifies a substantial investment in the company's transmission and distribution systems. Such investments are often viewed positively by investors, as they can lead to reduced operational risks and potential cost savings from fewer outages and maintenance requirements in the long term.From an industry perspective, the move aligns with the broader trend of utility companies investing in grid modernization to accommodate future energy demands, including the integration of electric vehicles and clean energy sources. These enhancements are essential to maintain system integrity and customer satisfaction, which can, in turn, influence regulatory support and rate case outcomes - factors critical to utility revenue streams. Financial Analyst FirstEnergy's disclosure of a $26 billion investment plan over a four-year period provides a clear indication of the company's capital allocation strategy. This level of expenditure will likely have implications for the company's financial structure, potentially affecting its debt levels and capital expenditure profiles. Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage these investments without adversely impacting its credit ratings or dividend policy.Moreover, the focus on infrastructure resilience could lead to operational efficiencies, which may reflect positively in future earnings reports. However, the costs associated with such a large-scale upgrade need to be weighed against the anticipated benefits. It's essential to scrutinize the return on investment and the impact on the company's return on equity, as these metrics are crucial for evaluating the financial health and performance of a utility company. Market Research Analyst The ongoing efforts by FirstEnergy to upgrade its transmission lines are indicative of a sector-wide push towards modernizing the electric grid. By focusing on the reliability and future-readiness of the grid, FirstEnergy is positioning itself to better meet emerging market demands, such as the growth in electric vehicle adoption and the transition towards more sustainable energy sources. This strategic positioning may enhance the company's competitive edge in the utilities market.Understanding consumer trends and regulatory pressures is vital, as these factors can significantly influence the success of such large-scale projects. The ability of FirstEnergy to execute the project efficiently and within budget will be critical in maintaining investor confidence and market share, especially in a sector where reliability and service quality are paramount for customer retention and acquisition. 03/14/2024 - 02:12 PM Work will help prevent or minimize outages for more than 3,600 FirstEnergy customers AKRON, Ohio, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), is replacing more than 900 insulator assemblies along two high-voltage power lines in Lorain County in Northeast Ohio. The project will strengthen the regional transmission system and help prevent or minimize the impact of power outages for more than 3,600 customers of Ohio Edison, a FirstEnergy company. The two 138-kilovolt power lines run through Grafton and Elyria in Lorain County and are approximately 13 miles and 14 miles in length, respectively. ATSI will replace 927 insulator assemblies on 196 transmission structures that support the two lines. Insulators separate high-voltage transmission lines from their grounded support towers and help maintain safe, consistent delivery of power. Carl Bridenbaugh, FirstEnergy's Vice President of Transmission: ""By installing new, upgraded equipment along these transmission lines, we can help prevent potential power outages and ensure that our transmission system continues to serve customers safely and reliably in the future."" The lines serve a substation in the area that delivers power to more than 3,600 customers of Ohio Edison. The insulator work began in late February and is expected to be complete in August. ATSI also plans to replace 18 structures along the route next year. ATSI provides transmission services in Ohio and in the western portion of Pennsylvania and owns or maintains more than 8,100 miles of transmission lines, substations and other facilities. The project is part of Energize365, a multi-year grid evolution program focused on transmission and distribution investments that will deliver the power FirstEnergy's customers depend on today while also meeting the challenges of tomorrow. With planned investments of $26 billion between 2024 and 2028, the program will create a smarter, more secure grid that will meet and exceed reliability targets and accommodate electric vehicles, the electrification of homes and businesses and clean energy sources. FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving more than six million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

The company's backlog reaches an all-time high of $67 million, driven by contract wins. Despite an operating loss in the quarter due to technical challenges, the company remains optimistic about future profitability and cash flow. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Frequency Electronics, Inc.'s recent financial report showcases a robust increase in revenues for both the three-month and nine-month periods of fiscal 2024, indicating a positive trend when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Notably, the 50% contribution of satellite payloads to consolidated revenues for the quarter and the 41% for the nine months, reflect a strong demand in this segment, which is a vital indicator of the company's market position and potential for future growth.However, the reported operating loss for the third quarter, despite the revenue growth, suggests that the company is facing challenges in managing its costs or encountering unexpected expenses, particularly in new development programs. The management's acknowledgment of technical difficulties in a new program and the confidence expressed in overcoming these setbacks could be seen as a commitment to continuous improvement and long-term strategy. The backlog of $67 million, an all-time high, provides a glimpse into the company's future revenue potential and may be a significant point of interest for investors. Financial Analyst The financial metrics presented by Frequency Electronics, Inc. offer a mixed picture. On one hand, the year-over-year revenue growth is commendable, with a substantial improvement in net income from operations for both the three-month and nine-month periods. This growth could be a signal to investors of the company's improving financial health and operational efficiency. On the other hand, the operating loss in the third quarter raises questions about the sustainability of profit margins, particularly given the company's historical trend towards strong gross margin performance.The shift from an operating loss of $5.1 million to an operating income of $2.5 million for the nine-month period is a significant turnaround, which may reflect well on management's strategies and operational adjustments. However, the decrease in net cash provided by operations year-over-year warrants attention, as it may indicate a shift in working capital management or other operational cash flows. Investors may need to monitor subsequent quarters to assess whether this is an aberration or part of a larger trend. 03/14/2024 - 04:01 PM MITCHEL FIELD, N.Y., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Frequency Electronics, Inc. (“FEI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ-FEIM) is reporting revenues for the three-month and nine-month periods of fiscal 2024, ended January 31, 2024, of approximately $13.7 million and $39.7 million, respectively, compared to revenues of $10.6 million and $27.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of fiscal year 2023, ended January 31, 2023. Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $0.5 million compared to an operating income of $0.3 million for the same period of fiscal year 2023. Operating Income for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 was $2.5 million compared to an operating loss of $5.1 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Net Income from operations for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 was $0.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share and $3.0 million or $0.32 per diluted share, respectively, compared to net losses from operations for the three and nine month ended January 31, 2023 of $0.3 million or ($0.03) per diluted share and $5.7 million or ($0.62) per diluted share, respectively. FEI President and CEO, Tom McClelland commented, “In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 we experienced continued revenue growth, reflecting the company’s ability to meet the highly technical needs of its customers in an expanding total addressable market. The backlog of $67 million at the end of Q3 is an all-time high for the company, driven in part by the meaningful contract wins we announced in November. That being said, we are reporting an operating loss for the quarter of $0.5 million, attributable to technical challenges primarily on a single new development program. Because we are often working on next generation programs with significant technological advancements, such temporary setbacks are not only an inevitable part of the business, they are necessary in order to keep pushing our technology development forward. We are aggressively managing this program and are confident that the overruns are largely behind us, and that overall we will still generate an operating profit for the year. In addition, the knowledge base and “lessons learned” from such setbacks help position us for improved performance on potential follow-on business. The gross margin performance in this quarter is not reflective of the strong gross margin trends we have recently exhibited, and we are continuing to work towards higher gross margins overall, as we have detailed on recent earnings calls. I believe our overall efforts have put us on a sustainable positive trajectory for growth, profitability and cash flow, and we anticipate generating significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter. The Company remains committed to achieving sustained profitability and cash generation going forward.” Fiscal Year 2024 Selected Financial Metrics and Other Items For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024, revenues from satellite payloads were approximately $6.8 million, or 50%, and $16.3 million, or 41%, respectively, of consolidated revenues compared to $5.0 million, or 47%, and $12.8 million, or 46% for the same period of the prior year.

Geron Announces FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee Votes in Favor of the Clinical Benefit/Risk Profile of Imetelstat for the Treatment of Transfusion-Dependent Anemia in Patients with Lower-Risk MDS,2024-03-14T19:54:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Geron Corporation's imetelstat receives positive vote from FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in adult patients with LR-MDS.

The IMerge Phase 3 trial results show significant clinical benefit with improved red blood cell transfusion independence and hemoglobin levels. The PDUFA target action date is set for June 16, 2024, indicating a potential new treatment option for patients with unmet medical needs. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The positive opinion from the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee on imetelstat's benefit/risk profile marks a pivotal moment for patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) who require transfusions. The clinical trial data indicating higher rates of transfusion independence with imetelstat aligns with the therapeutic goal of reducing the transfusion burden in these patients. The duration of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) being close to a year is a significant improvement over current standards. However, the high incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events, such as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, must be weighed against the benefits. These side effects, while manageable, could impact patient quality of life and treatment adherence. As a treating physician, the introduction of a new treatment option is welcome, but it's essential to consider the entire patient management plan, including monitoring and potential need for supportive care to address these adverse events. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint of 24-week red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) is noteworthy. This outcome suggests that imetelstat may offer a durable response for a subset of patients, which is a meaningful advancement in the treatment landscape of LR-MDS. The broad efficacy across various MDS subgroups, irrespective of ring sideroblast (RS) status or baseline transfusion burden, indicates that imetelstat could fill a significant unmet need in the MDS treatment paradigm. The observed sustained increase in mean hemoglobin levels over time could translate into an improved quality of life for patients. However, it's important to scrutinize the long-term safety profile, considering the prevalence of serious adverse events, as this could influence the drug's adoption and utilization post-approval. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the potential approval of imetelstat represents a meaningful opportunity for Geron Corporation, particularly as there are limited treatment options for LR-MDS. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is a critical milestone for the company and approval could lead to significant market penetration given the unmet need in this patient population. The commercial success of imetelstat will depend on factors such as pricing, reimbursement and the ability to manage the adverse events associated with treatment. Additionally, the competitive landscape, including emerging therapies and the positioning of imetelstat within treatment guidelines, will influence its market share. The anticipation of FDA approval and commercial launch could impact Geron's stock performance, with investor sentiment likely to be influenced by the ODAC's positive recommendation. 03/14/2024 - 03:54 PM FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 12 to 2 in favor of the clinical benefit/risk profile of imetelstat based on results from the IMerge Phase 3 clinical trial There are significant unmet needs across key TD LR-MDS patient populations, including difficult-to-treat subgroups that are underserved by currently available treatment options June 16, 2024 PDUFA target action date for imetelstat NDA for the treatment of TD anemia in adult patients with LR-MDS FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Geron Corporation (Nasdaq: GERN), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company developing investigational first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, to treat hematologic malignancies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 12 to 2 in favor of the clinical benefit/risk profile of imetelstat for the treatment of transfusion-dependent (TD) anemia in adult patients with low-to-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) who have not responded to or have lost response to or are ineligible for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). “We are pleased with the Committee’s decision to recognize the positive clinical benefit/risk profile of imetelstat for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in adult patients with lower-risk MDS. There are few treatment options and significant unmet medical need remains for these patients, particularly among those with difficult-to-treat subtypes of this blood cancer,” said Faye Feller, M.D., Geron’s Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer. “We believe that imetelstat has the potential to be an important new medicine for patients and look forward to continuing our collaboration with the FDA as they complete their review of our New Drug Application.” The ODAC reviewed the results from the IMerge Phase 3 clinical trial. The primary endpoint of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) for at least eight consecutive weeks was significantly higher with imetelstat vs. placebo (p<0.001), with median RBC-TI duration approaching one year for imetelstat ≥8-week RBC-TI responders. In addition, 28% of imetelstat-treated patients compared to 3% on placebo obtained a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint of at least 24-week RBC-TI. For those patients achieving ≥24-week RBC-TI, the median duration was 80 weeks. Clinically meaningful RBC-TI was achieved across key MDS subgroups irrespective of ring sideroblast (RS) status, baseline transfusion burden and International Prognostic Scoring (IPSS) risk category. Additionally, a sustained increase in mean hemoglobin levels in imetelstat-treated patients was observed over time compared to placebo patients. Consistent with prior imetelstat clinical experience, the most common Grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (62%) and neutropenia (68%) that were generally manageable and of short duration. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 16, 2024 for Geron’s New Drug Application (NDA) for imetelstat for the treatment of TD anemia in adult patients with low- to intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, who have failed to respond, or have lost response to, or are ineligible for ESAs. The ODAC provides the FDA with independent opinions and recommendations from outside medical experts, patients and caregivers, though the recommendations are not binding. Geron plans to commercially launch imetelstat in the U.S. upon potential FDA approval. About IMerge Phase 3 The Phase 3 portion of the IMerge Phase 2/3 trial is a double-blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate imetelstat in patients with IPSS Low or Intermediate-1 risk (lower-risk) transfusion-dependent MDS who were relapsed after, refractory to, or ineligible for, erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) treatment, had not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide and were non-del(5q). To be eligible for IMerge Phase 3, patients were required to be transfusion-dependent, defined as requiring at least four units of packed red blood cells (RBCs), over an eight-week period during the 16 weeks prior to entry into the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint of IMerge Phase 3 is the rate of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) lasting at least eight weeks, defined as the proportion of patients without any RBC transfusion for at least eight consecutive weeks since entry to the trial (8-week RBC-TI). Key secondary endpoints include the rate of RBC-TI lasting at least 24 weeks (24-week RBC-TI), the duration of RBC-TI and the rate of hematologic improvement erythroid (HI-E), which is defined under 2006 IWG criteria as a rise in hemoglobin of at least 1.5 g/dL above the pretreatment level for at least eight weeks or a reduction of at least four units of RBC transfusions over eight weeks compared with the prior RBC transfusion burden. A total of 178 patients were enrolled in IMerge Phase 3 across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. About Imetelstat Imetelstat is a novel, first-in-class investigational telomerase inhibitor exclusively owned by Geron and being developed by Geron in hematologic malignancies. Data from non-clinical studies and clinical trials of imetelstat provide strong evidence that imetelstat targets telomerase to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells in myeloid hematologic malignancies, resulting in malignant cell apoptosis. Imetelstat has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for both the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS that is not associated with del(5q) who are refractory or resistant to an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, and for adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease has relapsed after or is refractory to Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. Imetelstat is currently not approved by any regulatory authority. About Geron Geron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company pursuing therapies with the potential to extend and enrich the lives of patients living with hematologic malignancies. Our first-in-class investigational telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, harnesses Nobel Prize-winning science in a treatment that may alter the underlying drivers of disease. The New Drug Application (NDA) for imetelstat for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (TD LR-MDS) who have failed to respond or have lost response to or are ineligible for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), based on the results from the Phase 3 IMerge clinical trial, is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 16, 2024. In addition, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the same proposed indication and is under review. Furthermore, Geron currently has an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating imetelstat in relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis (R/R MF).

(PHR) reports strong financial results for Q4 and FY 2024, with revenue up 27% year-over-year. Despite a net loss, the company shows growth in AHSCs and total revenue. The outlook for FY 2025 indicates continued growth and improved Adjusted EBITDA. Positive Total revenue increased by 27% year-over-year to $356.3 million for fiscal year 2024. AHSCs grew by 26% year-over-year to 3,601 in fiscal year 2024. Net loss decreased to $136.9 million in fiscal year 2024 from $176.1 million in fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA improved to negative $35.4 million in fiscal year 2024 from negative $92.5 million in fiscal year 2023. Revenue outlook for fiscal year 2025 is set at $424 million to $434 million, with a growth range of 19% to 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal year 2025 is revised to $12 million to $20 million, indicating a positive trend compared to the previous year. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $87.5 million as of January 31, 2024, supporting the company's growth plans for fiscal year 2025. Negative Net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was $30.6 million, compared to $38.0 million in the same period the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal fourth quarter was negative $3.5 million, an improvement from negative $17.6 million in the same period the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $87.5 million as of January 31, 2024, down from $176.7 million as of January 31, 2023. Financial Analyst The reported fiscal year results for Phreesia, Inc. show a significant year-over-year revenue increase of 27%, indicating a robust expansion in their market presence. Despite this growth, there's a noted decrease in healthcare services revenue per AHSC, suggesting that the company's client acquisition rate is not fully translating into proportional revenue gains, potentially due to a saturation in payment processing volume. This decoupling could signal a need for Phreesia to diversify their revenue streams or enhance monetization strategies per client.Their net loss reduction from $176.1 million in fiscal year 2023 to $136.9 million in fiscal year 2024, along with a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA, indicates an effective cost management strategy and a path towards profitability. However, investors should be mindful of the decline in cash and cash equivalents by over 50% year-over-year, which could raise concerns about the company's liquidity and financial resilience in the absence of further capital infusion. Market Research Analyst Phreesia's performance reflects a broader trend in the healthcare technology sector where companies are aggressively expanding their client base. The increase in AHSCs by 26% is notable and demonstrates Phreesia's ability to penetrate the market. However, the slight decrease in revenue per AHSC suggests competitive pressures or a lower monetization of newer clients, which is common in aggressive expansion phases. The market will be watching closely to see if Phreesia can leverage its increased market share to generate higher revenue per client.With the company maintaining its revenue outlook for fiscal year 2025, it appears confident in its business model and growth strategies. The updated Adjusted EBITDA outlook also indicates operational optimizations and potential cost efficiencies. However, the lack of reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net income (loss) leaves some uncertainty regarding the impact of non-operational financial elements on the company's profitability. Legal Expert Phreesia's disclosure regarding the non-reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net income (loss) is a critical piece of information for stakeholders. This indicates that there are unpredictable financial elements such as Other (income) expense, net and (Benefit from) provision for income taxes that could significantly affect the company's financials. Stakeholders should be aware that non-GAAP financial measures, while helpful for operational insight, may not fully represent the company's financial health as per standard accounting practices.Additionally, Phreesia's use of multiple communication channels for disclosing material non-public information is in line with Regulation FD, ensuring fair and broad access to company information. Investors should monitor these channels to stay informed about the company's performance and strategy updates. 03/14/2024 - 04:03 PM WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Phreesia, Inc.

Average number of healthcare services clients (""AHSCs"") was 3,962 in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. Healthcare services revenue per AHSC was $17,456 in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by healthcare services client growth outpacing growth in payment processing volume and payment processing revenue. See ""Key Metrics"" below for additional information. Total revenue per AHSC was $23,979 in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by adding AHSCs from the acquisition of ConnectOnCall that have an immaterial amount of revenue associated with them. See ""Key Metrics"" below for additional information. Net loss was $30.6 million in the quarter compared to $38.0 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $3.5 million in the quarter compared to negative $17.6 million in the same period in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2024 was $87.5 million, down $15.8 million from October 31, 2023. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2024 Highlights Revenue was $356.3 million in fiscal year 2024, up 27% year-over-year. AHSCs were 3,601 in fiscal year 2024, up 26% year-over-year. Healthcare services revenue per AHSC was $72,215 in fiscal year 2024, down 1% year-over-year.

Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2024 was $87.5 million, down from $176.7 million as of January 31, 2023. Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook2 We are maintaining our revenue outlook for fiscal year 2025 at a range of $424 million to $434 million, implying year-over-year growth of 19% to 22%. The revenue range provided for fiscal 2025 assumes no additional revenue from potential future acquisitions completed between now and January 31, 2025. We are updating our Adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal year 2025 to a range of $12 million to $20 million from a previous range of $10 million to $20 million. We believe our $87.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2024, along with cash generated in our normal operations gives us sufficient flexibility to reach our fiscal 2025 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA outlook. Additionally, our available borrowing capacity under our credit facility with Capital One provides us with an additional source of capital to pursue future growth opportunities not incorporated into our fiscal 2025 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA outlook. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have not reconciled our Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP Net income (loss) because we do not provide an outlook for GAAP Net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and potential variability of Other (income) expense, net and (Benefit from) provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP Net income (loss). Because we cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. We caution, however, that such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP Net income (loss). For further information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures and an explanation of these measures, please see “Non-GAAP financial measures” below.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest income, net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and before stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other (income) expense, net. We have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this press release and our Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed after this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. We have not reconciled our Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP Net income (loss) because we do not provide an outlook for GAAP Net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and potential variability of Other (income) expense, net and Provision for (benefit from) income taxes, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP Net income (loss). Because we cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. We caution, however, that such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP Net income (loss). Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of non-cash stock-based compensation; (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; or (4) Interest (income) expense, net; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results.

Key Metrics (Unaudited) Three months ended January 31, Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Key Metrics: Average number of healthcare services clients (""AHSCs"") 3,962 3,140 3,601 2,856 Healthcare services revenue per AHSC $ 17,456 $ 17,705 $ 72,215 $ 72,599 Total revenue per AHSC $ 23,979 $ 24,390 $ 98,944 $ 98,358 We remain focused on building secure and reliable products that derive a strong return on investment for our clients and implementing them with speed and ease. This strategy continues to enable us to grow our network of healthcare services clients. The investments we make to grow, strengthen and sustain our network of healthcare services clients lead to growth in all of our revenue categories. The definitions of our key metrics are presented below. AHSCs. We define AHSCs as the average number of clients that generate subscription and related services or payment processing revenue each month during the applicable period. In cases where we act as a subcontractor providing white-label services to our partner's clients, we treat the contractual relationship as a single healthcare services client. We believe growth in AHSCs is a key indicator of the performance of our business and depends, in part, on our ability to successfully develop and market our solutions to healthcare services organizations that are not yet clients. While growth in AHSCs is an important indicator of expected revenue growth, it also informs our management of the areas of our business that will require further investment to support expected future AHSC growth. For example, as AHSCs increase, we may need to add to our customer support team and invest to maintain effectiveness and performance of our solutions for our healthcare services clients and their patients. Healthcare services revenue per AHSC. We define Healthcare services revenue as the sum of subscription and related services revenue and payment processing revenue. We define Healthcare services revenue per AHSC as Healthcare services revenue in a given period divided by AHSCs during that same period. We are focused on continually delivering value to our healthcare services clients and believe that our ability to increase Healthcare services revenue per AHSC is an indicator of the long-term value of our solutions. Total revenue per AHSC. We define Total revenue per AHSC as Total revenue in a given period divided by AHSCs during that same period. Our healthcare services clients directly generate subscription and related services and payment processing revenue. Additionally, our relationships with healthcare services clients who subscribe to our solutions give us the opportunity to engage with life sciences companies, health plans and other payer organizations, patient advocacy, public interest and other not-for-profit organizations who deliver direct communication to patients through our solutions. As a result, we believe that our ability to increase Total revenue per AHSC is an indicator of the long-term value of our solutions. Additional Information (Unaudited) Three months ended January 31, Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Patient payment volume (in millions) $ 977 $ 821 $ 3,947 $ 3,284 Payment facilitator volume percentage 82 % 81 % 82 % 80 % Patient payment volume. We believe that patient payment volume is an indicator of both the underlying health of our healthcare services clients’ businesses and the continuing shift of healthcare costs to patients. We measure patient payment volume as the total dollar volume of transactions between our healthcare services clients and their patients utilizing our payment platform, including via credit and debit cards that we process as a payment facilitator as well as cash and check payments and credit and debit transactions for which we act as a gateway to other payment processors. Payment facilitator volume percentage. We define payment facilitator volume percentage as the volume of credit and debit card patient payment volume that we process as a payment facilitator as a percentage of total patient payment volume. Payment facilitator volume is a major driver of our payment processing revenue. Our payment facilitator volume percentage could decline slightly over time should we increase our penetration of enterprise customers that are less likely to use Phreesia as a payment facilitator.

"ComEd Refiles Multi-Year Grid Plan to Advance Region’s Economic, Climate and Equity Goals",2024-03-14T17:57:00.000Z,Low,Positive,Illinois Commerce Commission to rule on ComEd's revised grid plan aligning with clean energy goals by end of 2024.,"ComEd Refiles Multi-Year Grid Plan to Advance Region’s Economic, Climate and Equity Goals Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Illinois Commerce Commission to rule on ComEd's revised grid plan aligning with clean energy goals by end of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Policy Analyst The refiled multi-year grid plan by ComEd, as directed by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), addresses several critical aspects of energy policy. One of the primary considerations is the alignment with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which aims to increase access to clean and renewable energy while also focusing on affordability and equity. This plan's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and benefits to equity investment eligible communities (EIECs) indicates a strategic shift towards inclusive growth and sustainable development.Analyzing the potential impact on the business landscape, the plan could lead to a more stable and predictable regulatory environment, which is beneficial for investors and stakeholders. However, the focus on affordability might put pressure on profit margins, especially if the cost of implementing new technologies exceeds initial projections. Businesses and investors should monitor the proceedings closely, as the ICC's ruling by the end of 2024 will influence ComEd's operations and potentially the wider energy sector in Illinois. Renewable Energy Expert ComEd's refiled grid plan is a significant step towards modernizing Illinois's energy infrastructure with an emphasis on renewable energy sources. The plan's alignment with CEJA suggests a transition away from fossil fuels, which could have far-reaching implications for the energy market and related industries. This shift is expected to foster the growth of renewable energy companies and could stimulate job creation in the sector.However, the integration of renewables into the grid presents technical challenges and requires substantial investment. Stakeholders should consider the potential for innovation in energy storage and grid management technologies as critical factors for the success of such a plan. Long-term, the move towards a cleaner energy mix could result in economic benefits and enhanced energy security, but the upfront costs and the scale of infrastructure changes required could pose risks to ComEd and its customers. Financial Analyst The financial implications of ComEd's revised grid plan are multifaceted. On one hand, the plan could result in increased capital expenditures to upgrade the grid, which may impact ComEd's financial statements and potentially affect the stock price. On the other hand, aligning with state-mandated clean energy goals could lead to operational efficiencies and open up new revenue streams in the long run.Investors should weigh the risks associated with the large-scale investment against the potential for regulatory incentives and support for renewable energy initiatives. It's also important to consider the competitive landscape, as ComEd's commitment to clean energy might influence its market position relative to other utilities. The ICC's final ruling will be a key determinant of the financial viability of the plan and should be closely watched by anyone with a stake in ComEd or the broader energy market. 03/14/2024 - 01:57 PM Illinois Commerce Commission Expected to Rule on New Plan by End of 2024 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As directed by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), ComEd today submitted to the ICC a refiled multi-year grid plan that will increase access to the benefits of clean and renewable energy in alignment with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). In December of 2023, the ICC rejected ComEd’s original multi-year grid plan, requiring ComEd to file a revised grid plan in 90 days, and asking the company for a plan that includes additional focus on affordability, cost effectiveness and benefits to equity investment eligible communities (EIECs). “We heard the Commissioners’ concerns and have worked diligently these past three months to create a plan that is responsive to their feedback while positioning ComEd to help the state achieve its clean energy and equity goals,” said Gil Quiniones, ComEd President and CEO. “It also reflects a deep collaboration with stakeholders, whose engagement and partnership helped us to strengthen the plan, creating a pathway for us to support CEJA’s vision at a pace that ensures rates remain affordable for all customers.” To assemble this new multi-year grid plan, building upon earlier stakeholder and community engagement efforts, ComEd re-engaged with stakeholders to better address the issues outlined by the Commission, hosting two public meetings and a series of six stakeholder workshops in January and February of this year, as well as numerous technical and direct discussions. Based on this engagement, and in response to feedback from the Commission, ComEd has made a number of changes to the original grid plan, including: A reduction in overall investment levels and bill impacts to better ensure affordability for customers; New affordability analysis that demonstrates ComEd’s new rates under the proposed multi-year grid plan are affordable, prudent and reasonable; and Enhanced explanation of the benefit of grid investments to ComEd customers, including additional detail on cost effectiveness. As electricity plays a larger role in the daily lives of customers and communities, the need to preserve ComEd’s nation-leading reliability is critical. For the second year in a row, it was recognized by PA Consulting, which named ComEd the most reliable utility in the U.S in 2023. ComEd also achieved a historic high 2nd place ranking within the J.D. Power Midwest Large Segment for residential customer satisfaction. Following an open process in which the ICC, other public agencies, and consumer, environmental and other groups will review the plan and costs, the ICC will issue a decision in December 2024. State regulators must find all costs prudent and reasonable before including them in rates. ComEd refiled multi-year grid plan Executive Summary and Plan Chapters available here. ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state's population.

The ruling is expected by the end of 2024. What prompted ComEd to submit a refiled multi-year grid plan to the ICC? The ICC rejected ComEd's original plan in December 2023, requiring a revised plan focusing on affordability, cost effectiveness, and benefits to equity investment eligible communities. What feedback did ComEd address in the revised grid plan submission? ComEd worked on affordability, cost effectiveness, and benefits to equity investment eligible communities in response to the Commissioners' concerns. What act does the revised grid plan align with? The plan aligns with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA)."

""Talen achieved its strongest financial performance ever in 2023, with over $1.1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA and $587 million of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, along with solid operating metrics,"" said Talen President and Chief Executive Officer Mac McFarland. ""We also recently announced the sale of our 960-megawatt (MW) Cumulus data center campus to Amazon Web Services (""AWS""), unlocking significant value for Talen. This transaction provides an attractive return on our investment and vision in building Cumulus and creates value through the sale of clean carbon-free power from our top-decile Susquehanna nuclear plant."" ""Proceeds from the Cumulus Data sale were used to pay off the Orion Energy Partners (""Orion"") term loan borrowings at Cumulus Digital (""Cumulus Digital TLF""), unlocking earnings from our interest in the Nautilus operations that were previously used to service that debt. Furthermore, earnings and cash flow uplift from the AWS agreements start in 2024. Thus, we are raising our 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance ranges to include these incremental earnings,"" McFarland continued. Key Highlights For the year ended December 31, 2023, reported Adjusted EBITDA of $1.121 billion and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $587 million.For fourth quarter 2023, reported Adjusted EBITDA of $123 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $(22) million.On March 4, 2024, announced the sale of Cumulus data center campus in northeast Pennsylvania to AWS for $650 million gross proceeds (approximately $361 million net to Talen, after certain related transactions, as described further below) and long-term contracts with AWS.Raising 2024 guidance ranges for Adjusted EBITDA to $640 - $840 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to $185 - $335 million.In December 2023, reached settlement with PPL on the Talen Montana litigation and received $115 million gross proceeds.Of the previously announced $300 million share repurchase program, 225,000 shares have been repurchased to date for approximately $14 million.Summary of Financial and Operating Results (Unaudited) Three MonthsEndedDecember 31, Year Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars Unless Otherwise Stated) 2023 2023 Adjusted EBITDA $ 123 $ 1,121 Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ (22) $ 587 Total Generation (a) 7.7 TWh 32.5 TWh Carbon-Free Generation 60 % 55 % Equivalent Forced Outage Factor (""EFOF"") (b) 11.5 % 5.5 % __________________ (a) Generated MWhs sold after consumption for station use where applicable. (b) EFOF is defined as the percentage of a given period in which a generating unit is not available due to forced outages and forced deratings. Represents all generation facilities, including our portion of partially-owned facilities. Given the impacts of fresh start accounting and the implementation of the plan of reorganization on GAAP earnings in 2023, Talen believes its non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are more meaningful in evaluating its performance. Talen's management team evaluates its financial and operating results utilizing these non-GAAP measures. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Talen reported Adjusted EBITDA of $1.121 billion and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $587 million. Talen met the midpoint of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA guidance and exceeded the high end of 2023 Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance. In PJM, mild temperatures and ample gas supply drove lower market prices, but cash flows were protected by hedge program gains. The PJM segment earned Adjusted EBITDA of $1.063 billion in 2023. In ERCOT, the plants ran well during elevated periods of peak demand, especially in the summer, driving significant physical energy margin, though that was partly offset by outages and congestion costs. Together, the ERCOT and WECC segments earned Adjusted EBITDA of $109 million in 2023. Talen achieved solid operational performance and a continued emphasis on safety throughout 2023, with an OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate of 0.6 (defined as the number of recordable incidents x 200,000 / total number of manhours worked). Fleet EFOF was 5.5%, impacted by unplanned outages at our Nueces Bay and Susquehanna generation facilities. Total generation was 32.5 terawatt hours (TWh), with 55% from carbon-free nuclear generation at Susquehanna. Raising 2024 Guidance ($ in millions) Range Adjusted EBITDA $640 – $840 Adjusted Free Cash Flow $185 – $335 Talen is raising 2024 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance ranges above the amounts announced in our third quarter 2023 earnings. The increase is driven by adding earnings from the AWS agreements and our existing Nautilus operations, along with incremental expected capacity revenues from the recent PJM secondary auction for 2024/2025. The new range for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA is $640 to $840 million and the new range for Adjusted Free Cash Flow is $185 to $335 million. Data Center Campus Sale On March 1, 2024, Talen sold the physical and intangible assets of Cumulus Data, which includes a zero-carbon data center campus currently being developed adjacent to Susquehanna, to AWS for gross proceeds of $650 million, $300 million of which is to be held in escrow until the achievement of certain development milestones that are expected to be achieved in 2024. Uses of the sale proceeds include repayment of the Cumulus Digital TLF in the amount of $186 million, the purchase of Orion's approximately 5% common equity in Cumulus Digital, distributions to minority interests, and payment of transaction fees, taxes and other costs. After these uses, net proceeds to Talen are estimated to be approximately $361 million, which will be deployed in line with Talen's capital allocation and shareholder returns strategy. In connection with the sale, Talen entered into a power purchase agreement to supply up to 960 MW of long-term, carbon-free power to the data center campus from Susquehanna. Talen and AWS agreed to fixed-price power commitments that increase in 120 MW increments over several years. AWS has a one-time option to cap commitments at 480 MW. Talen also entered into a separate agreement with AWS through which we will receive additional revenue from AWS related to sales of carbon-free energy to the grid. PPL/Talen Montana Litigation Settlement In December 2023, Talen reached a litigation settlement with PPL. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, PPL paid Talen Montana $115 million in cash in exchange for a full release of Talen Montana's claims against PPL. Talen Montana paid $11 million of the settlement to the general unsecured creditors trust that was established pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, resulting in $104 million net proceeds to Talen. Update on Share Repurchase Program In October 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing Talen to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock through December 31, 2025. In January 2024, the Company repurchased 225,000 shares for approximately $14 million at a weighted average price of approximately $63/share, excluding broker fees. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Talen is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, targeting a net leverage ratio of less than 3.5x net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA, along with maintaining ample liquidity. As of March 8, 2024, Talen had total available liquidity of approximately $1 billion, comprised of $459 million of unrestricted cash and $544 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. Talen's current net leverage ratio, utilizing 2023 Adjusted EBITDA and net debt balances as of March 8, 2024, is approximately 1.6x. Update on Hedging Activities and Nuclear Fuel Supply As of February 29, 2024, Talen had hedged approximately 80% of its expected generation volumes for the balance of 2024 and approximately 32% in 2025. Talen's hedging program is a key component of the Company's comprehensive fiscal policy and supports the objective of locking in future earnings and cash flows while maintaining upside optionality. As an update on nuclear fuel supply activities, Talen has eliminated its exposure to all Russia-related counterparties. Currently, Talen's nuclear fuel cycle is 100% contracted through the 2025 fuel load and at least 80% contracted through 2028.

Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined and calculated differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the most comparable GAAP measures as indicators of performance. Generally, non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions readers of this financial information not to place undue reliance on this non-GAAP financial measure, but to also consider them along with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA We use Adjusted EBITDA to: (i) assist in comparing operating performance and readily view operating trends on a consistent basis from period to period without certain items that may distort financial results; (ii) plan and forecast overall expectations and evaluate actual results against such expectations; (iii) communicate with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts, and the broader financial community concerning our financial performance; (iv) set performance metrics for the Company's annual short-term incentive compensation; and (v) assess compliance with our indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA is computed as net income (loss) adjusted, among other things, for certain: (i) nonrecurring charges; (ii) non-recurring gains; (iii) non-cash and other items; (iv) unusual market events; (v) any depreciation, amortization, or accretion; (vi) mark-to-market gains or losses; (vii) gains and losses on the NDT; (viii) gains and losses on asset sales, dispositions, and asset retirement; (ix) impairments, obsolescence, and net realizable value charges; (x) interest expense; (xi) income taxes; (xii) legal settlements, liquidated damages, and contractual terminations; (xiii) development expenses; (xiv) Cumulus Digital and noncontrolling interests, except where otherwise noted; and (xv) other adjustments. Such adjustments are computed consistently with the provisions of our indebtedness to the extent that they can be derived from the financial records of the business. Additionally, we believe investors commonly adjust net income (loss) information to eliminate the effect of nonrecurring restructuring expenses, and other non-cash charges which vary widely from company to company, from period to period, and impair comparability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of the financial statements to evaluate our operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to such items described above. These adjustments can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting policies, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a key non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful metric utilized by our chief operating decision makers to evaluate cash flow activities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is computed by Adjusted EBITDA reduced by capital expenditures including nuclear fuel but excluding development, growth and (or) conversion capital expenditures, cash payments for interest and finance charges, cash payments for taxes (excluding income taxes paid from the nuclear facility decommissioning trust (""NDT"") and pension contributions. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to determine a company's ability to meet future obligations and to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is widely used by investors to measure a company's levered cash flow without regard to items such as ARO settlements; income taxes paid from the NDT; nonrecurring development, growth and conversion expenditures; and cash proceeds or payments for the sale or purchase of assets, which can vary substantially from company to company and period to period depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, please refer to the reconciliations at the end of this earnings release. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace ""Net Income Attributable to Stockholders (Successor) / Member (Predecessor),"" which is the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The merger is expected to increase Genius Group's 2023 pro forma revenue guidance by approximately 150% to $76 million to $80 million. Genius Group anticipates an increase in pro forma net profit guidance to $7 million to $9 million. The combined companies aim to power Sovereign AI ecosystems for entrepreneurs, enterprises, governments, and students through AI education and enablement. The 'Genius City' model will support over five million students and a fifteen thousand partner marketplace. The merger will enable the companies to offer AI-driven solutions across various sectors to SMEs, enterprises, and government institutions. The newly merged group plans to launch the Genius City model in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore to educate and impact one million students, entrepreneurs, and enterprises within each city. The merger will combine Genius Group's AI-driven Edtech platform with FatBrain AI's AI-driven peer intelligence, sector-specific SaaS solutions to create a full AI Education and Acceleration ecosystem. FatBrain AI's CEO, Peter Ritz, and Chairman, Michael Moe, will join Genius Group's Board. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The merger between Genius Group and FatBrain AI represents a strategic consolidation within the edtech and AI sectors, aiming to capitalize on the growing demand for AI education and peer intelligence solutions. This move is particularly significant as it highlights a trend towards creating more comprehensive, end-to-end solutions that cater to a wide array of stakeholders, from students to governments.From a market perspective, the anticipated revenue and net profit increases for Genius Group post-merger suggest confidence in the synergy between the companies' offerings. The focus on 'Genius City' models aligns with global initiatives to invest in AI and technology-driven education, indicating a potential for substantial market growth. However, investors should monitor the execution of the merger's integration plan and the actual market adoption of the 'Genius City' concept.The merger's impact on the stock market will depend on the combined entity's ability to meet or exceed the projected financial targets and to scale the 'Genius City' model effectively. The educational technology sector is competitive and the success of this merger will hinge on the differentiated value provided through their combined AI-driven platforms. Financial Analyst An analysis of the financial implications of the merger reveals an ambitious increase in pro forma revenue guidance by approximately 150% and net profit guidance by $4 million. Such projections are aggressive and suggest that the management has high expectations for cost synergies and revenue growth post-merger. However, investors should approach these figures with caution, as the actual financial performance will depend on the successful integration of FatBrain AI's assets and customer base into Genius Group's operations.Furthermore, the all-stock transaction structure indicates that Genius Group is leveraging its stock as currency for growth, which is a common strategy in the tech industry. This can be beneficial for preserving cash but also dilutes existing shareholders. The long-term value creation for shareholders will therefore be contingent upon the merged entity's ability to innovate and capture significant market share in the burgeoning AI education sector. Educational Technology Expert The 'Genius City' model presents an innovative approach to integrating AI and edtech to foster upskilling and economic growth. The merger's focus on creating AI ecosystems for education and acceleration is timely, as there is a global push towards developing smart cities and sovereign AI. The commitment to educate and impact a large number of students and professionals aligns with the increasing need for AI literacy in the workforce.However, the success of this initiative will largely depend on the quality and relevance of the educational content, the efficacy of the AI-driven platforms in delivering personalized learning experiences and the ability to form meaningful partnerships with governments and enterprises. While the initiative is promising, the actual impact on the education sector and the broader economy will be measured by the adoption rates and the tangible outcomes for the learners and institutions involved. 03/14/2024 - 02:10 PM SINGAPORE, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genius Group Limited (NYSE American: GNS) (“Genius Group” or the “Company”), a leading entrepreneur edtech and education group, and FatBrain AI (“FatBrain AI”) an AI SaaS and Solutions company (OTCMKTS:LZGI) today announced completion of their merger to form an AI-powered Education and Acceleration group to power Sovereign AI ecosystems of tomorrow for entrepreneurs, enterprises, governments and students through AI education and enablement.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The extended collaboration between GE HealthCare and Hartford HealthCare represents a strategic investment into cutting-edge medical imaging technology and could signal a broader trend within the healthcare industry towards prioritizing technological innovation to improve patient outcomes. This partnership is likely to enhance Hartford HealthCare's competitive position by providing access to state-of-the-art equipment and software, potentially attracting more patients and healthcare professionals looking for advanced diagnostic capabilities.From a market perspective, the agreement may result in increased sales and market penetration for GE HealthCare, as the commitment to regular upgrades and maintenance could lead to recurring revenue streams. This long-term service agreement could be a model for other healthcare providers, potentially leading to similar deals that could boost GE HealthCare's financial performance over time. Medical Technology Analyst The integration of advanced AI and machine learning software in medical imaging equipment, as described in the collaboration, is a significant step in the evolution of diagnostic medicine. Technologies like the Critical Care Suite 2.0, Deep Learning Image Reconstruction and AIR™ Recon DL represent substantial advancements in the field, offering the potential for more accurate diagnoses and improved patient care.For investors and stakeholders in the medical technology sector, this collaboration underscores the importance of continuous innovation and the adoption of AI in healthcare. The emphasis on reducing scan times and improving diagnostic accuracy through these technologies could set new industry standards and drive demand for GE HealthCare's products, potentially impacting its stock market performance positively. Healthcare Economist The emphasis on decreasing the total cost of care while increasing access to innovation is a critical aspect of the Care Alliance. By streamlining the acquisition, deployment and redeployment of imaging technology, Hartford HealthCare could achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies. These efficiencies may translate into lower healthcare costs for patients and payers, aligning with broader economic goals of sustainable healthcare spending.Additionally, in-house maintenance by GE HealthCare technicians and the focus on minimizing technology obsolescence could reduce long-term operational costs for Hartford HealthCare. This approach to managing healthcare technology lifecycle costs can be an essential consideration for healthcare systems aiming to balance financial sustainability with high-quality patient care. 03/14/2024 - 01:30 PM The Care Alliance agreement features a systematic approach focused on innovation, patient and staff experience, and imaging advancements through 2030 HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC), a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and digital solutions innovator, and Connecticut-based Hartford HealthCare today announced that they have renewed a seven-year collaboration that began in 2016 to now extend through 2030, aiming to advance the healthcare system’s mission to provide personalized coordinated quality care. The Care Alliance strives to assist Hartford HealthCare in increasing access to innovation while decreasing the total cost of care for patients. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240314488911/en/ Hartford HealthCare will upgrade its imaging technology using a phased approach to the acquisition, deployment and redeployment of essential equipment like CT, PET/CT, MRI, X-ray, nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound and OEC 3D surgical imaging C-arm, keeping Hartford HealthCare’s imaging technologies current with the latest advancements in software, artificial intelligence and future innovations. The collaboration will increase patients’ access to GE HealthCare’s most current imaging technology, and may provide shorter scan times, reduced waiting times for care, and enable clinicians to have greater accuracy in diagnostic assessments. The agreement also includes GE HealthCare patient monitoring, anesthesia, maternal infant care and diagnostic cardiology technologies. “Our ongoing collaboration with GE HealthCare will allow Hartford HealthCare to provide exceptional imaging services, continually upgrading our technology so patients and clinicians across our system can be confident in having access to the most up-to-date capabilities,” said Karen Goyette, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer. “This is especially important now, as technologies, equipment and training are advancing at an ever-increasing pace.” GE HealthCare’s initial engagement with HHC led to the creation of the system’s Care Logistics Center in 2017. “The center allows us to match patients’ needs with the best care we can provide, quickly and expertly,” Goyette added. “We are looking forward to continued advances that benefit our patients and clinicians through this new collaboration.” Many of the new imaging systems in the collaborative effort will include tested AI and machine learning software, which will augment clinical expertise. For example, Critical Care Suite 2.0 is a software solution designed to assist clinicians in the intensive care unit by providing AI-powered insights and analytics to analyze medical images and detect potential critical conditions in real-time, such as collapsed lungs or errors in chest x-ray acquisitions1 2. By integrating seamlessly with existing systems, the Critical Care Suite 2.0 is designed to help expedite diagnosis, optimize treatment decisions, and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, Deep Learning Image Reconstruction is the next generation image reconstruction option that uses a dedicated Deep Neural Network to generate TrueFidelity CT Images, which have the potential to improve reading confidence in a wide range of clinical applications such as head, whole body and cardiovascular, for patients of all ages. As a third example, AIR™ Recon DL employs AI to enhance image reconstruction, using deep learning algorithms to improve the quality and speed of MRI scans. By optimizing image reconstruction, AIR™ Recon DL reduces artifacts, enhances image clarity, and enables shorter scan times3. It enables healthcare providers to obtain high-quality diagnostic images while improving patient comfort and workflow efficiency. “This strategic Care Alliance builds upon a successful first seven years and incorporates new elements that will help Hartford HealthCare stay current with our latest GE HealthCare technology as it continues to evolve, minimizing technology obsolescence and optimizing clinical capabilities now and in the future,” said Catherine Estrampes, president and CEO, U.S. and Canada at GE HealthCare. “We have seen many changes to the needs of healthcare over the last several years and collaborations like this enable us to work together with patient access and care, as well as clinician experience front of mind. It enables us to keep innovating together while continuing to explore additional potential opportunities.” Under the renewed service agreement, GE HealthCare technicians will be available in-house to repair and complete maintenance on all equipment within the scope of the collaboration. Additionally, regular upgrades to equipment will help ensure Hartford HealthCare’s fleet of imaging technology is optimized with the most innovative technology and tools available. The collaborative relationship with facilities, operations, clinical engineering and GE HealthCare’s project management and service teams will continue the holistic framework for maximizing the performance and longevity of Hartford HealthCare’s equipment with a focus on patient safety. GE HealthCare and Hartford HealthCare will also execute build-in-place upgrades with some existing MRI, CT, PET/CT, and X-rays to refresh older systems with fewer construction costs and while minimizing waste, equipment downtime, and disruption to patient care.

The transaction received strong investor demand with a blended interest rate of 5.48%, lower than previous transactions. Positive Completion of a $430 million securitization of vacation ownership loans Blended interest rate of 5.48%, lower than previous transactions Strong investor demand for the transaction Backed by a pool of approximately $439 million of vacation ownership loans from various timeshare brands Issuance of three classes of notes by the Issuer Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a $430 million securitization of vacation ownership loans by Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation represents a significant financial maneuver that could influence the company's liquidity and debt profile. The securitization process involves the creation of asset-backed securities by pooling various loans and selling them to investors, thereby providing the company with immediate capital. The blended interest rate of 5.48% indicates the average cost of borrowing through this securitization, which is notably lower than the previous transaction's rate by approximately 100 basis points, suggesting improved market conditions or investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness.The use of proceeds to pay down outstanding credit facility obligations could improve the company's leverage ratios and potentially lower future interest expenses. However, investors should be aware that securitization also entails risks, such as interest rate fluctuations and the quality of the underlying loans. The high gross advance rate of 98% reflects strong collateral backing but also implies a minimal retention of risk by the issuer, which may affect the recovery rate in case of defaults. Market Research Analyst Marriott Vacations Worldwide's strategy to securitize vacation ownership loans is indicative of the broader trend in the hospitality and timeshare industry towards leveraging financial instruments to manage liquidity. This transaction, particularly due to the scale of $430 million, can have a ripple effect on the industry's financing practices. The strong investor demand highlighted by the company's CFO points to a robust appetite for such securities, which could encourage other players in the market to consider similar financial structures.Given the competitive landscape of the timeshare industry, the ability to efficiently raise capital can provide a strategic advantage. The successful placement of Class A, B and C notes with varying interest rates demonstrates a tiered approach to risk management and could serve as a benchmark for future securitizations within the sector. The impact on the company's stock could be positive if the market perceives this transaction as a sign of financial prudence and strategic capital allocation. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this securitization is crucial for understanding its implications. The offering was conducted under Rule 144A and Regulation S, which govern the resale of securities to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, respectively. This suggests a targeted approach to investor outreach, ensuring compliance with securities regulations while potentially limiting the investor base to those who meet specific criteria.Furthermore, the fact that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, indicates that they are subject to certain restrictions on transferability. This could influence the liquidity of the notes in the secondary market. Investors should be aware of these legal nuances, as they can affect the ease with which one can divest from these securities. The absence of a public offering also underscores the importance of due diligence for potential investors, given the reduced disclosure requirements compared to registered securities. 03/14/2024 - 12:47 PM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: VAC) (“MVW” or the “Company”) announced today the completion of a $430 million securitization of vacation ownership loans, offered to qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued by MVW 2024-1 LLC (the “Issuer”). The notes have a blended interest rate of 5.48% and the gross advance rate was 98%. “We are pleased with the strong investor demand this transaction received, with a blended interest rate approximately 100 basis points below our November 2023 transaction,” said Jason Marino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The transaction was backed by a pool of approximately $439 million of vacation ownership loans from a variety of the Company’s timeshare brands. Three classes of notes were issued by the Issuer, comprising approximately $284 million of Class A Notes, approximately $89 million of Class B Notes, and approximately $57 million of Class C Notes. The Class A Notes have an interest rate of 5.32%, the Class B Notes have an interest rate of 5.51%, and the Class C Notes have an interest rate of 6.20%. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the 2024-1 securitization, net of fees, to pay down outstanding credit facility obligations and for other general corporate purposes. Important Notice This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities law. Unless so registered, the notes may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

Roper Technologies announces dividend,2024-03-14T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) declares a dividend of $0.75 per share, set to be paid on April 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 5, 2024.","Roper Technologies announces dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) declares a dividend of $0.75 per share, set to be paid on April 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend by Roper Technologies represents a direct financial action that impacts shareholder value. Dividends are a portion of a company's earnings returned to shareholders as a reward for their investment. The amount of $0.75 per share indicates the company's current profitability and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to support such distributions. Investors often view regular and consistent dividend payments as a sign of a company's financial health and stability.Moreover, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock price, is a key metric for income-focused investors. This announcement could potentially influence the stock's attractiveness to such investors, depending on how the yield compares to industry standards and fixed-income alternatives. It is also indicative of management's confidence in the company's ongoing cash flows and long-term earnings potential. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements can also have broader implications for market perception and the company's competitive positioning. In the case of Roper Technologies, a dividend payment may signal to the market that the company is prioritizing shareholder returns, which could be interpreted positively by the market. However, it's also crucial to evaluate this in the context of the company's capital allocation strategy. For example, if the company is choosing to pay dividends over reinvesting in growth opportunities or paying down debt, it could impact long-term growth prospects.It's important to analyze how this dividend compares to previous payouts and the payouts of competitors within the industrial sector and broader market. An increase in the dividend amount could suggest that the company is outperforming its peers or is expecting strong future performance, while a decrease or stagnation might raise concerns about its growth trajectory. Economist From an economic standpoint, dividend payments can reflect broader economic conditions. A company's ability to pay dividends consistently might be supported by a favorable economic environment, characterized by low interest rates and steady economic growth, which facilitates business operations and consumer spending. Conversely, during times of economic uncertainty or downturns, companies might reduce or suspend dividend payments to conserve cash.Therefore, Roper Technologies' dividend announcement could be seen as an economic indicator. If many companies within the sector or the market as a whole are maintaining or increasing their dividends, it could suggest overall economic stability or growth. Conversely, if dividend cuts are more common, it might indicate economic headwinds or a potential downturn. 03/14/2024 - 01:00 PM SARASOTA, Fla., March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roper Technologies, Inc.

The company's environmentally friendly solution reduces carbon footprint by up to 83% and costs by up to 80% compared to traditional processes. With a new facility starting production in Q2 2024 and a $30 million offtake customer agreement with Toyoda, Graphjet is poised for significant growth. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Technology Analyst The innovative production method employed by Graphjet represents a significant advancement in the materials sector, particularly in the production of graphite and graphene. The claim of an 83% reduction in carbon footprint and a 80% reduction in production costs compared to traditional methods could have profound implications for the industry. Environmentally conscious production processes are increasingly important in the global market, especially given the growing emphasis on sustainability and the transition to greener technologies.Graphjet's approach could set a new standard for environmental responsibility within the industry. By leveraging agricultural waste, the company is not only reducing the environmental impact but also potentially addressing waste management issues. This circular economy model could serve as a blueprint for other companies seeking to minimize their ecological footprint while maintaining competitiveness. The potential for cost savings is also significant, as it could enable Graphjet to offer competitive pricing and disrupt the market currently dominated by traditional graphite producers. Market Analyst The strategic positioning of Graphjet in the market, especially in the context of the U.S. seeking to reduce its reliance on foreign sources of graphite, is noteworthy. With China controlling a dominant share of graphite production, Graphjet's entry into the market offers a valuable alternative source. This is particularly relevant as graphite is a critical component for the EV (Electric Vehicle) and battery storage industries, sectors that are expected to see substantial growth in the coming years.The announced $30 million offtake agreement with Toyoda is a testament to the commercial viability and industry confidence in Graphjet's technology. This agreement could potentially signal to other industry players and investors that Graphjet's product meets the necessary quality and cost requirements. The anticipated need for additional fundraising suggests that while the company has secured a solid financial base, it may seek further investment to scale operations and meet growing market demand. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the successful business combination with Energem Corp and the subsequent Nasdaq listing under the ticker symbol 'GTI' marks a pivotal point for Graphjet. The capital raised through this transaction, amounting to $5.8 million, enhances the company's financial stability and provides the means to pursue expansion plans. However, the mention of anticipated additional fundraising indicates that the current capital may not suffice for the long-term growth strategy.The transition of Graphjet's warrants from Nasdaq to the OTC market could appeal to a different investor base and may reflect a strategic move to differentiate the types of securities offered to investors. As the company prepares for production in Q2 2024, the financial markets will likely monitor Graphjet's progress closely, especially given the current competitive landscape and the strategic importance of the materials it produces. 03/14/2024 - 12:37 PM Graphjet, utilizing its proven, commercial and patented technologies to sustainably produce graphite from agricultural waste, becomes the leading source of graphite and graphene for the U.S. market Graphjet’s vertically integrated environmentally friendly solution provides up to an 83% reduction in carbon footprint and up to an 80% reduction in cost compared to traditional processes Graphjet is well positioned for growth, with a new facility beginning production in Q2 2024, to support a $30 million offtake customer agreement with Toyoda KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, March 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Graphjet Technology (“Graphjet” or “the Company”), a leading developer of patented technologies to produce graphite and graphene directly from agricultural waste, and Energem Corp. (“Energem”) (Nasdaq: ENCP, ENCPW) today announced they have closed their previously announced business combination (“the Business Combination”). The transaction, which was approved on February 28, 2024, by Energem stockholders, creates the only pure-play publicly traded direct biomass-to-graphite company, establishing the Company as the leading source of graphite and graphene for the U.S market. Beginning tomorrow, March 15, 2024, Graphjet’s ordinary shares will start trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “GTI.” Graphjet’s warrants will be delisted from Nasdaq and begin trading on the OTC market under the symbol “GTIWW” on March 15, 2024. Graphjet’s CEO, Lee Ping Wei (Aiden Lee), and the rest of the Company’s current management team are expected to remain in leadership positions. “We are thrilled to list Graphjet on the Nasdaq, particularly at this crucial moment of critical material demand and limited availability for the U.S. market,” said Mr. Lee. “With China dominating more than 97% of all graphite production, we look forward to becoming the leading supplier to the U.S. market to support its burgeoning battery storage and EV industries. Our patented technologies are capable of producing graphite and graphene directly from agricultural waste, which fills a critical supply need for these highly strategic materials, as demand is expected to continue to accelerate over the next several years. Compared to incumbent players, Graphjet’s proven, commercial and patented vertically integrated technologies and process cuts the carbon footprint by 83% while reducing costs by 80%. We are poised to pursue high-value applications for our technologies across a multitude of sectors that can leverage our sustainably produced graphite and graphene from biomass waste to help create a more circular economy.” Graphjet has raised $5.8 million through the transaction and anticipates that additional fundraising will be necessary to accelerate its growth strategy and expand its manufacturing capacity. These funds will enhance the Company’s financial flexibility as well as its ability to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities. “Now, more than ever, we are well-positioned to execute on our growth strategy to become a top producer of graphite and graphene,” continued Mr. Lee. “On the heels of China’s decision to restrict exports on graphite, we continue to engage in advanced conversations with customers. Further, based on our optimism about market demand, we continue to explore opportunities to deploy our technology, at scale, in North America.” “As we noted when the transaction was announced, Graphjet not only produces high-demand materials in a growing market, but does so by utilizing a commonly available waste product in Malaysia,” said Swee Guan Hoo, CEO and Director of Energem. “We are excited that Graphjet and its team have reached this stage and believe they are ready to accelerate their market position as a public company.” Doris Wong Sing EE, Executive Director of Energem Corp, added, “Graphene and its applied products exhibit tremendous application potential in biomedical technologies, energy storage, composites and coatings, and water and wastewater treatment industries. We believe Graphjet’s breakthrough patented technology that transforms a renewable waste product to the highly valued artificial graphene and artificial graphite will allow Graphjet deliver shareholder value, and we are looking forward to seeing what they can accomplish in this new phase of the company’s existence.” Advisors ARC Group Limited acted as sole financial advisor, EF Hutton LLC served as Capital Markets Advisor to Energem, and Ogier (Cayman) LLP acted as Cayman Islands counsel. Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP is acting as legal counsel to Graphjet Technology. Rimon P.C. served as U.S. counsel to Energem in its initial public offering and as legal counsel to Energem in the business combination.

Despite a decrease in consolidated sales revenue, the company saw an increase in net income and income from operations compared to the previous year. FutureFuel's strategy focuses on operational excellence, reliability, and new product growth in the chemicals segment. Positive FutureFuel reports a net income of $37.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The company declares a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share and a $25 million share repurchase program. Despite a decrease in consolidated sales revenue, FutureFuel sees an increase in net income and income from operations compared to the previous year. The company's strategy emphasizes operational excellence, reliability, and new product growth in the chemicals segment. Negative Consolidated sales revenue decreased in 2023 compared to 2022. FutureFuel's biofuel segment experienced lower average sales prices in 2023. The company's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 showed a decrease in adjusted EBITDA compared to the same period in 2022. Financial Analyst The announcement from FutureFuel Corp. regarding its financial outcomes, including a significant increase in net income to $37.4 million, a special cash dividend and a share repurchase program, signals a robust financial position and operational efficiency. The substantial rise in net income by 146% year-over-year, despite a 7% decline in revenues, indicates a successful strategy in cost management and margin improvement. The special dividend of $2.50 per share and the share repurchase program of $25 million underscore the company's commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in its liquidity position, as evidenced by the increase in cash and cash equivalents to $219,444.From a financial perspective, these actions can be seen as a move to optimize capital allocation and potentially enhance earnings per share through the reduction of shares outstanding. It is also indicative of management's belief that the stock may be undervalued, hence the repurchase program. However, investors should consider the sustainability of such returns and whether these capital distribution strategies might affect the company's ability to invest in future growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The performance of FutureFuel's biodiesel and chemicals segments, as reflected in the financial results, demonstrates resilience in the face of market challenges such as dampened demand in mature segments. The record production volume of biodiesel aligns with the global trend towards renewable energy sources and may position FutureFuel favorably in the market. The company's focus on operational excellence and risk management, particularly in securing feedstock supplies and managing price volatility through futures contracts, has evidently paid off in maintaining strong margins.The strategic emphasis on growing new products within the chemical segment suggests an adaptive approach to market dynamics and customer needs. Investors may find the company's multi-market strategy and innovation focus a positive indicator for long-term growth and diversification of revenue streams. Commodities Expert FutureFuel's strategic maneuvers in the biodiesel segment, including the use of derivative instruments like heating oil futures, have been effective in safeguarding margins against the volatility of oil markets. The company's ability to manage its inventory levels and optimize the timing of sales for biodiesel and Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) is a testament to its adept handling of commodities trading.The disclosed inventory of RINs, which increased in fair market value year-over-year, represents a significant asset that can be monetized based on market conditions. This strategic inventory management, coupled with the reported gains from derivatives, suggests a sophisticated approach to commodities risk management that has likely contributed to the company's financial success.

Adjusted EBITDA in both years excludes the impact from unrealized gains or losses on derivatives. Realized gains and losses are included in Adjusted EBITDA in both 2022 and 2023. Financial Results Q4 2023 versus Q4 2022 Consolidated sales revenue decreased 22% or $25,807 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 primarily from lower average sales prices in the biofuel segment $25,819 and, to a lesser extent, in the chemical segment $1,433. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales volumes in the chemical segment $1,633. Income from operations increased $8,625 in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period of 2022. This comparative increase was primarily attributable to improved margins in both the biofuel and chemical segments inclusive of (i) the change in the unrealized activity of derivative instruments in comparison to the prior year quarter with a gain of $5,401 as compared to a loss of $2,709 and (ii) the benefit from the change in adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of inventory accounting which increased gross profit $4,311 in the current quarter and decreased gross profit $5,252 in the prior year quarter. Financial Results 2023 versus 2022 Consolidated sales revenue decreased 7% or $27,764 in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily from lower average sales prices in the biofuel segment $71,198 and, to a lesser extent, in the chemical segment $1,916. This decrease was partially offset by higher biodiesel sales volumes in the biofuel segment $44,994. Income from operations increased $9,822 as compared to 2022. This comparative increase was primarily attributable to improved margins in both the biofuel and chemical segments inclusive of (i) the change in the realized activity of derivative instruments in comparison to the prior year with a gain of $694 as compared to a loss of $24,703 in the prior year; the prior year loss included an unfavorable impact of volatility in the NYMEX heating oil futures market of $10,500 and (ii) the change in the unrealized activity of derivative instruments in comparison to the prior year with a gain of $1,878 in the current year and a gain of $343 in the prior year. Also contributing to this improved margin was the benefit from the change in adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting which increased gross profit $10,334 in 2023 and decreased gross profit $3,944 in 2022 (net of a liquidation of $1,850 from exiting the pipeline business). In our Biodiesel segment, our strategy is to secure ample supplies of feedstock when margins are attractive and then commit to sales of biodiesel and RINs to further secure those margins. This begins with building feedstock in the early part of the year and holding inventories of biodiesel and RINs until we can realize their optimum sales value later in the year. To protect those margins against price volatility in the oil markets, we use heating oil futures to counteract those movements. When the prices of those futures contracts fluctuate, it can result in significant changes in the value of the unrealized derivatives position that we report in our quarterly earnings. However, at the end of the year, when inventories of feedstock and biodiesel are lower, that effect is less pronounced. It is worth noting that even with this strong performance, as of December 31, 2023, we still hold 4.3 million of RINs in inventory at no cost with a fair market value of $6,567. For comparison, at December 31, 2022, we held 1.5 million of RINs in inventory at no cost with a fair market value of $2,557. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $6,022 in 2023, compared with $4,778 in the same period in 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents increased to $219,444 as of December 31, 2023. All marketable securities were sold during 2023 and the proceeds were moved to interest bearing accounts. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $175,640 and marketable securities were $37,126, for a total of $212,766. Share Repurchase Program FutureFuel also adopted a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of common stock expiring March 12, 2026. The program could be suspended or discontinued at any time, based on market, economic, or business conditions. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors.

Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements deal with FutureFuel’s current plans, intentions, beliefs, and expectations, and statements of future economic performance. Statements containing such terms as “believe,” “do not believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time-to-time FutureFuel or its representatives have made or will make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings that the company makes with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in press releases, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of FutureFuel’s authorized executive officers. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in FutureFuel’s Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in its future filings made with the SEC. An investor should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this document, which reflect FutureFuel management’s opinions only as of their respective dates. Except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described in this document and in current and future filings with the SEC are not the only ones faced by FutureFuel. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the company to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial to its business. In addition, FutureFuel cannot assess the impact of each factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, FutureFuel’s business, operating results, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. An investor should consult any additional disclosures FutureFuel has made or will make in its reports to the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and any amendments thereto. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to FutureFuel or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this document. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, FutureFuel used adjusted EBITDA as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities (each as determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. FutureFuel defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, non-cash share-based compensation expense, public offering expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of property and equipment, non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments, and other non-operating income or expense. Information relating to adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same data that management employs in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of FutureFuel’s business. FutureFuel’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies; therefore, the results of its calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows FutureFuel’s chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of FutureFuel’s business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of its operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures, and to pay dividends. In particular, FutureFuel management believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of FutureFuel’s operating performance and liquidity, relative to a performance and liquidity based on GAAP results, while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary among its operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance, and of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among similar companies, and non-cash gains and losses on derivative instruments, whose immediate recognition can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel. A table included in this earnings release reconciles adjusted EBITDA with net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance financial measure, and a table reconciles adjusted EBITDA with cash flows from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP liquidity financial measure.
