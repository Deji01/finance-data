(OTCMKTS:DLOC), the developer of Satenna™, a breakthrough technology that will deliver high-speed Internet from satellites directly to smartphones all over the world, today announced its endorsement of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposal to regulate supplemental Internet coverage from space. “Welcome to the party,” said Rich Berliner, CEO of Digital Locations. “The FCC has finally taken notice of the groundwork laid by space communications pioneers, such as Elon Musk’s Starlink, Jeff Bezos’ Project Kuiper, Globalstar and Digital Locations. We endorse the recent FCC proposal to regulate supplemental Internet coverage from space.” The FCC finally has its eyes set on space and satellite communications. On February 22, the FCC issued a 160-page report and order that would establish a domestic regulatory framework to enable collaborations between satellite operators and terrestrial service providers to offer ubiquitous connectivity, directly to consumer handsets using spectrum previously allocated only to terrestrial service. With an upcoming vote, the FCC will begin to lay the groundwork for needed rules and regulations for the growing satellite Internet business. The FCC wants to establish clear and transparent processes to support supplemental Internet coverage from space. Connecting consumers to essential wireless services where traditional terrestrial mobile service is not available can be lifesaving in remote locations and can open innovative opportunities for consumers and businesses, according to the FCC. “I believe that we have a head start over other players in this space,” Mr. Berliner continued. “Working with our technology team at Florida International University (FIU), we are developing a solution that only requires modifications on the smartphone side. This breakthrough can potentially eliminate the need to make costly and time-consuming modifications to existing, as well as future satellites.” Mr. Berliner concluded, “This is a major breakthrough. Initially we envision Satenna™ in a test phase as an add-on to existing phones. However, if our technology were included in a future version of an Apple iPhone or a Samsung phone, then a user of one of these smartphones of the future could instantly connect to a satellite system offering high-speed Internet service. With total satellite coverage from the sky, the days are numbered for dead zones, dropped calls and slow data.” About Digital Locations, Inc. Digital Locations, Inc., is the developer of Satenna™, a breakthrough technology that will deliver high-speed Internet from satellites directly to smartphones all over the world. Today, high-speed Internet (also known as broadband Internet) is only available in densely populated areas around the world. The rest of the world is still waiting. Elon Musk (SpaceX), Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin), and others are launching thousands of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Unfortunately, without the use of additional equipment, the technology does not yet exist that will allow these satellites to deliver high-speed Internet directly to smartphones. Solving this problem represents an extraordinary business opportunity. Working with a research team from Florida International University, we are developing a truly disruptive technology that will finally make it possible for the wireless industry to offer high-speed Internet service from satellites directly to smartphones anywhere in the world, indoors and outdoors with no dead zones and no cell towers. Anyone, anywhere, regardless of location, economic status, race, or gender will be able to access high-speed Internet service and benefit from remote learning, health care, government services, telework, participation in public affairs, and even Netflix, Amazon, and much, much more.

[TSX.V:CERT][OTCQX:CRDOF] (""Cerrado"" or the ""Company"") announces that it has entered into an option agreement with Amarillo Mineração do Brasil Ltda. (""Amarillo"") a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hochschild Mining PLC (""Hochschild""), whereby Cerrado has granted to Amarillo the option (""Option"") to purchase a 100% interest in the Company's Monte Do Carmo project (""MDC Project"") located in the State of Tocantins, Brazil (the ""Proposed Transaction""), for total consideration of US$60 million (approximately C$80 million) (the ""Purchase Price""), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.The Purchase Price would be payable in the following stages:US$15 million, initially advanced by way of a 10% interest-bearing secured loan (the ""Signing Loan""), of which US$7 million has been advanced as of the date of the grant of the Option (March 4, 2024), US$1 million may be advanced within 60 days, and the balance of US$7 million may be advanced two days following the mailing by Cerrado to its shareholders of a notice of meeting and management information circular in connection with a meeting to approve the Proposed Transaction to be held by June 30, 2024 (the ""Cerrado Shareholder Approval""). Upon the Cerrado Shareholder Approval being obtained, the Signing Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and expenses relating thereto, shall be deemed to be repaid in full by Cerrado by the concurrent set off of an amount equal to the Signing Loan due by Amarillo as part of the Purchase Price. If Cerrado fails to secure the Cerrado Shareholder Approval on or before June 30, 2024, the Signing Loan will mature on September 30, 2024.An aggregate of US$45 million, payable in four installments over the next three years, approximately, as further described below.During the Option Period (as defined below) Amarillo will take operational control of the MDC Project and has committed to spending a minimum of US$5m in qualifying expenditures.Mark Brennan, CEO and Chairman commented: ""The Proposed Transaction improves Cerrado's immediate short-term capital position and addresses short-term working capital needs while injecting development capital into the Minera Don Nicolas project. Going forward, Cerrado will be well capitalized with a strong gold production profile and leaves the Company positioned to pursue growth programs at our operating Minera Don Nicolas gold mine and our Mont Sorcier high grade iron project.""He added, ""In just five years at MDC, the Cerrado team has defined a proven mineral reserve of approximately 1 million ounces of gold, has completed a robust Feasibility Study, is in the final stages of permitting approval, and has attracted strong capital partners for the majority of a potential project debt construction funding. Despite the achievement of these significant milestones, the Company has been unable to raise the funds necessary to reach the final investment decision for construction. The lack of liquidity and capital available to junior mining companies over the last six to nine months has been unprecedented. It is important to thank the dedicated team at the MDC Project for having done such a tremendous job bringing the MDC Project to its current state of readiness in such an expedited timeframe.""Transaction Summary and DetailsAmarillo has agreed to advance the Signing Loan to Cerrado in cash as follows:US$7 million has been advanced by Amarillo (the ""First Advance"") on the date of the grant of the Option (March 4, 2024);US$1 million to be advanced 60 days after the date of the First Advance; andUS$7 million to be advanced within two days following the mailing to Cerrado shareholders of the management information circular to be prepared in connection with the meeting of Cerrado shareholders at which management would seek the Cerrado Shareholder Approval on or before June 30, 2024.Upon obtaining the Cerrado Shareholder Approval, the Signing Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and expenses relating thereto, shall be deemed to be repaid in full by Cerrado by the concurrent set off of an amount equal to the Signing Loan due by Amarillo as part of the Purchase Price. If Cerrado fails to secure the Cerrado Shareholder Approval on or before June 30, 2024, the Signing Loan will mature on September 30, 2024, at which time Cerrado will be obliged to: (i) repay the Signing Loan and other expenses (and any interest accrued thereon) no later than September 30, 2024; (ii) reimburse Amarillo for any costs incurred on the MDC Project between the date of signing of the Option Agreement (as defined below) and the date of termination of the Option Agreement; and (iii) pay to Amarillo a break fee in the amount of US$2.5 million.Amarillo may exercise the Option at its sole discretion at any time during the Option Period by providing an exercise notice to Cerrado, following which an aggregate amount of US$30 million would be payable to Cerrado prior to the closing of the Proposed Transaction in cash as follows:US$10 million (the ""Second Payment"") in cash, payable within 5 days of the date on which Amarillo gives written notice of its exercise of the Option to Cerrado, which option expires on March 19, 2025.US$20 million (the ""Third Payment"", and, together with the Signing Loan and the Second Payment, the ""Consideration"") in cash payable upon either: (i) if necessary, the approval of the Proposed Transaction by Hochschild shareholders, which is to occur no later than June 30, 2025; or (ii) if Hochschild shareholder approval is not required, by no later than March 30, 2025.In addition, Amarillo will make the following additional payments following the closing of the Proposed Transaction:US$10 million in cash payable within 14 days of the second anniversary of the date of the Cerrado Shareholder Approval (the ""Second Anniversary Payment""); andUS$5 million in cash payable within 14 days of the earlier of: (i) the commencement of commercial production from the MDC Project; and (ii) March 31, 2027 (the ""Production Payment"").The option agreement (""Option Agreement"") was entered into among Cerrado, Serra Alta Mineração Ltda., the Company's subsidiary in Brazil which holds the MDC Project, Amarillo, and Hochschild, in its capacity as guarantor of Amarillo's obligations under the Option and Loan Agreements. A loan agreement (the ""Loan Agreement"") was entered into by Cerrado and Amarillo, pursuant to which Amarillo has made certain credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of US$15 million available to Cerrado in connection with the Signing Loan.The closing of the Proposed Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including: (i) the exercise of the Option by Amarillo; (ii) the payment by Amarillo of the full Consideration; (iii) the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange; (iv) the approval of the shareholders of Cerrado; and (v) satisfaction of other closing conditions customary in a transaction of this nature.All amounts owing by Cerrado to, or advanced to Cerrado by, the Company or Amarillo, are secured by (i) a first lien on all of the outstanding equity interests (quotas) in Serra Alto, and (ii) a second lien on the assets relating to the MDC Project (the ""Security""), until termination of the Option Period (defined below). The security is subject to a security sharing agreement with another secured creditor.The Option will expire upon the earlier of (the period starting on the date of the Option Agreement and ending upon such expiry being the ""Option Period"") (i) March 19, 2025, (ii) the exercise of the Option and completion of the Proposed Transaction, and (iii) the termination of the Option Agreement. The Option may be exercised at Amarillo's sole discretion at any time during the Option Period, provided that all required payments have been paid by Amarillo. Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Amarillo is intended to assume operational control of the MDC Project from the date of the Option Agreement until the expiry of the Option Period, and Amarillo has agreed to incur exploration and other qualified expenditures on the MDC Project totaling no less than US$5 million during the Option Period.The Proposed Transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Cerrado. The Company's Board of Directors, senior officers and principal shareholder, collectively owning approximately 23.6% of the outstanding common shares of the Company have entered into voting and support agreements to support the Proposed Transaction.Background to the Proposed TransactionThe Proposed Transaction is the culmination of a prolonged capital-raising process initiated by management in the summer of 2023 in order to explore all possible funding alternatives to address the working-capital needs of the Company and fund the development of the MDC Project. During the second half of 2023, Cerrado undertook several formal attempts to raise equity capital with independent investment banks, and has pursued debt, alternative debt, private equity and strategic partnership alternatives to provide capital for the development of the MDC Project.Despite the Company filing an extremely robust Feasibility Study positioning the MDC Project as potentially one of the world's lowest-cost producers of gold, with a strong after-tax NPV and IRR, low initial capital requirement, and the sponsorship of strong project debt finance partners, the Company has been unable to attract sufficient capital to meet both the obligations or continue development of the MDC Project, as well as funding the change in working capital position in its Argentinian operations (described below) due to the lack of global liquidity for junior mining companies and development stage projects.With regards to the Company's Argentina operations, fiscal policy changes implemented in the country following the November 2023 general election, have imposed a significant financial burden to the Minera Don Nicolás (""MDN"") operation, adding further strain to Cerrado's working capital position. The material devaluation in the Argentinian peso in December 2023 resulted in hyper-inflation that, in turn, has led suppliers at MDN to increase costs and significantly restrict typical creditors operating terms. These changes occurred during the final stages of a substantial capital investment program at the Company's MDN mine in Santa Cruz province, Argentina. Combined, these events have had a severe impact on Cerrado's overall financial sustainability and led to the decision to enter into the Option Agreement with Amarillo.The immediate cash consideration received by Cerrado pursuant to the Proposed Transaction combined with anticipated production growth at MDN should address the short-term working capital requirements at MDN, and significantly enhance Cerrado's financial position and ability to progress operations moving forward. The MDN project has now completed a major capital investment program and the Company expects the operation to generate a period of strong cashflows supporting a reduction in debt levels at MDN over the next year.In addition, recent announcements by the Argentinian government that currency controls may be removed during the second half of 2024, would be a strong catalyst for the fiscal environment for MDN to improve. Management expects that operating cashflow from MDN combined with the immediate proceeds from the Proposed Transaction, and, ultimately the possible exercise of the Option, will put Cerrado in a robust financial position with a strong balance sheet from which it can organically grow and increase shareholder value at the Company's operations.Subsequent to the recent capital investment program at MDN, the mine is now positioned to start to generate meaningful cash flows to address the balance sheet. In 2023, the construction of a new heap leaching operation at the Las Calandrias South deposit, capable of supporting annual production in the 25-30K oz range once at full capacity, was completed. The mine also undertook the pre stripping required to open up the Calandrias North deposit to send to the CIL plant. The operations are on target to sustain historical production rates of between 50-60K ozs per annum going forward at reduced cash costs relative to previous years. In addition, the Company is evaluating the potential to develop a second smaller heap leach operation near the current Martinetas CIL plant to process known stockpiles and low grade resources as well as to expand the current heap leach capabilities. Exploration activities remain ongoing to develop both new high grade (open pit or underground) and low grade resources for heap leaching as can be seen at the various nearby operating mines in the region.In addition to the MDN producing gold mine, Cerrado also owns 100% of the Mont Sorcier Iron Ore project located just outside of Chibougamau, Quebec held by its fully owned subsidiary, Voyager Metals. A Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2022, outlined a project producing 5 million tonnes of 65% grade iron concentrates over a 21-year mine life with an initial NPV of US$1.6 billion. The project benefits from significant rail and port facilities already being in place, reducing substantially customary capital requirements. Historical results assumed the production of iron concentrates grading 65%, however, recent test work has demonstrated the ability to produce high purity, DRI grade material grading 67% iron, capable of being used in the Direct Reduction Injection steel production process. DRI grade iron receives a material premium in the market due to the significant environmental benefits of reducing green house gas emissions in the steel making process and are taking market share from conventional lower grade iron ore materials. Cerrado is currently working towards completing a bankable feasibility study to move the project forward based on the improved metallurgical test results. The robust nature of this project has resulted in the Company already being able to mandate TD Bank as lead arranger for a UK Export Credit Agency supported project financing for up to US$598 million to cover 70% of required upfront capital (see Cerrado press release dated November 21, 2023).Amendment to Sellers Agreement at MDNAdditionally, the Company has signed on March 3, 2024 an amendment to the purchase greement for the Minera Don Nicolas Project with Compañía Inversora en Minas S.A. andCompañía Inversora Argentina Para La Exportación S.A. (together, the ""Sellers""). The amendment allows for the balance of funds presently due to be paid from the escrow account to the Sellers by March 16, 2024 (corresponding to the Third Installment), being approximately $2.686 million, will instead be paid to the Sellers by June 7, 2024. Regarding the Final Installment, the monthly instalments due under Section 4.1 in respect of April 2024 through March 2025, will be reduced by 50%.The balance of payments due in respect of April 2024 through March 2025 will be paid by as a lump sum payment of $5.0M by no later than March 28, 2025.About Hochschild Mining PLCHochschild Mining PLC is a leading precious metals company listed on the London Stock Exchange (HOCM.L / HOC LN) and crosstrades on the OTCQX Best Market in the U.S. (HCHDF), with a primary focus on the exploration, mining, processing and sale of silver and gold.

Morgan becomes the first U.S. bank to join France's leading payment network, Cartes Bancaires CB, aiming to offer merchant clients access to the French payment system by the end of 2024. The move is set to provide competitive transaction costs and enhance local processing performance for French debit and credit card transactions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by J.P. Morgan to become a principal member of Cartes Bancaires CB represents a significant development in the European payments industry. This initiative will likely enhance J.P. Morgan's competitive position in the European market, particularly in France, by offering direct access to the leading payment system in the region. With 15 billion CB transactions annually, the potential for increased transaction volume is substantial. Furthermore, the ability to offer competitive transaction costs and improved local processing performance may attract new merchant clients, while potentially increasing customer loyalty through a more seamless payment experience.From a market perspective, this development could be an indicator of J.P. Morgan's long-term commitment to expanding its international payments infrastructure. This expansion aligns with the broader industry trend towards globalization of payment systems and the growing importance of having a diverse range of payment options available to consumers. By processing over $1 trillion of payments daily in EMEA and nearly $10 trillion globally, J.P. Morgan demonstrates the scale of its operations and the significance of its role in the payments market. This move could potentially lead to increased market share and influence in the European payments landscape. Financial Analyst The announcement by J.P. Morgan to join Cartes Bancaires CB as a principal member has direct financial implications for the bank and its stakeholders. By facilitating access to France's primary payment network, J.P. Morgan is poised to capture a larger share of the payment processing market, which could translate into higher revenue streams from merchant services. As the first U.S. bank to hold this status, it may enjoy a 'first-mover' advantage in the region, potentially leading to a stronger foothold in the European payments sector.Investors and analysts should monitor the progress of this initiative closely, as the ability to offer lower transaction costs and high-performance local processing could improve J.P. Morgan's profit margins in the merchant acquiring segment. It is also essential to consider the cost implications of such an expansion, including the investments required to integrate with the CB network and any regulatory compliance costs. These factors will play a crucial role in assessing the long-term profitability and return on investment of this strategic move. Economist Entering into a principal membership with Cartes Bancaires CB is not only a business move for J.P. Morgan but also an economic indicator of the interconnectedness of financial markets. This partnership could facilitate smoother transactions for consumers and businesses, potentially boosting economic activity by reducing friction in payments. Furthermore, the emphasis on innovation, inclusion and security reflects a broader economic shift towards digitalization and the need for secure, efficient payment systems in a modern economy.The expansion of J.P. Morgan's services in the European market may also have implications for employment and investment in the region. As the firm grows its presence in France, it could contribute to job creation and economic growth. Additionally, this move might encourage other U.S. financial institutions to explore similar opportunities, potentially increasing competition and fostering a more dynamic European payments market. 03/05/2024 - 01:00 AM J.P.

Financial Analyst The announcement of BowFlex Inc.'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the subsequent debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing arrangement signifies a critical juncture for the company. The DIP financing of $25 million, partitioned into a $9 million revolving commitment and a $16 million term loan, is essential for maintaining operations during the restructuring process. This funding ensures that BowFlex can continue to meet its financial obligations, which is paramount for retaining customer and vendor confidence.The proposed acquisition by Johnson Health Tech for $37.5 million, subject to adjustments, underlines a strategic move to preserve BowFlex's asset value and operational continuity. The provision for competing bids, as per Section 363, may potentially drive up the purchase price, benefitting creditors and shareholders. However, the breakup fee and expense reimbursements stipulated in the Stalking Horse Asset Purchase Agreement could deter other bidders, thus influencing the final sale outcome and the maximization of stakeholder value. Legal Expert Engaging in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding allows BowFlex Inc. to reorganize its business under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court. The strategic use of Section 363 facilitates the sale of assets free and clear of encumbrances, which can be more attractive to potential buyers and can aid in fetching a higher price for the assets. The stipulations within the Stalking Horse Asset Purchase Agreement, including bid protections like the breakup fee and reimbursement of expenses, are common in bankruptcy sales and serve to compensate the initial bidder for their role in setting the floor price and terms of the sale.It is crucial to note that the transaction is contingent on court approval and may be subject to additional legal and regulatory scrutiny. The outcome of this process will have a direct impact on the company's creditors, as the proceeds from the sale will be used to pay off outstanding debts, with secured creditors generally having priority over unsecured creditors. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, BowFlex's entry into Chapter 11 proceedings indicates a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the home fitness industry. The post-pandemic market has presented challenges for companies like BowFlex, as consumer behavior shifts and economic headwinds persist. The potential acquisition by Johnson Health Tech Retail, Inc. could lead to consolidation within the sector, potentially altering market dynamics and competitiveness.Understanding the broader industry trends is essential for evaluating the long-term implications of this acquisition. It's important to monitor consumer fitness trends, the adoption of connected fitness experiences and the financial health of competitors to fully assess the potential impact of this transaction on the market. 03/05/2024 - 12:40 AM Secured Commitment for $25 Million in Debtor-in-Possession Financing to Continue to Fulfill Customer Orders and Support Ordinary Course Operations VANCOUVER, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BowFlex Inc.

The company also provides an operational update for February, highlighting a decrease in Bitcoin production due to maintenance-related outage. Positive The sale of the Mirabel Facility for $6.1 million will help Argo Blockchain plc reduce its debt and strengthen its balance sheet. The Transaction will repay the Mirabel Facility's outstanding mortgage and part of the debt owed to Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ltd., reducing the Galaxy debt balance by 60%. The Company's pro forma debt balances show a significant reduction after the Transaction, with a total debt of $55.2 million as of 29 February 2024. The Transaction enables Argo to maintain ownership of mining machines and streamline operations by relocating them to the Baie Comeau facility, with a total expected hashrate capacity of 2.7 EH/s. The Transaction is expected to close by the end of March 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. February operational update reveals a 21% reduction in daily Bitcoin production due to a maintenance-related outage at the Cottonwood substation, resulting in a 15% decrease in mining revenue compared to January 2024. Despite the decrease in Bitcoin production, Argo CEO Thomas Chippas anticipates lower power prices at Helios, leading to improved mining profit, margin, and operating cash flow for February. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of Argo Blockchain's Mirabel Facility for $6.1 million represents a strategic financial move, aimed at improving the company's liquidity and reducing its debt burden. By analyzing the transaction price per megawatt, which stands at $1.2 million, it is evident that the sale price is a significant factor for the company's financial restructuring. This is particularly relevant when considering the aggressive deleveraging strategy that Argo is pursuing.The repayment of the Mirabel Facility's mortgage and the reduction of the Galaxy debt by $5.4 million, resulting in a 60% decrease from the original balance, are crucial steps in strengthening the company's balance sheet. The pro forma debt balances and interest rates provided offer a clear view of the company's debt profile post-transaction, which is an essential consideration for investors assessing the company's financial health and risk profile.From an operational standpoint, the retention of mining machines and the anticipated sale of older generation equipment could potentially streamline operations and maintain hashrate capacity. However, the impact on revenue from these changes needs to be monitored closely, as it will influence the company's future financial performance. Market Research Analyst The cryptocurrency mining industry is characterized by high volatility and operational challenges, such as fluctuating Bitcoin prices and network difficulty levels. Argo Blockchain's operational update for February, which includes a 21% reduction in daily Bitcoin production primarily due to maintenance issues, reflects the inherent risks associated with the sector. The subsequent decrease in mining revenue by 15% from the previous month underscores the sensitivity of the company's operations to external factors.Despite the operational setback, the company's ability to take advantage of favorable power market conditions to potentially reduce operating costs is a positive indicator. It suggests adaptability and resilience in managing operational expenses, which is a key factor for maintaining profitability in the dynamic cryptocurrency mining landscape.Analysts and investors will be interested in the long-term implications of these operational efficiencies and cost reductions on the company's competitive position within the industry. The expected hashrate capacity of 2.7 EH/s post-Transaction is an important metric that will be used to gauge the company's mining potential and forecast future earnings. Cryptocurrency Expert The strategic sale of the Mirabel Facility and the corresponding operational updates provide insights into Argo Blockchain's approach to navigating the complex cryptocurrency mining industry. The company's focus on deleveraging and optimizing non-mining operating expenses is a response to the need for financial stability in a market where asset prices and mining difficulties can fluctuate dramatically.Understanding the significance of hashrate capacity, which measures the computational power of mining equipment, is crucial in evaluating a mining company's potential revenue. Argo's emphasis on maintaining a strong hashrate capacity of 2.7 EH/s, despite selling the Mirabel Facility, suggests a calculated approach to balancing asset liquidation with mining capabilities. Additionally, the company's decision to sell certain prior generation machines could be seen as an effort to modernize its mining fleet, potentially leading to increased efficiency and reduced maintenance costs.It is also worth noting the impact of network difficulty on mining operations. The 5% increase in average network difficulty that Argo experienced in February is a reminder of the competitive nature of the industry and the importance of technical efficiency and scale in maintaining profitability. 03/05/2024 - 02:00 AM Sale of Mirabel, Quebec Data Center for $6.1 MillionFebruary Operational UpdateLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2024 / Argo Blockchain plc (LSE:ARB);(NASDAQ:ARBK), a global leader in cryptocurrency mining, is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement for the sale of its data center located in Mirabel, Quebec (the ""Mirabel Facility"") for total consideration of $6.1 million (the ""Transaction"").

The focus on evidence-based marketing, highlighting the benefits of CGM in glycemic control and potentially reducing mortality, may also play a role in shaping healthcare policies and insurance coverage, further influencing the market dynamics. Financial Analyst The clinical evidence supporting the use of Dexcom's CGM systems could have notable financial implications. The long-term efficacy and safety data may lead to increased confidence among healthcare providers and patients, potentially driving higher demand for Dexcom's products. The ability of Dexcom's technology to integrate with other diabetes management systems, such as the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump, enhances its value proposition and could lead to expansion in market share and revenue streams.Furthermore, the direct association between CGM use and reduced mortality could influence reimbursement policies and increase the accessibility of CGM technology, potentially widening the customer base. The company's rapid international expansion and product launches could indicate a strong revenue growth trajectory. However, investors should also consider the costs associated with research and development, marketing and the expansion into new markets when evaluating the company's financial health and future performance. 03/05/2024 - 03:00 AM New data shows long-term use of an AID system powered by Dexcom CGM can safely maintain improvements in glycaemic outcomes for up to two years1. Real-world evidence demonstrates reduction in severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis over 12 months in people with Type 1 diabetes using a Dexcom-powered Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system2. New global user data analysis shows an association between Dexcom CGM usage and a meaningful reduction in HbA1c for people treating their T2D with a GLP-14. Dexcom continues to enhance access to its portfolio around the world, including swift roll out of Dexcom ONE+ and the now, FDA cleared, Direct-to-Watch feature for G7. EDINBURGH, Scotland--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM), the global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with diabetes, announced compelling new clinical evidence supporting the use of Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. Dexcom also announced data showcasing the significant benefits of CGM use for individuals managing Type 2 diabetes, along with groundbreaking evidence demonstrating a direct association between CGM use and reduced mortality in people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The evidence and data will be presented during Dexcom symposia and presentations at the 17th International Conference on Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes, held March 6-9, in Florence. “As the pioneer in biosensing, since last year’s ATTD, Dexcom has moved at an extraordinary pace. We launched G7 in 16 additional countries, released Dexcom ONE+ and are today announcing the phased launch of ‘Direct-to-watch’, that’s two best-in-class products and a feature designed to empower even more people living with diabetes. Globally, we’ve expanded access to Dexcom products by over 5 million people,” said Kevin Sayer, President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board at Dexcom. Driving access to best-in-class CGM technology Dexcom has continued to drive access to its pioneering real-time CGM technology, launching its best-in-class G7 sensor in 16 new markets since ATTD 2023. The company’s latest sensor, Dexcom ONE+, which was built based on user and HCP feedback and is designed to be easy to use for anyone living with diabetes, has also launched in eight markets within one month of first becoming available. Delivering exceptional end-user experiences with direct connectivity to Apple Watch Showing a commitment to not only expanding access to life-changing CGM but also to improving the experience for those already using Dexcom CGM, Dexcom announced that ‘direct to Apple Watch’ functionality for Apple Watch will have a phased launch available to all G7 iOS users everywhere by the end of the second quarter of this year. The announcement means that Dexcom G7 will soon be the only CGM system that can connect directly to Apple Watch without always needing to carry an iPhone.† People choosing Dexcom G7 to help manage their diabetes will have access to ‘direct to Apple Watch’ as soon as it launches in their country. Unparalleled AID abilities With robust clinical evidence and strong partner relationships, Dexcom’s pioneering leadership and capabilities within connected systems remains unparalleled. Of particular significance within AID systems, the clinically meaningful health outcomes resulting from use of both the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology and Insulet Omnipod 5 are only proven when powered by Dexcom CGM. Further demonstrating the value of AID systems powered by Dexcom CGM, Dexcom will showcase recently published evidence at ATTD 2024. Data from the longest prospective follow-up study to date of a cohort with established Type 1 diabetes1, using the Insulet Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Dexcom G6, showed that long-term use of the AID system could safely maintain improvements in glycaemic outcomes for up to two years. Perhaps most significantly, despite the long duration of the study, event rates for severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis remained low at 2.04 and 0.24 events per 100 person-years. Furthermore, real-world evidence from almost 3,000 people using a Tandem Control-IQ AID system, powered by Dexcom CGM, demonstrated lower rates for both severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis over 12 months compared to historic rates2. Concurrent with these lower rates, on average adult participants spent more than 70% CGM time in range, while paediatric participants achieved 60% CGM time in range. In December, Dexcom and Tandem announced the connection of Dexcom G7 to Tandem’s t:slim X2 insulin pump software in the USA, swiftly followed by a roll out in markets across Europe, and in both South Africa and New Zealand. The announcement marked a powerful alliance combining Dexcom’s best-in-class G7 sensor with Tandem’s most widely available pump system. Dexcom also announced the availability, in the USA, of Dexcom G6 with Tandem Mobi, the world’s smallest, durable automated insulin delivery system++. Integration with Dexcom G7 will quickly follow in the USA in the second quarter of this year. Exceptionally effective CGM for all types of diabetes As demonstrated in multiple symposia and presentations at ATTD this year, clinical evidence continues to build demonstrating the effectiveness of Dexcom CGM use amongst people with all types of diabetes. Of particular note, Dexcom announced a first-of-its-kind study directly linking the benefits of CGM with a reduction in mortality for people treating Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with insulin‡3. These results indicate use of CGM may have broad-based benefits that extend beyond glucose lowering in patients with diabetes on insulin. Dexcom also unveiled new global user data analysis showing clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c specifically for people managing their Type 2 diabetes with a GLP1 and using a CGM sensor compared to groups not using CGM*4. Dexcom data also showed that amongst Type 2 user populations, the more regularly a Dexcom CGM was worn, the more time a user spent within their desired glucose range5. Furthermore, a qualitative study involving people treating their Type 2 diabetes with basal insulin found the visualisation of glucose levels offered by Dexcom CGM improved understanding of the impact of treatment and lifestyle decisions on glucose levels, and the impact of those glucose levels on additional health issues6. “The breadth of studies and outcomes showcased here at ATTD demonstrates the crucial role that Dexcom CGM can play in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes,” said Dr Thomas Grace, MD, Head of Clinical Advocacy and Outcomes at Dexcom. “From demonstrating a clinically significant decrease in HbA1c to increasing time in range and generally improving well-being, the results speak for themselves. We also continue to see studies confirm that whilst GLP1s are an effective initial treatment for those living with Type 2 diabetes the use of Dexcom CGM can strengthen their impact and provide an alternative for sustained long-term metabolic health improvement.” About DexCom, Inc.

(MANH) collaborates with Google Cloud and Zebra Technologies to conduct the industry's first real-world analysis of Unified Commerce in specialty retail in Europe. The study assessed 50 retailers in five countries across three verticals, revealing insights on customer experience capabilities and identifying four overall leaders in Unified Commerce. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent benchmarking study conducted by Incisiv, which evaluated 50 specialty retailers across Europe, provides valuable insights into the state of Unified Commerce in the retail sector. The study highlights the integration of digital and physical shopping channels as a significant factor for retail success. A key takeaway is the emphasis on a seamless 'Unified Basket' experience, where 40% of leaders personalize promotions and offers across channels, compared to just 6% of non-leaders.This suggests that retailers who invest in technology to synchronize online and in-store experiences can gain a competitive edge. The study's identification of brands like Adidas and H&M as leaders in this space indicates that large, well-established brands are setting the benchmark for the industry. For investors, this could signal which companies are likely to capture greater market share and consumer loyalty through advanced customer experience strategies. Customer Experience Specialist An important aspect of the findings is the 'Guided Inspiration' in search and discovery, which refers to the ability of retailers to help customers find products that resonate with their preferences. This capability is not just a technical feature but a strategic approach to customer engagement. It suggests that retailers who are able to leverage data analytics and AI to provide personalized shopping experiences are likely to outperform those who do not.For stakeholders, investing in such capabilities could lead to increased customer satisfaction and repeat business, which ultimately drives revenue growth. Retailers that fail to adapt may see a decline in customer retention and market share. The long-term implications include the potential reshaping of the retail landscape, where personalization becomes a key differentiator. Supply Chain Analyst The 'promising and fulfilment' aspect of the study dives into the operational efficiencies of the supply chain in a unified commerce environment. The ability to accurately promise and fulfill orders across channels is critical in meeting customer expectations. This level of service requires a sophisticated supply chain infrastructure that can handle complex logistics.Retailers that excel in this area are likely to see improvements in inventory turnover and reduced costs associated with overstocking or stockouts. This efficiency can be a significant driver of profitability. Conversely, retailers struggling with fulfillment may face customer dissatisfaction, increased returns and higher operational costs. For investors, the operational capabilities in promising and fulfillment can be indicative of a retailer's potential for long-term operational excellence and cost management. 03/05/2024 - 03:00 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Manhattan Associates Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH) today announced the findings of the industry's first real-world analysis of Unified Commerce in specialty retail in Europe conducted in partnership with Google Cloud and Zebra Technologies. The Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail, conducted by Incisiv via actual shopping transactions, assessed three retail verticals (apparel and footwear, home and DIY, and luxury), and five countries (France, Germany, Italy, UK, and the Netherlands). The Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail in Europe conducted by Incisiv, assessed 50 retailers, analysing 290+ customer experience capabilities in four categories including: search and discovery; cart and checkout; promising and fulfilment and service and support. Based on data from actual purchases, returns and customer journeys across digital and physical channels, the benchmarking reveals common attributes of successful retailers and opportunities for retailers to improve customer value and operations. Of the 50 retailers benchmarked, four brands emerged as overall leaders in Unified Commerce: Adidas, H&M, Leroy Merlin and M&S. Below are some of the key findings from each of the four categories assessed: Unified Basket: The biggest point of friction in today’s retail customer experience is due to the loss of context when transiting between the physical and the digital. Leaders in cart and checkout understand that a unified cart or basket is a foundational capability when it comes to that all-important connection across channels; 40% of leaders show personalised promotions and offers on product description pages and cart, compared to 6% of non-leaders. Guided Inspiration: Leaders in search and discovery help shoppers discover meaningful products, making shoppers feel good about their purchase decisions, with 100% of leaders publishing detailed content on sustainability practices. They offer capabilities such as product recommendations, back-in-stock notifications, and product sourcing information, while 40% of Leaders offered real-time inventory visibility on product detail pages and personalised recommendations on home pages. Flawless Fulfilment: Leaders in promising and fulfilment make sure shoppers’ product pick-up or delivery experience is as good as their shopping journey. Not only do leaders meet or beat their delivery promises consistently, they do also so while being more environmentally friendly too. Offering shoppers greater post-order flexibility, including complete or partial cancellations, and greater delivery/pick-up options are all areas leaders excel in. 60% of leaders offer shoppers the ability to cancel orders post-purchase compared to 28% of non-leaders. 360 Degree Service: Leaders in the service and support segment offer shoppers a wide variety of service options; from in-store assistance to call centres, social media support to live agents on their website and mobile app. Importantly though, they offer seamless continuity, consistent quality and always-on availability across channels and services. They empower shoppers to self-serve most of their service needs with 92% of Leaders supporting in order modifications, returns and exchanges via chat/call and 75% offering their customers the ability to return purchases to drop-off locations. Henri Seroux, senior vice president, EMEA at Manhattan Associates commented: “73% of European consumers are more likely to shop with retailers offering integrated online and in-store experiences. This means brands need complete visibility and insight into all aspects of their business, from back-end supply chain processes to customer services, if they are to deliver seamless shopping experiences to Europe’s mosaic-like retail landscape.” “Unified Commerce holds great promise for retailers and the key to it lies in not only seamlessly joining digital and in-person experiences, but also linking all the data and systems that enable them too,” said Paul Tepfenhart, Global Director Retail and Consumer Strategy at Google Cloud. “Manhattan Associates’ partnership with Google Cloud on this latest benchmark provides retailers with a data-based roadmap to deliver a unified commerce strategy that makes it easier for both customers and store associates to reliably locate the right products online and instore.” “The European benchmark findings illustrate progress and investment are being made in addressing table stake capabilities such as channel integration, efficient search, payment options, sustainability choices and fulfilment. However, retailers are lagging in adopting many high impact differentiating capabilities and driving operational excellence,” said Tim Stoddard, General Manager and Senior Vice President EMEA, Zebra Technologies. “The results underline the importance of real-time optimised inventory visibility, front-line associate engagement, and elevated customer experience as key pillars to the delivery of Unified Commerce.” Amarjot Mokha, Chief Operating Officer at Incisiv added: “In a fast-paced European market, retailers must continually innovate and adapt if they are to keep pace shifting consumer trends. Retailers embracing a Unified Commerce approach are able to go beyond simply selling products, to a place where they can craft experiences that resonate beyond country borders. This type of customer connection drives strong business growth, up to 3X higher revenue opportunities and creates the type of brand connection and customer loyalty every retailer covets.” Click here to view the complete 2024 Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail in Europe. Methodology: Incisiv first developed a detailed parameterised list of Unified Commerce customer experience capabilities. Then, based on shopper insights, retailer executive surveys, retailer digital and store performance data, and segment-level KPI benchmarks, it organised key capabilities into Table Stakes and Differentiating Experiences. Incisiv then developed an objective list of 50 retailers across five European countries and three Specialty Retail segments, choosing a mix of top omnichannel retailers by revenue, across apparel and footwear, home and DIY and luxury. All retailers had to be in good financial health, as determined by a combination of factors including their debt rating, and rate of store closures. Incisiv’s team of customer experience analysts then conducted comprehensive shopping journeys, including real purchases and returns, across both physical and in-person channels. Assessed retailers were then scored based on the adoption of customer experience capabilities, the efficacy of each capability, and the consistency and quality of experience. Based on their score, brands were organised into one of four performance categories - Leaders, Challengers, Followers, or Laggards - each with a statistically significant difference in capability maturity and impact on performance.

Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Spirent Communications by VIAVI Solutions represents a strategic consolidation within the telecommunications test and measurement industry. This move is indicative of a trend towards integration in the sector, aiming to create comprehensive solutions that span across multiple verticals including 5G and 6G infrastructure, cloud services and enterprise networks. The merger is poised to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for advanced network testing due to the increasing complexity of network infrastructure and the anticipated roll-out of next-generation wireless technologies.The projected annual run-rate cost synergies of up to $75 million suggest significant operational efficiencies and reflect a concerted effort to streamline the combined entity's operations. This figure will be of particular interest to stakeholders, as it provides a quantifiable metric for the anticipated financial benefits of the merger. However, the realization of these synergies will depend on the effective integration of the two companies' operations and cultures, which is often a challenging aspect of any merger or acquisition. Financial Analyst The financial structure of the acquisition, including the use of existing cash, debt financing and a strategic investment by Silver Lake, indicates a multi-faceted approach to funding which aims to balance immediate acquisition costs with long-term financial health. VIAVI's strategy to prioritize debt repayment post-acquisition using free cash flow is a prudent measure that will likely reassure investors concerned about the potential increase in leverage. The targeted leverage ratios of 4.0x gross and 3.0x net are within industry norms, suggesting a conservative financial approach despite the scale of the transaction.Furthermore, the involvement of Silver Lake, with a $400 million investment and a seat on the VIAVI Board, adds a layer of strategic oversight and could signal confidence in the long-term prospects of the combined entity. The anticipated use of US net operating losses to lower the blended non-GAAP tax rate is a tactical move that could improve profitability and cash flow, contributing positively to shareholder value. Legal Expert The acquisition's dependency on shareholder and regulatory approvals is a common and critical step in such transactions. The unanimous recommendation by the Spirent Board and the irrevocable agreements from Spirent Directors who hold shares are strong indicators of internal support for the deal. However, the actual completion of the acquisition will hinge on the fulfilment of these conditions, which can be influenced by a variety of factors including market conditions and regulatory scrutiny.Regulatory considerations, particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors, often involve assessments of competitive impacts and national security implications. Given the international scope of both companies' operations, regulatory approvals may involve multiple jurisdictions, each with its own set of complexities. The expected closing timeline in the second half of 2024 provides a broad window to address these regulatory challenges. 03/05/2024 - 02:20 AM Highly complementary and synergistic product portfolios to enable delivery of high-performance, integrated solutions for networking and mission-critical applications, including 5G and 6G wireless infrastructure Complementary nature of products and technologies to provide diversification and accelerated growth in attractive, adjacent verticals, such as cloud service providers, enterprise/IT networks, 5G private networks, 6G+ and positioning, navigation and timing verticals Greater engineering, research and development and design capabilities to accelerate new technology development and product innovation, in particular with regard to artificial intelligence and machine learning, security, cloud-native architecture and automation Operational efficiencies anticipated to result in annual run-rate cost synergies of up to $75 million approximately two years after the completion of the Acquisition Anticipate utilizing US net operating losses to lower the combined group’s blended non-GAAP tax rate Silver Lake to make $400 million long-term strategic investment in VIAVI Solutions in connection with the Acquisition CHANDLER, Ariz. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VIAVI Solutions (“VIAVI”) (NASDAQ: VIAV), a leading provider of communications test, measurement and optical technologies, and Spirent Communications plc (“Spirent”) (LSE: SPT), a global provider of automated test and assurance solutions for networks, cybersecurity and positioning, today announced an agreement on the terms of a cash offer for Spirent which the Spirent Board intends to unanimously recommend (the “Acquisition”).

Silver Lake has an outstanding track record of supporting leading technology companies through both organic growth investments and scale acquisitions.” VIAVI believes, due to the complementary nature of the respective businesses, there is a compelling strategic and financial rationale for the Acquisition, as it is expected to: Create a leading provider of test, assurance and security solutions for research and development labs, service providers, data centers and mission-critical infrastructure Merging the highly complementary product portfolios and services will enable the combined group to deliver solutions for various markets and applications. Provide diversification and accelerated growth in attractive, adjacent market verticals The combination of VIAVI and Spirent’s current and future product offerings will position the combined group to bring to market innovative solutions across high-growth cloud service providers, enterprise/IT networks, 5G private networks, 6G+ and positioning, navigation and timing verticals. Achieve greater engineering, research and development and design capabilities to accelerate new technology development and product innovation VIAVI believes that building on the combined expertise of the engineering, research and development and design teams of both VIAVI and Spirent will result in greater engineering, research and development and design capabilities to accelerate new technology development and product innovation, in particular with regard to artificial intelligence and machine learning, security, cloud-native architecture and automation. Further, the combined group will benefit from additional financial and operational resources to continue its leadership in research and development and to deliver products to new verticals to help customers solve their most difficult challenges. Achieve greater operating leverage and generate cost synergies Operational efficiencies anticipated to result in annual run-rate cost synergies of up to $75 million approximately two years after the completion of the Acquisition. VIAVI anticipates utilizing its US net operating losses to lower the combined group’s blended non-GAAP tax rate. VIAVI will prioritize debt paydown utilizing free cash flow generation after the completion of the Acquisition to lower leverage ratios towards 4.0x gross and 3.0x net over the long term. The Acquisition will be funded by VIAVI’s existing cash, a fully committed $800 million 7-year term loan from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and a $400 million investment from Silver Lake in the form of a fully committed senior convertible note. In connection with the Silver Lake investment, Ken Hao, Chairman and a Managing Partner of Silver Lake will join the VIAVI Board of Directors. In addition, VIAVI obtained a $100 million 5-year revolving credit facility (unfunded at close), committed by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., to provide additional financial flexibility.

No representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by Jefferies as to the contents of this press release. This press release is for information purposes only and is not intended to, and does not, constitute or form part of any offer to sell, or an invitation to purchase, any securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, or of any vote or any approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the Acquisition or otherwise. This press release is not an advertisement and does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document. Overseas Shareholders Unless otherwise determined by Bidco or required by the Takeover Code, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Acquisition shall not be made available, directly or indirectly, in, into, or from a Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction and no person may vote in favour of the Acquisition by any such use, means, instrumentality or form within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this press release and all documents relating to the Acquisition are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed, or sent in, into, or from a Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction, and persons receiving this press release and all documents relating to the Acquisition (including custodians, nominees, and trustees) must not mail or otherwise distribute or send them in, into, or from such jurisdictions where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. The Acquisition shall be subject to the applicable requirements of English law, the Takeover Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange, and the Financial Conduct Authority. Additional Information for US Investors The Acquisition relates to shares of a UK company and is proposed to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the laws of England and Wales. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure and procedural requirements applicable in the UK to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure requirements of US tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has approved or disapproved or passed judgment upon the fairness or the merits of the Acquisition or determined if this press release is adequate, accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the US. However, if Bidco were to elect to implement the Acquisition by means of a takeover offer, such Takeover Offer would in addition need to be made in compliance with any applicable US laws and regulations, including any applicable exemptions under the US Exchange Act. Such a takeover would be made in the US by Bidco and no one else. In the event that the Acquisition is implemented by way of a takeover offer, in accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the US Exchange Act, Bidco or its nominees, or its brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares or other securities of Spirent outside the US, other than pursuant to such takeover offer, during the period in which such takeover offer would remain open for acceptance. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase shall be disclosed as required in the UK, shall be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and shall be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In accordance with normal UK practice, VIAVI, Bidco, or their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares or other securities of Spirent, other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition and/or scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made, they would occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. The receipt of consideration by a US shareholder or holder of Spirent ADRs pursuant to the scheme will likely be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. Each Spirent Shareholder and Spirent ADR holder is urged to consult their independent professional advisor immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to them, including under applicable US state and local, as well as overseas and other, tax laws. Financial information relating to Spirent included in this press release and the scheme document (or, if applicable, the offer document) has been or shall have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the UK and may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US. Bidco and Spirent are organized under the laws of England and Wales. Some or all of the officers and directors of Bidco and Spirent, respectively, are residents of countries other than the US. In addition, most of the assets of Bidco and Spirent are located outside the US. As a result, it may be difficult for US shareholders of Spirent and Spirent ADR Holders to effect service of process within the US upon Bidco or Spirent or their respective officers or directors or to enforce against them a judgment of a US court predicated upon the federal or state securities laws of the US. Forward-Looking Statements This press release (including information incorporated by reference in this press release), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, or any member of the VIAVI Group, contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements”. Such forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and on numerous assumptions regarding the business strategies and the environment in which Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, any member of the VIAVI Group, or any member of the combined group shall operate in the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release may relate to Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, any member of the VIAVI Group, or any member of the combined group’s future prospects, developments and business strategies, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes”, “estimates”, “will look to”, “would look to”, “plans”, “prepares”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “is expected to”, “is subject to”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “forecasts”, “synergy”, “strategy”, “goal”, “cost-saving”, “projects” “intends”, “assumes”, “may”, “will”, “shall” or “should” or their negatives or other variations or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, any member of the VIAVI Group, or any member of the combined group’s operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; and (iii) the effects of global economic conditions and governmental regulation on Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, any member of the VIAVI Group, or any member of the combined group’s business. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that shall occur in the future. These events and circumstances include changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or disposals. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any one or more of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such factors. None of Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, nor any member of the VIAVI Group, nor any member of the combined group, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisors, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this press release shall actually occur. Given these risks and uncertainties, potential investors should not place any reliance on forward-looking statements. Specifically, statements of estimated cost savings and synergies relate to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties, and contingencies. As a result, the cost savings and synergies referred to may not be achieved, may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. Due to the scale of the combined group, there may be additional changes to the combined group’s operations. As a result, and given the fact that the changes relate to the future, the resulting cost synergies may be materially greater or less than those estimated. The forward-looking statements speak only at the date of this press release. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, or any member of the VIAVI Group, or any member of the combined group, or any of their respective associates, directors, officers, employees, or advisors, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Spirent, any member of the Spirent Group, VIAVI, Bidco, any member of the VIAVI Group and any member of the combined group expressly disclaim any obligation to update such statements other than as required by law or by the rules of any competent regulatory authority, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. No Profit Forecasts or Estimates No statement in this press release is intended as a profit forecast or estimate for any period and no statement in this press release should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for VIAVI or Spirent, as appropriate, for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for VIAVI or Spirent, as appropriate.

The offering size was increased from $450.0 million, with an option for additional notes. The notes will bear interest at 1.50% per year and mature on September 1, 2029. Holders can convert the notes under certain conditions. iRhythm expects to use the net proceeds for various purposes, including repaying loans and entering capped call transactions. Positive None. Negative The offering of convertible notes may lead to potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes. The need to repay loans and repurchase shares could impact iRhythm's financial position. The capped call transactions could limit potential gains for investors in iRhythm's common stock. Financial Analyst iRhythm Technologies' decision to increase its offering of Convertible Senior Notes from $450.0 million to $575.0 million reflects a strong demand from qualified institutional buyers, which could be interpreted as market confidence in the company’s long-term prospects. The option for initial purchasers to buy an additional $86.25 million in notes provides flexibility and could lead to further capital infusion if exercised. The interest rate of 1.50% is relatively low, suggesting that investors are willing to accept lower yields in exchange for the potential upside of conversion into equity, especially considering the conversion premium of approximately 35.0% over the current stock price.The use of proceeds indicates a strategic approach by iRhythm to strengthen its balance sheet by repaying existing debt, specifically the loan from Braidwell and to support general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions. This could signal an aggressive growth strategy that may appeal to investors looking for expansion and scale in the digital healthcare space. However, the impact on the stock's liquidity and potential dilution effect from the capped call transactions and share repurchases could be a concern for current shareholders.Overall, the offering could be beneficial for iRhythm in terms of providing financial flexibility and the ability to invest in growth initiatives, which could be positive for the company's long-term valuation, subject to execution on the intended use of proceeds. Market Research Analyst The digital healthcare industry is witnessing rapid growth, with an increasing focus on technologies that can predict and prevent diseases. iRhythm's move to secure additional funding through convertible notes could be seen as a strategic initiative to capitalize on market opportunities. By repaying debt and potentially investing in acquisitions, iRhythm seems to be positioning itself as a more competitive player in the market.The capped call transactions, aimed at reducing potential dilution, suggest that iRhythm is mindful of shareholder interests while also trying to manage the impact of conversion on its earnings per share. The decision to repurchase shares concurrently with the offering at the last reported sale price could be a signal to the market of the management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value, which might be perceived positively by investors.However, the repurchase of shares and the associated market activities by the capped call counterparties could lead to volatility in the stock price. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the market's reaction to these transactions and their effect on the stock's performance, particularly in terms of liquidity and price stability. Legal Expert The offering of Convertible Senior Notes by iRhythm Technologies is structured to comply with Rule 144A, indicating a private placement to qualified institutional buyers rather than a public offering. This approach allows the company to raise capital more quickly and with potentially less disclosure than a public offering, which can be advantageous in terms of timing and confidentiality.The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, which means they are subject to transfer restrictions and may only be sold to other qualified institutional buyers. The legal framework surrounding these transactions is complex and requires careful navigation to ensure compliance with securities laws and to avoid potential legal pitfalls.The involvement of Braidwell, both as a lender and a potential purchaser of the notes, adds another layer of complexity to the transaction. The company must ensure that all dealings with Braidwell are conducted at arm's length and on terms that are fair and equitable to all parties, to prevent any potential conflicts of interest or allegations of preferential treatment. 03/04/2024 - 11:42 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iRhythm Technologies, Inc. (“iRhythm”) (NASDAQ: IRTC), a leading digital health care company focused on creating trusted solutions that detect, predict and help prevent disease, announced today the pricing of its offering of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The aggregate principal amount of the offering was increased from the previously announced offering size of $450.0 million. iRhythm also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period from, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The sale of the notes is expected to close on March 7, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of iRhythm, and will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on September 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the notes. Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2029, the notes will be convertible at the option of holders of the notes only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the notes will be convertible at the option of holders at any time until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of whether such conditions have been met. Upon conversion, the notes may be settled in shares of iRhythm’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of iRhythm’s common stock, at the election of iRhythm. The initial conversion rate is 6.7927 shares of iRhythm’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $147.22 per share of iRhythm’s common stock, representing an approximate 35.0% premium based on the last reported sale price of iRhythm’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 4, 2024 of $109.05 per share). The initial conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 5, 2027, the notes will not be redeemable. On or after March 5, 2027, and prior to June 1, 2029, iRhythm may redeem for cash all or part of the notes, at its option, subject to a partial redemption limitation, if the last reported sale price of iRhythm’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which iRhythm provides notice of redemption. Holders of the notes will have the right to require iRhythm to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes). iRhythm will also be required to increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with certain fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date or convert their notes called (or deemed called) for redemption following the delivery by iRhythm of a notice of redemption. Braidwell LP, iRhythm’s lender and a holder of its common stock, has expressed an interest in purchasing a portion of the notes offered hereby. Any such purchase will be on the same terms as purchases of notes by other investors. An indication of interest is not binding and there can be no assurance that Braidwell will purchase notes or will be allocated any notes by the initial purchasers. A portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes will be paid to Braidwell as repayment of the loan from Braidwell, as further described below. iRhythm estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $559.5 million (or approximately $643.6 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by iRhythm. iRhythm intends to use approximately $63.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions, as described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, iRhythm intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions. In addition, iRhythm expects to use approximately $80.2 million of the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment in full of indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and related fees, under iRhythm’s Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with Braidwell Transaction Holdings LLC – Series 5, which consists of borrowings under the initial tranche of the Loan Agreement’s term loan facility. iRhythm also expects to use approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 229,252 shares of iRhythm’s common stock concurrently with the offering at a purchase price of $109.05 per share in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. These repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of iRhythm’s common stock, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. iRhythm intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include sales and marketing activities, medical affairs and educational efforts, research and development and clinical studies, and working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies in the future. However, iRhythm has no commitments or specific plans with respect to any such investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies at this time. In connection with the pricing of the notes, iRhythm has entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “capped call counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of iRhythm’s common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to iRhythm’s common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments that iRhythm could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap equal to $218.10 per share, which represents a premium of 100.0% over the closing price of iRhythm’s common stock of $109.05 per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 4, 2024. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties have advised iRhythm that they and their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to iRhythm’s common stock and/or purchase iRhythm’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of iRhythm’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to iRhythm’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling iRhythm’s common stock or other securities of iRhythm in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes or following any repurchase of notes by iRhythm in connection with any optional redemption, fundamental change repurchase or otherwise, in each case, if iRhythm elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such conversion or such redemption or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of iRhythm’s common stock or the notes, which could affect noteholders’ ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of iRhythm’s common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of iRhythm’s common stock, if any, into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes and any shares of iRhythm’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and are not expected to be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, statements regarding the timing and closing of iRhythm’s offering of the notes and expected use of net proceeds from the offering. Statements containing words such as “could,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” or similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Factors that may contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks related to whether iRhythm will close the offering of the notes and consummate the share repurchases on the expected date, or at all, whether the outstanding debt of iRhythm is retired, the expected use of the net proceeds from the offering, which could change as a result of market conditions or for other reasons, prevailing market and other general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally, and whether iRhythm will be able to satisfy the conditions required to close the sale of the notes. The foregoing list of risks and uncertainties is illustrative, but is not exhaustive. For information about other potential factors that could affect iRhythm’s business and financial results, please review the “Risk Factors” described in iRhythm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 22, 2024 and in iRhythm’s other filings with the SEC. Except as may be required by law, iRhythm does not intend, and undertakes no duty, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances.

Hamilton Lane Announces Pricing of Public Offering of Class A Common Stock,2024-03-05T02:37:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Hamilton Lane Incorporated (HLNE) announces a public offering of 1,922,322 shares of Class A common stock, raising approximately $210 million.

The offering, managed by Morgan Stanley, aims to close on March 7, 2024, with proceeds intended for settling cash exchanges of membership units. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Hamilton Lane regarding the pricing of their public offering represents a strategic financial maneuver to raise capital. The expected gross proceeds of approximately $210 million from the sale of 1,922,322 shares of Class A common stock could signify an expansion or debt management strategy. Typically, a company may use such proceeds to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt, or fund other corporate expenses.From an investor's perspective, the utilization of proceeds to settle cash exchanges of membership units might suggest a consolidation of ownership or an effort to streamline the equity structure of the company. This can potentially lead to increased financial stability or prepare the company for future strategic moves. However, investors should consider the dilutive effect of the new shares on earnings per share (EPS) and whether the expected use of proceeds justifies this dilution. Market Research Analyst Hamilton Lane's decision to engage in a public offering is a significant event that warrants attention from the market. The role of Morgan Stanley as the sole book-running manager and underwriter indicates confidence in the offering's success. The firm's choice to go through an underwritten public offering rather than a private placement or direct listing suggests a desire for a structured and potentially less volatile capital raise.Market participants should assess the timing of the offering and its size relative to the firm's market capitalization. The offering's success and the market's reception could influence Hamilton Lane's stock price and investor sentiment. The broader market conditions, including interest rates and the performance of the asset management sector, should also be considered as they can impact investor appetite for such offerings. Legal Expert Hamilton Lane's public offering is conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows them to offer and sell securities to the public without the need for a separate registration for each act of offering.

Holders of Series 1 Shares have the option to convert into Senior Preferred Shares, Series 2. The fixed quarterly dividends on Series 1 Shares will be 7.475%, with a conversion option available until March 18, 2024. Series 2 Shares will have quarterly floating rate dividends tied to the annual yield on three-month Government of Canada treasury bills. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Brookfield Infrastructure regarding the fixed dividend rate for its Series 1 Shares signifies a substantial commitment to shareholder returns. The set rate of 7.475% is notably higher than the average dividend yield of the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which typically hovers around the 2.5% to 3.5% range. This could be an indicator of strong cash flow generation and financial stability within Brookfield Infrastructure, which may bolster investor confidence.However, the high dividend rate may also reflect a premium required by investors for holding these preferred shares, potentially due to perceived risks associated with the company or the sector. Investors should consider the company's payout ratio and compare it with industry peers to assess the sustainability of these dividends. Furthermore, the option for shareholders to convert Series 1 Shares into Series 2 Shares with a floating rate tied to government treasury bill yields offers flexibility in a changing interest rate environment, which is particularly relevant in the context of recent monetary policy trends. Market Research Analyst The conditional approval by the TSX for the listing of the Series 2 Shares upon conversion indicates a procedural step that aligns with regulatory compliance and market standards. For market participants, the availability of both fixed and floating rate preferred shares from Brookfield Infrastructure presents diversified options for income-focused portfolios. The market's reception to these instruments will be contingent on the broader economic conditions, especially the interest rate landscape and the performance of the infrastructure sector.Investors will likely monitor the uptake of the conversion offer closely. A significant shift from Series 1 to Series 2 could signal market expectations of rising interest rates, whereas a preference to remain with Series 1 might suggest a search for yield stability. The conversion decision deadline also introduces a temporal factor that could influence investor behavior and stock liquidity in the short term. Economist The fixed and floating dividend rates associated with Brookfield Infrastructure's preferred shares offer insights into the current economic climate. The fixed rate provides a hedge against potential inflationary pressures, while the floating rate option tied to government treasury bill yields allows for adjustment in response to shifts in monetary policy. The decision by shareholders to convert or retain their Series 1 Shares will reflect their expectations of future economic conditions.Given the context of recent economic trends, such as fluctuating interest rates and inflation concerns, the structure of these preferred shares could be seen as a strategic move by Brookfield Infrastructure to manage market risks and investor expectations. The economic implications of such financial instruments extend beyond the company itself and may influence investor sentiment towards the infrastructure sector and fixed-income markets in general. 03/04/2024 - 06:50 PM All amounts in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated BROOKFIELD, NEWS, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.

Michael Polansky said: “It’s critical that investors strive to find companies whose missions extend beyond profitability, by supporting the development of technologies that can drive meaningful and sustained improvement to human life. CLINUVEL is an example of a company that aims to improve human health and I am delighted to become a trustee of the Photomedicine Foundation, which will play a vital role in improving the lives of individuals with light-related conditions who cannot access life-saving medical care.” Sean Parker said: “CLINUVEL is one of the most innovative Life Sciences companies that exists today with a management that has the patience to see through long development. Both its groundbreaking melanocortin technology and long-term business plan will disrupt the world of biopharmaceuticals and luxury skincare. The Photomedicine Foundation is a welcome addition to a company on a path to growth unlike any other.” CLINUVEL’s CEO, Dr. Philippe Wolgen said: “Sean Parker and Michael Polansky are unafraid to rip up the rulebook in their mission to advance science and improve global health.

Ned Lamont; Stacey Kennedy, President Americas & CEO of PMI’s U.S. Business; Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz (Photo: Business Wire) Beginning January 2025, in coordination with WBDC, PMI’s U.S. business will contribute $1 million per year over a five-year period toward the “Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative” (WEEI) to help remove barriers that prevent women from full participation in Connecticut’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. “Philip Morris International is committed to making positive impact throughout Connecticut communities and beyond. Our partnership with WBDC and investment through the ‘Women’s Economic Empowerment Initiative’ enables us to better support Gov. Ned Lamont’s vision of positioning our state as a catalyst for women and their families,” said Stacey Kennedy, President, Americas Region & CEO of PMI’s U.S. business. “As the first multinational to receive Global EQUAL-SALARY Certification, we believe supporting female empowerment and ensuring economic equality is paramount for our collective economic growth. We encourage other companies to join in the initiative to empower females across the state. We have chosen to partner with WBDC because of their 27-year track record as the leading force for women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship and a driver of economic equity across Connecticut.” Since 1997, WBDC has educated and trained more than 18,900 clients in all of Connecticut’s 169 towns— helping women to launch, sustain, and scale more than 14,170 businesses, create and maintain more than 31,400 jobs, and access more than $57 million in capital. This support from PMI will ensure continuity of the vital services WBDC provides and will allow the WBDC to build a legacy thousands of female entrepreneurs in Connecticut can rely on for years to come. Decades of research show women’s full economic participation has enormous benefits, including increasing financial stability in their households and reducing poverty in their communities. Data from the New York-based Eurasia Group indicates that if policymakers were to prioritize investment in women’s economic power, the global economy could grow an additional 7% or $10 trillion by 20301. Through WEEI, PMI and WBDC, Connecticut-based women will receive the education, training, resources, and access to capital they need to put them and their families on the right path to economic self-reliance. “This investment from PMI will enable us to continue the critical work we do to support economic independence through entrepreneurship for women in Connecticut,” said WBDC CEO Fran Pastore. “We are pleased that PMI has trusted us to use these funds to continue to help women access capital, education, and resources to support themselves and fuel employment within our state. Over the past few years, we have seen a 275% increase in the number of women who come to us seeking to launch or scale their business. Without the support of corporations in our community like PMI, this growth, and the growth we anticipate in the future, would not be possible.” “Investments in female entrepreneurs and women-led businesses are investments in the future of Connecticut,” said Gov. Ned Lamont. “From our efforts to advance pay equity, to enacting a paid family medical leave program, to safeguarding healthcare services and increasing access to childcare so that women who enter the workforce can not only stay in the workforce, but advance as leaders and entrepreneurs, these are just some of the reasons Connecticut is one of the best states in the nation to live, work, and raise a family.” This historic partnership was announced during a press conference at PMI’s Stamford, Connecticut headquarters (677 Washington Boulevard, 11th floor Stamford, CT 06901) at 10 a.m. EST on Monday, March 4, 2024. In attendance was Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont; U.S. Congressman Jim Himes; Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz; Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons; Stacey Kennedy, President Americas & CEO of PMI’s U.S. Business; Marian Salzman, Senior Vice President & Chief Corporate Citizenship Officer, PMI U.S.; and Fran Pastore, CEO of the Women’s Business Development Council. 1Eurasia Group.

Portfolio holdings include Enterprise Products Partners, Energy Transfer LP, MPLX LP, The Williams Companies, ONEOK, Inc., and more. Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (NYSE: KYN) aims to provide high after-tax total return by investing in Energy Infrastructure Companies. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the recent financial disclosure by Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc., the net asset value (NAV) per share of $10.69 provides a snapshot of the company's financial health. The reported asset coverage ratios, particularly the 642% for senior securities and 451% for total leverage, are significantly above the minimum 300% required by the 1940 Act for senior securities and 200% for total assets. This suggests a strong balance sheet and low risk of default, which could be reassuring for investors and could potentially lead to a positive impact on the stock's performance.Furthermore, the composition of the long-term investments, with a heavy concentration in Midstream Energy Companies, reflects a targeted investment strategy in a sector known for stable cash flows and dividends. However, this focus also implies exposure to sector-specific risks, such as fluctuations in energy prices and regulatory changes. Investors would benefit from understanding the implications of such a focused portfolio in the context of their individual investment strategies and the current energy market trends. Market Research Analyst The disclosure of top holdings within Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund's portfolio provides insight into the fund's market positioning. The dominance of Midstream Energy Companies, such as Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Energy Transfer LP, indicates a reliance on the infrastructure necessary for energy transportation and storage. This sector is typically less volatile than the upstream sector, which focuses on exploration and production and can offer more predictable returns.Given the growing global energy demand and the transition towards more renewable sources, the fund's minimal exposure to Renewable Infrastructure Companies at 1% might be seen as a missed opportunity for diversification and growth. Investors may consider the potential for the fund to adapt its strategy to include more investments in renewables, which could offer long-term growth prospects as the energy sector evolves. Economist The reported net assets of $1.8 billion and the substantial asset coverage ratios may reflect broader economic trends, such as the recovery of energy markets from previous downturns or the increasing demand for infrastructure development. The high coverage ratios could indicate a conservative approach to leverage, which might protect the fund during economic downturns but could also limit potential returns during market upswings.Investors should consider macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate changes and economic cycles, which could affect the performance of energy infrastructure investments. A rising interest rate environment, for instance, could increase borrowing costs for companies within the fund’s portfolio, potentially affecting their profitability and, by extension, the fund's returns. 03/04/2024 - 08:15 PM HOUSTON, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc.

The shares will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'LGCL'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Lucas GC Limited's upsized initial public offering (IPO) is a significant event for the company and its potential investors. The decision to price the offering at $4.00 per share, aiming to raise $6 million in gross proceeds, reflects the company's valuation expectations and market demand. This capital infusion is crucial for Lucas as it likely plans to use the funds to further develop its AI-driven human capital management services, scale its operations and possibly expand into new markets.Investors will be keen to scrutinize the company's use of proceeds, management's track record and the competitive landscape of the PaaS sector within the HR industry. The valuation at IPO and the performance of the stock post-listing will be critical indicators of market confidence in Lucas's business model and growth prospects. Additionally, the fact that the offering was upsized may indicate stronger than anticipated investor interest, which could bode well for the company's debut on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Market Research Analyst Lucas's focus on AI technology within the human resources sector places it within a growing niche of the HR industry that leverages advanced technologies for talent management and recruitment processes. The PaaS model offers scalability and flexibility to its professional clientele, which could be a strong selling point. However, the success of Lucas will depend on how well it differentiates itself from competitors and the effectiveness of its platform in delivering tangible benefits to users.It is important to assess the market size, growth projections and trends in HR tech to understand the potential for Lucas's services. The adoption rate of AI in HR is increasing as companies seek more efficient ways to manage their workforce and Lucas's entry point could be well-timed if their solutions align with current market needs. Nevertheless, the long-term success will hinge on continuous innovation and the ability to retain and grow its customer base in a competitive market. Technology Industry Analyst The role of AI in human capital management is a transformative force, automating and optimizing tasks that were traditionally manual and time-consuming. Lucas's PaaS offering positions the company at the intersection of AI and HR, a sector that is ripe for innovation. The effectiveness of their AI algorithms, data security measures and system integration capabilities will be key factors that determine their market acceptance.Considering the technical complexity of AI platforms, Lucas's ability to provide a user-friendly interface while ensuring robust back-end functionality will be crucial for adoption. It's also worth noting that as a newly public company, Lucas will face increased scrutiny regarding its technology development roadmap and how it plans to sustain technological leadership amidst rapid changes in AI advancements. 03/04/2024 - 09:38 PM NEW YORK, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucas GC Limited (the ""Company"" or ""Lucas""), an artificial intelligence (AI) technology-driven online agent-centric human capital management service provider focused initially on targeting professionals based on Platform-as-a-Service, or PaaS, in the human resources industry, today announced the pricing of its upsized initial public offering (the ""Offering"") of 1,500,000 ordinary shares (the ""Ordinary Shares"") at a public offering price of $4.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $6,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

Forward-looking information in this news release includes, but is not limited to: future capital expenditures, including the amount and nature thereof; future acquisition opportunities including Pine Cliff's ability to execute on those opportunities; future drilling opportunities and Pine Cliff's ability to generate reserves and production from the undrilled locations; oil and natural gas prices and demand; expansion and other development trends of the oil and natural gas industry; business strategy and guidance; expansion and growth of our business and operations; maintenance of existing customer, supplier and partner relationships; supply channels; accounting policies; risks; Pine Cliff's ability to generate adjusted funds flow; Pine Cliff's ability to pay a dividend; and other such matters. All such forward-looking information is based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. The risks, uncertainties and assumptions are difficult to predict and may affect operations, and may include, without limitation: foreign exchange fluctuations; equipment and labour shortages and inflationary costs; general economic conditions; industry conditions; changes in applicable environmental, taxation and other laws and regulations as well as how such laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced; the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital; the effect of weather conditions on operations and facilities; the existence of operating risks; volatility of oil and natural gas prices; oil and gas product supply and demand; risks inherent in the ability to generate sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet current and future obligations; increased competition; stock market volatility; opportunities available to or pursued by us; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The foregoing factors are not exhaustive.Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, this forward-looking information and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking information will transpire or occur including the reduction in municipal taxes and surface land rentals, or if any of them do, what benefits will be derived there from. Except as required by law, Pine Cliff disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Natural gas liquids and oil volumes are recorded in barrels of oil (""Bbl"") and are converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (""Mcfe"") using a ratio of one (1) Bbl to six (6) thousand cubic feet. Natural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (""Boe"") using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) Bbl. This conversion ratio is based on energy equivalence primarily at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. The terms Boe or Mcfe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. One Mcf of natural gas is approximately 1.02 million British thermal units (""MMBtu"").Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of oil, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.All amounts herein are presented in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified. All references to $CAD or $ are to Canadian dollars and monetary references to $US are to United States dollars.

The company plans to achieve this by maintaining a closing bid price of $1.00 or higher for 10 consecutive business days, considering a reverse stock split if needed. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The extension granted to UTime Limited by Nasdaq for compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is a critical operational factor for the company's continued listing on the exchange. A company's failure to meet the Nasdaq's minimum bid price is often seen as an indicator of potential financial instability or investor disinterest, which can lead to decreased liquidity and investor confidence. The extension provides UTime with a grace period to implement strategies like a reverse stock split, which consolidates the number of outstanding shares to increase the stock price, thereby meeting the exchange's requirements.However, such measures can be a double-edged sword. While they may temporarily satisfy listing standards, they can also signal underlying issues with the company's valuation or market perception. Investors typically view reverse stock splits with caution, as they do not inherently improve a company's fundamentals. The impact on the stock market will largely depend on the company's ability to convince investors of its growth prospects and financial health during this extended compliance period. Financial Analyst For stakeholders, the immediate implications of the Nasdaq notification are relatively limited, as the company's shares will continue to be traded without interruption. However, the long-term implications warrant closer examination. UTime's ability to maintain a bid price above $1.00 over a sustained period will be crucial to avoid delisting, which would significantly affect stock market visibility and the ability to attract institutional investors.Investors will be closely monitoring UTime's financial performance and strategic initiatives in the coming months. The company's success in improving its share price through operational growth or financial restructuring will be key to its stock market performance. Should UTime fail to meet the compliance requirements by the deadline, the consequences could include a decline in share price due to reduced investor confidence and potential delisting, which would hinder capital raising efforts and potentially impact the company's growth trajectory. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, UTime's disclosure about the Nasdaq notification and the potential for a reverse stock split is an important transparency measure for current and potential investors. It is imperative that the company adheres to all regulatory requirements and communicates any significant changes to its shareholders. Non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules could lead to legal ramifications, including delisting. The company's consideration of all available options to regain compliance is a proactive approach that may mitigate the legal risks associated with failing to meet the exchange's standards.Shareholders should be aware that a reverse stock split, while legal, often requires shareholder approval and can affect the value of their investment. It is essential for UTime to navigate this process with due diligence, ensuring that all shareholder communications and actions are in line with legal requirements and best practices to maintain corporate governance standards. 03/04/2024 - 09:00 PM NEW YORK, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UTime Limited (“UTime” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: UTME), a mobile device manufacturing company committed to providing cost effective products and solutions to consumers globally and helping low-income individuals from established and emerging markets, today announced that on February 28, 2024, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications Department, granting the Company another 180 calendar days extension, or until August 26, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement.

The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including repaying $700 million 3.35% senior notes due May 15, 2024. Joint book-running managers are Citigroup Global Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Chubb Limited regarding the pricing of a $1 billion public offering of 5.000% senior notes due in 2034 is a significant financial move. The decision to issue debt at a higher interest rate than the existing 3.35% notes may reflect current market conditions where interest rates have risen. For investors, this suggests a strategic approach by Chubb to lock in financing costs for the next decade, possibly anticipating further interest rate hikes.However, the increase in interest costs will affect Chubb's financial statements. The interest expense will rise, reducing net income in the short term. Over the long term, this could be a prudent move if interest rates continue to rise, as refinancing older debt at a higher rate later would be more costly. Investors should monitor the company's interest coverage ratio and overall debt levels in future financial disclosures to assess the impact of this new debt on Chubb's financial health. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the involvement of major financial institutions such as Citigroup, HSBC and Wells Fargo as joint book-running managers indicates a strong market appetite for Chubb's debt securities. The offering's size and the interest rate being higher than the debt it aims to replace also suggest that Chubb is confident in its ability to meet its financial obligations.It's crucial to consider the broader economic context, such as inflation and Federal Reserve policies, which could influence investor sentiment towards fixed-income securities. While the senior notes offer a fixed return, inflationary pressures could erode the real value of future interest payments. Therefore, the market's reception of this offering could serve as an indicator of investor confidence in Chubb's long-term stability and the insurance sector's resilience amid economic uncertainties. Legal Expert The issuance of senior notes is subject to complex securities regulations. Chubb's adherence to the requirement of prospectus supplement and registration under the relevant securities laws is crucial for the legality of the offering. Investors should note that the securities are guaranteed by Chubb Limited, which provides an additional layer of security.Moreover, the explicit statement that the offering does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy in any jurisdiction where such action would be unlawful is a standard legal disclaimer to mitigate the issuer's legal risk. It also informs potential investors of the territorial limitations of the offering, underscoring the importance of understanding the legal framework governing securities before participating in such financial transactions. 03/04/2024 - 08:45 PM ZURICH, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB) announced today that its subsidiary, Chubb INA Holdings Inc., has priced a public offering of $1 billion of 5.000% senior notes due 2034.

Positive Biogen to present new data on its Alzheimer's disease portfolio at the AD/PD™ 2024 conference. Presentations will cover insights into the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

Biogen emphasizes exploring multiple pathologies and modalities in Alzheimer's disease for innovative care. Key presentations include results of BIIB113 study in healthy volunteers, alpha-synuclein co-pathology distribution, lecanemab's efficacy in disrupting tau accumulation, and more. Research aims to push boundaries of innovation and make a real difference in Alzheimer's care. Negative None. Neurology Research Scientist From a neuroscientific perspective, the new data presented by Biogen on its Alzheimer's disease portfolio represents a significant advancement in the understanding of AD pathologies. The development of BIIB113, an oral small molecule inhibitor of tau aggregation, is particularly noteworthy. Tau proteins are integral to the stability of neuronal microtubules; their aggregation is a hallmark of AD and is associated with neurodegeneration. The safety profile and brain target engagement data in healthy volunteers provide a foundational understanding for the potential translational impact of BIIB113. Furthermore, the investigation into alpha-synuclein co-pathology addresses another protein aggregation commonly associated with Parkinson's disease but also present in AD, suggesting a more integrated approach to neurodegenerative disease research and potential cross-applicability of treatments. Clinical Trial Expert The clinical trial design for BIIB113, as highlighted in the upcoming presentations, is crucial for assessing the drug's safety and efficacy. The randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design of the first in-human study is the gold standard for determining causality in clinical outcomes. The ascending dose methodology allows for careful monitoring of the drug's effects at various levels, which is essential for establishing a safe and effective dosing regimen. Additionally, the long-term efficacy data of lecanemab will be of great interest to the medical community, as it may offer insights into the sustainability of treatment benefits over time and inform future trial designs for AD therapeutics. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst In the pharmaceutical industry, the progression of drugs like BIIB113 and lecanemab through the clinical trial phases can have substantial implications for market dynamics. Biogen's focus on novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease taps into a high-need, high-value market, given the lack of curative treatments for this debilitating condition. The safety and target engagement data are early indicators of a drug's potential market viability. Positive results can lead to increased investor confidence and stock valuation, whereas any adverse findings could have the opposite effect. The presentations at AD/PD™ 2024 will likely be scrutinized by investors for signals on Biogen's future revenue streams and competitive positioning within the neurodegenerative treatment landscape. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM New data advances understanding of new approaches to treating Alzheimer’s diseaseResearch on disease progression could help inform future clinical trials CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc.

(GSL) declares a cash dividend of $0.546875 per depositary share for its 8.75% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares. The dividend covers the period from January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2024, and will be paid on April 2, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Global Ship Lease, Inc. indicates a distribution of earnings to shareholders, which is a sign of the company's current profitability and liquidity status. The dividend yield, calculated from the annualized dividend and the share price, is a key metric for income-focused investors. The specific yield of 8.75% for the Series B Preferred Shares is notably high, reflecting a premium to compensate for the higher risk associated with preferred shares compared to common stock.Investors should consider the sustainability of such dividends in the context of the company's earnings, payout ratio and the cyclicality of the shipping industry. Shipping companies face volatile freight rates and operating costs, which can impact their ability to maintain dividend payments. Additionally, the perpetual nature of these preferred shares means that they do not have a maturity date, potentially offering long-term income for investors if the company remains stable. Market Research Analyst Global Ship Lease's dividend announcement may influence the company's stock performance, particularly for the Series B Preferred Shares. Preferred shares typically attract investors seeking stable income and have less exposure to market volatility compared to common shares. However, the shipping industry is subject to macroeconomic factors such as global trade volumes, fuel prices and geopolitical events. These factors can affect the demand for shipping services and, consequently, the company's financial performance.Investors might also consider the implications of the company's capital allocation strategy. By paying dividends, the company is choosing to return capital to shareholders rather than reinvesting it into growth opportunities or debt reduction. This decision could be interpreted as management's confidence in the company's financial health or a lack of viable investment opportunities within the industry. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM LONDON, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Ship Lease, Inc.

Positive Revenue increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $23.9 million compared to $22.0 million in the same period in 2022. Total operating costs and expenses decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 decreased compared to the same periods in 2022. Nektar entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement financing with gross proceeds of $30 million in March 2024. Preclinical data on NKTR-255 in combination with obinutuzumab was presented at the 65th ASH Annual Meeting in December 2023. Nektar initiated a Phase 2b study of rezpegaldesleukin in patients with atopic dermatitis in October 2023. A clinical study collaboration with AbelZeta Pharma for evaluating NKTR-255 in NSCLC patients was announced in September 2023. Nektar regained full rights to rezpegaldesleukin from Eli Lilly in August 2023. A strategic reprioritization and cost restructuring plan was announced in April 2023 to focus on immunology and inflammation programs. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Nektar Therapeutics indicate a significant reduction in cash and investments, from $505.0 million at the end of 2022 to $329.4 million at the end of 2023. This reduction reflects the company's cash burn rate and capital allocation over the year. The expectation that current funds will sustain operations into the third quarter of 2026 provides a runway that investors will closely monitor, as it implies a need for additional funding or revenue generation within the next few years.Revenue remained relatively stable with a slight decrease year-over-year, which could signal that the company is maintaining its existing business while attempting to grow its pipeline. The reduction in operating costs and expenses, particularly in R&D and G&A, is a positive sign of cost control and the strategic reprioritization mentioned by the company. However, the net loss for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2023, even when excluding non-cash goodwill and other impairment charges, suggests that the company is still far from profitability. Medical Research Analyst The progression of Nektar's immunology and inflammation pipeline, especially the potential value-creating data readouts for REZPEG in atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, is a critical factor for future valuation. The initiation of a Phase 2b study for REZPEG and the presentation of positive preclinical data for NKTR-255 in combination with obinutuzumab are indicative of a maturing pipeline that could lead to significant milestones. However, the actual impact on the company's financials will depend on the successful completion of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual market adoption.From an R&D perspective, the decrease in expenses is attributed to the wind down of the bempegaldesleukin program, which suggests a strategic shift in focus towards other promising candidates. The reprioritization of the pipeline following the reacquisition of rezpegaldesleukin rights from Eli Lilly also indicates a reevaluation of the company's strategic direction, which could have long-term implications for its R&D effectiveness and portfolio diversification. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and Nektar's strategic development activities must be viewed in the context of market demand for immunology and inflammation treatments. The potential for REZPEG and NKTR-255 to address unmet medical needs in atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and hematological malignancies could position the company in lucrative markets if clinical outcomes are favorable.Moreover, the collaboration with AbelZeta Pharma to evaluate NKTR-255 in advanced NSCLC patients could open up additional market opportunities, but it's essential to consider the competitive landscape and prevalence of anti-PD-1 therapies. The corrected efficacy data for rezpegaldesleukin and the regaining of full rights from Eli Lilly could be seen as a reset for the company's market strategy, potentially restoring investor confidence if managed effectively. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Cash and investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2023, were $329.4 million as compared to $505.0 million at December 31, 2022. Nektar's cash and marketable securities are expected to support strategic development activities and operations into the third quarter of 2026. ""We believe that the progress that we have made in the past nine months puts Nektar in a strong position to advance our highly promising immunology and inflammation pipeline programs,"" said Howard W. Robin, President and CEO of Nektar. ""We are looking forward to multiple potential value-creating data readouts for REZPEG in the first half of 2025 in both atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. As we build our pipeline in immunology, we are also conducting IND-enabling studies for NKTR-0165, our novel agonist antibody targeting TNFR2."" Summary of Financial Results Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.9 million as compared to $22.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $90.1 million as compared to $92.1 million in 2022. Total operating costs and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $57.4 million as compared to $74.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total operating costs and expenses for the full year 2023 were $353.8 million as compared to $468.2 million in 2022. Operating costs and expenses for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2023 decreased as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in research and development expenses, general and administrative expense and restructuring, impairment and costs of terminated program, partially offset by $76.5 million in non-cash goodwill impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2023. R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $29.9 million as compared to $34.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $114.2 million as compared to $218.3 million in 2022. R&D expense decreased for full year 2023 primarily due to the wind down of the bempegaldesleukin program. G&A expense was $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $21.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. G&A expense for the full year 2023 was $77.4 million as compared to $92.3 million in 2022. G&A expense decreased for the full year 2023 primarily due to the wind down of the bempegaldesleukin program. Restructuring, impairment and other costs of the terminated program were $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $52.0 million in the full year 2023, as compared to $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $135.9 million in the full year 2022. The full year 2023 amount includes $7.9 million in severance expense, $35.3 million in non-cash lease impairment charges, $5.5 million for clinical trial and related employee compensation costs for the wind down of the bempegaldesleukin program, and $3.3 million in other restructuring costs. The full year 2022 amount includes $30.9 million in severance expense, $65.8 million in non-cash lease impairment charges, $31.7 million for clinical trial and related employee compensation costs for the wind down of the bempegaldesleukin program, as well as $7.5 million in other restructuring costs. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $42.1 million or $0.22 basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of $59.7 million or $0.32 basic and diluted loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $276.1 million or $1.45 basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of $368.2 million or $1.97 basic and diluted loss per share in 2022. Excluding the $111.8 million in non-cash goodwill and other impairment charges, net loss, on a non-GAAP basis, for the full year 2023 was $164.3 million or $0.86 basic and diluted loss per share. 2023 and Recent Business Highlights In March 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with TCG Crossover Fund, an institutional accredited investor, to sell securities in a private placement financing for gross proceeds of approximately $30 million, before deducting expenses.In December 2023, Nektar's collaborators from the Cairo Laboratory at New York Medical College presented preclinical data on NKTR-255 in combination with obinutuzumab at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. NKTR-255 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of expanded Natural Killer (NK) cells when combined with obinutuzumab against rituximab-resistant Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells in vitro and significantly improved the survival of mice xenografted with Raji-4RH compared to controls.In October 2023, Nektar initiated a Phase 2b study of rezpegaldesleukin in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The Company expects initial data from the study in the first half of 2025.In October 2023, Nektar presented data from the Phase 1b study of rezpegaldesleukin in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) in an oral session at the 2023 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD that were treated with rezpegaldesleukin showed dose-dependent improvements in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Validated Investigator Global Assessment (vIGA), Body Surface Area (BSA), and Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) over 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, which were sustained post-treatment over an additional 36 weeks.In September 2023, Nektar announced a clinical study collaboration with AbelZeta Pharma, Inc. (formerly Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc.) to evaluate NKTR-255 in combination with C-TIL051 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that are relapsed or refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy. Under the collaboration, AbelZeta will add NKTR-255 to its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial being conducted at Duke Cancer Institute. Enrollment for this trial is ongoing.In August 2023, Nektar announced promising new and corrected rezpegaldesleukin efficacy data which were previously reported in 2022 and inaccurately calculated by former collaborator Eli Lilly and Company. Nektar regained the full rights to rezpegaldesleukin from Eli Lilly in April 2023.In April 2023, Nektar announced a strategic reprioritization and cost restructuring plan in order to enable a new focus of its pipeline on immunology and inflammation programs.Conference Call to Discuss Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Financial Results Nektar management will host a conference call to review the results beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time/2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, March 4, 2024.

DIAMONDROCK HOSPITALITY DECLARES DIVIDEND FOR FIRST QUARTER 2024,2024-03-04T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,DiamondRock Hospitality Company (DRH) announces quarterly cash dividend for common shareholders and preferred stockholders.,"DIAMONDROCK HOSPITALITY DECLARES DIVIDEND FOR FIRST QUARTER 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary DiamondRock Hospitality Company (DRH) announces quarterly cash dividend for common shareholders and preferred stockholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by DiamondRock Hospitality Company signifies a distribution of earnings to shareholders, which is a direct indicator of the company's financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. The common share dividend of $0.03, although modest, represents a return on investment for shareholders and is a signal that the company is maintaining a level of profitability. The preferred stock dividend of $0.515625, tied to the 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, is a more substantial commitment and reflects the fixed income-like nature of preferred shares, offering a predictable stream of income.Investors typically view such announcements as positive, as they provide tangible returns. However, the size of the dividend relative to the company's earnings per share (EPS) and the payout ratio (dividends relative to net income) are crucial in assessing the sustainability of these dividends. If the payout ratio is too high, it might indicate that the company is returning too much money to shareholders instead of reinvesting in growth, which could be a concern for long-term value creation. On the other hand, a low payout ratio could suggest that the company has room to grow its dividends or invest in other strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst The hospitality industry is subject to cyclical demand and can be sensitive to economic conditions. As such, the ability of DiamondRock Hospitality Company to continue paying dividends may be influenced by external factors such as travel trends, occupancy rates and consumer spending. A consistent dividend payout can be seen as a sign of strength and may attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing the demand for the company's shares.It is also important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price. This metric helps investors compare the attractiveness of the dividend relative to other companies in the market. A higher yield can make the stock more appealing to investors seeking income, although it is essential to balance this with the overall risk profile of the company and the sustainability of its dividend policy. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst DiamondRock Hospitality Company, operating within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. This regulatory requirement ensures a steady flow of dividends to investors but also limits the amount of earnings the company can reinvest in property acquisitions and improvements. As a REIT, the company's dividends are also influenced by its property portfolio's performance, including occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADRs) and revenue per available room (RevPAR).Analyzing the company's portfolio health, such as its geographic diversity, property types and exposure to different market segments, is essential in understanding the risk associated with its dividends. Additionally, the real estate market's overall health, interest rate environment and access to capital markets can significantly impact the company's ability to finance operations and manage debt, which in turn affects dividend sustainability. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM BETHESDA, Md., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DiamondRock Hospitality Company (the ""Company"") (NYSE: DRH) announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share to be paid on April 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024. The Company's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.515625 per share on its 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 18, 2024. About the Company DiamondRock Hospitality Company is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) that is an owner of a leading portfolio of geographically diversified hotels concentrated in leisure destinations and top gateway markets.

Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM LITTLETON, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rare Element Resources Ltd. (the “Company” or “RER”) (OTCQB: REEMF) is pleased to announce that it has completed a new mineral resource estimate based on maximizing the recovery of the key magnet materials of neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), terbium (Tb) and dysprosium (Dy), as well as other critical rare earths such as lanthanum (La). The estimate is focused on the Bull Hill deposit at the Bear Lodge Project, located in northeastern Wyoming, with long-term upside existing in the Carbon, Whitetail, and Taylor deposits located within the Company’s mineral claims. The mineral resource was estimated using data from 252 core holes drilled between 2009 and 2013, including 20,491 assay intervals that totaled 186,712.5 feet (56,910 meters) of drilling from the Company’s drill hole database. The full database includes approximately 500 drill holes, totaling over 285,000 feet (86,868 meters) of core. Additionally, it incorporates recovery data generated from the 2021 pilot plant testing of the Company’s proprietary recovery and separation technology, which is now being utilized in the demonstration plant project being constructed by RER in Upton, Wyoming. The mineral resource estimate, utilizing a cut-off grade of 2.18% total rare earth oxide (“TREO”), focuses on the oxide and oxide-carbonate zones, which are considered the optimum feed yielding the best recoveries and costs from the Company’s proprietary recovery and separation technology. Bull Hill TREO Mineral Resource Summary for the Total Oxide @ 2.18% TREO Cutoff Resource Class Metric Tonnes %TREO Contained TREO Metric Tonnes Recovered NdPr Metric Tonnes (millions) (1000’s) (1000’s) Measured 2.04 4.53 92.4 18.4 Indicated 3.98 3.85 153.1 31.3 Measured & Indicated (M&I) 6.02 4.08 245.5 49.7 Inferred 1.90 3.61 68.5 14.4 Resource Notes: Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that any part of the mineral resource will be converted to mineral reserves in the future. All figures are rounded to reflect the accuracy of the grade and tonnage estimates. This mineral resource estimate is reported in accordance with Regulation S-K (CFR Title 17 Part 229 Items 1300-1305) at a cut-off grade of 2.18% TREO. Only certain rare earth elements (La, Nd, Pr, Dy, and a heavy rare earth element mixed oxide including Yb, Tm, Tb, Er, Ho, Lu) are considered payable for pit optimization purposes. Commodity price assumptions used in the preparation of the mineral resource estimate are set forth in the TRS. The estimated overall NdPr process recovery is 90%. “With demand for magnet materials expected to grow exponentially over the next 30 years, driven primarily by their use in defense and green technologies, it makes sense to focus our efforts on those key magnet materials in this resource model. This will ensure that over the longer term, we are aligned with the national security interests and decarbonization goals of the United States,” stated Brent Berg, President and CEO of the Company. “Our proprietary rare earth recovery and separation technology enabled us to look at the body of geological data we have generated through a different lens. That work allows us to focus on a higher grade and smaller pit design. I believe this strategy provides the greatest opportunity for the Company to capitalize on the projected rare earth demand growth and most clearly aligns with our innovative technology while allowing us to preserve the long-term, upside potential of the Bear Lodge Project.” The Company is preparing a Technical Report Summary (“TRS”) in accordance with Regulation S-K (CFR Title 17 Part 229 Items 601(b)(96) and 1300-1305), as well as an updated technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). The TRS will be filed on the date of this release on a current report on Form 8-K and will be available at www.sec.gov. The NI 43-101-compliant report will be filed on the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedarplus.ca within 45 days of the date of this press release. The mineral resource work and technical reports are being undertaken by Alan C. Noble, P.E., principal engineer of Ore Reserves Engineering (ORE), based on his modeling work developed on the Bear Lodge Project over the past decade. The full list of economic assumptions and cut-off grade sensitivity for the evaluation will be fully discussed in both the TRS and the NI 43-101 compliant technical reports. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates do not account for all modifying factors. These mineral resource estimates include measured, indicated, and inferred mineral resource categories. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of geological uncertainty and cannot be included in mineral reserves. There is also no certainty that the inferred mineral resources will be converted to measured and indicated (M&I) mineral resource categories through further drilling and exploration. Rare Element Resources Ltd. is a publicly traded, strategic materials company focused on delivering rare earth products for technology, energy, and defense applications by advancing the Bear Lodge REE Project in northeast Wyoming. Bear Lodge is a significant mineralized district containing many of the less common, more valuable, critical rare earths that are essential for high-strength permanent magnets, electronics, fiber optics, laser systems for medical technology and defense, as well as technologies like electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines.

ALBEMARLE ANNOUNCES PROPOSED PUBLIC OFFERING OF DEPOSITARY SHARES,2024-03-04T21:11:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Albemarle Corporation (ALB) has announced a $1.75 billion offering of depositary shares representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding growth capital expenditures and repaying outstanding commercial paper.","ALBEMARLE ANNOUNCES PROPOSED PUBLIC OFFERING OF DEPOSITARY SHARES Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Albemarle Corporation (ALB) has announced a $1.75 billion offering of depositary shares representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding growth capital expenditures and repaying outstanding commercial paper. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Albemarle Corporation's decision to commence an offering of $1.75 billion in depositary shares is a significant financial event that warrants a close examination of its implications for the company's capital structure and future growth prospects. The offering is substantial, representing a potential increase in the company's market capitalization and liquidity. By granting the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase additional shares, the total offering could increase by up to 15%, further impacting the company's equity base.The intended use of proceeds for growth capital expenditures, particularly in lithium operations, underscores Albemarle's strategic focus on expanding its footprint in the energy sector. This move is timely, given the increasing demand for lithium in battery production for electric vehicles. The repayment of outstanding commercial paper with the proceeds will also improve the company's debt profile, potentially leading to a more favorable credit rating and reduced interest costs in the future.Investors should note the mandatory conversion feature of the preferred stock, which will convert into common stock in 2027. This could lead to dilution of existing shareholders' equity but may also reflect management's confidence in the company's long-term growth and profitability, which could underpin the common stock's value over time. Market Research Analyst Albemarle's move to raise capital through a preferred stock offering is indicative of broader market trends where companies are seeking to lock in capital for strategic investments amidst fluctuating market conditions. With no current public market for these depositary shares or the preferred stock, the success of this offering will be a bellwether for investor appetite for hybrid financial instruments that offer both equity and fixed income characteristics.The choice to list the depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange could enhance visibility and liquidity for the new securities, potentially attracting a diverse investor base. Market response to similar offerings has been mixed and Albemarle's case will provide further insight into the market's valuation of growth prospects in the lithium sector, which is pivotal for the renewable energy and electric vehicle markets. Legal Expert From a regulatory standpoint, Albemarle's adherence to SEC requirements by filing a shelf registration statement, including a base prospectus and related preliminary prospectus supplement, is an essential step in ensuring compliance and transparency for potential investors. The legal framework governing such offerings aims to protect investors by mandating the disclosure of all material information.Prospective investors must be cognizant of the terms detailed in the prospectus, particularly the rights and preferences associated with the preferred stock, which include conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights. The legal implications of these rights can have a significant impact on the future financial standing of the company and the value proposition for investors. 03/04/2024 - 04:11 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) (""Albemarle"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in providing essential elements for mobility, energy, connectivity, and health, today announced that, subject to market and other conditions, it has commenced an offering (the ""Offering"") of $1.75 billion of depositary shares (""Depositary Shares""), each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (""Preferred Stock""), in an underwritten registered public offering. In addition, Albemarle expects to grant the underwriters in the Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $262.5 million of Depositary Shares. Albemarle intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other uses, funding growth capital expenditures, such as the construction and expansion of lithium operations in Australia and China that are significantly progressed or near completion, and repaying the Company's outstanding commercial paper. Holders of the Depositary Shares will be entitled to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights, subject to the provisions of a deposit agreement. Unless earlier converted, each share of the Preferred Stock will automatically convert on or around March 1, 2027 into a number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (""Common Stock""), based on the applicable conversion rate, and each Depositary Share will automatically convert into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to a proportionate fractional interest in such shares of Common Stock. The conversion rates, dividend rate and other terms of the Preferred Stock will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering of the Depositary Shares. Currently, there is no public market for the Depositary Shares or the Preferred Stock. Albemarle intends to apply to list the Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ALB PR A.""

(ARE) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $1.27 per common share for Q1 2024, representing a 5% increase over the previous year. The company plans to reinvest $2.1 billion into new development projects while maintaining a low FFO payout ratio. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.'s increased quarterly cash dividend is a strong signal of the company’s financial health and management's confidence in its future cash flows. The 5 percent increase in the annual dividend payout is a positive indicator for investors, reflecting the company's ability to generate higher net cash from operating activities. This is particularly noteworthy in the real estate sector, where steady cash flow is critical for both operations and investor confidence.Furthermore, the dividend payout ratio of 56 percent is a critical metric, as it indicates the company is not overextending itself by distributing cash at the expense of future growth. A low payout ratio suggests that the company retains a substantial portion of earnings to reinvest in new projects, which is essential for long-term value creation. The projected aggregate $2.1 billion of net cash for reinvestment after dividends over the next five years underscores the company's robust operational performance and strategic planning. Real Estate Market Analyst The focus on maintaining a highly leased pipeline of new Class A/A+ development and redevelopment projects is indicative of the company's commitment to high-quality assets. Class A/A+ properties are considered to be in the best locations with superior construction and amenities, which generally attract high-profile tenants and command higher rents. This strategic positioning in the market is likely to enhance the company's competitive advantage and ensure sustainable revenue growth.The company's ability to increase its dividend while sustaining a low funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio is a testament to its operational efficiency. The FFO is a key measure in the real estate industry that approximates the cash generated by the company's business, excluding the impact of depreciation and other non-cash items. A low FFO payout ratio indicates that the company is generating sufficient cash to comfortably cover its dividend payments, which is a reassuring sign for investors looking for stable income streams. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM PASADENA, Calif., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.27 per common share for the first quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on April 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 28, 2024. The common stock dividend for the 12 months ending March 31, 2024 of $5.02 per common share represents an increase of 24 cents, or 5 percent, over the 12 months ended March 31, 2023. The dividend allows the company to share its continued high-quality, strong and increasing net cash provided by operating activities with its common shareholders while retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into its highly leased pipeline of new Class A/A+ development and redevelopment projects. For the five-year period ending December 31, 2024, the company expects to generate for reinvestment an aggregate $2.1 billion of net cash provided by operating activities after dividends.1 Additionally, its dividend payout ratio (quarterly common stock dividends divided by quarterly funds from operations) remains favorably low at 56 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Growth in the company's net cash provided by operating activities continues to generate opportunities to increase the company's quarterly cash dividend per common share while maintaining a low FFO payout ratio. 1 Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends (i) excludes timing differences such as changes in operating assets and liabilities and (ii) includes deductions for distributions to the company's consolidated real estate joint venture partners.

The sale includes deposit accounts with an approximate balance of $39 million and loans with an approximate balance of $3 million, set to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2024.","Arrow Announces Acquisition of Whitehall, N.Y. Branch Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Arrow Financial Corporation announces the acquisition of a branch office in Whitehall, New York, from Berkshire Bank, aiming to expand market presence and enhance shareholder value. The sale includes deposit accounts with an approximate balance of $39 million and loans with an approximate balance of $3 million, set to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Arrow Financial Corporation's acquisition of the Berkshire Bank branch represents a strategic expansion that could have a positive effect on Arrow's market share and regional presence. The addition of $39 million in deposit accounts and $3 million in loans is a relatively modest increase in assets, but it can lead to enhanced revenue streams through cross-selling opportunities and improved customer service capabilities. The acquisition aligns with Arrow's growth strategy and could signal to investors a proactive approach to scaling operations and diversifying assets.From a financial perspective, the key metrics to watch post-acquisition will include the cost of integration, the retention rate of the newly acquired customers and the ability of Arrow Financial to leverage the new branch to increase its loan and deposit base. Investors should also monitor how the acquisition impacts Arrow's overall financial health, particularly its capital adequacy ratios, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). These indicators will provide insights into the efficiency and profitability of the acquisition in the longer term. Market Research Analyst Given the local nature of community banking, the acquisition of the Whitehall branch by Glens Falls National Bank could strengthen Arrow Financial's competitive position in Washington County. The move may be viewed favorably by existing and potential customers due to the bank's commitment to the community and its emphasis on local expertise. Customer retention and satisfaction are critical in the banking sector and a smooth transition for new customers will be essential for realizing the full value of the acquisition.It is also important to assess the competitive dynamics of the region. If Berkshire Bank's presence in the area was significant, Arrow's acquisition could reduce competition, potentially allowing for better pricing power. However, if the market is still competitive, Arrow will need to differentiate itself through superior customer service or product offerings to capitalize on its expanded footprint. Legal Expert The acquisition's success is contingent upon receiving customary regulatory approvals, which is a standard procedure in the banking industry. These approvals are critical to ensure that the transaction meets all legal and regulatory requirements, including antitrust laws and banking regulations. The legal process involves scrutiny of the acquisition's impact on competition and the local economy, as well as the financial stability of the combined entity.Moreover, the promise of employment for all employees associated with the Whitehall branch is not only a positive community relations move but also helps mitigate potential legal and regulatory concerns related to labor. Ensuring a smooth transition for employees can prevent disruptions in service during the integration phase and aligns with regulatory expectations for fair employment practices during mergers and acquisitions. 03/04/2024 - 05:15 PM GLENS FALLS, N.Y., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Arrow Financial Corporation (NasdaqGS® - AROW) today announced that its bank subsidiary, Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Company, has entered into a definitive agreement with Berkshire Bank, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.

The sale is targeted for completion by the end of the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Following the anticipated completion of the sale, Glens Falls National Bank will operate a total of nine branches in Washington County. ""We are thrilled to announce the acquisition of the Whitehall location from Berkshire Bank, and we are eager to welcome its customers to our Arrow Family of Companies,"" said Dave DeMarco, President and CEO of Arrow Financial Corporation and Glens Falls National Bank.

However, the size and sustainability of the dividend yield, compared to industry averages and the company's historical payouts, are crucial for evaluating the attractiveness of AEO as a dividend stock.Investors should consider the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio that is too high might not be sustainable in the long term, whereas a lower ratio could indicate that the company is reinvesting more back into growth opportunities. Additionally, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price, provides a measure of the income generated from a stock investment. It's important to compare this yield to those of other companies in the retail sector to assess competitiveness. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements often have implications for market perceptions of a company's stability and future outlook. For a retailer like American Eagle Outfitters, dividends can reflect confidence in ongoing operations and the ability to generate consistent cash flow amidst market challenges such as fluctuating consumer demand and competition. Analysts and investors might interpret this announcement as a sign of operational strength and a commitment to delivering shareholder value, which could influence the stock's market performance.Furthermore, the retail industry is sensitive to economic cycles and a company's ability to maintain a dividend during downturns can be particularly reassuring to investors. It's also worth noting that regular dividends can attract a certain investor demographic looking for regular income streams, possibly affecting the stock's investor base and trading volumes. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.

The estimated sources of the distribution for 2024 include net investment income, realized gains, and return of capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Sprott Focus Trust, Inc. regarding its quarterly distribution is a significant piece of information for investors and market analysts. The distribution rate, pegged at 6% of the rolling average of the prior four quarter-end net asset values (NAVs), is a key indicator of the Fund's performance and its ability to generate value for shareholders. The decision to allow shareholders to receive the distribution in additional shares or cash is also noteworthy, as it provides flexibility and could influence the stock's liquidity and volatility around the ex-dividend date.It is important to assess the Fund's distribution components, which include net investment income, net realized short-term gains, net realized long-term gains and return of capital. A high percentage of the distribution coming from realized gains suggests a potentially successful investment strategy, whereas a significant return of capital might indicate that the Fund is returning part of the investors' original investment, which could be perceived as a less positive signal regarding the Fund's ability to generate earnings through its operations. Tax Expert From a taxation perspective, the composition of Sprott Focus Trust's distribution has implications for investors. The breakdown between net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains and return of capital affects how the distribution is taxed. Long-term gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, which aligns with the incentive for long-term investment. The portion classified as return of capital is not taxed immediately but reduces the cost basis of the investment, potentially increasing capital gains when the shares are sold. Investors should consider their individual tax situations when deciding whether to take the distribution in cash or reinvest in additional shares. Market Research Analyst The Fund's Distribution Policy and its quarterly distributions are likely to be closely monitored by market research analysts, as they can impact investor sentiment and the Fund's attractiveness in the market. The policy's flexibility, with the Board of Directors having the discretion to change the annual rate, introduces a level of uncertainty that needs to be factored into any investment decision. Furthermore, the determination of share price for reinvestment on a specified future date can also play a role in short-term trading strategies, as investors may try to anticipate the impact of this pricing on the Fund's market value. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM TORONTO, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprott Focus Trust, Inc.

West Virginia American Water Receives Base Rate and Surcharge Orders from Public Service Commission of West Virginia,2024-03-04T21:36:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"West Virginia American Water receives approval for $287 million infrastructure investments, including water and wastewater upgrades. Rates for customers adjusted, with average monthly increases for water and wastewater customers.","West Virginia American Water Receives Base Rate and Surcharge Orders from Public Service Commission of West Virginia Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary West Virginia American Water receives approval for $287 million infrastructure investments, including water and wastewater upgrades. Rates for customers adjusted, with average monthly increases for water and wastewater customers. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The approval of adjusted water and wastewater rates by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia represents a significant regulatory decision with economic implications. The authorized additional revenue of $18.4 million, stemming from over $220 million in infrastructure investments, underscores the necessity for utility companies to modernize their systems to comply with regulatory standards and meet consumer demand. The investment in infrastructure, including water mains and treatment plants, is essential for long-term economic stability and public health.However, the rate increases for residential and wastewater customers, averaging $8 and $12 per month respectively, will likely have a ripple effect on household budgets. While the improvements are crucial, they also raise concerns about affordability, especially among low-income households, despite the PSC's expansion of reduced rates for those at or below 200% of the federal poverty rate. The balance between necessary infrastructure investment and consumer rate impact is a delicate one that regulators and companies must navigate carefully. Financial Analyst For investors and stakeholders in the utility sector, the PSC's order is a clear indicator of West Virginia American Water's commitment to capital reinvestment and regulatory compliance. The additional revenue authorized through rate adjustments is a direct reflection of the company's ongoing investments and could signal a stable revenue stream in the long term. From a financial perspective, this may strengthen the company's position for future financing and credit ratings.However, the denial of tiered rates for certain low-income customers suggests potential limitations on the company's pricing strategy, which could affect public perception and regulatory relationships. It is important for stakeholders to monitor the implementation of the new rates and system improvement charges, as well as the company's efficiency measures to maintain affordability, which could impact customer satisfaction and retention. Market Research Analyst The utility industry is sensitive to both regulatory changes and infrastructure demands. The approval of rate adjustments by the PSC is an indication of the industry's ongoing need to invest in infrastructure to maintain service quality and compliance with environmental regulations. This scenario is common across the United States, where aging infrastructure requires significant investment.Market trends suggest that consumers are increasingly aware of the quality of their utilities services, which can influence customer loyalty and company reputation. West Virginia American Water's proactive approach to infrastructure improvement could enhance its competitive position in the market. However, the challenge lies in balancing investment costs with customer rate increases without compromising service quality or affordability, which is a key factor in customer retention and satisfaction. 03/04/2024 - 04:36 PM Supports Needed Infrastructure investments of $287 Million CHARLESTON, W.Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Public Service Commission of West Virginia (PSC) issued an order late Friday, February 23 approving adjusted water and wastewater rates for West Virginia American Water customers following the company’s May 2023 request for a rate adjustment. The order authorizes an additional $18.4 million in revenue, driven by over $220 million in completed infrastructure investments made since 2020, including upgrades to water mains, treatment plants, tanks, valves, booster stations and other infrastructure necessary to maintain and improve water quality, service reliability and fire protection. The new base rates are effective as of February 25, 2024, and follow a 300-day statutory review of the company’s rate request. As part of the request, the company sought to establish tiered rates for certain low-income customers following the federal poverty level guidelines; however, the PSC denied that proposal. The PSC did expand the 2018 reduced rates for low-income customers to those at or below 200% of the federal poverty rate, and the company will work to stand up that program and provide customers with further details as soon as practicable. On Friday, March 1, the company also received an order for its June 2023 Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) request for additional annualized revenues. The $5.9 million order included the company’s first approved Wastewater System Improvement Charge (WSIC). The surcharges became effective on March 1, 2024 and include $67 million in system-wide upgrades that West Virginia American Water will make across its water and wastewater systems in 2024. “West Virginia American Water is committed to making needed infrastructure improvements across our service areas so we can continue to comply with water quality and environmental regulations and meet customers’ water and wastewater service needs,” said Robert Burton, president, West Virginia American Water. “In addition, we will continue to remain focused on opportunities for greater efficiencies to help maintain affordable rates.” Residential water customers can expect to see an average increase of approximately $8 per month, which includes the approved adjusted rates and related system improvement charges. Wastewater customers can expect to see an average increase of approximately $12 per month. As the company continues to make calculations from this order, the aforementioned increases are subject to change. West Virginia American Water also wants to remind its customers about several targeted customer assistance programs. Residential customers have the option of paying bills under a budget billing plan to have predictable monthly payments and avoid seasonal spikes, and customers with past-due bills are offered flexible payment arrangements through installment agreements. The company also offers a reduced rate program that provides a year-round 20 percent discount on residential water and wastewater rates for low-income customers determined eligible by the West Virginia Department of Human Services. Additionally, the company helps fund the West Virginia Utility Assistance Program Dollar Energy Fund, through which eligible customers can receive one-time emergency grants applied directly to their water bills. Customers can learn more about assistance options by calling 1-800-685-8660 or visiting the Customer Assistance Programs page on the company website.

BridgeBio Pharma Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock,2024-03-04T21:17:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. announces a $250 million public offering of common stock, with an option for additional $37.5 million, managed by J.P. Morgan, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., and Mizuho. The offering is subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals.","BridgeBio Pharma Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. announces a $250 million public offering of common stock, with an option for additional $37.5 million, managed by J.P. Morgan, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., and Mizuho. The offering is subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Positive None. Negative The public offering might dilute the existing shareholders' ownership as more shares are issued, potentially impacting the stock price negatively. Financial Analyst The initiation of a public offering by BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. indicates a strategic move to raise capital. The size of the offering, $250 million with an additional $37.5 million option for underwriters, is significant and suggests a robust use of proceeds that could range from funding ongoing research and development to possibly reducing debt or financing acquisitions.Analyzing the market's response to such an offering will be crucial. An oversubscribed offering could signify strong investor confidence in BridgeBio's future, while a lackluster response might hint at market concerns over the company's valuation or its prospects. Furthermore, the involvement of high-profile financial institutions as book-runners and managers may enhance investor confidence due to the perceived due diligence and support from these entities.It’s also important to consider the dilutive effect on current shareholders. Issuing new shares can dilute existing ownership percentages and potentially depress the stock price if the market perceives the offering as a sign that the company is overvalued or desperate for cash. However, if the capital is used effectively to accelerate growth or improve the balance sheet, it could lead to long-term shareholder value. Market Research Analyst BridgeBio's focus on genetic diseases and cancers places it within a highly competitive and innovative sector where capital demands are high due to the costs associated with research, clinical trials and bringing products to market. The decision to raise funds through a public offering can be seen as a proactive approach to ensuring financial flexibility.In the biopharmaceutical industry, the timing of such offerings can be strategic, often aligning with positive trial results or FDA approvals to capitalize on momentum. However, without specific catalysts mentioned, investors will be keen on understanding the intended use of proceeds. Market sentiment can be influenced by how effectively BridgeBio communicates its strategy and how the raised capital will contribute to its pipeline's progression or the commercialization of its therapies.Long-term industry trends show increasing investment in personalized medicine and targeted therapies, which could play in BridgeBio's favor if it holds a promising pipeline. Investors will closely monitor how this offering aligns with industry growth trajectories and BridgeBio's operational efficiencies relative to its peers. Legal Expert In the context of securities law, BridgeBio's use of a shelf registration statement is noteworthy. This mechanism allows companies to register securities and sell them in one or more separate offerings based on market conditions. The fact that the registration automatically became effective upon filing indicates a well-prepared and expedited process, which is often the case for established issuers with a track record of SEC compliance.Investors should note that the offering's success is subject to legal and regulatory considerations, including market conditions and the requirement for a prospectus supplement. The final prospectus supplement will provide essential details, including the use of proceeds and risk factors, which are critical for making informed investment decisions.Furthermore, the press release's disclaimer highlights the legal boundaries of such communications, ensuring that the company is not seen as making an offer before the registration statement is filed and effective, which is a regulatory safeguard for investors. 03/04/2024 - 04:17 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

The company aims to expand its workforce, fulfill new customer requirements, and increase business opportunities.","CPS Technologies Announces MMAP Award Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CPS Technologies Corporation (CPSH) receives a $200,000 award from the Massachusetts Manufacturing Accelerate Program (MMAP) to purchase a 5-axis CNC machine, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities. The company aims to expand its workforce, fulfill new customer requirements, and increase business opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The award granted to CPS Technologies Corporation by the Massachusetts Manufacturing Accelerate Program signifies a strategic investment in advanced manufacturing technology. The procurement of a 5-axis CNC machine is likely to enhance the company's competitive edge by expanding its manufacturing capabilities. This move not only positions CPS to meet more complex client requirements but also potentially increases the company's operational efficiency. By bringing more work in-house, CPS can reduce reliance on external suppliers, which may lead to cost savings and improved quality control.Furthermore, the investment in new machinery is indicative of a commitment to innovation and growth within the local economy. The anticipated workforce expansion and training programs underscore a positive impact on employment and skill development in the Massachusetts area. Investors and stakeholders might view this as a long-term value creation strategy, as workforce enhancement can lead to increased productivity and potentially higher quality outputs. Financial Analyst The financial injection of $200,000 into CPS Technologies Corporation is relatively modest when considered against the backdrop of industrial capital expenditures. However, the specific allocation towards a 5-axis CNC machine could have a leveraged effect on the company's financials. It is crucial to monitor how this capital expenditure translates into return on investment through enhanced production capabilities and the acquisition of new business. Stakeholders should look for improvements in key financial metrics such as gross margin and EBITDA in subsequent financial reporting periods as indicators of the investment's efficacy.Additionally, the company's initiative to grow its workforce in response to increased manufacturing capacity suggests confidence in sustained demand for its products. This could be a signal to the market of anticipated revenue growth, although it also implies an increase in operational expenses. The balance between these two factors will be critical in assessing the financial health and growth trajectory of CPS post-investment. Manufacturing Process Expert The integration of a 5-axis CNC machine into CPS Technologies' manufacturing process represents a significant technological advancement. Unlike traditional 3-axis machines, a 5-axis CNC can move a part or a tool on five different axes simultaneously, allowing for complex shapes and geometries to be machined with high precision. This capability is particularly beneficial for industries requiring intricate components, such as aerospace, defense and medical devices.For CPS, this could mean entry into new markets or the enhancement of its product offerings in existing markets. The ability to produce more complex parts in-house not only streamlines the production process but also reduces the time-to-market for new products. This strategic move could result in a stronger market position and a more diverse customer base, which is crucial for business resilience and long-term success. 03/04/2024 - 04:16 PM NORTON, Mass., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPS Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:CPSH) (“CPS” or the “Company”) today announced it has received an award from the Massachusetts Manufacturing Accelerate Program (“MMAP”) in response to a proposal submitted by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2023. The award, valued at $200,000, will support the purchase of a 5-axis CNC machine and expand the Company’s manufacturing capabilities to better serve its clients. This new capability will build on the Company’s core competencies while enabling CPS to fulfill a new generation of customer requirements and capture additional business. The addition of a 5-axis CNC machine will also allow the Company to complete more work in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, more specifically, in-house. With this increased manufacturing capacity, CPS expects to grow its workforce to keep up with demand and train existing and new machinists and technicians to operate and maintain the 5-axis CNC. CEO & President Brian Mackey said of the award, “The Company has a long history here in Massachusetts, and we are committed to remaining a key contributor to our local manufacturing economy. We are proud to receive this award from MMAP and look forward to passing on the benefits that a 5-axis CNC provides through expanded offerings to our customers.” About CPSCPS is a technology and manufacturing leader in producing high-performance energy management components that facilitate the electrification of the economy. Our products and intellectual property include critical pieces of the technology puzzle for electric trains and subway cars, wind turbines, hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, the smart electric grid, 5G infrastructure and others.

The company made progress in developing its Version 1.0 Surgical System, securing hospital partnerships, and appointing a new Company President. Operating expenses decreased in Q4, with a cash burn rate of $63.4 million for 2023. Vicarious Surgical expects a cash burn of $50 million in 2024. Positive Successful transition of Beta 2 surgical system to Version 1.0 in 2023. Signed a fourth major U.S. hospital system agreement with Intermountain Health. Executed a $47 million equity follow-on offering to extend cash runway. Appointed Randy Clark as Company President for core business functions. Operating expenses decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the prior year. Cash burn rate for 2023 was $63.4 million. Full year 2024 cash burn guidance of approximately $50 million. Negative Increase in operating expenses for full year 2023 compared to the prior year. Adjusted net loss for full year 2023 was $76.3 million. GAAP net loss for full year 2023 was $71.1 million. Negative net loss per share for full year 2023 compared to a net income in the prior year. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Vicarious Surgical indicates a strategic shift towards capital efficiency, as seen by the reduced operating expenses and a narrowed adjusted net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year. The company's decision to execute a $47 million equity follow-on offering, which extended the cash runway, is a critical move for a company in the growth phase, especially in a capital-intensive industry like medical robotics. Investors should note the cash burn reduction from $63.4 million in 2023 to the projected $50 million in 2024, suggesting improved financial management and the impact of prior cost reduction initiatives. However, the GAAP net loss widening in the full year compared to the net income in the prior year could raise concerns about the company's profitability trajectory and warrants close monitoring of future financials. Medical Technology Market Analyst From a market adoption perspective, Vicarious Surgical's partnership with over 250 hospitals, including a new agreement with Intermountain Health, is significant. It reflects the company's potential to penetrate the market and suggests confidence among healthcare providers in the company's technology. The transition from the Beta 2 surgical system to the Version 1.0 indicates a maturity in product development that could be pivotal for the company's growth. The anticipation of cadaveric testing in the spring and the integration of the V1.0 system in the fall are key milestones that could impact the company's valuation, as they are critical steps towards commercialization. The appointment of Randy Clark as Company President may also streamline operations and strengthen the company's commercial strategy, which is crucial for the successful rollout of new medical technologies. Medical Research Analyst The development of Vicarious Surgical's Version 1.0 Surgical System and its upcoming cadaveric testing are pivotal in the clinical validation process of medical devices. Successful testing outcomes can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially accelerate FDA approval processes. As the company refines its regulatory strategy, stakeholders should consider the stringent requirements for medical device approval and the associated risks and delays that can affect the company's timelines and financials. The integration hurdles mentioned could also signal complexities in the system that may require additional R&D investment, potentially affecting the company's long-term financial health and market position. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM Version 1.0 Surgical System On Track for Cadaveric Testing this Spring Achieves 2023 Cash Burn Objective of $63.4 Million 2024 Cash Burn Guidance of $50 Million Reflects Prior Cost Reduction Initiatives WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vicarious Surgical Inc.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), Vicarious Surgical provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”, and together with Adjusted Net Loss, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). The Company presents Non-GAAP Financial Measures in order to assist readers of its consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that its management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes. Vicarious Surgical’s Non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing its financial performance over multiple periods. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are key performance measures that Vicarious Surgical’s management uses to assess its operating performance. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures facilitate internal comparisons of Vicarious Surgical’s operating performance on a more consistent basis. Vicarious Surgical uses these performance measures for business planning purposes and forecasting. Vicarious Surgical believes that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures enhance an investor’s understanding of Vicarious Surgical’s financial performance as it is useful in assessing its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Vicarious Surgical believes are not representative of its core business. The Non-GAAP Financials Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate this measure in the same manner. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When evaluating Vicarious Surgical’s performance, you should consider the Non-GAAP Financial Measures alongside other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including net loss. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not replace the presentation of Vicarious Surgical’s U.S. GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Vicarious Surgical’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In this press release, Vicarious Surgical has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, and the calculation for Adjusted EPS.

(WISH) reports financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023, with revenues at $53 million, a 57% YoY decrease. Net Loss at $68 million. Adjusted EBITDA shows a loss of $54 million. Preliminary January 2024 results indicate revenues of $14 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $13 million. Positive Strong decline in revenues for Q4 and fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Net Loss decreased from $110 million to $68 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved from $95 million to $54 million in Q4 2023. Preliminary January 2024 results show a further decrease in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA loss. Actual results may vary from preliminary estimates due to financial closing procedures. Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial year-over-year revenue decline of 57% reported by ContextLogic Inc. is a critical indicator of the company's deteriorating sales performance. The Core Marketplace, which is a significant segment of their business, experienced an even steeper decline. This suggests that the platform is facing major challenges in retaining and attracting customers, which is essential for sustainable growth. The decrease in Product Boost and Logistics revenues further corroborates the trend of reduced commercial activity across the board.Despite the decrease in net loss from the previous year, the company still reported a significant net loss of $68 million. This improvement may be attributed to cost-cutting measures or more efficient operations, yet it is essential to scrutinize the sustainability of these improvements. The Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowing is another sign of potential operational optimization, but investors should question whether these are one-off improvements or indicative of a turnaround strategy taking effect.The negative Free Cash Flow is also a concern, as it reflects the company's inability to generate enough cash to support operations and invest in growth. The preliminary results for January 2024 do not suggest an immediate recovery, which could further strain the company's financial position and impact its ability to fund future initiatives. Market Research Analyst ContextLogic's performance must be evaluated within the broader ecommerce market, which is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The significant revenue decline could be a result of increased competition, changes in consumer behavior, or an ineffective value proposition. It is vital to analyze market trends to understand the company's positioning and the effectiveness of its growth strategies.Furthermore, the mobile ecommerce sector is driven by user experience and platform engagement. The decline in Core Marketplace revenues could suggest that ContextLogic is not keeping pace with competitors in terms of technology, product assortment, or customer engagement strategies. Insights into the company's market share and customer acquisition costs would be essential to assess the efficacy of their marketing efforts and the potential for recovery. Economist From an economic perspective, ContextLogic's financial results may be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as consumer spending patterns and economic cycles. The decrease in revenue could be partially attributed to broader economic downturns, which typically result in reduced discretionary spending. It is important to consider the economic climate when evaluating the company's performance and future outlook.Additionally, the company's international operations may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations, trade policies and global market dynamics. An analysis of the economic indicators relevant to the regions in which ContextLogic operates could provide insights into external factors impacting the company's financial health. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc.

See below for more information regarding our presentation of non-GAAP metrics in the section titled: “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Previously Announced Transaction On February 12, 2024, ContextLogic Inc. announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) had unanimously approved an agreement to sell substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities, principally comprising its Wish ecommerce platform (the “Asset Sale”), to Qoo10, an ecommerce platform operating localized online marketplaces in Asia, for approximately $173 million in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. The purchase price represents approximately $6.50 per share and an approximately 44% premium to ContextLogic’s closing stock price on February 9, 2024, the last trading day prior to announcing the transaction. Following closing of the transaction, ContextLogic will have limited operating expenses and a balance sheet that will be debt-free and will include net cash proceeds from the asset sale, approximately $2.7 billion of Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and certain retained assets. The Board intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to help monetize its NOLs. The Board also intends to explore the opportunity for a financial sponsor to help ContextLogic realize the value of its tax assets. The Company expects to complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2024, subject to the approval of ContextLogic’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency. As part of the agreement, ContextLogic will begin trading under a new ticker symbol within 30 days of the closing of the transaction. In light of the pending transaction, ContextLogic will not host a conference call or live webcast to discuss these financial results. First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Guidance Due to the pending transaction, ContextLogic has discontinued providing guidance.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: interest and other income (expense), net (which includes foreign exchange gain or loss, foreign exchange forward contracts gain or loss and gain or loss on one-time non-operating transactions); provision or benefit for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes; lease impairment related expenses; and other items. Additionally, in this news release, we present Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The reconciliation between historical GAAP and non-GAAP results of operations is provided below. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP and other operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of the company’s performance for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors concerning its financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative financial measure to net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. We also provide Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that represents net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third parties to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. The reconciliation between net cash used in operating activities and Free Cash Flow is provided below. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our net cash used in operating activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Further information on these and additional risks that could affect Wish’s results is included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and future reports that Wish may file with the SEC from time to time, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. Any forward-looking statement made by Wish in this news release speaks only as of the day on which Wish makes it. Wish assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release. The unaudited financial results in this news release are estimates based on information currently available to Wish. While Wish believes these estimates are meaningful, they could differ from the actual amounts that the company ultimately reports in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Wish assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these estimates prior to filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The preliminary unaudited information relating to our financial results for the month ended January 31, 2024 reflects Wish’s preliminary estimates with respect to such results based on currently available information, is not a comprehensive statement of Wish’s financial results and is subject to completion of Wish’s financial closing procedures. Wish’s actual results may differ materially from these estimates. These estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for our full interim or annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Further, Wish’s preliminary estimated results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the remainder of the first quarter of 2024, the full year 2024, or any future period as a result of various factors. A Note About Metrics The numbers for some of our metrics, including MAUs and LTM Active Buyers, are calculated and tracked with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third party. We use these metrics to assess the growth and health of our overall business. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user or merchant base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measurement as the methodologies used require significant judgment and may be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we regularly review and adjust our processes for calculating metrics to improve their accuracy, and our estimates may change due to improvements or changes in technology or our methodology.

The product shows superior results in Phase 3 trials, targeting a $1.3 billion market. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The FDA approval of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% marks a significant milestone for Formosa Pharmaceuticals and AimMax Therapeutics, signaling a potential shift in the post-operative ocular treatment landscape. The product's entry into the ophthalmic steroid market, valued at $1.3 billion, introduces a new competitor into a space that has not seen a novel steroid introduction in over a decade and a half.The proprietary APNT™ nanoparticle formulation platform could represent a technological advantage, potentially offering enhanced delivery and efficacy. The superior clinical outcomes demonstrated in Phase 3 trials, notably the rapid and sustained clearance of inflammation and pain relief, position the product as a strong contender against existing treatments. This could lead to a rapid adoption curve and market penetration, potentially reshaping market dynamics and influencing the stock performance of involved companies. Medical Research Analyst From a medical standpoint, the approval of a new ophthalmic steroid with a 'super potent' corticosteroid and a convenient dosing regimen (twice daily for 14 days without tapering) addresses a significant need for post-operative care in ocular surgery. The impact of this new treatment option on patient outcomes cannot be overstated, as the ease of use and the elimination of a tapering schedule can lead to better adherence and, subsequently, better recovery outcomes.Furthermore, the statistically significant results from the clinical trials (p<0.001) not only underscore the efficacy of the drug but also suggest a potential for setting a new standard of care in post-operative inflammation and pain management. This could lead to a shift in prescribing habits and an increase in market share for Formosa Pharmaceuticals and its partners. Market Research Analyst The ophthalmic steroid market serves a substantial and consistent patient population, with an estimated seven million ocular surgeries performed annually in the United States alone. The introduction of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% could disrupt the current market, offering a new option to ophthalmologists and patients. The strategic partnership with Eyenovia for U.S. commercialization is particularly noteworthy, as it leverages Eyenovia's expertise in the field to maximize the product's market reach and penetration.Given the product's favorable posology and clinical profile, it is poised to capture a significant share of the market. The mid-year launch timeline allows for anticipation build-up among healthcare providers and patients, potentially accelerating uptake upon release. The market response to this launch could be a significant indicator of the product's future trajectory and its impact on Formosa Pharmaceuticals' financial performance. 03/04/2024 - 05:55 PM TAIPEI, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Taiwan-based Formosa Pharmaceuticals (6838.TWO) and AimMax Therapeutics (United States) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% (APP13007), for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Utilizing a super potent corticosteroid, clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% is derived from Formosa Pharma's proprietary APNT™ nanoparticle formulation platform. This innovative formulation represents the first FDA-approved ophthalmic clobetasol propionate product and the first new steroid in over 15 years on the ophthalmic market, offering patients a convenient and straightforward dosing regimen (twice daily for 14 days without tapering). Two Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated rapid and sustained clearance of inflammation and pain relief that was statistically and clinically superior to its matching placebo (p<0.001). This novel eyedrop enters a $1.3 billion dollar market for topical ophthalmic steroids and steroid combinations, driven by an estimated seven million ocular surgeries performed annually in the United States. ""This approval marks Formosa Pharma's entry into the global marketplace and provides a critical foundation and momentum for continued development, as well as advancement of new endeavors. With immense gratitude, we thank our development colleagues at AimMax Therapeutics for their wisdom and tenacity in guiding the program through to success. Equally, we recognize the tireless efforts of our employees and unwavering support from colleagues in the realization of this corporate milestone,"" said Erick Co, President and CEO of Formosa Pharmaceuticals. With FDA approval now secured, we look forward to working with our U.S. commercialization partner, Eyenovia, Inc., to reach ophthalmologists and ocular surgery patients, while in parallel working to expand into additional territories and advance our earlier stage pipeline."" ""We congratulate Formosa Pharma for the achievements and are extremely pleased with the collaborative opportunity to bring this novel and impressive formulation to the market to benefit millions of patients for the ease of use and rapid recovery and regain of visual acuity after ocular surgery"" said AimMax Therapeutics' Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Laurene Wang, Ph.D. ""We believe clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% will be a very synergistic addition to our commercial product portfolio, and we are honored that Formosa has entrusted Eyenovia with the marketing of this important asset in the United States,"" stated Michael Rowe, Chief Executive Officer of Eyenovia. ""We are already working diligently toward a robust launch of this differentiated and desirable product mid-year, and we believe that, given its more favorable posology and profile compared to other post-surgical steroid options, it has the potential to capture a significant share of an estimated $1.3 billion annual market opportunity.""

Full year adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 140 bps to 6.8%. The company provided outlook and guidance for full year 2024, focusing on enhancing operational efficiency and growing the Electrical Systems segment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An analysis of CVG's reported financials indicates a mixed performance. The company's revenue contraction of 5.0% in Q4 2023, primarily due to a strike and reduced demand, is a cause for concern as it suggests vulnerability to labor disputes and market fluctuations. However, the growth in the Electrical Systems segment by 19.4% is a positive sign, showing successful diversification efforts which could mitigate risks associated with other underperforming segments.The reported increase in full-year adjusted EBITDA margins to 6.8% and a significant debt paydown leading to a reduced leverage ratio from 2.2x to 1.5x reflect effective cost management and an improved financial structure. These developments could enhance investor confidence and potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating, impacting the cost of capital for CVG.Despite a softer fourth quarter, the record annual sales and the new business wins valued at over $150 million, concentrated in the Electrical Systems segment, signal potential for future growth. The forecast for 2024, considering the expected decline in Class 8 truck builds, suggests that management anticipates continued resilience based on their diversification strategy. This forward-looking statement, while optimistic, should be weighed against industry trends and macroeconomic factors that could impact demand across CVG's portfolio. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CVG's emphasis on operational efficiency and quality standards is aligned with broader industry trends towards lean operations and high-quality outputs. The focus on growing the Electrical Systems segment responds to increasing electrification and automation in industrial applications, which is a growing market.However, the reduced demand in Vehicle Solutions, Aftermarket and Industrial Automation segments may reflect broader economic headwinds or sector-specific challenges. The decline in these segments could be indicative of competitive pressures or a shift in consumer preferences. CVG's ability to pivot and capture new business in these areas will be crucial for sustained growth.The 16% projected decline in Class 8 truck builds for 2024, as per ACT Research, poses a significant challenge for CVG's Vehicle Solutions segment. Investors should monitor how CVG's diversification strategy and new business in the Electrical Systems segment can offset this anticipated downturn. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain a balanced portfolio will be key to CVG's performance in the coming fiscal year. Debt Market Analyst CVG's financial results show a proactive approach to debt management, with a full-year debt paydown of $10.9 million and a notable decrease in net debt. The improved leverage ratio of 1.5x is a significant reduction from the previous 2.2x, indicating a stronger balance sheet and potentially lower financial risk for creditors.Despite the decline in revenue for Q4, the free cash flow generation of $19 million in 2023 is a robust indicator of the company's liquidity and ability to service its debt obligations. This financial flexibility could be advantageous for CVG in pursuing strategic investments or weathering economic volatility.Investors in the debt market should consider the company's guidance for 2024 cautiously. While the company's debt profile has improved, the potential impact of lower Class 8 truck production on the company's revenue streams could affect its ability to generate similar levels of free cash flow and continue its debt reduction trajectory. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM Fourth quarter sales of $223 million, record annual sales of $995 million Full year adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 140 bps to 6.8% Provides outlook and guidance for full year 2024 NEW ALBANY, Ohio, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CVG (NASDAQ: CVGI), a diversified industrial products and services company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights (Compared with prior-year period, where comparisons are noted) Revenue of $223.1 million, down 5.0% due primarily to the impacts of a strike-related labor stoppage at a customer facility and reduced demand across Vehicle Solutions, Industrial Automation and Aftermarket segments; however, Electrical Systems segment continues to show strong growth with 19.4% increased revenue.Operating income of $5.0 million, up $9.0 million; adjusted operating income of $6.6 million, down $1.8 million. Lower adjusted operating income was driven primarily by lower volumes and increased SG&A.Net income of $23.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $32.0, or $(0.98) per diluted share; adjusted net income of $2.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, versus $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.Adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million, down $2.9 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.6%, down from 5.7%. Full Year 2023 Highlights (Compared with prior-year period, where comparisons are noted) Revenue of $994.7 million, driven by pricing and the contribution of new business wins in Electrical Systems, offset by lower sales volume in Industrial Automation, Vehicle Solutions, and Aftermarket segments.New business wins in excess of $150 million when fully ramped; these wins were concentrated in our Electrical Systems segment.Operating income of $48.1 million, up $27.9 million, and adjusted operating income of $51.1 million, up $14.5 million. The increase in operating income was due to improved pricing and business mix.Full-year 2023 debt paydown was $10.9 million, and net debt declined to $103.7 million; leverage ratio declined to 1.5x from 2.2x. James Ray, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with our 2023 results as CVG continued winning new business, particularly in Electrical Systems, and made progress on the Company’s transformation plan, driving record annual sales and improved profitability for the year. As we look to fiscal 2024, we are focused on enhancing operational efficiency and quality standards, growing our Electrical Systems segment to be our largest business, as well as facilitating cross-functional collaboration among our various business segments to strengthen our core Vehicle Solutions business and cultivating stronger customer relationships.” Mr. Ray concluded, “As the new CEO, I am grateful for the hard work of our talented global teams that help drive improvements in our business every day, and I am looking forward to a strong fiscal 2024.” Andy Cheung, Chief Financial Officer, added, “We delivered another year of record revenue driven by continued price realization and new business wins, despite softer fourth quarter revenues which were impacted by, among other things, a UAW labor strike at one customer facility. Our strong performance resulted in free cash flow of $19 million in 2023, which has helped us further pay down debt and reduce our net leverage to 1.5x. During the quarter, we initiated several restructuring actions to better align our resources with investments in growth product lines, which we expect will further enhance profitability across our underlying core businesses. Despite industry forecasts for a lower Class 8 truck build in 2024, we expect our financial performance in 2024 to be more resilient as we continue our diversification strategy reflecting primarily the success in growing our Electrical Systems business.” Financial Results(amounts in millions except per share data and percentages) Fourth Quarter 2023 2022 ChangeRevenues$223.1 $234.9 (5.0)%Gross profit$26.2 $12.4 111.3%Gross margin 11.7% 5.3% Adjusted gross profit1$26.0 $23.9 8.8%Adjusted gross margin1 11.7% 10.2% Operating income (loss)$5.0 $(4.0) NM2Operating margin 2.2% (1.7)% Adjusted operating income1$6.6 $8.4 (21.4)%Adjusted operating margin1 2.9% 3.6% Net income (loss)$23.3 $(32.0) NM2Adjusted net income (loss)1$2.9 $1.4 107.1%Earnings (loss) per share, diluted$0.70 $(0.98) NM2Adjusted earnings (loss) per share, diluted1$0.09 $0.04 125.0%Adjusted EBITDA1$10.3 $13.3 (22.6)%Adjusted EBITDA margin1 4.6% 5.7% 1See Appendix A for GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation 2Not meaningful Consolidated Results Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Fourth quarter 2023 revenues were $223.1 million compared to $234.9 million in the prior year period, a decline of 5.0%. The decrease in revenues is due primarily to the impact of a strike at a customer facility, previous year benefit from a post-COVID backlog in Asia-Pacific, and reduced demand in Vehicle Solutions, Aftermarket, and Industrial Automation segments, which more than offset an increase in Electrical Systems revenue. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fourth quarter 2023 revenues by $1.8 million, or by 0.7%.Operating income for the fourth quarter 2023 was $5.0 million compared to operating loss of $4.0 million in the prior year period. Foreign currency translation also favorably impacted fourth quarter 2023 operating income by $0.7 million. Excluding special costs, the fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted operating income was $6.6 million, down 21.4%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven primarily by lower volumes, strike impact, and higher SG&A.Interest expense was $2.4 million and $2.9 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on variable debt.Net income was $23.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to net loss of $32.0 million, or $(0.98) per diluted share, in the prior year period. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility, $37.8 million of cash and $160.1 million availability from revolving credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of $197.9 million. Segment Results Fourth Quarter 2023 Results (Compared with prior-year period, where comparisons are noted) Vehicle Solutions Segment Revenues were $128.4 million, a decrease of 10.1% primarily resulting from lower volumes and the impact of a strike at a customer facility during the quarter.Operating income for the fourth quarter 2023 was $3.6 million, a decrease of 1.8%. Excluding special costs, the fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted operating income was $4.0 million, a decrease of 3.9%, as compared to the fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes partially offset by pricing improvement and cost controls. Electrical Systems Segment Revenues were $56.2 million, an increase of 19.4%, primarily resulting from increased pricing and sales volume.Operating income was $6.7 million, an increase of 25.0% primarily attributable to pricing and volume leverage. Aftermarket and Accessories Segment Revenues were $31.4 million, a decrease of 8.1%, primarily resulting from decreased sales volume.Operating income was $3.4 million, an increase of 7.3%.

Industrial Automation Segment Revenues were $7.1 million, a decrease of 35.0%, due to lower sales volume from decreased customer demand.Operating income was $0.9 million, compared to operating loss of $11.9 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted operating income increased to $0.3 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to cost controls. Outlook CVG is providing the following outlook for the full year 2024: Metric2024 Outlook ($ millions)Net Sales$915 - $1,015Adjusted EBITDA$60 - $73 This outlook reflects, among others, current industry forecasts for North American Class 8 truck builds.

In general, the non-GAAP measures exclude items that (i) management believes reflect the Company’s multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning and to determine incentive compensation. Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on the Company’s financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors and to comparable reporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated. What were CVG's fourth quarter sales in 2023?

Reaches Cooperation Agreement with Legion Partners Asset Management Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc. announces the addition of three new independent directors to the Board and the formation of an Operational and Financial Performance Task Force to enhance operational and financial performance. The Company has entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC, appointing Richard N. Peretz, Wendy M. Weinstein, and Lester Owens to the Board. Legion Partners will support the Company by voting in favor of nominated directors at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The Cooperation Agreement includes provisions for margin improvement opportunities and financial metric targets for 2024 and 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Corporate Governance Expert The appointment of new independent directors and the formation of an Operational and Financial Performance Task Force are strategic moves that can have significant implications for corporate governance and oversight. Independent directors bring fresh perspectives and are often instrumental in ensuring that a company's board is functioning effectively and in the best interest of shareholders. The inclusion of experienced professionals like Mr. Peretz, Ms. Weinstein and Mr. Owens can potentially enhance the board's expertise, particularly in the areas of compensation, governance and financial oversight. The planned reduction in board size post-annual meetings is also indicative of a push towards a leaner, more efficient governance structure. This is a positive sign for investors as it suggests a commitment to streamlining operations and improving financial performance. Financial Analyst The formation of the task force and the agreement to pursue margin improvement opportunities indicate a proactive approach to financial management. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a critical financial metric that measures a company's operational profitability. The targets set forth in the Cooperation Agreement, aiming for a minimum of 5.7% in fiscal 2024 and 6.2% for fiscal 2025, are ambitious and suggest a focus on cost control and operational efficiency. Achieving these targets would likely be viewed favorably by investors, as higher margins can lead to improved cash flows and potentially higher returns on investment. Additionally, the agreement for Legion Partners to vote in support of the board's nominees and the mutual non-disparagement clauses create a cooperative environment that could stabilize the company's governance and align the interests of the board, management and significant shareholders. Market Research Analyst The Chefs' Warehouse operates in the specialty food distribution industry, which is characterized by thin margins and intense competition. The appointment of directors with a mandate to identify margin improvement opportunities is particularly relevant in this context. The food distribution industry is also subject to fluctuations in commodity prices and consumer demand, making operational efficiency and financial performance key areas for competitive advantage. By bringing in directors with expertise in these areas, the company is signaling its intent to strengthen its market position. Investors and stakeholders will likely monitor the impact of these appointments and the task force's recommendations on the company's market share and overall industry standing. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM Three New Independent Directors Join the Board with Five Incumbent Directors Who Have Served for Five Years or Longer Stepping off by the 2025 Annual Meeting Operational and Financial Performance Task Force Will be Formed to Support Identifying Margin Improvement Opportunities RIDGEFIELD, Conn., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc.

As contemplated by the Cooperation Agreement, on March 4, 2024, the Company temporarily increased the size of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to fourteen members and appointed two new independent directors, Richard N. Peretz and Wendy M. Weinstein, to the Board. The Company has agreed to nominate Mr. Peretz and Ms. Weinstein for election at the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2024 Annual Meeting”). Further, as provided in the Cooperation Agreement, a third new independent director, Lester Owens, was appointed to the Board on March 4, 2024 and will be nominated for election at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting. Mr. Peretz was appointed as a member of the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board and Ms. Weinstein was appointed as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board.

Further, pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, the Board has agreed to form an Operational and Financial Performance Task Force with the purpose of improving the Company’s operational and financial performance, including identifying and making recommendations to the Board and management on margin improvement opportunities, which will include Mr. Peretz and Ms. Weinstein. The Board will, upon consultation with the Operational and Financial Performance Task Force, retain a nationally recognized independent consulting firm to assist with the activities of the Operational and Financial Performance Task Force. In addition, Legion Partners has agreed to vote its shares in support of any director nominated and recommended by the Board at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting, in addition to certain customary standstill provisions and other voting agreements for the duration of the standstill period.

(ATXS) reported financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, highlighting progress in STAR-0215 for HAE and STAR-0310 for atopic dermatitis. They anticipate proof-of-concept data for STAR-0215 in Q1 2024 and an IND submission for STAR-0310 by year-end 2024. Astria closed an offering, raising $125.0 million, with a cash position of $246.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Positive None. Negative Increase in operating losses due to acquired in-process R&D expense for STAR-0310 license agreement. Net loss increased to $72.9 million for the full year 2023 compared to $51.8 million in 2022. Net cash used in operating activities rose to $30.2 million for Q4 2023 from $10.7 million in Q4 2022. Financial Analyst Reviewing Astria Therapeutics' financial results reveals a strategic emphasis on their lead programs, STAR-0215 and STAR-0310. The cash position of $246.5 million, bolstered by the recent underwritten offering, suggests a solid runway into mid-2027. This financial stability is vital for investors, as it indicates the company can sustain its operations without the immediate need for additional capital. However, the increased operating loss and net loss, both quarterly and annually, reflect the capital-intensive nature of R&D in the biopharmaceutical industry. Investors should monitor the burn rate and consider the potential dilutive effects of future financings. Medical Research Analyst The progress of STAR-0215 and STAR-0310 is of particular interest. STAR-0215's advancement into a pivotal Phase 3 program, pending successful proof-of-concept results, could position it as a first-choice preventative therapy for HAE. Its favorable safety profile and potential for infrequent dosing are competitive advantages. On the other hand, STAR-0310's preclinical promise as a best-in-class OX40 antagonist for atopic dermatitis could fill a significant market need. However, the inherent risks of drug development, such as clinical trial failures or regulatory setbacks, could impact both the timeline and the financial outlook of Astria. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the therapeutic areas targeted by Astria—HAE and atopic dermatitis—represent markets with high unmet needs and substantial commercial potential. The company's strategic focus on these areas could lead to significant market penetration, provided the clinical outcomes are positive. The anticipation of initial proof-of-concept data for STAR-0215 and the IND submission for STAR-0310 are milestones that could influence investor sentiment and stock volatility. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, as these factors will be key determinants of Astria's success in bringing these therapies to market. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM -- ALPHA-STAR Trial of STAR-0215 Initial Proof-of-Concept Data in HAE Patients Expected Q1 2024 -- -- STAR-0310, Potential Best-in-Class OX40 Program for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis, on Track for Expected IND Submission by Year-End 2024 and Phase 1a Initiation in Q1 2025 -- BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Astria Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATXS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing life-changing therapies for allergic and immunological diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “We have strong conviction in the potential for STAR-0215 to be the first-choice preventative therapy for HAE,” said Jill C. Milne, Chief Executive Officer at Astria Therapeutics. “Our final data from the Phase 1a trial demonstrate that STAR-0215, in addition to having a trusted modality and proven mechanism, has a favorable safety profile with low risk of injection site pain and has the potential to achieve rapid and durable protection against HAE attacks. We are looking forward to sharing initial proof-of-concept data in HAE patients this quarter and believe they could support dosing as infrequently as every six months. STAR-0310 for atopic dermatitis also remains on track for expected preclinical results later this year and an IND submission by year-end.” STAR-0215 The ALPHA-STAR Phase 1b/2 trial of STAR-0215 in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE) is on track. Initial proof-of-concept results are expected in the first quarter of 2024. ALPHA-STAR is a global, open-label, proof-of-concept trial assessing single and multiple doses of STAR-0215 in patients with HAE types I and II. The trial is evaluating safety and tolerability, changes in HAE attack rate, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and quality-of-life assessments. The initial proof-of-concept results are expected to inform on three and six month dosing and include efficacy results in the form of attack rate reduction, safety and tolerability, PK, and PD. Additionally, the company expects to have data from single and multiple doses in patients. Pending proof-of-concept results from the ALPHA-STAR trial, Astria expects to progress directly to a pivotal Phase 3 program which is anticipated to initiate in the first quarter of 2025. A Long-Term Open-Label Trial, ALPHA-SOLAR, has been initiated and is enrolling participants from ALPHA-STAR, with data from participants who have received multiple doses of STAR-0215 now accruing. The trial is assessing the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of STAR-0215. Participants are receiving STAR-0215 every three or six months. Final results from the Phase 1a trial were shared at the AAAAI Annual Meeting in Washington D.C. These results confirm early proof of concept in healthy subjects for STAR-0215 as a potential preventative HAE therapy with a favorable safety profile, long half-life, and durable PD. STAR-0310 Astria is developing STAR-0310, a monoclonal antibody OX40 antagonist that incorporates YTE technology, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). STAR-0310, a preclinical stage program, has the potential to have the best-in-class profile in AD. Astria expects to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for STAR-0310 by year-end 2024 and plans to initiate a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy subjects in the first quarter of 2025, with initial results from the trial expected in the third quarter of 2025. Astria intends to present information on the preclinical profile of STAR-0310 at upcoming scientific conferences in 2024. Underwritten Offering In February 2024, Astria closed an underwritten offering of 10,340,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $125.0 million before deducting underwriting fees and commissions and other offering expenses. The financing was led by RA Capital Management, with participation from Perceptive Advisors, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, TCGX, Driehaus Capital Management, and Adage Capital Partners L.P. in addition to other existing shareholders. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, Astria had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $246.5 million, compared to $188.8 million as of September 30, 2023. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, together with gross proceeds from approximately $145.0 million in financing activity in Q1 2024, will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into mid-2027. As of February 29, 2024, there were 54,903,061 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company’s current operating plan centers on the development of STAR-0215 and STAR-0310, including (i) for STAR-0215, support for all program activities up to the completion of a planned Phase 3 pivotal trial, and (ii) for STAR-0310, the anticipated submission of an IND and the initiation and completion of the planned Phase 1a clinical trial of healthy subjects (and any related anticipated milestone payments). Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $30.2 million, compared to $10.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the full year 2023 was $68.4 million, compared to $43.5 million for the full year 2022. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $11.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $42.1 million for the full year 2023, compared to $34.3 for the full year 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to advancement of STAR-0215 from IND-enabling activities and a single-site clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2022 into multi-site international clinical trials in patients in 2023. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $25.7 million for the full year 2023, compared to $19.2 million for the full year 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in employee expenses due to company growth. Operating Loss: Loss from operations was $34.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $14.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $83.0 million for the full year 2023, compared to $53.5 million for the full year 2022. The increase in operating losses was largely attributable to the $15.2 million in acquired in-process R&D expense associated with the license agreement of the STAR-0310 candidate. Net Loss: Net loss was $31.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $13.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and $72.9 million, or $2.42 per share for the full year 2023, compared to $51.8 million, or $3.55 per share for the full year 2022. Net Loss Per Share Basic and Diluted: Net loss per share basic and diluted was $0.86 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.72 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Berkshire Bank's East Syracuse branch by Pathfinder Bancorp represents a strategic move that could bolster Pathfinder's market presence and financial metrics. With an additional $198 million in deposits and $32 million in loans, Pathfinder's liquidity profile and loan portfolio are poised for enhancement. The expected favorable internal rate of return and earnings per share accretion suggest a positive outlook for shareholder value. However, the actual financial impact will depend on the execution of the integration and the cost efficiencies realized from the consolidation.It is crucial to monitor the post-acquisition performance to assess whether the anticipated accretion to earnings materializes and the tangible book value earn back period aligns with projections. The market will also look closely at the capital ratios post-acquisition to ensure that the balance sheet remains robust enough to support further growth. Pathfinder's strategic positioning within the region, coupled with an expanded asset base of approximately $1.7 billion, could provide a competitive edge in the local banking landscape. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of a branch from Berkshire Bank by Pathfinder Bancorp indicates a competitive step in the regional banking sector. The East Syracuse branch's location and physical space may enhance Pathfinder's customer service and operational capabilities. The strategic move to acquire a branch with a strong historical presence and customer base can be seen as an effort to deepen market penetration and customer loyalty.Pathfinder's emphasis on maintaining personal connections and the decision to retain existing branch employees align with the trend of community banks leveraging local ties to differentiate themselves in a market dominated by larger national banks. The integration of the branch and its employees will be a critical factor in retaining customer trust and minimizing disruption. The impact on the local banking market could be significant, as Pathfinder strengthens its presence and potentially attracts new customers through its expanded services and regional branch network. Economist This transaction between Pathfinder and Berkshire Bank is reflective of the consolidation trend within the banking industry, which can lead to increased market concentration in certain regions. The acquisition's impact on the local economy should be positive, as it suggests a commitment to growth and may lead to enhanced financial services for both consumers and businesses in the East Syracuse area.Pathfinder's strategy to focus on community-centric banking and relationship-driven values could foster economic stability and support for local businesses.

Nonetheless, it is important to consider the broader implications of banking consolidation on competition and consumer choice in the long term. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM OSWEGO, N.Y., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.

The proceeds will be used for the development of various programs and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The successful closing of Viking Therapeutics' underwritten public offering is a significant financial milestone, indicating robust investor interest and a strong market appetite for the company's shares. The offering's size, with over 7 million shares at $85.00 each, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $632.5 million, is substantial for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm. This capital influx will bolster Viking's financial position, enabling accelerated development of its therapeutic programs. Furthermore, the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares underscores confidence in Viking's potential.From a financial perspective, the involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers and co-managers lends credibility to the offering. It is essential to note that the proceeds, before expenses, are considerable and are intended for the development of Viking's leading drug candidates and general corporate purposes. This allocation of funds is expected to catalyze the company's research and development efforts, potentially leading to advancements in treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders.Investors should monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of capital deployment as it can significantly impact Viking's future valuation and stock performance. The company's strategic focus on its VK2809, VK2735 and VK0214 programs will likely be a critical factor in its operational progress and success in the competitive biopharmaceutical landscape. Biotech Market Analyst The capital raised by Viking Therapeutics through this public offering is poised to fund the continued development of its pipeline products, which target metabolic and endocrine disorders—a therapeutic area with significant unmet medical needs. The company's lead candidates, VK2809, VK2735 and VK0214, have the potential to address conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, respectively.It is crucial to understand the competitive landscape and the current stage of clinical development for these candidates. The success of these programs will be instrumental in determining Viking's market position and future revenue streams. Furthermore, the allocation of funds towards general research and development could lead to the discovery of new drug candidates, expanding Viking's portfolio and potential market reach.Investors and stakeholders should consider the long-term implications of the company's R&D investments, as the biotech sector is characterized by high risk and high reward. The time frame for drug development and regulatory approval is lengthy and the outcome is uncertain, but successful product launches could significantly enhance shareholder value. Pharmaceutical Legal Expert The offering was conducted under an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which allows for timely capital raising opportunities as market conditions become favorable. The immediate effectiveness of the shelf registration upon filing with the SEC simplifies the process of issuing new shares. However, it is imperative for the company to comply with the SEC's regulations and ensure that all the necessary disclosures are made to potential investors through the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus.Legal compliance in the biopharmaceutical industry is critical, not only in terms of financial offerings but also in the development and commercialization of drugs. Viking must navigate complex regulatory pathways to bring its drug candidates to market. The funds raised will likely be subject to scrutiny to ensure they are used as declared for development programs and corporate purposes and not for undisclosed activities that could lead to legal complications or investor mistrust.Investors should be aware that any deviations from the stated use of proceeds or regulatory missteps in drug development could have legal and financial repercussions for the company, potentially affecting its stock price and investor confidence. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM SAN DIEGO, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Positive Record third-quarter revenue of $186.6 million, up 39% year-over-year Net income of $13.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $28.8 million Funded backlog of $462.8 million as of January 27, 2024 Raised fiscal year revenue guidance for 2024 to between $700 million and $710 million Anticipates double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by AeroVironment reflect a significant increase in revenue and net income, indicating a robust financial performance. The record third-quarter revenue growth of 39% year-over-year is particularly notable, as it outpaces average industry growth rates, suggesting that the company is gaining market share or benefiting from sector-specific tailwinds. The increase in net income of $14.6 million compared to the previous year's quarter is a strong indicator of operational efficiency and could signal improved profitability margins. Furthermore, the raised revenue guidance for the fiscal year 2024 implies management's confidence in continued strong performance and may positively influence investor sentiment.The growing backlog, now standing at $462.8 million, is a forward-looking indicator of sustained revenue streams. However, investors should be mindful of the company's ability to convert this backlog into recognized revenue while maintaining or improving margins. The increase in gross margin to 36% from 34% is a positive trend, yet it is important to monitor the impact of any unfavorable product mix and the associated risks of cost increases or production inefficiencies. Defense Industry Analyst AeroVironment's growth in the Loitering Munitions Systems (LMS) segment by 140% year-over-year is a reflection of the increasing global demand for advanced military technologies. LMS, which includes drones and other unmanned systems capable of surveillance or attack, are becoming integral to modern warfare and security operations. The company's significant revenue growth in this segment could be attributed to heightened global security tensions and increased defense spending by governments. This trend is expected to continue, given the current geopolitical climate and AeroVironment's position within this niche market could provide a competitive advantage.However, the decrease in MacCready Works (MW) segment revenue by 13% warrants attention to understand the underlying causes and whether this signals a strategic shift or a temporary setback. Investors should assess the company's research and development investments, which have increased by $9.0 million, to gauge their alignment with future growth areas and the potential for new product development or enhancements to existing offerings. Market Research Analyst The strategic outlook provided by AeroVironment indicates an expectation for double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2025, which could be driven by both organic growth and potential acquisitions. The company's focus on integrating acquisitions efficiently and on a timely basis is crucial for maintaining momentum and leveraging synergies. As the defense sector evolves with technological advancements, AeroVironment's ability to adapt and innovate will be key to capturing emerging opportunities.Investors should consider the broader industry context, including competitors' activities, regulatory changes and economic conditions, when evaluating the company's future prospects. The forecasted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of between $2.69 and $2.83 exclude certain expenses and gains or losses, providing a measure of core operational performance that can be compared against industry peers. Nonetheless, the reliance on non-GAAP measures should be balanced with an understanding of GAAP results to ensure a comprehensive financial assessment. 03/04/2024 - 04:10 PM ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AeroVironment, Inc. (“AeroVironment” or the “Company”) reported today financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended January 27, 2024. Third Quarter Highlights: Record third quarter revenue of $186.6 million, up 39% year-over-year Third quarter net income of $13.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $28.8 million, increases of $14.6 million and $5.1 million, year-over-year, respectively Funded backlog of $462.8 million as of January 27, 2024 “Once again, AeroVironment has delivered outstanding results, including a record for third quarter revenue that’s nearly 40% above the same period last fiscal year,” said Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Solid bottom-line results, fueled by record demand and strong operating execution, have us on track for our best year ever. In addition, the Company continues to show tremendous growth in the Loitering Munition Systems segment, which delivered record revenue in the quarter. “With the increased global demand for our solutions, strong backlog and growing pipeline, AeroVironment remains well positioned for continued growth. As such, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal year revenue guidance for 2024 to between $700 million and $710 million, and we continue to anticipate double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2025.” FISCAL 2024 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $186.6 million, an increase of 39% as compared to $134.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting higher product sales of $64.7 million, partially offset by lower service revenue of $12.5 million. From a segment standpoint, the year-over-year increase was due to revenue growth in Loitering Munitions Systems (“LMS”) of 140% and Unmanned Systems (“UMS”) of 23%, partially offset by a decrease in MacCready Works (“MW”) of 13%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $67.3 million, an increase of 48% as compared to $45.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting higher product margin of $20.1 million and higher service gross margin of $1.7 million. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin increased to 36% from 34%, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of product revenue to total revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix. Gross margin was favorably impacted by a decrease in depreciation charges for in-service assets of $5.3 million related to the closure of COCO site locations during fiscal year 2023. Gross margin was negatively impacted by $4.0 million of intangible amortization expense and other related non-cash purchase accounting expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $3.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $14.3 million as compared to $4.6 million for the third quarter of last fiscal year. The increase year-over-year was primarily due higher gross margin of $21.8 million, partially offset by increases in research and development (“R&D”) expense of $9.0 million and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense of $3.1 million. Other income, net, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.9 million, as compared to other loss, net of $5.4 million for the third quarter of last fiscal year. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to increases in net unrealized gains on investment holdings and interest income and a decrease in interest expense. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.3 million, as compared to a benefit of $(0.5) million for the third quarter of last fiscal year. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to an increase in income before income taxes. Net income attributable to AeroVironment for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $13.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, as compared to net loss attributable to AeroVironment of $(0.7) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, in the prior-year period, respectively. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $28.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.63, as compared to $23.7 million and $0.33, respectively, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. BACKLOG As of January 27, 2024, funded backlog (defined as remaining performance obligations under firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $462.8 million, as compared to $424.1 million as of April 30, 2023. FISCAL 2024 — OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR For fiscal year 2024, the Company now expects revenue of between $700 million and $710 million, net income of between $51 million and $55 million, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of between $122 million and $127 million, earnings per diluted share of between $1.86 and $2.00 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, other non-cash purchase accounting expenses and equity securities investments gains or losses, of between $2.69 and $2.83. The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including certain assumptions with respect to our ability to efficiently and on a timely basis integrate acquisitions, obtain and retain government contracts, changes in the timing and/or amount of government spending, react to changes in the demand for our products and services, activities of competitors, changes in the regulatory environment, and general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Investors are reminded that actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing our results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operating and financial performance. Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income before intangible amortization, amortization of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, goodwill impairment and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share We exclude the acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity securities investments gains or losses, goodwill impairment and one-time non-operating items because we believe this facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and existing businesses, and with our peer companies. We believe, however, that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization including amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, adjusted for the impact of certain other non-cash items, including amortization of implementation of cloud computing arrangements, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, equity method investment gains or losses, equity securities investments gains or losses, goodwill impairment and one-time non-operating gains or losses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under U.S. GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We believe this facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and existing businesses, and with our peer companies. We believe, however, that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation, intangible asset amortization will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized and that interest and income tax expenses will recur in future periods. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.

Financial Analyst Southland Holdings' reported revenue increase in the fourth quarter suggests a positive growth trajectory in terms of sales. However, the significant drop in gross profit and the shift from a net income to a net loss year-over-year is alarming. The decline in EBITDA further underscores operational challenges or increased costs that have not been offset by revenue growth. This performance could be indicative of margin compression, possibly due to rising material costs or lower project efficiency. Investors may be concerned about the company's profitability and the sustainability of its growth, particularly in the context of a flat annual revenue.The backlog increase is a positive sign, indicating a strong future revenue stream. However, the quality and profitability of the backlog are key, as new awards do not necessarily translate to future profits. The market will likely focus on the company's ability to convert its backlog into profitable revenue and on management's strategies to address the profit erosion seen in the current report. Market Research Analyst In the specialized infrastructure construction sector, backlog is a critical metric as it provides visibility into future work and potential revenue. Southland's 12% backlog increase suggests a competitive market position and an ability to secure new contracts. However, the industry is known for its cyclicality and sensitivity to economic conditions. Thus, the ability to maintain margins in the face of economic headwinds, such as inflation or potential recessions, will be crucial for Southland's long-term success.Additionally, the construction industry is facing a tight labor market and supply chain disruptions. These factors could be contributing to Southland's reduced profitability and should be closely monitored by stakeholders. The company's strategy to navigate these challenges will be of particular interest in future quarters, as will its ability to ramp up new projects efficiently. Economist The reported financials of Southland Holdings reflect broader economic trends, including potential inflationary pressures that may have impacted costs, leading to reduced gross profit and net losses. The transition from net income to net loss year-over-year despite revenue growth is a red flag that may suggest inefficiencies or external cost pressures not adequately managed.From an economic standpoint, the company's performance may also reflect the state of the infrastructure sector, which is heavily influenced by government spending and policies. As such, regulatory changes and fiscal stimulus can have significant impacts on companies like Southland. The firm's ability to adapt to these macroeconomic conditions will be critical in ensuring long-term viability and profitability. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Southland Holdings, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes certain unaudited financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including but not limited to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), backlog, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom. Note that other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently, and therefore such financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. Southland believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Southland’s financial condition and results of operations. Southland also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items of expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the accompanying tables for reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures for Southland’s current and historical results: adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net income (loss) per share attributable to common stock; and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stock, and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measures) to net income (loss) attributable to common stock.

Instead, they are based only on Southland’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of Southland’s business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.

Enbridge Receives Canada Energy Regulator Approval for Mainline Tolling Settlement,2024-03-04T21:40:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB) receives approval from the Canada Energy Regulator for the Mainline Tolling negotiated settlement until December 31, 2028. The settlement establishes tariffs for crude oil and liquids shipments across Canada and North America, aiming to provide value to customers, generate returns for Enbridge, and ensure a stable energy supply.","Enbridge Receives Canada Energy Regulator Approval for Mainline Tolling Settlement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Enbridge Inc. (ENB) receives approval from the Canada Energy Regulator for the Mainline Tolling negotiated settlement until December 31, 2028. The settlement establishes tariffs for crude oil and liquids shipments across Canada and North America, aiming to provide value to customers, generate returns for Enbridge, and ensure a stable energy supply. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The Canada Energy Regulator's approval of Enbridge Inc.'s Mainline Tolling negotiated settlement is a significant development for the company and its stakeholders. This settlement directly influences Enbridge's revenue structure and impacts the cost basis for shippers utilizing the Mainline system. As tariffs are a primary source of income for pipeline companies, the locked-in rates until 2028 provide a stable and predictable cash flow, which is favorable for financial planning and debt management. This stability is also attractive to investors seeking consistent returns in a sector that can be influenced by volatile commodity prices.From a competitive standpoint, the approval of the settlement ensures that Enbridge can maintain its market position by offering competitive rates to its customers. This is critical in retaining and potentially expanding its customer base in the face of competition from other modes of transportation and pipelines. Furthermore, the unanimous approval from the industry signals strong industry support and could be indicative of Enbridge's effective stakeholder management. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market implications of the CER's approval of Enbridge's Mainline Tolling settlement requires examining the potential effects on crude oil and liquids shipments. The settlement could increase the attractiveness of shipping products from Western Canada, potentially leading to increased volumes. This could have a positive impact on the Canadian oil industry by providing more efficient and cost-effective access to markets, which is crucial for producers, especially when considering the geographical and logistical challenges associated with Canada's oil sands.Increased shipments could also lead to greater demand for ancillary services and could boost economic activities in regions connected by the Mainline. However, it's important to monitor the response from environmental groups and other stakeholders concerned with the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, as their actions can influence public perception and regulatory decisions. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the approved Mainline Tolling settlement for Enbridge are multifaceted. The retroactive effect of the agreement back to July 1, 2021, suggests a potential for recouped revenues or adjustments in financial statements. This could lead to a one-time positive adjustment in Enbridge's earnings reports, which would need to be analyzed separately from ongoing operations to understand the company's core performance.Investors and analysts should also consider the impact of the settlement on Enbridge's risk profile. With a secured revenue stream, Enbridge might be seen as a lower-risk investment within the energy sector. However, the long-term nature of the settlement means that Enbridge has less flexibility to adjust tolls in response to market conditions, which could be a drawback if the market environment changes significantly. It's essential to balance the benefits of revenue security against the risks associated with reduced flexibility. 03/04/2024 - 04:40 PM CALGARY, AB, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Enbridge Inc. (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB) (Enbridge or the Company) announced today that the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) has approved the Mainline Tolling negotiated settlement effective until December 31, 2028. The settlement sets tariffs for crude oil and liquids shipments that start in Western Canada and are delivered across Canada and North America. ""We're pleased that the CER approved the settlement and believe it creates value for all. Our customers will continue to receive competitive and responsive service; Enbridge will earn attractive risk-adjusted returns; and the Mainline will continue to feed North America and global markets with a long-term source of safe, secure, and affordable energy,"" said Colin Gruending, President, Liquids Pipelines. ""The settlement received unanimous approval from industry, and we are grateful for our collaborative customer relationships."" The CER determined that the Settlement is consistent with the revised guidelines for negotiated settlements. The new tolls were in effect on an interim basis on July 1, 2023, and the overall agreement is retroactively effective back to July 1, 2021. More details of the MTS filings are available on the CER website: Mainline Tolling Agreement About Enbridge At Enbridge, we safely connect millions of people to the energy they rely on every day, fueling quality of life through our North American natural gas, oil and renewable power networks and our growing European offshore wind portfolio.

Mills to the Board of Directors. The company now has approximately 183.0 million shares of common stock outstanding, with plans to update its 2024 operational and financial guidance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Talos Energy's acquisition of QuarterNorth Energy represents a significant consolidation in the energy sector, likely to influence Talos's market position and financial stability. The issuance of approximately 24.4 million shares to QuarterNorth shareholders as transaction consideration indicates a notable equity dilution for existing Talos shareholders. However, the strategic implications of this dilution must be evaluated in the context of the assets and infrastructure acquired, which are expected to contribute to Talos's free cash flow. The market will be closely monitoring the updated operational and financial guidance to assess the transaction's impact on Talos's revenue, cost structure and earnings projections.Joseph A. Mills's appointment to the Board could signal a strategic pivot or enhancement in governance, with his experience potentially injecting a fresh perspective on operational execution and the exploitation of synergies. Investors should consider how Mills's expertise in the upstream and midstream sectors might influence Talos's strategic decisions and operational efficiency, potentially affecting the company's long-term growth trajectory and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of QuarterNorth by Talos Energy is a substantial event that can reshape competitive dynamics within the deepwater exploration and production niche. Talos's emphasis on the acquisition of predominantly operated, oil-weighted deepwater assets suggests a targeted approach to bolster its portfolio in areas with higher margins and potentially greater control over operations. This strategic move could position Talos favorably in the industry, particularly in a context where oil prices and energy demand fluctuate. The ability to generate substantial free cash flow is a critical metric for investors, as it reflects a company's financial health and its capacity to fund future growth, pay dividends, or reduce debt.It is important to consider the timing of the acquisition and the acceleration of synergies that Talos anticipates. The energy market's response to such transactions can be contingent on broader economic indicators, regulatory changes and geopolitical events. Thus, understanding the broader market implications and how Talos might navigate these challenges will be essential for stakeholders making informed decisions. Energy Sector Analyst The transaction between Talos Energy and QuarterNorth highlights the ongoing trend of consolidation within the energy industry, particularly in the context of deepwater exploration and production. The acquisition's potential to enhance Talos's asset base and infrastructure is significant, as it could lead to increased operational efficiencies and a stronger position in the market. The focus on oil-weighted assets is indicative of Talos's strategy to leverage the current market environment, which is characterized by a rebound in oil prices post-pandemic.Analyzing the potential for 'synergies' mentioned by Talos's CEO is crucial, as these synergies often involve cost savings through economies of scale, optimized resource allocation and enhanced bargaining power with suppliers and contractors. The extent to which Talos can successfully integrate QuarterNorth's operations and realize these synergies will be a determining factor in the acquisition's success and its impact on the company's stock valuation. 03/04/2024 - 04:30 PM HOUSTON, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Talos Energy Inc.

(FFIE) has filed a lawsuit against Ding Lei, a former executive of the company, and founder of Human Horizons Holdings, for trade secret infringement and unfair competition. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and cessation of infringing activities related to the FF 91 model. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The lawsuit filed by Faraday Future against a former executive for trade secret infringement and unfair competition is a significant legal confrontation in the electric vehicle industry. The claim centers around the alleged misuse of confidential information related to Faraday Future's FF 91 model, which is critical to the company's competitive edge. The legal process in such cases can be protracted and complex, often involving detailed forensic analysis to establish the extent of any misappropriation and its impact on the plaintiff's business.From a legal standpoint, the case's outcome could set precedents for intellectual property protection in the rapidly evolving EV sector. If Faraday Future succeeds, it could deter potential intellectual property theft, reinforcing the sanctity of trade secrets. Conversely, a loss could embolden competitors and potentially weaken Faraday's market position. The case also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and non-disclosure agreements to safeguard proprietary information. Financial Analyst The legal action taken by Faraday Future against Human Horizons could have material financial implications for both entities. Investors should monitor this situation closely as the litigation can affect Faraday Future's market valuation and investor confidence. The direct financial impact includes potential monetary damages awarded and the costs associated with the legal proceedings. Indirectly, the lawsuit may influence Faraday Future's ability to secure funding and partnerships, given that trade secrets are a significant component of a tech company's valuation.Furthermore, the injunction sought to prevent Human Horizons from using the trade secrets could impact the latter's product offerings and sales, potentially altering competitive dynamics. Market sentiment can be volatile in response to such news and the uncertainty surrounding the litigation's duration and outcome may lead to short-term stock price fluctuations for Faraday Future. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) market is highly competitive, with innovation and intellectual property being key differentiators. The lawsuit indicates a fierce battle over technological advancements and market positioning. The FF 91's trade secrets represent significant research and development efforts and are likely to be a cornerstone of Faraday Future's strategy to capture market share.An analysis of the competitive landscape shows that any disruption in Faraday Future's ability to deploy its technology could advantage competitors. The market will be closely watching the resolution of this case, as it could influence strategic partnerships, consumer perception and the pace of innovation within the EV space. The outcome may also provide insights into the enforceability of intellectual property rights in international markets, particularly China, which is a key player in the global EV industry. 03/04/2024 - 04:30 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.

The Plan is a standard corporate governance item for companies like Ciscom, and is designed to ensure that all Ciscom shareholders are treated fairly in connection with any take-over bid and to protect against ""creeping bids"", which involve the accumulation of more than 25%, on an aggregate basis, of Ciscom's common shares (the ""Common Shares"") through purchases exempt from applicable take over-bid rules.Pursuant to the Plan, ten rights have been issued and attached to each Common Share issued and outstanding.

After the Triggering Event, holders of the rights (other than the bidder and its related parties) will be permitted to exercise their rights to purchase additional Common Shares for $0.00001 per share which is expected to be satisfied through the payment of a dividend to each shareholder at the time of the Triggering Event. The Plan is effective immediately, and will be presented for ratification by the shareholders within six months of the effective date.

The loan portfolio yielded 11.9% as of December 31, 2023. Over eleven years, investors received $246 million in distributions, equivalent to $15.08 per share. Positive Strong net investment income and core net investment income reported for Q4 2023. Loan portfolio yielding 11.9% as of December 31, 2023. Investors received $246 million in distributions over eleven years. Financial highlights show growth in net investment income and core net investment income compared to the previous year. Negative Net realized loss on investments and foreign currency translation. Increase in gross operating expenses driven by interest expense and income incentive fees. Reduction in maximum commitment under the Credit Facility. Decline in net asset value per share from $14.02 to $13.26. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Stellus Capital Investment Corporation reflect a robust operational performance, with a notable increase in both net investment income and core net investment income per share year-over-year. The company's ability to cover its regular dividend with earnings is a positive indicator of financial health, as it suggests a sustainable dividend policy. Additionally, the loan portfolio's yield of 11.9% is significantly above the average, which could indicate a higher risk profile but also potentially higher returns for investors. However, the net realized loss on investments is a concern and warrants further analysis of the portfolio's risk management strategies.From a liquidity perspective, the amendment to the credit facility and the successful equity issuance under the ATM Program demonstrate Stellus's proactive management of capital resources. The reduction in interest coverage ratio requirement could provide more financial flexibility, but it may also signal a higher leverage position that investors should monitor closely. The increase in gross operating expenses, driven by higher interest expenses and incentive fees, is another area to watch, as it can impact net income margins. Market Research Analyst Stellus Capital's portfolio activity, including both new investments and repayments, provides insight into the company's strategic direction and market positioning. The diversification across various sectors, as indicated by the portfolio company descriptions, suggests a broad approach to investment that could mitigate sector-specific risks. However, the net activity being negative for the quarter and lower year-over-year could indicate a strategic shift or a more selective investment approach in a potentially volatile market.The reported increase in total assets alongside a decrease in net asset value per share year-over-year requires attention. This could suggest dilution effects from the issuance of new shares, which might concern existing shareholders. The detailed breakdown of the portfolio's weighted average yield offers transparency into the income-generating capabilities of the investments and could be of interest to investors seeking high-yield opportunities. Legal Expert The Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement indicates a strategic financial maneuver by Stellus Capital to optimize its capital structure. The extension of the Commitment Termination Date and Final Maturity Date provides the company with a longer horizon to manage its debt obligations. The increase in the maximum accordion limit from $315.0 million to $350.0 million offers additional borrowing capacity, which could support future growth initiatives or provide a buffer in uncertain economic conditions. It's important to understand the legal implications and covenants associated with these changes, as they can have significant impacts on the company's operational flexibility and financial obligations. 03/04/2024 - 05:31 PM HOUSTON, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Stellus Capital Investment Corporation (NYSE:SCM) (""Stellus"" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

(2) Total realized income is the sum of net investment income, net realized gains (losses) on investments, net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency, and loss on debt extinguishment; all U.S. GAAP measures. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY ($ in millions, except data relating to per share amounts and number of portfolio companies) As of As of December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Investments at fair value $874.5 $844.7 Total assets $908.1 $898.2 Net assets $319.9 $275.8 Shares outstanding 24,125,642 19,666,769 Net asset value per share $13.26 $14.02 Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 New investments $44.2 $30.1 $183.9 $211.0 Repayments of investments (55.2) (53.2) (134.2) (127.5) Net activity ($11.0) ($23.1) $49.7 $83.5 As of As of December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Number of portfolio company investments 93 85 Number of debt investments 81 73 Weighted average yield of debt and other income producing investments (3) Cash 11.0 % 10.3 % Payment-in-kind (""PIK"") 0.5 % 0.4 % Fee amortization 0.4 % 0.4 % Total 11.9 % 11.1 % Weighted average yield on total investments (4) Cash 10.3 % 9.7 % Payment-in-kind (""PIK"") 0.5 % 0.3 % Fee amortization 0.3 % 0.4 % Total 11.1 % 10.4 % (3) The dollar-weighted average annualized effective yield is computed using the effective interest rate for our debt investments and other income producing investments, including cash and PIK interest, as well as the accretion of deferred fees. The individual investment yields are then weighted by the respective cost of the investments (as of the date presented) in calculating the weighted average effective yield of the portfolio. The dollar-weighted average annualized yield on the Company's investments for a given period will generally be higher than what investors in the Company's common stock would realize in a return over the same period because the dollar-weighted average annualized yield does not reflect the Company's expenses or any sales load that may be paid by investors. (4) The dollar-weighted average yield on total investments takes the same yields as calculated in the footnote above but weights them to determine the weighted average effective yield as a percentage of the Company's total investments, including non-income producing loans and equity. Results of Operations Investment income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $105.8 million and $75.1 million, respectively, most of which was interest income from portfolio investments. Gross operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $63.9 million and $46.5 million, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by increased interest expense and income incentive fees. For the same respective periods, base management fees totaled $15.5 million and $14.8 million, income incentive fees totaled $10.2 million and $3.8 million, capital gains incentive fee reversals totaled ($0.6) million and ($2.8) million, fees and expenses related to our borrowings totaled $32.0 million and $24.5 million (including interest and amortization of deferred financing costs), administrative expenses totaled $1.9 million and $1.8 million, income tax totaled $1.3 million and $1.2 million and other expenses totaled $3.6 million and $3.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company waived income incentive fees totaling $0.3 million for net operating expenses of $63.7 million. No such income incentive fees were waived for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net investment income was $42.2 million and $28.6 million, or $1.92 and $1.46 per common share based on weighted average common shares outstanding of 22,004,648 and 19,552,931 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Core net investment income, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that excludes the capital gains incentive fee (reversal) and income tax expense accruals, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $43.0 million and $26.9 million, or $1.95 and $1.38 per share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's investment portfolio had a net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of $2.8 million and ($17.5) million, respectively, and the Company had net realized (losses) gains of ($30.2) million and $3.7 million, respectively. The full realizations for the year ended December 31, 2023 had previously been reflected as unrealized depreciation which were reversed during the year then ended and included in the $2.8 million of unrealized appreciation as of December 31, 2023. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $17.5 million and $14.5 million, or $0.80 and $0.74 per common share, based on weighted average common shares outstanding of 22,004,648 and 19,552,931 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Lisa Franchetti and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Christopher Mahoney joined U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss, for a visit to the company’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division today. While in Pascagoula, Franchetti, Mahoney and Wicker toured the shipyard’s facilities and met with Ingalls leadership for an overview of the ships under construction and the investments being made within the shipyard. During the visit, the group toured guided missile destroyers USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) and Ted Stevens (DDG 128), amphibious assault ship Bougainville (LHA 8), and amphibious transport dock Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29). “We were honored to host Adm. Franchetti, Gen. Mahoney and Sen. Wicker and showcase the hard work being accomplished by our dedicated shipbuilders every day,” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said. “As we continue to invest in our people, facilities and processes, we can best position ourselves to fully support the needs of our Navy and Marine Corps partners.” A photo accompanying this release is available at: https://hii.com/news/hii-hosts-naval-leaders-at-ingalls-shipbuilding. Adm. Franchetti, who was sworn in as the nation’s 33rd chief of naval operations in November 2023, also met with crewmembers of ships currently at Ingalls. This visit marked CNO’s first trip to Ingalls Shipbuilding as chief of naval operations and was part of a series of visits to Gulf Coast shipyards. “It’s been just over two years since McCool’s launch, and because of each and every one of you, this ship will be ready and fiercely capable in this decisive decade and for the many decades that follow,” said Franchetti to the shipyard workers, industry members and ship’s crew aboard Richard M. McCool Jr. “I want each of you to know that I am proud of you, and I’m proud of all that you are doing to ensure our Navy remains the most powerful Navy in the world.” During the visit, the group had the opportunity to see first-hand the work taking place in support of the Navy and Marine Corps. “The importance of these shipyards cannot be overstated,” Mahoney said. “Manufacturing and production is essential to a strong economy and America’s maritime advantage relies on the ships that carry our Marines and Sailors around the globe. Both of those things are on display here — on these lines with these hard working men and women. It was great to meet some of them and hear their stories. Their work is critical to our National Defense.” Wicker echoed Mahoney’s statements saying, “I will always showcase our skilled Mississippi shipbuilders and the impressive work they do along the coast. The Navy, Marine Corps, and world benefit from what comes out of our shipyards. As one of Mississippi’s U.S. Senators and the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look for every opportunity to advance our state’s national defense contributions.” Since 2015, HII has invested nearly $1 billion in the Ingalls Shipbuilding infrastructure, facility and toolsets enabling shipbuilders to improve product flow and process efficiency, and enhance product quality.

Managed receivables grew by 13.7% to $2.4 billion, with a return on average shareholders' equity of 20.7%. The company saw a purchase volume of $683.4 million and net income of $20.0 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported operating revenue growth of 14.9% and the increase in managed receivables by 13.7% to $2.4 billion are significant indicators of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation's financial health. These figures suggest the company's ability to generate revenue and manage credit risk effectively, particularly in the financial technology sector where the management of receivables is critical. The return on average shareholders' equity of 20.7% is particularly noteworthy, as it exceeds the average for the financial industry, which typically ranges between 10-15%. This implies a strong profitability and efficient use of equity capital by the company. The addition of 387,000 new accounts and a total of 3.6 million accounts served indicate successful market penetration and customer acquisition strategies. The company's conservative approach to underwriting since mid-2022 suggests a focus on credit quality over volume, which may be appealing to risk-averse investors. However, prospective investors should consider the potential for market saturation or increased competition, which could affect future growth rates. Market Research Analyst Atlanticus Holdings Corporation's strategic partnerships and expansion into new ones have contributed to its growth in receivables, particularly in the retail credit line of business. The company's anticipation of increased opportunities for growth as prime credit providers tighten underwriting standards indicates a strategic positioning to capture market share from higher credit quality segments. This shift in the market presents both an opportunity and a risk, as it may lead to an increase in competition for subprime lending. Furthermore, the company's mention of a stable credit environment due to consumers adjusting to higher costs of living and experiencing wage growth provides context for the financial sector. It suggests that despite macroeconomic challenges, there is a segment of consumers who are managing their finances effectively, which could lead to lower default rates and a healthier portfolio for credit providers like Atlanticus. Economist The performance of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation can be seen as a microcosm of the broader financial technology sector and consumer credit market. The company's growth amidst higher cost of living and higher wage growth reflects a resilient consumer base. The management's reliance on data over forecasts in underwriting decisions is a prudent strategy that may contribute to stability in uncertain economic conditions. However, the long-term impact of inflationary pressures on consumer credit quality remains a concern for the industry. The company's optimistic outlook and growth in general purpose receivables, despite a conservative credit posture, may indicate underlying strength in consumer financial health or a shift in consumer borrowing behavior. It will be important to monitor these trends for indicators of broader economic health and consumer confidence. 03/04/2024 - 05:25 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating revenue growth of 14.9% over prior year, with 3.6 million accounts served (1), allowing for continued strong resultsSource: Atlanticus Holdings Corp ATLANTA, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlanticus Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: ATLC) (Atlanticus, the Company, we, our or us), a financial technology company which enables its bank, retail and healthcare partners to offer more inclusive financial services to millions of everyday Americans, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Management Commentary Jeff Howard, President and Chief Executive Officer at Atlanticus stated, “We continue to maintain our focus on managing risk, achieving adequate returns on our shareholder’s capital, and when appropriate, growth. We have maintained our conservative approach to underwriting that began in mid-2022 and will continue to do so until data, not forecasts, indicate a change would be prudent. Our most recent data indicate that the consumers we serve have adjusted to higher cost of living while benefiting from higher wage growth, which has resulted in a more stable credit environment. With this backdrop, we were able to sustain growth across each of our business lines. We once again achieved double digit growth in receivables purchased and receivables growth on the year in our retail credit line of business. This is primarily the result of continued growth with our strategic partners as well as new partnerships. We anticipate increased opportunities for growth as providers of prime credit continue to tighten their underwriting standards. We have already seen an increase both in the flow of applications we assess on behalf of our bank partner and the importance of our solution to new and existing merchant relationships. Our general purpose receivables also grew year over year even with our more conservative credit posture as we continue to grow the total number of customers we serve through our omnichannel origination platform. We are optimistic about growth for our general purpose receivables in 2024 but we will continue to employ our conservative approach to underwriting. While this may reduce the pace of growth in the short-term, our outlook for long-term growth remains.” “As credit conditions continue to stabilize and macro-economic uncertainty abates, we believe the markets that we serve provide exceptional opportunity for long-term, sustained growth. Within our general-purpose credit card, retail credit, healthcare payments, and auto-finance lines of business we are well positioned with a diversified product platform to help meet the financial needs of the over 100 million consumers with less than perfect credit who are overlooked by large banks. Our role is to continue to leverage our experience, our 27 years of data aggregation and proven analytics, and our technology to bring best in class products to these consumers in our effort to Empower Better Financial Outcomes for Everyday Americans.” Financial ResultsFor the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % ChangeTotal operating revenue, net$308,600 $268,664 14.9% $1,155,246 $1,046,104 10.4%Other non-operating revenue 490 429 nm 630 809 nmTotal revenue 309,090 269,093 14.9% 1,155,876 1,046,913 10.4%Interest expense (32,619) (24,002) 35.9% (109,342) (81,851) 33.6%Provision for credit losses (601) (542) nm (2,152) (1,252) nmChanges in fair value of loans (184,072) (162,206) 13.5% (689,577) (577,069) 19.5%Net margin$91,798 $82,343 11.5% $354,805 $386,741 -8.3%Total operating expenses$61,093 $52,561 16.2% $226,247 $237,469 -4.7%Net income$26,273 $23,690 10.9% $101,954 $134,612 -24.3%Net income attributable to controlling interests$26,304 $23,991 9.6% $102,845 $135,597 -24.2%Preferred stock and preferred unit dividends and discount accretion$(6,341) $(6,317) nm $(25,198) $(25,076) nmNet income attributable to common shareholders$19,963 $17,674 13.0% $77,647 $110,521 -29.7%Net income attributable to common shareholders per common share—basic$1.37 $1.22 11.4% $5.35 $7.55 -29.1%Net income attributable to common shareholders per common share—diluted$1.10 $0.98 12.2% $4.24 $5.83 -27.3% *nm = not meaningful Managed Receivables Managed receivables increased 13.7% to $2.4 billion with over $291.4 million in net receivables growth from December 31, 2022, largely driven by growth both in the private label credit and general purpose credit card products offered by our bank partners. Total accounts served increased 9.0% to 3.6 million. While some of our merchant partners continue to face year-over-year growth challenges, others are still benefiting from continued consumer spending and a growing economy. Our general purpose credit card portfolio continues to grow in terms of total customers served and therefore we continue to experience growth in total managed receivables. We expect continued growth in our managed receivables when compared to prior periods in 2023 which were restricted due to tightened underwriting standards adopted during the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters). As these new underwriting standards have now been applied across our portfolio, it has allowed us to expand the offerings our bank partners make available to consumers. Total Operating Revenue Total operating revenue consists of: 1) interest income, finance charges and late fees on consumer loans, 2) other fees on credit products including annual and merchant fees and 3) ancillary, interchange and servicing income on loan portfolios. During the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, total operating revenue increased 14.9% to $308.6 million and 10.4% to $1.2 billion, respectively. Finance and fee billings on our fair value receivables increased to $268.2 million and $970.0 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively from $232.6 million and $874.7 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We are currently experiencing continued period-over-period growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables and to a lesser extent in our CAR receivables—growth that we expect to result in net period-over-period growth in our total interest income and related fees for these operations for 2024. Future periods’ growth is also dependent on the addition of new retail partners to expand the reach of private label credit operations as well as growth within existing partnerships and the level of marketing investment for the general purpose credit card operations. Interest Expense Interest expense was $32.6 million and $109.3 million for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $24.0 million and $81.9 million for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The elevated expenses were primarily driven by the planned increases in outstanding debt in proportion to growth in our receivables coupled with increases in the cost of capital. Outstanding notes payable, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform increased to $1,796.0 million as of December 31, 2023 from $1,586.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The majority of this increase in outstanding debt relates to the addition of multiple revolving credit facilities during 2023. Recent increases in the federal funds rate have started to increase our interest expense as we have raised additional capital (or replaced existing facilities) over the last two years. We anticipate additional debt financing over the next few quarters as we continue to grow coupled with increased effective interest rates resulting from federal funds rate increases. As such, we expect our quarterly interest expense for these operations to increase compared to prior periods. However, we do not expect our interest expense to increase significantly in the short term (absent raising additional capital) because over 85% of interest rates on our outstanding debt are fixed. Adding to interest expense in 2024, in January and February, 2024, we sold a combined $57.3 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2029. Changes in Fair Value of Loans Changes in fair value of loans increased to $184.1 million and $689.6 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $162.2 million and $577.1 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. This increase was largely driven by growth in underlying receivables. We include asset performance degradation in our forecasts to reflect the possibility of delinquency rates increasing in the near term (and the corresponding increase in charge-offs and decrease in payments) above the level that historical and current trends would suggest. As receivables associated with both 1) assets acquired prior to our tightened underwriting standards (mentioned above) and 2) those assets negatively impacted by inflation, gradually become a smaller percentage of the portfolio, we expect to see overall improvements in the measured fair value of our portfolios of acquired receivables. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased 16.2% in the quarter but decreased 4.7% for the full year when compared to the same periods in 2022. For the quarter, operating expenses increased, driven by increases in variable servicing costs associated with growth in our receivables as well as growth in both the number of employees and inflationary compensation pressure. Marketing costs, corresponding to growth in our accounts served also contributed to increases for the quarter. We expect increased levels of expenditures associated with anticipated growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card operations. These expenses will primarily relate to the variable costs of marketing efforts and card and loan servicing expenses associated with new receivable acquisitions. Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders Net income attributable to common shareholders increased 13.0% to $20.0 million, or $1.10 per diluted share and decreased 29.7% to $77.6 million, or $4.24 per diluted share, for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share Repurchases We repurchased and retired 575,156 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.6 million, in the year ended December 31, 2023. We will continue to evaluate the best use of our capital to increase shareholder value over time.

Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents information about managed receivables, which is a non-GAAP financial measure provided as a supplement to the results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, we present managed receivables, total managed yield, combined principal net charge-offs, and fair value to face value ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures aid in the evaluation of the performance of our credit portfolios, including our risk management, servicing and collection activities and our valuation of purchased receivables. The credit performance of our managed receivables provides information concerning the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent with the portfolios. Management relies heavily upon financial data and results prepared on the managed basis in order to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or the calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures are provided below for each of the fiscal periods indicated. These non-GAAP financial measures include only the performance of those receivables underlying consolidated subsidiaries (for receivables carried at amortized cost basis and fair value) and exclude the performance of receivables held by our former equity method investee. As the receivables underlying our former equity method investee reflect a small and diminishing portion of our overall receivables base, we do not believe their inclusion or exclusion in the overall results is material. Additionally, we calculate average managed receivables based on the quarter-end balances. The comparison of non-GAAP managed receivables to our GAAP financial statements requires an understanding that managed receivables reflect the face value of loans, interest and fees receivable without any consideration for potential credit losses or other adjustments to reflect fair value. A reconciliation of Loans at fair value to Loans at amortized cost is as follows: At or for the Three Months Ended 2023 2022 (in Millions)Dec. 31 (1)Sep. 30 (1)Jun. 30 (1)Mar. 31 (1)Dec. 31 (1)Sep. 30 (1)Jun. 30 (1)Mar. 31 (1)Loans at fair value$2,173.8 $2,050.0 $1,916.1 $1,795.6 $1,818.0 $1,728.1 $1,616.9 $1,405.8 Fair value mark against receivable (2)$237.5 $265.2 $257.9 $260.1 $302.1 $322.3 $293.0 $272.9 Loans at amortized cost$2,411.3 $2,315.2 $2,174.0 $2,055.7 $2,120.1 $2,050.4 $1,909.9 $1,678.7 Total managed receivables$2,411.3 $2,315.2 $2,174.0 $2,055.7 $2,120.1 $2,050.4 $1,909.9 $1,678.7 Fair value to face value ratio (3) 90.2% 88.5% 88.1% 87.3% 85.8% 84.3% 84.7% 83.7% (1)We elected the fair value option to account for certain loans receivable associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform that were acquired on or after January 1, 2020, and, as discussed in more detail in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, on January 1, 2022, we elected the fair value option under ASU 2016-13 for those private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables that were previously accounted for under the amortized cost method.(2)The fair value mark against receivables reflects the difference between the face value of a receivable and the net present value of the expected cash flows associated with that receivable.(3)The Fair value to face value ratio is calculated using Loans at fair value as the numerator, and Loans at amortized cost as the denominator.

Announces Sale and Leaseback Agreement Further Strengthening The Company’s Liquidity Position Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The Beachbody Company, Inc. (NYSE: BODi) sells its Van Nuys production facility for $6.2 million, using proceeds to prepay $5.5 million on its Term Loan. The company also amends its Term Loan reducing minimum liquidity financial covenants to improve liquidity. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of Beachbody Company's production facility represents a strategic financial move, particularly in the context of liquidity management and debt reduction. By selling the asset for $6.2 million, which is above its net carrying value of $4.8 million, the company has realized a gain, indicating astute asset management. The subsequent leaseback arrangement ensures operational continuity while freeing up capital.The partial prepayment of the Term Loan by $5.5 million is a significant step towards reducing the company's debt burden. This move is likely to be viewed favorably by creditors and investors as it reflects proactive financial stewardship. Furthermore, the amendment of the Term Loan to lower the minimum liquidity covenants eases the company's financial obligations, potentially improving its creditworthiness and offering more flexibility in managing its cash flows.However, it's important to monitor the long-term implications of lease payments on the company's operating expenses. While the initial cash influx is beneficial, the lease arrangement could lead to higher fixed costs over time. Stakeholders should consider both the immediate positive impact on liquidity and the long-term financial commitments entailed by the lease. Market Research Analyst The sale-leaseback deal can be interpreted as a signal of Beachbody's strategic pivot in a competitive health and wellness market. By liquidating a non-core asset, the company may be aiming to reinvest in its core subscription services and digital offerings, which are central to its business model. This move aligns with broader industry trends where digital and subscription-based models are gaining prominence.From a market perspective, the transaction may also be seen as an effort to streamline operations and focus on high-growth areas. Investors and analysts typically look for such strategic decisions as indicators of a company's adaptability and forward-thinking approach. Beachbody's emphasis on improving its liquidity position suggests a strategic emphasis on financial health, which could enhance investor confidence. Nevertheless, the long-term success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to effectively allocate the freed-up capital towards profitable growth initiatives. Real Estate Investment Analyst The real estate aspect of the transaction, specifically the premium obtained over the net carrying value, underscores the potential undervaluation of the property on Beachbody's books or favorable market conditions for sellers. The leaseback arrangement indicates a calculated decision to maintain operational presence while benefiting from real estate capital gains.Real estate investment analysts would evaluate the terms of the lease, such as the duration and extension options, against market rents to assess the deal's attractiveness. A five-year lease with two three-year extension options provides stability for Beachbody, but it also locks in long-term commitments. The terms of the lease, including rent escalations and other conditions, will affect the company's financial flexibility and should be scrutinized in relation to industry norms and the local real estate market's trajectory. 03/04/2024 - 04:25 PM EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Beachbody Company, Inc. (NYSE: BODi) (“BODi” or the “Company”), a leading subscription health and wellness company, today announced that it has sold its Van Nuys production facility which had a net carrying value of $4.8 million at December 31, 2023, for $6.2 million. Simultaneous with the sale, the Company entered into a five-year lease of the facility, with two options to extend the lease for a period of three years each. The Company used the net proceeds received from the sale to make a partial prepayment on its Term Loan of $5.5 million. The amounts related to the sale of the facility and the partial prepayment will be recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company also entered into an amendment of its Term Loan with its lender which (1) reduced the minimum liquidity financial covenant from $19 million to $17 million through March 31, 2024, and (2) reduced the minimum liquidity financial covenant from $24 million to $22 million from April 1, 2024 through the maturity date of the Term Loan. Carl Daikeler, Chief Executive Officer of Beachbody, commented “The sale and leaseback transaction demonstrates our commitment to improving our liquidity position as we execute on our turnaround. We are intent on evaluating options that will optimize our balance sheet going forward.” About BODi and The Beachbody Company, Inc.

Newmont Announces Pricing of Notes to Repay Outstanding Borrowings Under Revolving Credit Facility,2024-03-04T22:29:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Newmont Corporation and Newcrest Finance Pty Limited have priced a private offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.300% notes due 2026 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.350% notes due 2034. The Offering is expected to close on March 7, 2024, with the net proceeds intended for debt repayment and general corporate purposes.","Newmont Announces Pricing of Notes to Repay Outstanding Borrowings Under Revolving Credit Facility Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Newmont Corporation and Newcrest Finance Pty Limited have priced a private offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.300% notes due 2026 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.350% notes due 2034. The Offering is expected to close on March 7, 2024, with the net proceeds intended for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a $2 billion private offering by Newmont Corporation is a significant financial event that merits attention from multiple perspectives within the financial sector. The offering is split into two tranches, with different maturities, which is a common strategy to manage debt maturity profiles and interest rate exposure. The interest rates of 5.300% for the 2026 Notes and 5.350% for the 2034 Notes are indicative of the current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness.From an investment standpoint, the use of proceeds to repay existing debt is a prudent move, potentially leading to a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio and possibly improving the company's credit rating. However, investors should be aware of the potential dilution of earnings per share if the debt is used for activities that do not generate immediate income. Additionally, the fact that these notes are not registered under the Securities Act and are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons indicates a targeted approach to fundraising, which may limit liquidity for some investors. Market Research Analyst Within the context of the mining industry, Newmont Corporation's strategic financial maneuver to repay its revolving credit facility suggests a focus on strengthening its balance sheet. This move could be interpreted as a signal of financial stability and a conservative approach to leverage. Market analysts often scrutinize such actions to assess a company's long-term financial health and operational efficiency.It is also worth noting that the repayment of the bilateral credit debt, which was acquired as part of the Newcrest Mining Limited acquisition, reflects on Newmont's post-acquisition integration strategy. The success of this strategy is crucial for investor confidence, as it can affect the company's future growth and profitability. The terms of the notes being offered may also reflect the industry's current cost of capital, which could be a benchmark for other companies in the sector considering similar financial activities. Legal Expert The legal implications of the offering are also noteworthy. The fact that the notes will not be registered under the Securities Act and are subject to specific selling restrictions, such as Rule 144A and Regulation S, is indicative of a complex regulatory environment that companies must navigate when raising capital. Compliance with these regulations ensures that the offering is conducted lawfully and targets appropriate investors.Additionally, the cautionary statement regarding the offer's legality in certain jurisdictions and the lack of regulatory approval for the offering document highlights the importance of due diligence for potential investors. These legal constraints underscore the need for transparency and adherence to securities laws, which are designed to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the financial markets. 03/04/2024 - 05:29 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NGT, ASX: NEM, PNGX: NEM) (“Newmont” or the “Company”) and Newcrest Finance Pty Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont (“Newcrest Finance” and, together with Newmont, the “Issuers”) announced today that they have priced a private offering (the “Offering”) of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.300% notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.350% notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by Newmont USA Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont.

Medical Research Analyst The completion of the business combination between QT Imaging Holdings and GigCapital5 marks a significant milestone in the medical imaging industry. The unique technology developed by QT Imaging, which harnesses low frequency sound waves for body imaging, presents a considerable advancement in the field. This technology, particularly the QT Imaging Breast Acoustic CT™ Scanner, has been granted FDA clearance as an adjunct to mammography, indicating its potential to enhance breast cancer detection and diagnosis. With a focus on patient comfort and safety, the system's ability to produce high-resolution 3D images without breast compression or radiation exposure represents a disruptive innovation in the market.From a research perspective, the implications of this technology are substantial. The high resolution, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the imaging system, combined with its cost-effectiveness, may result in increased adoption rates in hospitals and clinics. Furthermore, the system's capability to consistently image dense breast tissue or implants could lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses for a broader range of patients. This is particularly relevant given the global medical imaging market's estimated value of $40 billion and the projected growth of the cancer screening market.Considering the financial support from the NIH and private investors, QT Imaging's technology appears well-vetted, potentially facilitating its acceptance by the medical community. The partnership with a major medical equipment provider could further accelerate commercialization efforts, enhancing market penetration and shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The medical imaging market is a rapidly growing sector, with a current estimated worldwide value of $40 billion and a CAGR of 8% for breast cancer detection technologies. QT Imaging's entry into the public market, through its business combination with GigCapital5, positions the company to capitalize on this growth. The market opportunity for their novel imaging technology is underscored by the growing demand for non-invasive and patient-centric diagnostic tools.The strategic partnership with a leading medical equipment provider, along with the anticipated NASDAQ listing under the ticker 'QTI', may attract investor attention and provide QT Imaging with the capital necessary to scale operations and expand market reach. Given the competitive landscape, QT Imaging's differentiation in providing a safer, more comfortable and potentially more accurate imaging solution could disrupt existing imaging modalities and capture significant market share.Long-term, the company's focus on leveraging artificial intelligence and smart physics in medical imaging suggests a commitment to innovation that could sustain growth. Investors will likely monitor the company's ability to navigate the challenges of fundraising and growing as a micro-cap company, as well as its execution of commercialization strategies post-public offering. Financial Analyst The financial implications of QT Imaging's business combination with GigCapital5 and its subsequent NASDAQ listing are multifaceted. The nearly $17.8 million in funding from the NIH and private investments since QT Imaging's inception in 2014 is a strong endorsement of the company's technology and market potential. This level of support suggests confidence in the company's ability to generate a return on investment through its innovative imaging solutions.As a publicly traded entity, QT Imaging will be under increased scrutiny regarding its financial performance. The company's ability to effectively manage costs while scaling up production and sales will be critical to its success. Additionally, the partnership with a major medical equipment provider could provide both financial and strategic benefits, including expanded distribution channels and increased credibility in the marketplace.Investors will be interested in the company's revenue growth, profit margins and market share gains post-IPO. The long-term financial health of QT Imaging will depend on its ability to maintain technological leadership, secure additional FDA clearances and effectively compete in the global medical imaging market. 03/04/2024 - 04:58 PM Combined Company’s Innovative Body Imaging Scanning Systems Using Low Frequency Sound Waves Provide Critical Solutions for Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Disease QT Imaging Holdings Expected to Begin Trading on NASDAQ Under Ticker Symbol “QTI” on March 5, 2024 NOVATO, Calif. & PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- QT Imaging Holdings, Inc. a medical device company engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of innovative body imaging systems using low frequency sound waves, and GigCapital5, Inc.

This has resulted in a major market opportunity—the annual worldwide medical imaging market currently is estimated to be worth approximately $40 billion, with $10 billion coming from the United States.1 Global cancer screening, with an approximately $150 billion market size in 2022, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% and reach approximately $472 billion in 2033.2 Breast cancer detection and diagnostic technologies (including mammography, MRI, ultrasound, etc.) are a meaningful part of the medical imaging market and are estimated to represent a $4.6 billion global market in 2023 with an ongoing CAGR of 8%.3 QT Imaging, with the support of nearly $17.8 million in financial support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and significant funding from private investors since its inception in 2014, has developed a novel, comprehensive body imaging technology that has high resolution, high sensitivity, high specificity, high positive and negative predictive values, and is safe and inexpensive. The technology is based on low frequency transmitted sound and uses a one-of-a-kind novel sound back-scatter design and inverse-scattering reconstruction to create its images. The QT Imaging Breast Acoustic CT™ Scanner, with its already granted FDA clearance as adjunct to mammography, sets a new standard in breast imaging excellence. Unlike traditional mammography, this state-of-the-art system offers numerous key advantages to a patient-centric approach. By eliminating uncomfortable breast compression, radiation exposure, and the need for contrast agents or injections, this innovative system prioritizes patient comfort and safety while delivering high-quality, high-resolution 3D images. Also, in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, the QT Imaging scanner ensures consistent and reproducible image quality for patients with dense breast tissue or implants, backed by rigorous validation from the National Institutes of Health. Those differentiating and state-of-the-art characteristics have already attracted the attention of and led to a commercialization partnership with one of the world’s major medical equipment providers, as QTI Imaging recently announced. Dr. John Klock, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of QT Imaging, said, “The completion of our business combination with GigCapital5 and emergence as a publicly-traded company is a landmark achievement for QT Imaging, and one that we would not have reached without the hard work and focus of our dedicated employees and the support of our partners at GigCapital5, more so in this very difficult time for fund raising and growing micro-cap companies. By introducing the first body-safe imaging technology into the marketplace, we are creating disruptive innovation, a dedication to using technology, as well as software, artificial intelligence, and smart physics, to improve medical imaging and thus healthcare quality and access. As a public company, we plan to stay committed to building value for shareholders by continuing to address issues presented by conventional imaging technologies with our accurate, safe, less expensive, easily deployable imaging solutions.” Dr. Avi Katz, Founding Managing Partner of GigCapital Global and Executive Chairman of the Board of GigCapital5, said, “The GigCapital team is very proud to have closed our fifth business combination since inception in 2017, GigCapital5 with QT Imaging. We are pleased to continue to support QT Imaging’s journey as a publicly held company, as part of its Board of Directors and other functions as the company enters its next phase of innovation and growth.

Roseburg Forest Products and Danfoss Power Solutions are examples of successful participants in the program, reducing energy usage and costs while increasing sustainability. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Efficiency Consultant The Continuous Energy Improvement (CEI) initiative by Entergy Arkansas represents a significant stride in energy management and sustainability for businesses. From an energy efficiency perspective, the substantial savings reported by companies like Roseburg Forest Products and Danfoss Power Solutions underscore the tangible benefits of systematic energy optimization. Roseburg's avoidance of over 19 million kWh in energy usage, leading to an estimated $1.1 million in savings, demonstrates the potential scale of impact such initiatives can have on operational costs.Furthermore, the initiative's focus on no-cost and low-cost operational changes, such as powering down equipment during non-operational periods, is a critical step towards behavioral change in energy consumption. The ripple effect of this can be seen in the reduction of overhead costs, potentially improving the operating margin and offering a competitive edge. It's also worth noting the positive environmental implications of reduced energy consumption, which align with growing consumer and investor interest in corporate sustainability practices. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the CEI initiative for participating Arkansas businesses are considerable. With Entergy Arkansas awarding $862,482 in incentives, there is a direct impact on these companies' bottom lines. For investors, the energy savings translate into improved financial health for these companies, which could be reflected in their stock performance and attractiveness to sustainability-focused investors.An essential aspect to consider is the forward-looking impact of these savings. The reduced energy costs not only provide immediate financial relief but also allow for reinvestment into other areas of the business, potentially spurring innovation or expansion. Additionally, the positive PR from participating in such initiatives can enhance a company's brand value and customer loyalty, factors that indirectly contribute to long-term shareholder value. Sustainability Analyst The CEI initiative's success stories highlight a growing trend in corporate responsibility towards energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. Companies like Roseburg Forest Products and Danfoss Power Solutions are setting benchmarks for the industry by exceeding their energy reduction goals. This proactive approach to sustainability can serve as a model for other companies, potentially influencing industry norms and expectations.It's also essential to consider the broader implications of such initiatives on the market. As businesses become more energy-efficient and sustainable, they may also benefit from regulatory incentives, subsidies, or tax breaks, further enhancing their competitive advantage. The focus on sustainability can also drive innovation, leading to the development of new products or services that cater to an increasingly eco-conscious consumer base. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM One south Arkansas company estimated to have saved over $1 million in energy costsLITTLE ROCK, AR / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / Arkansas businesses are receiving thousands of dollars in incentive payments and saving even more than that in energy usage by participating in Entergy Arkansas' Entergy Solutions Continuous Energy Improvement (CEI) initiative.CEI, which provides energy efficiency strategies, consulting advice and technical expertise designed to help companies save money and energy, has awarded five companies $862,482 and is estimated to generate energy savings of 36.5 million kilowatt hours.

The CEO emphasizes the focus on core New York markets and long-term profitability, while the CFO highlights cost reduction and improved efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic divestiture of ten branches by Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. represents a significant consolidation effort within the banking sector. From a market research perspective, the reduction of physical branches aligns with broader industry trends where financial institutions are optimizing their branch networks in response to digital banking adoption. By concentrating on core markets, Berkshire is likely aiming to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency in areas with higher growth potential.The transaction's neutrality to the 2024 earnings outlook suggests a carefully balanced financial strategy. The preservation of capital through the avoidance of severance and real estate costs is a prudent move that could bolster investor confidence. Moreover, the commitment to retaining all associated staff could ensure continuity of service, which is crucial for maintaining customer relationships during such transitions. Financial Analyst The sale of branches, including associated deposits and loans, has immediate balance sheet implications for Berkshire Hills Bancorp. With approximately $485.5 million in deposits being transferred, there is a notable liquidity event. However, the management's statement that this will not materially increase borrowings indicates a stable liquidity position post-transaction.Investors should note the emphasis on cost savings and long-term profitability. The reduction in the expense run rate may lead to improved net interest margins over time. This move could be seen as a reallocation of resources towards more profitable or strategic initiatives within the company's core markets. The absence of material impact on the 2024 earnings outlook might suggest that any potential revenue loss from the sold branches is expected to be offset by reduced operating costs and potential gains from the securities sale. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the sales are subject to customary regulatory approvals, indicating that the transactions will be scrutinized by financial regulators to ensure compliance with banking laws and regulations. The involvement of reputable legal counsel, Luse Gorman, PC and financial advisor RBC Capital Markets LLC, underscores the complexity and significance of these transactions.Ensuring that the sales do not disrupt Berkshire's commercial banking business is likely a key legal consideration. The exclusion of commercial banking from the transactions helps mitigate risks associated with client retention and contractual obligations. Additionally, the commitment to offer employment to all associated staff suggests that the company is taking steps to comply with labor laws and potentially reduce the risk of litigation associated with employment disruptions. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM Enhances efficiency and profitability of the overall branch networkStrengthens focus in core New York marketsCombined branch and securities sale is neutral to full year 2024 earnings outlookBOSTON, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.

The notes will be convertible under certain conditions and mature on March 15, 2029. LivaNova may redeem the notes under specific circumstances. The interest rate, conversion rate, and other terms will be determined later. The company expects to enter into capped call transactions to hedge potential dilution and offset cash payments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by LivaNova PLC regarding the private offering of $300 million in convertible senior notes due 2029 is significant for investors and the company's financial strategy. Convertible notes are a form of debt that can be converted into equity, typically shares of the issuing company, under certain conditions. This mechanism provides an alternative to direct equity financing that can be less dilutive to current shareholders if the conversion is at a premium to the current share price.From a financial perspective, the key terms to note are the interest rate, conversion rate and the redemption features. The interest rate will determine the periodic cash outflows for the company, affecting its cash flow and financial stability. The conversion rate will set the price at which the debt can convert into equity, which can influence future equity dilution. The redemption feature allows the company to repurchase the notes after a certain period or upon specific events, which can be a tool for managing its capital structure dynamically.Moreover, the capped call transactions intended to accompany the notes offering are financial instruments aimed at reducing the potential dilution from the converted notes and hedging the company's exposure to stock price movements. The impact of these transactions on the company's earnings per share and share price warrants close attention. Market Research Analyst Entering into a convertible note offering and the associated capped call transactions indicates LivaNova's strategic approach to capital raising and earnings management. The company's decision to offer these financial instruments in a private offering to institutional investors suggests a targeted approach towards sophisticated investors who can evaluate the risks and benefits of such complex financial instruments.Market conditions at the time of the offering will heavily influence the success of the notes issuance and the pricing of the capped call transactions. Investor appetite for convertible securities, the prevailing interest rate environment and the performance of LivaNova's stock will all play critical roles. Additionally, the market's reaction to the hedging activities by the option counterparties could affect LivaNova's stock price in the short term, as these transactions may involve substantial volumes of the company's shares. Legal Expert The offering is being made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, which is a safe harbor exemption from the registration requirements for certain offerings to qualified institutional buyers. This exemption allows for a more expedited and less public offering process, which can be advantageous for the issuer. However, it also means that the securities will be restricted and generally cannot be sold to the public without registration or an applicable exemption from registration.Legal considerations also extend to the terms of the conversion and redemption of the notes, as well as the establishment of capped call transactions. These terms must be carefully structured to comply with securities law and to ensure the protection of both the issuer and the investors. The mention of potential redemption in the event of certain tax-related events suggests that LivaNova is also considering the tax implications of the notes and their conversion, which is a prudent legal and financial consideration. 03/04/2024 - 04:44 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LivaNova PLC (Nasdaq: LIVN), a market-leading medical technology company, today announced its intention to offer $300 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), subject to market conditions and other factors. LivaNova also intends to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of LivaNova. Prior to December 15, 2028, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. On or after December 15, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes may be converted at any time. LivaNova will satisfy any conversion of notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of such notes being converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, ordinary shares of LivaNova, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, at LivaNova’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of LivaNova’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of such notes being converted. The notes will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. LivaNova may redeem the notes at its option, on or after March 22, 2027, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which LivaNova provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. LivaNova may also redeem the notes at its option, at any time, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain tax-related events. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, LivaNova expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers in the notes offering or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) having an expiration date that is the same as the maturity date of the notes. The capped call transactions would cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of LivaNova’s ordinary shares underlying the notes and are expected generally to compensate (through the payment of cash to LivaNova) for potential dilution to LivaNova’s ordinary shares upon conversion of the notes and to offset any cash payments made in excess of the principal amount of converted notes in the event that the market price per ordinary share, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, with such compensation and/or offset being subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, LivaNova expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. LivaNova expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will purchase LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of the ordinary shares or the notes at that time. In addition, LivaNova expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or by purchasing or selling ordinary shares or other securities of LivaNova in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so (x) during the observation period related to conversions of notes on or after December 15, 2028, (y) during any observation period related to a conversion of notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2028, if LivaNova elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such conversion and (z) following any repurchase of notes by LivaNova if LivaNova elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert their notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of their notes. LivaNova’s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, LivaNova USA, Inc., is also considering entering into one or more separate and individually negotiated transactions with one or more holders of its 3.00% Cash Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “cash exchangeable senior notes”) to repurchase for cash a portion of the cash exchangeable senior notes on terms to be negotiated separately with each holder (each, a “note repurchase”). The cash exchangeable senior notes were issued by LivaNova USA, Inc. and are guaranteed by LivaNova. Any terms of each note repurchase are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the cash exchangeable senior notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares and the trading price of the cash exchangeable senior notes at the time of each such note repurchase. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the cash exchangeable senior notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. LivaNova USA, Inc. intends to negotiate the note repurchases through one of the initial purchasers and/or its affiliate who would repurchase any such cash exchangeable senior notes from holders and resell them to LivaNova USA, Inc. on or about the closing date of this offering. LivaNova expects that holders of the cash exchangeable senior notes that sell their cash exchangeable senior notes to LivaNova USA, Inc. as described above and that have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such cash exchangeable senior notes may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares (including entering into derivatives with one or more of the initial purchasers in this offering or their respective affiliates) and/or purchase ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, resulting in a higher effective conversion price of the notes. In connection with the issuance of the cash exchangeable senior notes, LivaNova USA, Inc. entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. To the extent LivaNova USA, Inc. effects any note repurchases, it intends to enter into agreements with those financial institutions to terminate a portion of those capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of cash exchangeable senior notes repurchased. In connection with any such termination of any of the existing capped call transactions and the related unwinding of the existing hedge positions of LivaNova USA, Inc.’s counterparties to those capped call transactions, those counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may unwind various derivatives with respect to LivaNova’s ordinary shares and/or sell ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after pricing of the notes. This activity could decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares at that time and could decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market value of the notes. The note repurchases and the unwind of the existing capped call transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the cash exchangeable senior notes participating in the note repurchases and by the financial institutions party to the capped call transactions, could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, or decrease, or reduce the size of any increase in, the market price of LivaNova’s ordinary shares, which may affect the trading price of the notes being offered and the initial conversion price of the notes. LivaNova cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes being offered or LivaNova’s ordinary shares. Additionally, LivaNova is actively engaged in negotiations with respect to, and has the intention to enter into, an incremental facility amendment to its existing credit agreement in order to increase the aggregate principal amount available to LivaNova under its revolving credit facility and decrease the margin under such facility. However, there is no assurance that the completion of such amendment will be achieved. LivaNova expects to use the net proceeds of the offering and the unwind of the existing capped call transactions, after fees, discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, (i) to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described above, (ii) to pay the cost of the note repurchases described above and (iii) to the extent LivaNova has remaining proceeds after satisfying the foregoing, for general corporate purposes. The notes will only be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes have not been, nor will they be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. LivaNova will apply for the listing of the notes on The International Stock Exchange in Guernsey. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any offer or sale of, the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale of the notes would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. This press release does not constitute an offer or solicitation to participate in any note repurchase.

ITIC is a North Carolina company traded on Nasdaq, specializing in title insurance policies, tax-deferred exchanges, and investment management services. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Investors Title Company represents a distribution of earnings to shareholders, which is a direct indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. From a financial perspective, the amount of $.46 per share needs to be evaluated against the company's earnings per share (EPS) to assess the payout ratio. This ratio indicates what portion of earnings is being returned to shareholders versus being reinvested in the company. A stable or increasing dividend over time can signal confidence in the company's financial stability and future earnings potential.Investors may also consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock's price per share. This yield provides a measure of the income return on an investment in the company's stock, which is particularly relevant for income-focused investors. However, it's essential to consider the sustainability of the dividend, as a high yield based on a static dividend can be misleading if the company's stock price is falling due to underlying business issues. Market Research Analyst In the context of the title insurance industry, the announcement of a dividend could be reflective of the overall market conditions affecting the real estate sector. Title insurance is a cyclical business, closely tied to the health of the real estate market, including factors such as transaction volumes and property values. Therefore, the ability of Investors Title Company to pay out dividends may also indicate robust real estate activity and a favorable economic environment for their core business operations.It's also worth noting that the provision of ancillary services such as tax-deferred exchanges and investment management could diversify the company's revenue streams. This diversification can mitigate risks associated with downturns in the real estate market and provide a more stable earnings base, which supports regular dividend payments. Analysts might look at the company's revenue breakdown and growth in these service areas to gauge long-term sustainability and potential areas for expansion. 03/04/2024 - 04:31 PM CHAPEL HILL, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Investors Title Company (Nasdaq: ITIC) announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $.46 per share to shareholders of record March 18, 2024, payable March 29, 2024.

Total net assets decreased from $180.4 million to $162.0 million from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst The reported net investment income of $0.35 per share for OFS Capital Corporation indicates a robust capacity to generate earnings from its investment portfolio, surpassing the quarterly distribution. This is a positive indicator of operational efficiency and could be seen favorably by investors. However, the net loss on investments of $0.66 per share, primarily due to net unrealized depreciation, raises concerns about the valuation of the underlying assets in the portfolio. The decrease in NAV from $12.74 to $12.09 suggests a decline in the intrinsic value of the investments, which may affect investor confidence and could lead to a reevaluation of the company's stock by the market.The repayment of SBA debentures by the subsidiary ahead of schedule reflects a strategic move to optimize capital structure, potentially reducing future interest expenses. However, the surrendering of the license to operate as a small business investment company could signal a strategic shift in operations, which stakeholders should monitor for implications on future growth avenues. Market Research Analyst The portfolio composition, with 92% consisting of floating rate loans, positions OFS Capital to potentially benefit from rising interest rates, as the interest income from these loans would increase correspondingly. However, the weighted-average performing income yield's decrease from 14.6% to 14.1% might be indicative of underlying pressures on income generation or changes in the mix of income-producing assets. This trend warrants attention as it could impact future earnings.The broader market may also react to the performance of structured finance securities, which experienced broader declines. As these securities can be sensitive to economic conditions and market sentiment, their performance can be a bellwether for the health of the credit markets. The attention to these factors is crucial for understanding the potential risks and opportunities within OFS Capital's portfolio. Economist The financial results of OFS Capital, particularly the decrease in net asset value and the net loss on investments, can be partially attributed to the broader economic context, including interest rate fluctuations and market volatility. The performance of floating rate loans as a majority of the loan portfolio is closely tied to monetary policy decisions by central banks. An economist would assess the implications of the current interest rate environment and economic forecasts to gauge the potential impact on OFS Capital's future earnings and investment strategy.Moreover, the early repayment of SBA debentures and the subsequent request for the approval to surrender the SBIC license need to be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. This move could be a strategic adaptation to the changing economic conditions, which may include considerations such as access to capital, regulatory shifts, or a reorientation towards different investment opportunities. 03/04/2024 - 04:30 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFS Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: OFS) (“OFS Capital,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

Expenses For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, total expenses decreased by $0.5 million as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total expenses was primarily due to a decrease in base management and incentives fees of $0.3 million and a decrease in interest expense of $0.2 million related to lower average outstanding debt balances. Net Gain (Loss) on Investments For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net loss on investments of $8.8 million was primarily due to unrealized depreciation on a few issuer-specific portfolio companies and broader declines on our structured finance securities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2023, we had $45.3 million of cash, which included $4.0 million held in OFSCC-FS, LLC (“OFSCC-FS”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Our use of cash held by OFSCC-FS is restricted by contractual conditions of its credit facility with BNP Paribas, including limitations on the amount of cash OFSCC-FS can distribute to us. As of December 31, 2023, OFS SBIC I, LP had cash of $28.0 million. See “Other Recent Events” above. As of December 31, 2023, we had an unused commitment of $25.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility with Banc of California (the “Banc of California Credit Facility”), as well as an unused commitment of $59.5 million under the revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas, both of which are subject to borrowing base requirements and other covenants. On December 15, 2023, we amended the Banc of California Credit Facility to: (i) extend the maturity date from February 28, 2024 to February 28, 2026; (ii) increase the interest rate floor from 4.00% to 5.00%; and (iii) eliminate the 0.50% unused line fee and replace it with an annual commitment fee of 0.50%.

(NASDAQ: ICCH) reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Net earnings increased, with net income of $4,454,000 for the year. Direct premiums written and net premiums earned saw significant growth, driven by rate increases. Despite an increase in losses and settlement expenses, total assets and equity also increased. Management remains optimistic for 2024. Positive Net earnings increased to $4,454,000 for the year from a loss of $582,000 in 2022. Direct premiums written increased by 14.5% for the fourth quarter and 12.4% for the year. Net investment income rose by 28.4% for the year. Total assets and equity increased by 9.8% and 10.9% respectively. Management is optimistic for 2024 with strong core insurance business and investment performance. Negative Losses and settlement expenses increased by 10.7% for the fourth quarter and 7.6% for the year. Expense ratio increased slightly for the year. GAAP combined ratio increased slightly for the year. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by ICC Holdings, Inc. indicate a noteworthy improvement in net earnings for the twelve months of 2023 compared to the previous year. This reflects a positive trajectory in the company's profitability, which can be attributed to increased direct premiums written and net premiums earned, both showing double-digit growth percentages. Such a trend is significant as it suggests a growing market share and successful rate increases, which are vital for revenue generation in the insurance sector.However, the increase in losses and settlement expenses, particularly due to prior year accident development, raises concerns about underwriting quality and reserve adequacy. Investors may scrutinize the company's loss ratio trends and the effectiveness of its underwriting measures, especially for Liquor Liability claims, which have been highlighted as a contributing factor to increased costs.The improvement in book value per share is another positive indicator for shareholders, as it reflects the company's intrinsic value growth. The reported increase in net investment income, driven by higher interest rates and a larger investment portfolio, is also a favorable sign, as it suggests a healthy investment strategy that complements the core insurance business. Market Research Analyst ICC Holdings' focus on the food and beverage industry presents a specialized market niche, which may offer competitive advantages such as tailored products and expertise in addressing industry-specific risks. The company's growth in direct premiums written indicates successful penetration and retention within this niche, an important factor for long-term sustainability.Entering new states, as mentioned by the CEO, could further enhance premium growth, but also comes with regulatory and market risks that need to be managed effectively. The company's ability to maintain growth while managing these risks will be critical for future performance.The slight uptick in the combined ratio, although still under the 100% threshold for the fourth quarter, suggests a balance between premiums earned and incurred losses and expenses. This ratio is a crucial metric for evaluating insurance company efficiency and profitability. Stakeholders will closely monitor this ratio in future periods for signs of sustained underwriting discipline. Economist The reported financial results should be considered within the broader economic context, including inflationary pressures mentioned by management. Inflation can impact both sides of an insurance company's balance sheet: it can lead to higher claim payouts and operating expenses, while also potentially increasing investment returns on assets tied to interest rates.ICC Holdings' ability to navigate inflationary conditions, reflected in their operational results, will be crucial for maintaining profitability. The increase in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses, even if partly due to business growth, warrants attention to ensure that expense growth does not outpace premium growth.The insurance industry is also sensitive to market conditions, as evidenced by the company's unrealized gains on equity securities and fixed income holdings. Fluctuations in market conditions can lead to volatility in these gains or losses, affecting the company's financial stability and performance indicators such as book value per share. 03/04/2024 - 04:30 PM ROCK ISLAND, Ill., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ICC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ICCH) (the Company), parent company of Illinois Casualty Company, a regional, multi-line property and casualty insurance company focusing exclusively on the food and beverage industry, today reported unaudited results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. FOURTH QUARTER AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 – FINANCIAL RESULTS Net earnings totaled $3,058,000, or $1.04 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net earnings of $3,078,000, or $1.05 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net earnings of $4,454,000, or $1.51 per share, compared to a net loss of $582,000, or $0.19 per share, for the same period in 2022. The change for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was driven by increased writings and positive changes in net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. Book value per share increased to $21.35 at December 31, 2023, from $19.16 at December 31, 2022. This increase in book value is due to net income and the improvement in the market value of our fixed income holdings. Direct premiums written increased by $3,059,000, or 14.5%, to $24,091,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, from $21,032,000 for the same period in 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, direct premiums written increased by $10,264,000, or 12.4%, to $92,991,000 compared to $82,727,000 for the same period in 2022. The growth for both periods is primarily due to rate increases. Net premiums earned increased by $1,896,000, or 10.4%, to $20,188,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $18,292,000 for the same period in 2022. Net premiums earned increased by $6,660,000, or 9.6%, to $75,717,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, from $69,057,000 for the same period in 2022. The increase in net premiums earned is driven by the increased premium writings in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company ceded to reinsurers $2,637,000 of earned premiums, compared to $2,435,000 of earned premiums for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company ceded earned premiums of $10,703,000, compared to $9,512,000 for the same period in 2022. This increase is a result of increased direct earned premiums. Net investment income increased by $244,000, or 21.5%, to $1,381,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $1,137,000 for the same period in 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net investment income increased by $1,145,000, or 28.4%, to $5,179,000 from $4,034,000 for the same period in 2022. The increase is the result of both an increase in the interest rates earned on the investments in our portfolio and an increase in the overall size of our investment holdings. Net unrealized gains on equity securities decreased $404,000 year over year to $1,071,000 in gains for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to gains of $1,475,000 for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the fourth quarter was driven by a planned reduction in our equity holdings, which resulted in $404,000 of unrealized gains becoming realized. Net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities increased $6,056,000 year over year to $1,350,000 in gains as of December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of $4,706,000 as of December 31, 2022. Losses and settlement expenses increased by $1,089,000, or 10.7%, to $11,231,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, from $10,142,000 for the same period in 2022. This increase was largely driven by prior year accident development on Liquor Liability claims and Business Owner's Liability claims. Losses and settlement expenses increased by $3,397,000, or 7.6%, to $47,930,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, from $44,533,000 for the same period in 2022. This increase was driven in large part by prior year development of Liquor Liability claims. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by $902,000, or 13.3%, to $7,662,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, from $6,760,000 for the same period in 2022. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by $3,590,000, or 14.4%, to $28,486,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, from $24,896,000 for the same period in 2022. The change in both periods is due to increased commissions stemming from business growth and agency profitability. Total assets increased by $18,904,000, or 9.8%, from $192,162,000 on December 31, 2022, to $211,066,000 on December 31, 2023. This increase was partially due to $8.7M in positive cash flow from operations, which allowed the Company to increase the investment portfolio. The investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, property held for investment, and other invested assets, increased by $13,567,000, or 10.7%, from $127,325,000 on December 31, 2022, to $140,892,000 on December 31, 2023. These increases are a result of improved market conditions impacting both our fixed income and equity portfolios. Total equity increased by $6,590,000, or 10.9%, from $60,441,000 as of December 31, 2022, to $67,031,000 as of December 31, 2023. The main drivers of this increase was current earnings and improved market conditions favorably impacting our fixed income portfolio. FOURTH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 – FINANCIAL RATIOS The Company's losses and settlement expense ratio (defined as losses and settlement expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 55.6% and 63.3% for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared with 55.4% and 64.5% for the same periods in 2022. The expense ratio (defined as the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 38.0% and 37.6% for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 37.0% and 36.1% for the same periods in 2022. The Company's GAAP combined ratio (defined as the sum of the losses and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio) was 93.6% and 100.9% for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 92.4% and 100.6% for the same periods in 2022. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY ""We finished 2023 with a strong fourth quarter. The underwriting measures shared in the Q3 Earnings Release have taken hold, particularly with Liquor Liability, leading to a lower overall loss and settlement expense ratio of 63.3% in 2024. We finished the year with significantly fewer open claims in comparison to the last four years, which should lead to a lower loss and settlement expense ratio in 2024. Inflationary pressures on operating expenses continued resulting in a slightly higher expense ratio and a combined ratio of 100.9%, which is comparable to the 100.6% from 2022. ""Improved investment market conditions in 2023 drove our net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities and stocks up considerably from 2022. In addition, increased rates and holdings expanded our net investment income in 2023 and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. ""We continue to be optimistic for 2024 as our core insurance business remains strong, our investments are performing well, and the new states we are entering will enhance premium growth in 2024,"" stated Arron Sutherland, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Precast gross profit decreased by 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial results of Northwest Pipe Company, several key metrics draw attention. The annual net sales decline of 2.9% and the more pronounced 9.6% decrease in annual gross profit indicate a contraction in both revenue and profitability. This contraction could be attributed to external economic factors such as interest rate fluctuations impacting demand, especially within the Precast segment. However, the company's ability to generate strong cash flow, as evidenced by the $53.5 million net cash from operating activities, showcases effective working capital management. This liquidity improvement, coupled with the strategic stock repurchase, reflects a confident management stance on intrinsic value.The reported backlog figures, particularly the $319 million for SPP, despite a challenging bidding environment, suggest a healthy pipeline that could translate into future revenue stability. Investors should monitor backlog trends as they can be leading indicators of future performance. The capital expenditure reduction year-over-year signals a cautious approach to investment, likely a response to the uncertain market conditions faced in 2023.It is crucial to consider the SPP segment's slight net sales increase against the backdrop of steel price volatility and reduced bidding activity. This resilience may point to the effectiveness of the company's growth strategy and its impact on through-cycle stability. However, the anticipated first-quarter sales decline due to seasonality and unscheduled downtime presents a near-term challenge that stakeholders should be aware of. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Northwest Pipe Company's performance reflects broader industry trends, such as the impact of high interest rates on construction-related demand, particularly within the Precast segment. The reported record safety performance and the emphasis on reducing cyclicality through diversification into the Precast business align with industry norms where companies are increasingly focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) factors and operational resilience.The strength of the company's SPP backlog, including confirmed orders, despite a decrease in bidding volume, indicates a competitive positioning within the Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe market. However, the decline in the Precast order book year-over-year could be seen as a cause for concern, potentially indicating a need for strategic adjustments to counteract the effects of the interest rate environment.The company's strategic share repurchases suggest a perceived undervaluation by management, which might be of interest to investors as a signal of confidence. However, such buybacks also reduce the equity available and can affect the stock's liquidity and volatility. Economist Examining the economic context, Northwest Pipe Company's financial results can be partially understood through the lens of macroeconomic conditions. The influence of interest rates on the Precast segment underscores the sensitivity of infrastructure and construction sectors to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's actions throughout 2023 have likely played a role in shaping demand patterns for the company's products.The reduced overhead absorption due to lower demand in the Precast segment suggests a need for flexible cost structures to maintain profitability in varying economic climates. As the company anticipates a stronger bidding environment in 2024, it is important to consider potential economic recovery scenarios and infrastructure spending as key drivers for future growth.The company's focus on margin improvement and cash flow generation is a prudent approach in an environment where operating leverage can be both a risk and an opportunity. The ability to navigate economic headwinds while maintaining strong liquidity positions the company favorably for capitalizing on potential market upswings. 03/04/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth quarter 2023 net sales of $110.2 million increased 3.1% year-over-yearAnnual net sales of $444.4 million decreased 2.9% year-over-yearAnnual gross profit of $77.6 million decreased 9.6% year-over-year from 2022 recordAnnual net income of $2.09 per diluted shareStrong annual cash generation with net cash provided by operating activities of $53.5 millionBacklog1 of $273 million; backlog including confirmed orders2 of $319 million for the Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe segment (""SPP"")Order book3 of $46 million for the Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems segment (""Precast"")Repurchased $4.4 million of common stock through February 29, 2024Record safety performance; annual total recordable incident rate of 1.51VANCOUVER, Wash., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Pipe Company (NASDAQ: NWPX) (the ""Company""), a leading manufacturer of water-related infrastructure products, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The Company will broadcast its fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call on Tuesday, March 5, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. PT. Management Commentary ""Despite the challenging circumstances of 2023, we generated annual net sales of $444.4 million, down only moderately from 2022, demonstrating what we believe is a new level of through cycle resilience created by the growth strategy deployed over the last several years. In 2023 we faced significant challenges in both our Steel Pressure Pipe and Precast businesses. The SPP business had one of the smallest bidding volume periods we have seen in many years and the Precast business continued to be suppressed by the interest rate environment throughout 2023,"" said Scott Montross, President and Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Pipe Company. ""In addition, we achieved record safety performance in 2023 and collectively our facilities are well below the national average for total recordable incident rate."" Mr. Montross continued, ""Our SPP revenue of $296.4 million was strong and our backlog including confirmed orders remained elevated at $319 million despite significantly reduced bidding activity and steel price volatility throughout 2023. While we anticipate a significantly stronger bidding year in 2024, due to typical seasonality and severe weather conditions that have led to unscheduled downtime time at several facilities, first quarter SPP net sales are expected to decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, but expected to remain well above first quarter 2023 levels. We also expect year-over-year SPP margins in the first quarter to improve moderately compared to 2023. Precast net sales declined slightly by 1.4% year-over-year to $148.0 million in 2023 as higher interest rates continued to impact demand for both the residential and commercial construction markets. Precast margins were compressed due to reduced overhead absorption on lower demand. Further, the aforementioned early 2024 weather events have also caused unscheduled downtime in our Precast facilities, further suppressing the already seasonally slow first quarter. We expect Precast net sales in the first quarter to be similar to the same quarter last year with near-term margins remaining compressed."" Mr. Montross concluded, ""We were pleased to have improved our liquidity position in the fourth quarter by continuing to pay down debt and generating strong cash flow from operations given our effective management of working capital despite reduced levels of profitability. Our growth strategy remains focused on growing our Precast business to reduce the cyclicality of our SPP operations and improving our overall margins and cash flow generation.""

(NASDAQ: PTEN) reported an average of 122 drilling rigs operating in the United States for February 2024. The company emphasized that various factors can affect its operating results, and the number of drilling rigs may not directly correlate with financial performance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The disclosure by Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. regarding the average number of drilling rigs operating is a direct indicator of the company's activity levels and, by extension, its revenue-generating capacity. This figure is a critical metric for investors as it reflects the operational scale for a given period. A stable or increasing trend in the number of drilling rigs can signal robust demand for the company's services, potentially leading to higher utilization rates, increased revenue and improved margins.However, it's important to note that the number of active rigs does not directly translate to financial performance, as the company's profitability is also affected by factors such as day rates, operational efficiency and cost structure. Investors should also consider the broader industry context, including oil prices, energy demand forecasts and sector-specific challenges, as these can significantly influence Patterson-UTI's business outlook and stock performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement serves as a preliminary indicator of Patterson-UTI's quarterly performance. The consistency in the average number of drilling rigs operating suggests a steady operational tempo, which could be factored into revenue estimations for the upcoming quarterly results. Investors typically look for stability or growth in operational metrics as a sign of a company's health and competitive positioning.While this operational update is valuable, it is essential for investors to await the full financial results, including income statements and balance sheets, to assess the company's profitability, debt levels and cash flow situation. These comprehensive financials will offer a clearer picture of Patterson-UTI's financial health and its potential impact on the stock market. Energy Sector Analyst The number of active drilling rigs is a bellwether for the energy sector at large, often correlating with industry investment trends and commodity prices. For companies like Patterson-UTI, which operate in the oilfield services industry, rig counts can provide insights into future sector activity and capital expenditure among exploration and production companies.Analysts in this field would compare the reported rig count against broader industry trends, such as the Baker Hughes rig count, to gauge whether Patterson-UTI is outperforming or underperforming its peers. This comparison can offer predictive insights into market share dynamics and the company's strategic positioning. Additionally, understanding the geographic distribution of these rigs can shed light on regional market conditions and potential regulatory impacts on operations. 03/04/2024 - 06:45 PM HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / PATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.

Wisconsin Power and Light Company Prices Public Offering of Green Bonds,2024-03-04T22:47:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Wisconsin Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation, has priced a public offering of $300 million in 5.375% debentures due in 2034. The proceeds will be used for developing and acquiring solar electric generating units. The offering is expected to close on March 7, 2024.","Wisconsin Power and Light Company Prices Public Offering of Green Bonds Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Wisconsin Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation, has priced a public offering of $300 million in 5.375% debentures due in 2034. The proceeds will be used for developing and acquiring solar electric generating units. The offering is expected to close on March 7, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Wisconsin Power and Light Company's $300 million green bond offering is a significant financial event that merits close scrutiny. Green bonds are a type of fixed-income instrument that are specifically earmarked to raise money for climate and environmental projects. The 5.375% interest rate is a critical figure, as it represents the cost of borrowing for WPL and impacts the attractiveness of the bonds to investors. In the current market, where interest rates are rising, a higher coupon rate may be necessary to entice investment, but it also implies a higher cost of capital for the issuer.Investors and analysts should evaluate the terms of the bond in the context of the broader market and WPL's financial health. The allocation of funds towards solar electric generating units is aligned with a growing trend in sustainable investment, potentially offering long-term benefits to both the company and investors. However, it's also important to assess the projected return on investment for these solar projects, as they will ultimately be the source of revenue to cover the interest payments and principal on the bonds. Environmental Economist From an environmental economics perspective, the issuance of a green bond by WPL is a strategic move that reflects a broader shift towards sustainable energy infrastructure. The earmarking of proceeds for solar electric generating units indicates a commitment to renewable energy, which is increasingly seen as a necessary transition to address climate change. This transition not only has environmental benefits but could also provide economic advantages in the form of potential subsidies, tax benefits and a stronger corporate reputation that can enhance customer and investor relations.However, the long-term success of this investment hinges on factors such as technological advancements in solar energy, regulatory changes and the overall economic environment. Investors should consider the volatility of these factors and the company's ability to adapt to changes that could affect the profitability of the solar projects funded by these bonds. Market Research Analyst In terms of market dynamics, the green bond market has been expanding as investors increasingly seek out environmentally friendly investment opportunities. WPL's offering taps into this demand, potentially providing a competitive edge in attracting capital. The involvement of prominent underwriters and the use of a shelf registration statement suggest a well-planned issuance process, which may increase investor confidence.It is essential for stakeholders to analyze WPL's market position, the competitive landscape of the energy sector and the potential impact of this green bond on the company's financial structure. The bond's due date of 2034 gives a relatively long-term horizon, which requires an assessment of the issuer's long-term financial stability and the sustainability of its business model in the context of evolving energy markets. 03/04/2024 - 05:47 PM $300 million in green bonds will be due in 2034 MADISON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Wisconsin Power and Light Company (“WPL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: LNT), announced the pricing of its public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% debentures.

The estimated total capital expenditures over the next five years to meet the buildout requirements and other projects is $508 million gross and $346 million net after grant funding. 2023-Fourth Quarter and Full Year Preliminary Results RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LICT Corporation (“LICT” or the “Company”; OTC Pink®: LICT) reports unaudited, preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Data for all periods is adjusted for the spin-off of MachTen and presented as discontinued operations. Unaudited Results - Fourth Quarter Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $0.3 million to $29.6 million versus $29.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-regulated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 5.2% to $18.1 million from the prior year’s fourth quarter $17.2 million driven by sales of broadband services and high-speed data circuits. Further, our results include December revenues from the Manti Non-Regulated entities which were acquired on November 30th. Regulated revenues were $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decline of $0.6 million versus the prior year’s fourth quarter of $12.1 million. Total EBITDA was $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $12.6 million in 2022. The $1.0 million decline in EBITDA is the result of higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, including higher labor and increased material costs, professional and engineering fee expenses, as well as a decline in regulated revenue and also crimped by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.5 million in our Iowa/Wisconsin operation. In 2022 the impairment charge was $5.7 million to our Iowa/Wisconsin subsidiaries. Non-regulated EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $7.7 million compared to $7.5 million last year. The increase was driven by the above-mentioned increases in broadband services and high-speed data circuits, offset by increased expenses. Regulated EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.9 million compared to $5.1 million during the same period last year. OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSES) – Other income/expenses decreased to $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, versus $0.3 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter, reflecting higher earnings from affiliated companies partially offset by higher interest expense. EARNINGS PER SHARE – Earnings per share excluding one-time events for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $163 per share compared to $293 per share last year. Unaudited Results - Full Year Revenues from continuing operations in 2023 were $116.5 million, an increase of $1.0 million, compared to $115.5 million in 2022. Non-regulated revenues for the full-year 2023 increased by $2.5 million to $70.4 million from the prior year’s $67.9 million driven by sales of broadband services and high-speed data circuits. Regulated revenues were $46.1 million in 2023, a decline of $1.5 million versus the prior year total of $47.6 million due to a loss in voice access lines as well as the annual 5% decline in frozen switch access. EBITDA in 2023 totaled $45.6 million versus $48.8 million in 2022. The $3.1 million decline was due in part to a $0.8 million reduction as a result of a previously announced abandonment of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund programs. Additionally, throughout the year we faced inflationary pressures, resulting in increased salary expenses. Increase in our bandwidth capacity and resold circuits, accounted for $0.9 million of the increase in expenses. The planned surge in capital projects over the next five years required us to allocate additional resources and expenses such as consulting and engineering during 2023. Non-regulated EBITDA remained flat at $28.8 million for the year, while regulated EBITDA declined by $3.1 million to $16.8 million compared to $19.9 million in 2022. As previously mentioned, in the full year there was a non-cash $3.5 million goodwill impairment charge versus $5.7 million, in 2022. OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSES) Other expenses in 2023 rose to $1.1 million versus $0.4 million in the prior year. This change was driven by higher interest expenses offset by an increase in earnings in affiliated companies. EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share excluding one-time events for the full year of 2023 were $949 per share as compared to $1,333 per share for the prior year. CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS - LICT is in the process of completing its most recent Shareholder Designated Contribution Program. Registered shareholders on February 15, 2023, were eligible to designate $100 per LICT share owned to a 501(c)3 charity. The current program could result in $1.2 million of designated contributions for 2023. As we have noted, LICT’s program tracks the shareholder contribution program established by Berkshire Hathaway in 1981. At the inception of Berkshire’s program, Warren Buffett explained in his letter to shareholders that charitable giving in this manner provides significant benefits to shareholders. In addition, GAMCO Investors initiated a similar program in 2013, followed by Associated Capital Group in 2016. Since the inception of the program in 2016, LICT has contributed approximately $9.6 million to designated 501(c)(3) organizations chosen by shareholders. FCC Programs and Other Capital Expenditures Total gross Capital Expenditures to meet the buildout requirements for E-ACAM, Federal (ReConnect III & IV) and State grants are estimated at $508 million and net of $346 million after grant funding. I. ENHANCED ALTERNATIVE CONNECT AMERICA COST MODEL (E-ACAM) PROGRAM The Federal Communications Commission proposed an increase in ACAM funding through a program known as E-ACAM, which began January 1, 2024. In the new program, though there is some lingering concern and debate over funding, LICT entities will receive $37 million annually through 2038 with minimum speed requirements of 100/20 Mbps, and the required Capex is $364 million gross and $253 million after grant funding. II. RECONNECT III and RECONNECT IV- LICT was also awarded contracts for 7 entities, of which, our share of cost would be approximately $14 million. These grants require us to provide 1 Gig of fiber broadband speed. III. AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP) Under the ACP program, which has been terminated, eligible customers received a broadband credit of up to $30 per month (up to $75 for households on Tribal Lands) towards their qualifying internet plan. During 2023, our approximately 1900 eligible customers received just over a half million dollars in credits. Strategic Initiatives The spin-off of our Michigan entity, MachTen (OTC Pink: MACT), occurred on August 31, 2023. At the time of the spin-off each shareholder of LICT received 150 shares of MachTen per one share of LICT. LICT acquisition of Manti Telephone Company (MTC) and its partner companies, Manti Tele Communications Company (MTCC), and AFConnect (AFI) is nearly complete. The Manti transaction closed on November 30, 2023, and the MTC transaction will close pending regulatory approval. During the fourth quarter of 2023, LICT completed the sale of 40% of its 20% ownership of Brick Skirt Holding Company (formerly DFT Communications) to CIBL, Inc. LICT’s sale of its remaining 12% ownership of Brick Skirt, is pending regulatory approval. Bretton Woods continues to utilize Brick Skirt for certain administrative functions as it has since 2014, when LICT sold DFT back to its founding family, but retained a 20% equity interest. FIXED WIRELESS - Sound Broadband LLC, LICT’s newly formed, wireless company, has initiated the installation of 5G wireless broadband services in areas we serve in New Mexico. Additional analysis continues in order to expand the implementation of 5G wireless broadband services in our other locations to efficiently provide increased broadband speeds to many of the communities we serve. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES – For the fourth quarter of 2023, capital expenditures were $7.5 million versus $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Capital Expenditures for the year 2023 were $37 million versus $42 million in 2022, excluding our Michigan entity. SHARE REPURCHASES – During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 370 shares for $6.7 million, with an average price of $18,235 per share. On December 31, 2023, 16,971 shares were outstanding, with 425 shares remaining authorized for purchase. OPERATING STATISTICS/BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT - LICT owns and operates 6,329 miles of fiber optic cable, 9,040 miles of copper cable, 839 miles of coaxial cable and 82 towers.

Market Research Analyst The joint venture between Bunge and Chevron to build a new oilseed processing plant represents a strategic move to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable fuel feedstocks. This development is indicative of a broader industry trend where companies are investing heavily in renewable energy sources to meet both regulatory requirements and market demand for cleaner energy alternatives. The flexible design of the plant to process various types of oilseeds, including novel crops, suggests a forward-thinking approach to supply chain diversification and innovation.From a market perspective, this expansion could enhance the competitive positioning of Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables by increasing its production capacity and potentially reducing costs through economies of scale. The addition of 30 new jobs upon the plant's completion also signals a positive economic impact at the local level. Furthermore, the investment aligns with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, which are increasingly influencing investment decisions and stock valuations. Energy Sector Analyst The announcement of Bunge and Chevron's investment decision is particularly significant for the energy sector, as it underscores the shift towards renewable fuel sources. The new plant's capability to process softseeds and novel winter oilseed crops aligns with the industry's need for innovation in feedstock production to support sustainable fuel alternatives. The operational goal set for 2026 positions the joint venture as a future key player in the renewable fuels market.For stakeholders, this move suggests a long-term strategy aimed at reducing carbon intensity in transportation fuels. Chevron's involvement and its rights to purchase oil for transportation fuel manufacturing could potentially lead to more efficient and cleaner fuel options in the market, which is in line with global carbon reduction goals. This could enhance Chevron's reputation as a leader in energy transition and potentially improve its market share in the renewables sector. Environmental Policy Expert The environmental implications of this investment are profound. By focusing on renewable fuel feedstocks, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables is contributing to the reduction of lifecycle carbon intensity in transportation fuels. This initiative supports national and international climate goals by providing a tangible pathway to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. The plant's ability to process a diverse range of oilseeds, including CoverCress, which can be grown as a cover crop, also suggests potential agricultural benefits such as soil health improvement and better crop rotations.The joint venture's strategic direction is aligned with the increasing regulatory pressure to transition towards low-carbon energy sources. This proactive approach not only mitigates future regulatory risks but also positions the company favorably in the eyes of environmentally-conscious investors and consumers who prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM ST. LOUIS & SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bunge (NYSE:BG) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) today announced approval of a final investment decision for their joint venture Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC to build a new oilseed processing plant adjacent to its existing processing facility located on the Gulf Coast in Destrehan, LA. The announcement was celebrated with a groundbreaking event at the site. The plant features a flexible design, intended to allow it to process soybeans as well as softseeds, including novel winter oilseed crops, such as winter canola and CoverCress, among others. Expected to be operational in 2026, the processing facility aims to add scale and efficiencies to Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables, that will allow the company to better meet the increased market demand for renewable fuel feedstocks. The plant is also intended to support the growing feed and protein markets through the production of meal products. “This new facility is another step in our long-term strategy to improve our capabilities at scale for the renewable fuels market and to reduce the carbon intensity of our own and our customers' value chains,” said Luciano Salvatierra, Bunge’s Senior Vice-President, Renewable Fuels. The expansion is expected to create more than 150 construction jobs and add 30 new jobs when the plant is operational. “Having greater ability to process softseeds, including novel winter oilseed crops, will help advance our innovation in the feedstock space and meet the growing demand for renewable fuels,” said Stacey Orlandi, director, Manufacturing, Chevron Renewable Energy Group. “Investments like this one help support farmers and consumers while reducing the lifecycle carbon intensity for transportation fuels.” Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables is focused on developing renewable fuel feedstocks leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships and Chevron’s expertise in renewable fuels production and marketing.

The payment will be made until August 31, 2024, based on the final stockholding position recorded on March 21, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING S.A. regarding the payment of interest on capital (IOC) to stockholders is a significant financial event that should be closely scrutinized by investors. The payment of R$ 0.2418 per share, with a 15% income tax withholding, reflects a direct return to shareholders and impacts the distributable earnings of the bank. The timing and size of such payments can influence investor sentiment and stock liquidity, as they often signal the company's cash flow stability and profitability.It is crucial to consider the historical trends of IOC payments by Itaú Unibanco and compare them with industry benchmarks. A consistent track record of IOC payments could imply robust financial health, whereas deviations might indicate changes in the company's capital allocation strategy or underlying financial conditions. Investors should also factor in the potential tax implications and the net receivable amount, which is R$ 0.20553 per share after taxes.Moreover, the declared IOC could affect the stock's ex-dividend price adjustment on March 22, 2024. Typically, a stock price might drop by an amount roughly equivalent to the dividend (or IOC in this case) payment on the ex-date, reflecting the reduction in the company's assets due to the payout. This is a key consideration for strategies involving dividend capture or for investors evaluating entry and exit points. Market Research Analyst The announcement from ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING S.A. can be seen as an indicator of the bank's strategic priorities, particularly in terms of shareholder value distribution. The provision of IOC is a common practice in Brazilian markets, often preferred over dividends due to tax advantages for both the company and investors. It is essential to analyze the competitive landscape, where such payouts can influence the attractiveness of ITAÚ UNIBANCO's shares relative to its peers.Investor relations strategies, such as the one employed by Itaú Unibanco, aim to maintain transparent communication with shareholders and can be instrumental in managing market expectations. The bank's approach to capital distribution should be evaluated within the broader context of its financial performance, including return on equity (ROE), earnings growth and risk management practices.Understanding the sector-specific implications of such payments, including regulatory constraints and the macroeconomic environment, is also vital. For instance, the Central Bank of Brazil's monetary policy and regulatory requirements could influence the bank's capital adequacy and, consequently, its capacity for IOC payments. Tax Advisor The tax implications of the interest on capital payment announced by ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING S.A. warrant careful consideration. The 15% withholding tax rate on IOC payments is a critical aspect for individual investors, as it affects the net income they receive. Corporate stockholders, who can prove immunity or exemption from such withholding, stand to benefit differently, highlighting the importance of tax planning in investment decisions.Investors should be aware of the Brazilian tax code's nuances concerning IOC and how it interacts with other forms of investment income. The distinction between IOC and dividends, for example, is particularly relevant in Brazil, where dividends are typically exempt from income tax, whereas IOC is not. However, IOC can be deductible for the company, which may result in a lower overall tax burden and thus influence the company's preference for this form of shareholder remuneration.It is essential to assess the after-tax return on investment, considering the IOC payment in conjunction with the investor's overall tax situation. This can affect the effective yield on the shares and should be factored into the investment analysis and portfolio strategy. 03/04/2024 - 04:58 PM SÃO PAULO, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING S.A. informs its stockholders that its Board of Directors has approved, at the meeting held on this date, the payment of interest on capital to stockholders, in the amount of R$ 0.2418 per share, with income tax withholding at a rate of 15%, resulting in net interest of R$ 0.20553 per share, except for the corporate stockholders able to prove that they are immune or exempt from such withholding, which will be made until August 31, 2024, as usually done by the Company, based on the final stockholding position recorded on March 21, 2024, with their shares traded ex-rights starting March 22, 2024.

Additionally, Ranger published its first Sustainability Report. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Ranger Energy Services, Inc. indicates a robust fiscal health with a 5% increase in annual revenue and a 57% increase in net income year-over-year. The company's strategic capital allocation, including debt repayment, dividend initiation and share repurchases, suggests a strong balance sheet and a shareholder-friendly approach. The 22% free cash flow to trailing 30-day stock price ratio is a substantial figure, highlighting efficient cash management and potential for reinvestment or further shareholder returns. The authorization of an additional $50 million for share repurchases demonstrates confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects.While the results are positive, it is essential to consider the broader industry context. The U.S. land rig count decline could signal potential challenges in the energy sector that Ranger may face. However, the company's resilience in maintaining profitability despite this indicates a competitive edge. Investors should monitor the sustainability of Ranger's financial performance, especially in the context of fluctuating energy prices and potential regulatory changes. Market Research Analyst Despite a decrease in U.S. land rig count, Ranger Energy Services has managed to achieve record revenues and EBITDA margins. This suggests that the company has effectively capitalized on its 'production cycle focus' and strong customer relationships. The initiation of shareholder return programs, including dividends and share repurchases, is a clear signal to the market of Ranger's financial stability and commitment to delivering shareholder value.However, the mention of 'customer budget exhaustion' and 'holiday slowdowns' in the fourth quarter could indicate cyclical vulnerabilities. Investors should consider the potential impact of market seasonality on future performance. Additionally, the company's sustainability report could play a role in attracting ESG-focused investors, potentially influencing stock market sentiment. Energy Sector Analyst Ranger Energy Services' performance amidst a 20% drop in U.S. land rig count is noteworthy. The company's emphasis on high specification rigs and wireline segment resilience, despite end-of-year slowdowns, showcases its operational efficiency and adaptability. The energy sector's dynamics, including oil and gas prices and drilling activity levels, will continue to influence Ranger's operations. Therefore, while current financial results are strong, ongoing attention to industry trends and Ranger's strategic responses is crucial for stakeholders.Additionally, the company's focus on sustainability could be a strategic move to align with industry shifts towards cleaner energy and operational efficiency. The publication of a sustainability report may enhance Ranger's reputation and compliance with emerging regulations, which is increasingly important for long-term viability in the energy sector. 03/04/2024 - 04:54 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ranger Energy Services, Inc.

Sustainability Report ____________________ 1 “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free Cash Flow” are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). A Non-GAAP supporting schedule is included with the statements and schedules attached to this press release and can also be found on the Company's website at: www.rangerenergy.com. 2 Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s share price is calculated at $10.20, based on 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding December 31, 2023. 3 Shares repurchased to date include repurchases settled from January 1, 2024 through February 29, 2024 with total share repurchases under existing share repurchase authorization of 2,542,300. Management Comments Stuart Bodden, Ranger’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased to report the highest annual earnings in Ranger’s history in 2023. Strong customer relationships, superior service quality and our production cycle focus drove the Company to record high revenue, despite a U.S. land rig count which was 20% below the prior year. Ranger also reported record high EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Earnings per Share despite weaker than anticipated customer activity. This year was pivotal for Ranger in not only proving our investment thesis that the Company can weather drilling activity declines with a resilient profile, but also in transforming the financial profile of the Company through paying down our debt, initiating a dividend and repurchasing a significant amount of our outstanding shares to return meaningful value to our shareholders. The Company’s first shareholder returns program, launched in the second quarter, resulted in a distribution of $21.7 million to shareholders, or 40% of free cash flow, through cash dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases have continued during the first quarter of 2024 given the compelling value our shares present today. All of these accomplishments were enabled by our committed and resourceful team members, from top to bottom, that truly embody what we term our OneRanger spirit.” “Our fourth quarter was impacted by customer budget exhaustion and holiday slowdowns. That said, our anchor high specification rigs business showed stability, as it has throughout 2023. Our wireline segment showed some weakness given frac slowdowns at year-end along with more significant seasonality given the heavier exposure to Northern basins. Pricing across segments improved or remained resilient during the year and we remain bullish about the longer-term opportunities for the Company and our ability to grow with existing asset capacity,” continued Bodden. “I am also proud to announce that Ranger has released its first ever Sustainability Report today, which details the Company’s efforts towards operating more safely and responsibly. Ranger has always taken its environmental, social and governance obligations seriously and we are delighted to share the results of our programs and cast a vision for the future.” “We begin 2024 from a position of strength. Ranger is debt free with over $85 million of liquidity and confident in our ability to navigate an uncertain environment. Our two strategic priorities in 2024 are to continue our profitable growth and provide meaningful capital returns to shareholders. Our acquisition strategy includes both smaller bolt-on type opportunities, as well as potentially larger transactions, and we will target lower capital intensity service lines, increased in-basin scale, and production cycle focus. As it relates to shareholder returns, we remain fully committed to our dividend and continuing to opportunistically repurchase our shares during the year,” concluded Bodden. REVIEWING 2023 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Ranger’s stated four strategic pillars for creating shareholder value are: maximizing cash flow, fortifying its balance sheet, growing through acquisition, and returning meaningful capital to shareholders. These pillars underpinned our success in 2023 and lay the foundation for our path in 2024. a. Maximizing Cash Flow: The Company’s focus on cash flow generation is enabled by its capital efficient business model with strong operating leverage. During 2023, the Company generated $63.0 million of free cash flow(1), after adjusting for the acquisition and related integration costs of pumps in the third quarter. We previously communicated our ability to convert at least 60% of our EBITDA to free cash flow and 2024 will be focused on delivering on that goal once more as we continue to focus on expanding profit margins in our wireline business. b. Fortifying the Balance Sheet: The Company ended the fourth quarter with $0.1 million of debt and $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and liquidity in excess of $85 million. The Company believes, at its current size and in consideration of industry dynamics, that minimal debt is critical to its ability to maximize shareholder returns through opportunistic investment and capital returns to shareholders and will look to preserve and grow balance sheet strength in the coming year looking only to use leverage in acquisitions when there is a high degree of confidence in future cash flows. c. Exploring Growth Through Acquisition: During the third quarter of 2023, the Company closed on its purchase of pump down assets and support equipment. The Company remains highly engaged in evaluating opportunities and ever disciplined in ensuring that any transactions are value creating to shareholders. d. Returning Capital to Shareholders: The Company has made and is reiterating its commitment to return at least 25% of annual cash flows to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, the Company repurchased 1,805,500 shares with continued repurchases in 2024 spending over $25 million since initiation a year ago. The Board has approved an additional $50 million share repurchase program authorization, resulting in a total share repurchase capacity of $85 million. Furthermore, the Board is declaring its quarterly dividend today, March 4, 2024, of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable on April 5, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $151.5 million, a decrease from $154.3 million in the prior year period, and a decrease from $164.4 million in the prior quarter. Revenue decreases from the prior year were attributable to reduced activity in our wireline and processing and ancillary services segments. Year-to-date revenue was $636.6 million, an increase of 5%, or $28.1 million from $608.5 million in the prior year due to pricing improvements across segments and increasing operating activity in select service lines. Cost of services for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $129.7 million, or 86% of revenue, compared to $127.8 million, or 83% of revenue in the prior year period. The increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue from the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to inflationary cost pressures and reduced operating activity during the quarter due to year-end customer activity declines and weather related issues. Year-to-date cost of services was $531.7 million, or 84% of revenue, compared to $503.9 million or 83% of revenue in the prior year period attributable to inflationary pressures on labor, rentals and repair costs with the most significant increase noted medical costs per employee which affected cost of services by $3.5 million in 2023 when compared to 2022. General and administrative expenses were $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $7.5 million in the prior year period and $7.0 million in the prior quarter. General and administrative expenses year-to-date totaled $29.5 million. This compares to general and administrative expenses of $39.9 million in 2022. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to prior year elevated acquisition and integration costs related to acquisitions. Net income totaled $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $7.6 million in the prior year period and $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income from the prior year and quarter periods is primarily attributable to increasing costs as compared to the prior year, such as the aforementioned medical costs. 2023 net income of $23.8 million increased 58% from $15.1 million in 2022. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.09 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.30 in the prior year period and $0.38 in the prior quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share for 2023 was $0.95 compared to $0.65 in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased $3.2 million from $21.6 million in the prior year period and decreased $5.6 million from $24.0 million in the prior quarter. The decreases were driven by the aforementioned reduction in wireline completions activity and certain ancillary service lines as well as inflationary pressure on costs. 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was $84.4 million, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the prior year. BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS High Specification Rigs High Specification Rigs segment revenue was $79.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a increase of $6.4 million, or 9% relative to the prior year period, and a decrease of $0.2 million relative to the prior quarter revenue of $79.2 million. Rig hours decreased by 4% to 107,900 from 112,400 in the prior quarter and decreased by 5% from 113,600 in the prior year period. Hourly rig rates increased by 5% to $733 from $700 per hour in the prior quarter, reflecting an slight increase in pricing quarter over quarter. Segment revenue for the full year was $313.3 million, an increase of $20.1 million, or 7% compared to 2022. Hourly rig rates increased by 12% from $625 per hour in 2022 to $703 per hour in 2023. Operating income was $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.2 million, or 2% relative to $9.8 million in the prior year period and a decrease of $0.6 million, or 6% compared to $10.6 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.4 million in the fourth quarter, up from $15.2 million in the prior year period and down from $15.7 million in the prior quarter. Operating income was $44.0 million for year-to-date 2023, an increase of $9.7 million, or 28% relative to $34.3 million for year-to-date 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $64.1 million in 2023, up from $60.5 million in 2022. Wireline Services Wireline Services segment revenue was $41.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, down $6.8 million, or 14% compared to $48.3 million in the prior year period and down $11.7 million, or 22% compared to $53.2 million in the prior quarter. Our Completions service line completed stage counts of 5,000, a decrease of 26% compared to 6,800 in the prior year period and a decrease of 26% compared to 6,800 for the prior quarter. Stage count pricing was $8,400 for the current quarter as compared to $7,100 for the prior year period and $7,800 for the prior quarter. The decrease in revenue and increase stage count from the prior year period is indicative of lower operational activity, offset by improvements made in pricing. Full year segment revenue was $199.1 million, up $2.1 million, or 1% compared to $197.0 million in 2022. Completed stage counts decreased by 18% from 31,400 during 2022, to 25,600 in 2023. Operating loss was $1.8 million in the fourth quarter, down $3.8 million, or 190% from operating income of $2.0 million in the prior year period and down $6.1 million, or 142%, from operating income of $4.3 million for prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 million, down 40% from $4.7 million in the prior year period and down 62% from $7.4 million for the prior quarter. Operating income was $7.1 million, down $0.5 million, or 7% during 2023, from $7.6 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.1 million in 2023, up from $18.6 million for year-to-date during 2022. Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services segment revenue was $31.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, down $2.4 million, or 7% from $33.4 million for the prior year period and down $1.0 million, or 3% from $32.0 million for the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year and from the prior quarter was largely attributable to reductions in operational activity within select service lines. Segment revenue was $124.2 million during 2023, up $5.9 million, or 5% from $118.3 million in 2022. The increase in revenue was attributable to full year increases in operational activity services lines such as coil tubing, plug and abandonment services, and logistics services. Operating income in this segment was $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, down from $4.6 million in the prior year period and down from $4.5 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.3 million, down from $6.6 million in the prior period and down compared to $6.5 million in the prior quarter. BALANCE SHEET, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $85.1 million of liquidity, consisting of $69.4 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $15.7 million of cash on hand. This compares to $61.0 million of liquidity as of December 31, 2022, which consisted of $57.3 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $3.7 million of cash on hand. The Company had total debt of $0.1 million compared to total debt of $18.4 million at December 31, 2022, a reduction of 99%. Year-to-date Cash provided by Operating Activities was $90.8 million, compared to $44.5 million over the same period in 2022. The Company’s free cash flow(1) improved significantly year over year to $54.3 million on a year-to-date basis compared to free cash flow(1) of $30.7 million in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, the Company had capital expenditures of $36.5 million, which includes $7.25 million for the pumping asset acquisition completed during the third quarter. 2024 OUTLOOK Ranger remains bullish on the long-term opportunities and growth potential for its business; however, the Company expects that operator activity levels are unlikely to grow meaningfully during 2024 while supply and demand dynamics and future global economic activity remain uncertain. Against this backdrop, Ranger sees both positive signals and challenges as it enters the year. We are seeing activity begin to ramp in the back half of February after a slow start to the year due to weather impacts and non-Ranger related safety events and shutdowns. Ranger has also expanded work with the key blue-chip customer agreement announced in 2023 and is optimistic that additional growth opportunities will result from this work and other opportunities. Ranger’s production focused business model demonstrated its cyclical resilience in 2023 and underpins a 2024 budget that includes modest growth year over year dependent on operator behavior remaining stable. Converting 60% of EBITDA to free cash flow(1) through efficient use of capital expenditures will continue to allow Ranger to provide strong return of capital to shareholders during the year.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED) Note Regarding Non‑GAAP Financial Measure The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes to be insightful in understanding the Company’s financial results. These financial measures, which include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, should not be construed as being more important than, or as an alternative for, comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Detailed reconciliations of these Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures have been included below and are available in the Investor Relations sections of our website at www.rangerenergy.com. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from the reconciliations. Our computations of these Non-GAAP financial measures may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed below from net income or loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, equity‑based compensation, acquisition-related, severance and reorganization costs, gain or loss on disposal of assets, and certain other non-cash items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance. The following tables are a reconciliation of net income or loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods, in millions: High Specification Rigs Wireline Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Other Total Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Net income (loss) $ 10.0 $ (1.8 ) $ 3.4 $ (9.5 ) $ 2.1 Interest expense, net — — — 0.7 0.7 Income tax expense — — — 1.8 1.8 Depreciation and amortization 5.4 2.9 1.9 0.4 10.6 EBITDA 15.4 1.1 5.3 (6.6 ) 15.2 Equity based compensation — — — 1.2 1.2 Gain on disposal of property and equipment — — — (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Severance and reorganization costs — 1.7 — — 1.7 Acquisition related costs — — — 0.5 0.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15.4 $ 2.8 $ 5.3 $ (5.1 ) $ 18.4 High Specification Rigs Wireline Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Other Total Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net income (loss) $ 10.6 $ 4.3 $ 4.5 $ (10.0 ) $ 9.4 Interest expense, net — — — 0.7 0.7 Income tax expense — — — 1.6 1.6 Depreciation and amortization 5.1 3.1 2.0 0.4 10.6 EBITDA 15.7 7.4 6.5 (7.3 ) 22.3 Impairment of fixed assets — — — 0.4 0.4 Equity based compensation — — — 1.3 1.3 Gain on disposal of property and equipment — — — (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Acquisition related costs — — — 0.1 0.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15.7 $ 7.4 $ 6.5 $ (5.6 ) $ 24.0 High Specification Rigs Wireline Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Other Total Year Ended December 31, 2023 Net income (loss) $ 44.0 $ 7.1 $ 15.5 $ (42.8 ) $ 23.8 Interest expense, net — — — 3.5 3.5 Income tax expense — — — 7.2 7.2 Depreciation and amortization 20.1 11.3 6.9 1.6 39.9 EBITDA 64.1 18.4 22.4 (30.5 ) 74.4 Impairment of fixed assets — — — 0.4 0.4 Equity based compensation — — — 4.8 4.8 Loss on retirement of debt — — — 2.4 2.4 Gain on disposal of property and equipment — — — (1.8 ) (1.8 ) Severance and reorganization costs — 1.7 — 0.4 2.1 Acquisition related costs — — — 2.1 2.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 64.1 $ 20.1 $ 22.4 $ (22.2 ) $ 84.4 High Specification Rigs Wireline Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Other Total Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Net income (loss) $ 9.8 $ 2.0 $ 4.6 $ (8.8 ) $ 7.6 Interest expense, net — — — 1.6 1.6 Income tax benefit — — — (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Depreciation and amortization 5.4 2.7 2.0 0.5 10.6 EBITDA 15.2 4.7 6.6 (6.8 ) 19.7 Equity based compensation — — — 1.0 1.0 Gain on disposal of property and equipment — — — (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Acquisition related costs — — — 1.4 1.4 Legal fees and settlements — — — 0.2 0.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15.2 $ 4.7 $ 6.6 $ (4.9 ) $ 21.6 High Specification Rigs Wireline Services Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services Other Total Year Ended December 31, 2022 Net income (loss) $ 34.3 $ 7.6 $ 20.2 $ (47.0 ) $ 15.1 Interest expense, net — — — 7.3 7.3 Income tax expense — — — 0.9 0.9 Depreciation and amortization 26.2 11.0 5.3 1.9 44.4 EBITDA 60.5 18.6 25.5 (36.9 ) 67.7 Impairment of fixed assets — — — 1.3 1.3 Equity based compensation — — — 3.8 3.8 Gain on disposal of property and equipment — — — (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Bargain purchase gain, net of tax — — — (3.6 ) (3.6 ) Severance and reorganization costs — — — 1.6 1.6 Acquisition related costs — — — 7.9 7.9 Legal fees and settlements — — — 1.5 1.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 60.5 $ 18.6 $ 25.5 $ (25.1 ) $ 79.5 Free Cash Flow We believe free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance, as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows. The following table is a reconciliation of consolidated operating cash flows to free cash flow for the respective periods, in millions: Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 37.7 $ 90.8 $ 44.5 Purchase of property and equipment (8.6 ) (36.5 ) (13.8 ) Free cash Flow $ 29.1 $ 54.3 $ 30.7 Add back: Purchase of property and equipment related to asset acquisition 1.5 8.7 Modified Free cash Flow $ 30.6 $ 63.0 EBITDA $ 18.4 $ 84.4 $ 79.5 Free cash Flow conversion - Free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA 158 % 64 % 39 % Modified Free cash Flow conversion - Modified Free cash Flow as a percentage of EBITDA 166 % 75 % View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240304189183/en/ Melissa Cougle Chief Financial Officer (713) 935-8900 InvestorRelations@rangerenergy.com Source: Ranger Energy Services, Inc.

Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL) (“NGL,” “our,” “we,” or the “Partnership”) today provided an update on the expected availability of the partnership’s 2023 Investor Tax Packages including Schedule K-1 for its common unitholders. Historically, NGL’s Investor Tax Packages have been available by early March for the preceding tax year; however, the timing of the availability of NGL’s 2023 Investor Tax Packages is dependent upon actions of the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration with regard to the passage, or not, of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024, (referred to as “H.R. 7024”). H.R. 7024 was passed by the House of Representatives on January 31, 2024 and is now among the legislative items that the U.S. Senate may or may not consider. This legislation includes changes in tax law which would be applied retroactively to the 2023 tax year. As passed by the House of Representatives, certain provisions in H.R. 7024 would lower NGL’s taxable income for 2023 compared to existing tax law. H.R. 7024 is subject to the legislative process, which may include amendments introduced by the Senate and thus reconciliation of this bill between the House of Representatives and the Senate and subject to the ultimate approval by the President. Due to the ongoing consideration of H.R. 7024 by Congress and thus the uncertainty of the ultimate tax laws applicable to tax year 2023, NGL currently expects that its 2023 Investor Tax Packages, including Schedule K-1 and all information to fiduciaries for common units owned in tax exempt accounts, will be delayed in comparison to previous years and will be available by March 30, 2024. Once the applicable tax laws for 2023 are known and finalized by the passage, or not, of H.R. 7024, NGL will provide an update on the availability of the 2023 Investor Tax Packages. While these matters are beyond our control, we apologize for any inconvenience the timing of this pending tax legislation may cause our partners/unit holders.

The dividend rates for Series D and Series E Preferred Shares are determined based on government bond yields. Holders of Series D Preferred Shares will receive fixed cumulative preferential cash dividends, while holders of Series E Preferred Shares will receive floating rate cumulative preferential cash dividends. The announcement includes specific dividend rates for upcoming periods and conversion instructions for Series D Preferred Shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. regarding the dividend rates for its Series D and Series E Preferred Shares is a significant piece of information for current and potential investors. The reset of the dividend rate to 6.853% for Series D Preferred Shares, pegged to the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield plus a margin, is indicative of the company's approach to offering competitive returns in line with market interest rates. Similarly, the floating dividend rate for the Series E Preferred Shares at 8.261%, tied to the 3-month Government of Canada Treasury Bill yield, suggests a responsiveness to short-term interest rate changes.These rates are crucial for income-focused investors who depend on dividends as a source of regular income. The reset and floating rates provide a hedge against interest rate volatility, which is particularly relevant in the current economic climate where interest rates have been subject to fluctuations. Investors will weigh the attractiveness of these rates against alternative investment opportunities, considering factors such as the stability of the company's cash flows, its credit rating and the overall health of the utility sector. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the adjustment of dividend rates for preferred shares can influence investor perception of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.'s financial health and its ability to sustain payments. The fact that the company has set the dividend rates above the benchmark government bond yields could be interpreted as a positive signal of its financial stability and a commitment to maintaining investor confidence.Moreover, the option for Series D shareholders to convert to Series E shares introduces an element of flexibility that might appeal to investors seeking to capitalize on potential shifts in interest rates. The conversion deadline is also a critical date for the market, as it could impact the liquidity and market pricing of these preferred shares. The market will closely monitor the uptake of conversion offers to gauge investor sentiment towards fixed versus floating dividends in the current economic environment. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the adherence to the terms outlined for both Series D and Series E Preferred Shares is essential. The company must ensure compliance with the conditions set forth in the share prospectus, including the precise calculation of dividend rates and the strict observance of deadlines for conversion rights. Failure to comply could result in legal repercussions and damage to investor trust. The communication to beneficial owners of Series D Preferred Shares regarding the exercise of their conversion right underscores the importance of transparency and due process in corporate actions.It is also important to note that the declaration of dividends is contingent upon board approval, reflecting the company's governance structure and the discretionary nature of dividend payments. Investors should be aware that while the rates are announced, actual dividends are not guaranteed and depend on the company's financial performance and strategic decisions by the board. 03/04/2024 - 05:00 PM OAKVILLE, ON, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Further to the news release of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.

The 10-year contract highlights BWXT's technical capabilities in high-consequence environmental restoration sites. The contract underscores BWXT's commitment to supporting DOE's environmental stewardship and national security efforts. Negative None. Environmental Management Expert The contract awarded to BWX Technologies, Inc. by the U.S. Department of Energy for operations at the Hanford Site represents a substantial commitment to environmental remediation and reflects the growing importance of environmental management within the energy sector. The Hanford Site, with its history of plutonium production, presents unique challenges in terms of radioactive waste cleanup. The estimated value of up to $45 billion over a decade underscores the scale and complexity of the work required.From an environmental management perspective, the integration of operations, waste treatment and project management within the scope of the ITDC is significant. It indicates a holistic approach to environmental restoration, which is essential for minimizing long-term risks and ensuring the safety of the workforce and public. The emphasis on environment, safety, health and quality within the contract’s core functions aligns with industry best practices for such high-stakes projects. Market Research Analyst The financial implications of a contract of this magnitude are considerable for BWX Technologies and its partners. A contract valued at up to $45 billion provides a stable, long-term revenue stream, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors and could potentially influence BWXT's stock market performance positively. The partnership with subsidiaries of Amentum and Fluor also indicates a strong collaboration between major industry players, which may enhance the joint venture's capability to manage the complexities of the Hanford Site project.Furthermore, the award of such a contract by the DOE may signal potential opportunities for other companies in the environmental management sector. As the government continues to prioritize the cleanup of legacy sites, the market for environmental restoration services could see significant growth, potentially benefiting companies with the requisite technical expertise and operational capacity. Energy Sector Analyst The Hanford Integrated Tank Disposition Contract (ITDC) represents a strategic pivot for the U.S. Department of Energy and BWX Technologies, emphasizing the shift towards addressing legacy environmental liabilities. The contract's focus on the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the long-standing issue of radioactive waste treatment. The ability to safely immobilize and dispose of tank waste is critical for mitigating environmental risks associated with former plutonium production activities.Given the DOE's role in national security and cleanup work, this contract also has broader implications for the energy sector's alignment with federal environmental and security objectives. The successful execution of the ITDC could serve as a benchmark for future environmental management projects and establish BWXT and its partners as leading contributors to the sector's efforts in environmental stewardship and sustainable operations. 03/04/2024 - 04:45 PM LYNCHBURG, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) today announced a contract with an estimated value of up to $45 billion over a 10-year ordering period from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for environmental management operations at the Hanford Site in Washington.

The Offering is made under an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3.","Intapp Announces Launch of Secondary Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Intapp, Inc. (INTA) announces a public offering of 7,000,000 shares of common stock by a Selling Stockholder, with J.P. Morgan as the underwriter. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offering, and the underwriter has an option to purchase additional shares. The Offering is made under an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst An offering of 7,000,000 shares by a significant stockholder can indicate a few potential market movements. Firstly, the market liquidity for Intapp, Inc. shares is likely to increase, potentially leading to more volatility in the stock price in the short term. Investors might interpret this sale as a signal regarding the insider's confidence in the company's future performance. It's crucial to note that the company itself is not diluting its shares or receiving any proceeds, which means the fundamental value of the company remains unchanged by this transaction.However, the perception of the company's valuation may be impacted, as large offerings can sometimes pressure the stock price downward. The underwriter's option to purchase additional shares could further augment this effect. The role of J.P. Morgan as the underwriter and sole book-running manager is also significant, as their involvement suggests a degree of confidence in managing such a large transaction and possibly stabilizing the stock post-offering. Financial Analyst The financial implications of this offering are multifaceted. On one hand, the sale by Great Hill Equity Partners IV, L.P. does not directly affect Intapp, Inc.'s capital structure since no new capital is raised for the company. On the other hand, the market's reaction to the sale could indirectly affect the company's cost of capital in the future, especially if the stock price is affected substantially. Investors should closely monitor the stock's performance following the offering, as it may affect investor sentiment and could be indicative of the market's view on the company's valuation.Additionally, the use of a shelf registration statement indicates that the company had previously planned for the possibility of such transactions, which can be a sign of strategic financial planning. The terms of the offering, particularly the underwriting discounts and commissions, will also be critical in understanding the net proceeds to the selling stockholder and the potential impact on the stock's market price. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the transaction's adherence to SEC regulations, specifically the use of an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, is crucial. This form is typically utilized by well-established companies that meet certain regulatory criteria, allowing them to register securities for sale in a more streamlined and expedited process. The involvement of a free writing prospectus and a prospectus supplement suggests compliance with disclosure obligations, which is intended to protect investors by providing them with the necessary information to make informed decisions.The legal framework governing such transactions is designed to ensure fair and transparent markets and any deviation from the SEC's requirements could have significant legal implications for all parties involved. Investors should consider the legal robustness of the offering process as part of their overall assessment of the transaction. 03/04/2024 - 04:44 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intapp, Inc.

The notes have interest rates of 5.200% and 5.450% per annum, respectively.","American Tower Corporation Prices Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary American Tower Corporation (AMT) announces the pricing of $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes due 2029 and 2034. The company plans to use the net proceeds to repay existing debt under its credit facility. The notes have interest rates of 5.200% and 5.450% per annum, respectively. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, the offering of senior unsecured notes by American Tower Corporation is a significant move to manage its debt profile. The interest rates of 5.200% for the 2029 notes and 5.450% for the 2034 notes are competitive given the current interest rate environment. The issuance at a price slightly below face value indicates a normal market practice to entice investors. The expected net proceeds of approximately $1.281.3 million will provide liquidity to repay existing indebtedness, which could improve the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics.However, investors should closely monitor the company's credit ratings and the general conditions in the corporate bond market, as these factors could affect the cost of future borrowing and the company's overall financial health. Additionally, the use of proceeds to pay down a revolving credit facility suggests a strategic move to lock in longer-term financing at fixed rates, which could be beneficial if interest rates rise further. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, American Tower Corporation's public offering reflects a proactive approach to capital management amidst fluctuating market conditions. The telecommunications sector, where American Tower operates, is capital-intensive with a high demand for infrastructure investment. The issuance of these notes could signal confidence to the market about the company's long-term growth prospects and its ability to generate stable cash flows. For stakeholders, this could be seen as a positive sign of the company's commitment to maintaining a solid balance sheet. It's also worth noting the role of the joint book-running managers, which include major financial institutions. Their involvement brings credibility to the offering and could potentially attract a wide array of institutional investors. The impact on the stock market will depend on investor perception of the company's debt management strategy and its implications for future profitability. Debt Capital Markets Expert When assessing the impact of American Tower Corporation's debt issuance from a capital markets perspective, one must consider the current corporate bond market trends. The chosen maturities, 2029 and 2034, offer investors medium to long-term investment horizons, which could be appealing in a low-yield environment. The pricing strategy reflects a yield that is attractive enough to compensate for the unsecured nature of the notes, without significantly exceeding the prevailing rates for similar credit profiles.It's also critical to evaluate the signaling effect this issuance may have. By opting to repay its revolving credit facility, American Tower is potentially signaling to the market its preference for fixed-rate debt in anticipation of a rising interest rate scenario. This strategic move could be interpreted as a prudent step to lock in borrowing costs, which can stabilize cash outflows related to interest payments in the long run. 03/04/2024 - 05:24 PM BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today announced the pricing of its registered public offering of senior unsecured notes due 2029 and 2034 in aggregate principal amounts of $650.0 million and $650.0 million, respectively.

Positive Positive: Record-setting consolidated revenue of $1.27 billion in 2023. Positive: Enhanced margin performance and growth strategy success. Positive: Significant progress in International segment and U.S. Loss Adjusting. Negative: Revenue decrease of 8% in Q4 2023 compared to 2022. Negative: Net income decrease on a non-GAAP basis in 2023 Q4. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results from Crawford & Company highlight a mixed performance, with a year-over-year decrease in fourth-quarter revenues but an overall annual revenue increase. The revenue decline in Q4 2023, attributed partially to reduced weather-related revenue, contrasts with the full-year revenue growth. This growth is indicative of successful strategic initiatives and strong client relationships, particularly in U.S. Loss Adjusting, Broadspire and Praxis. However, the Q4 results may raise concerns about the company's quarterly volatility and its dependency on external factors such as weather conditions.From a stock market perspective, the improved full-year net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are positive signals for investors, reflecting a turnaround from the previous year's loss. The increased consolidated adjusted EBITDA and operating earnings suggest enhanced operational efficiency and margin performance. Investors should consider the company's ability to sustain this margin expansion in the face of potential headwinds like benign weather patterns that may affect future earnings. Market Research Analyst Examining Crawford & Company's performance in the context of the claims management and outsourcing industry, the company's international expansion and double-digit revenue growth in certain segments are noteworthy. These achievements reflect a strategic focus on diversification and may provide a competitive edge in a global market. However, the decrease in Q4 revenue and adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of revenues indicates potential challenges in maintaining market share and profitability, especially during off-peak periods for weather-related claims.The company's constant dollar basis analysis, which shows an 8% increase in revenues over 2022, helps stakeholders understand performance without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. This is especially relevant for a global company like Crawford, where currency risk can significantly impact reported results. Stakeholders should monitor how the company manages these risks, especially in light of ongoing global economic uncertainties. Economist The financial results of Crawford & Company provide insights into broader economic trends, such as the impact of foreign exchange rates and global weather patterns on corporate performance. The company's ability to grow revenues in a year marked by benign weather suggests resilience in its core business operations, despite external economic factors. However, the reduced weather-related revenue in Q4 2023 serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of some revenue streams and the importance of economic diversification.Furthermore, the company's performance, particularly the non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and operating earnings, offer a more nuanced understanding of its operational health, excluding one-time adjustments and non-operational expenses. These figures, favorable in comparison to the previous year, may reflect well on the company's financial management practices in an environment where many businesses are facing tightening margins due to inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty. 03/04/2024 - 04:42 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crawford & Company® (NYSE: CRD-A and CRD-B) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.

Our 2023 results reflect the success of our growth strategy and the strength of our client relationships as demonstrated by full year revenue and profit records in U.S. Loss Adjusting, Broadspire and Praxis as well as significant progress in our International segment. As indicated in our third quarter earnings materials, our fourth quarter performance was impacted by benign weather activity, which resulted in reduced weather-related revenue as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, where several severe weather events drove significant revenue performance for the Company. That said, both Broadspire and our International business saw double digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting the underlying strength of our businesses.” Mr. Verma continued, “2023 marked a momentous year of growth and margin expansion with operating earnings increasing 38% from 2022. As we move through 2024, I am optimistic about the prospects that lie ahead for our business, presenting ample opportunities to further enhance our brand presence and expand our market share.” Segment Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year North America Loss Adjusting North America Loss Adjusting revenues before reimbursements were $69.7 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, decreasing (10.3)% from $77.7 million in the 2022 fourth quarter.

Unallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits, Net Unallocated corporate costs were $9.4 million in the 2023 fourth quarter, compared with credits of $0.3 million in the 2022 period. The increase in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in self-insurance costs, $2.7 million increase in compensation, $1.2 million increase in professional fees, and $1.5 million increase in support costs. Unallocated corporate costs were $19.4 million in 2023, compared with $7.1 million in 2022. The increase for 2023 was due to a $3.7 million increase in self-insurance costs, $1.8 million gain on sale of our Canadian head office building in 2022, $1.5 million increase in professional fees, $1.4 million increase in compensation, $1.2 million for certain non-recurring fair value adjustments, $1.6 million increase in unallocated payroll tax, benefits and insurance costs, and $1.1 million increase in other unallocated costs. 2022 Goodwill Impairment The Company recognized a $36.8 million pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2022. This charge was partially offset by a $15.9 million reduction in income tax expense during the third quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the income tax benefit of the impairment normalized due to the non-discrete income tax treatment, which resulted in a reduction of the income tax benefit of $12.4 million, or $0.25 per share for the 2022 fourth quarter. For the year, the after tax impact of the goodwill impairment was $33.3 million, or $0.67 per share for 2022. There was no goodwill impairment in 2023. Presentation Revision of 2023 Quarters “Revenues before reimbursements” for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes income earned which offsets the costs of managing the funds maintained to administer claims for certain of the Company's customers. These amounts were previously presented as reductions to “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the first, second, and third quarter 2023 interim financial statements. The Company adjusted its interim financial information for an immaterial revision in presentation of amounts totaling approximately $3,343,000, $3,890,000, and $4,528,000 which increased “Revenues before reimbursements” and “Total Revenues” for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023, respectively, and resulted in a corresponding increase in “Selling, general, and administrative” expenses and “Total Costs and Expenses” by the same amounts. There were no revisions to amounts reported for 2022 or 2021. The revisions are reflected in ""Revenues before reimbursements"" for the Company's North America Loss Adjusting and Broadspire segments. In North America Loss Adjusting, the revised presentation was approximately $472,000, $533,000, and $597,000 for the first, second, and third quarter of 2023, respectively. In Broadspire, the revised presentation was $2,871,000, $3,357,000, and $3,930,000 for the first, second, and third quarter of 2023, respectively. Other Matters The Company recognized pretax contingent earnout adjustments totaling an expense of $0.9 million and a benefit of $(0.3) million in the 2023 fourth quarter and comparable 2022 period, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment of earnout liabilities arising from recent acquisitions. Contingent earnout expense was $4.0 million in 2023, compared with $2.9 million in 2022. This adjustment, which is not a component of operating earnings, is based on favorable changes to projections of acquired entities over the respective earnout periods, which span multiple years. The Company recognized non-service pension costs of $2.2 million in the 2023 fourth quarter compared with $0.1 million in the 2022 period. Non-service pension costs totaled $8.6 million in 2023 compared to a credit of $(1.6) million in 2022. Non-service pension costs represent the U.S. and U.K. non-service defined benefit pension costs, which are non-operating in nature as the U.S. plan is frozen and the U.K. plans are closed to new participants. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the Company recognized an $11.8 million income tax reserve, or $0.24 per share, primarily related to previously benefited tax losses in certain international jurisdictions. These tax assets currently do not expire and are available for future use depending on the profitability of those jurisdictions. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow The Company’s consolidated cash and cash equivalents position as of December 31, 2023, totaled $58.4 million, compared with $46.0 million at December 31, 2022. The Company’s total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, totaled $209.1 million, compared with $238.9 million at December 31, 2022. The Company’s operations provided $103.8 million of cash during 2023, compared with $27.6 million provided in 2022. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $58.4 million improvement in the change in billed and unbilled accounts receivables, $19.8 million related to incentive compensation, and higher earnings, partially offset by the timing of other payments. The Company made no contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $2.4 million in contributions to its U.K. plans for 2023, compared with no contributions to the U.S. plan and $0.6 million to the U.K. plans in 2022. During 2023, the Company didn't repurchase any shares of CRD-A, but repurchased 293,952 shares of CRD-B at an average per share cost of $9.30. The total cost of share repurchases during 2023 was $2.7 million.

Non-GAAP Presentation In the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the foregoing discussion and analysis of segment results of operations, we do not include a gross up of segment expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to evaluate the financial performance of our Company and operating segments, and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions. Unlike net income, segment operating earnings is not a standard performance measure found in GAAP. We believe this measure is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment and consolidated operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Consolidated operating earnings represent segment earnings including certain unallocated corporate and shared costs, but before net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, goodwill impairment, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, contingent earnout adjustments, reserves on certain income tax assets, non-service pension costs and credits, income taxes and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA is not a term defined by GAAP and as a result our measure of adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. However, adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operational results. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to shareholders of the Company with adjustments for depreciation and amortization, net corporate interest expense, goodwill impairment, contingent earnout adjustments, reserves on certain income tax assets, non-service pension costs and credits, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense. Unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, certain unallocated professional fees and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments. Income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, contingent earnout adjustments, and non-service pension costs and credits are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Contingent earnout adjustments relate to changes in the fair value of earnouts associated with our recent acquisitions. Non-service pension costs and credits represent the U.S. and U.K. non-service defined benefit pension costs, which are non-operating in nature as the U.S. plan was frozen in 2002 and the U.K. plans are closed to new participants. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis. Goodwill impairments and reserves on certain income tax assets arise from time to time due to various factors, but are not allocated to our operating segments since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis. A significant portion of our operations are international. These international operations subject us to foreign exchange fluctuations.

(2) The income tax impact of goodwill impairment was based on the estimated annual effective income tax rate. Due to the non-discrete income tax treatment of the third quarter 2022 goodwill impairment, the income tax benefit normalized as income was earned during the remainder of the year, resulting in a lower full year income tax benefit during 2022.

As the Company has Non-GAAP positive net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, these dilutive securities were added back to calculate Non-GAAP earnings per share. Further information regarding the Company’s operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, financial position as of December 31, 2023, and cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is shown on the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Brookfield Corporation regarding the fixed dividend rate for its Series 34 Shares represents a critical piece of information for investors and analysts, particularly those focused on income-generating securities. The set dividend rate of 6.145% is a significant figure, as it directly impacts the yield that investors can expect from their investments in these preference shares. This rate must be evaluated against the backdrop of the current interest rate environment and the yields offered by comparable securities in the market.Investors will assess the attractiveness of the fixed rate in light of alternative investment opportunities, including government bonds and other corporate dividend-paying instruments. The conversion option into Series 35 Shares adds a layer of complexity, as it introduces a variable dividend rate tied to the performance of government treasury bills, which can be appealing if investors anticipate an increase in interest rates.Furthermore, the condition set by Brookfield that automatic conversion will occur if the outstanding shares fall below a certain threshold is a mechanism that can influence investor decisions, as it may affect the liquidity and marketability of the shares. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the conditional approval of the Series 35 Shares by the TSX is noteworthy. The listing requirements of the TSX are designed to ensure that only securities of a certain standard are traded on the exchange, which can serve as a quality assurance for potential investors. The conversion feature of the Series 34 Shares into Series 35 Shares, with a floating dividend rate, offers investors flexibility and potential for increased income, should the interest rates rise, making the Series 35 Shares potentially more attractive in a rising rate environment.The ability to convert can also serve as a hedge against interest rate risk for the Series 34 Shareholders. It's important to monitor the uptake of the conversion offer, as a significant shift from fixed to floating rate preferences could signal market expectations regarding future interest rates. Economist An economist would scrutinize the dividend rates in the context of broader economic indicators. The fixed dividend rate of 6.145% and the floating rate of Series 35 Shares at 2.63% over the yield on three-month Government of Canada treasury bills must be contextualized within the current economic cycle, inflation rates and monetary policy outlook. The fixed rate provides a benchmark for investors to gauge the relative risk and return profile of these preference shares against the backdrop of potential economic scenarios, such as inflationary pressures or economic downturns.The decision by investors to convert to Series 35 Shares with a floating rate will be influenced by their expectations of economic conditions, particularly the trajectory of interest rates. If the market anticipates higher interest rates, the floating rate shares could become more appealing. Conversely, in a stable or declining rate environment, the security of a fixed return might be more desirable. 03/04/2024 - 04:36 PM BROOKFIELD, NEWS, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Corporation (“Brookfield”) (NYSE: BN, TSX: BN) today announced that it has determined the fixed dividend rate on its Cumulative Class A Preference Shares, Series 34 (“Series 34 Shares”) (TSX: BN.PF.B) for the five years commencing April 1, 2024 and ending March 31, 2029.

Positive Strong financial performance with revenue growth of 21% for Q4 and full year 2023 Achieved ARR of $337.1 million and net income of $1.0 million for the full year Focused on increasing new user growth, driving expansion, and adding new products Plans to launch new Enterprise Platform in 2024 Expects revenue growth of approximately 19% year-over-year for 2024 Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Semrush Holdings, Inc. indicate a robust year-over-year revenue growth of 21%, highlighting a significant upswing in the company's financial performance. The transition from a net loss in the previous year to a net income in both the fourth quarter and full year is a particularly strong sign of improved financial health. Additionally, the achievement of an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of 23% suggests a stable and expanding customer base, which is critical for the sustainability and predictability of future revenues.The increase in paying customers by 12.5% and the growth in free, active customers to over one million are positive indicators of market penetration and product acceptance. However, the slight decrease in dollar-based net revenue retention from 109% to 107% could signal a need to focus on customer satisfaction and retention strategies. The forward-looking guidance provided for the first quarter and full year 2024, with expected revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margin improvements, reflects management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory.It is also noteworthy that the company is shifting its guidance focus from non-GAAP net income to non-GAAP Operating Margin and Free Cash Flow Margin, which may offer investors a clearer picture of operational efficiency and cash generation potential. This strategic move aligns with the company's emphasis on profitability and efficiency. Market Research Analyst Semrush's continued investment in Generative AI and the expansion of its platform offerings, including the introduction of new tools like AI Chat and the AI Ad Copy Generator app, demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and staying ahead of market trends. The upcoming General Availability of the new Enterprise Platform in the first half of 2024 is a strategic move to cater to large-scale business customers, potentially opening up new revenue streams and strengthening the company's position in the competitive SaaS landscape.The reported growth of customers paying more than $10,000 annually by over 30% indicates successful penetration into the higher-end market segment, which could lead to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) and contribute to the overall financial growth of the company. This segment typically offers higher margins and longer contract durations, which can be beneficial for long-term financial stability.Furthermore, the addition of Bing to the Position Tracking tool reflects the company's responsiveness to customer needs and may enhance the value proposition for existing and prospective clients. This diversification of offerings can help mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single search engine and potentially attract a broader customer base. Legal Expert The updates to the definitions of non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations, which now exclude certain costs such as Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquisition Related Costs, represent a refinement in financial reporting that aims to provide a more transparent view of the company's operating performance. This change underscores the importance of clear financial communication to stakeholders and aligns with regulatory trends emphasizing non-GAAP reporting clarity.While the company has not provided specific reconciliations of non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, citing variability and complexity, this practice is not uncommon. It is important for investors to understand the limitations of non-GAAP measures and to use them in conjunction with GAAP results to form a complete picture of financial performance.The decision to focus on non-GAAP Operating Margin and Free Cash Flow Margin for future guidance, rather than non-GAAP net income, may assist investors in assessing the company's operational efficiency and cash management, which are key factors in evaluating a company's financial health and growth potential. 03/04/2024 - 04:30 PM Fourth quarter revenue of $83.4 million, up 21% year-over-year Full year 2023 revenue increases over 21% year-over-year Achieves ARR of $337.1 million, up 23% year-over-year Full year net income of $1.0 million and Non-GAAP net income of $16.3 million BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Semrush Holdings, Inc.

I want to express my sincere gratitude to our growing number of customers, talented employees, and shareholders who showed incredible support and loyalty across our business,” said Oleg Shchegolev, CEO and Co-Founder of Semrush.

Nearly 108,000 paying customers as of December 31, 2023, up 12.5% from a year ago. Dollar-based net revenue retention of 107% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 109% in the previous quarter. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures & Definitions of Key Metrics” below for how Semrush defines ARR, dollar-based net revenue retention, non-GAAP net income (loss), and free cash flow, and the financial tables that accompany this release for reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its closest comparable GAAP financial measure. Fourth Quarter 2023 Business Highlights We are committed to empowering our customers with the best-in-class platform needed to boost their online presence and gain an edge in the market. In the fourth quarter, we advanced and expanded many of our offerings: Continued investments in Generative AI to provide enhanced, more efficient content creation capabilities through Semrush’s platform and App Center: Introduced AI Chat, a generative chat system within ContentShake AI that allows customers to enter detailed prompts, request additional content, and ask questions to improve the content creation process and help businesses connect with a larger audience. Released the AI Ad Copy Generator app, a data-driven tool that uses billions of ad copies to draft effective copy variations, helping customers launch high-performing Google Ads campaigns. Announced the AI Accessibility Widget, an app that uses AI to diagnose accessibility issues in real time, enabling businesses to enhance user-friendliness and ensure website compliance. Added Bing to the Position Tracking tool, allowing customers to set up their tracking campaign and track daily rankings for their target keyword lists. We are pleased to announce our new Enterprise Platform will be Generally Available (GA) in the first half of 2024. It has been in a soft launch state since late October 2023 and is currently being used by a select number of large-scale business customers. Semrush customers who pay more than $10,000 annually grew by more than 30% year-over-year. Ended the quarter with more than 1,041,000 registered free active customers, up nearly 30% year-over-year. Business Outlook “During 2023, we were able to re-accelerate revenue growth, improve our profitability and generate strong free cash flow,” said Brian Mulroy, CFO of Semrush. “Looking ahead to 2024, we are confident in our ability to grow and to continue to scale our business to capitalize on the market opportunity. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to spending to improve efficiency and profitability, even while we invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will continue to create long-term, durable growth and value for our shareholders.” Based on information as of today, March 4, 2024, we are issuing the following financial guidance: First Quarter 2024 Financial Outlook For the first quarter, we expect revenue in a range of $84.7 to $85.3 million, which at the mid-point would represent growth of approximately 20% year-over-year. We expect first quarter Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 8%. Full-Year 2024 Financial Outlook For the full year, we expect revenue in a range of $364 to $368 million, which at the mid-point would represent growth of approximately 19% year-over-year. We expect full year Non-GAAP operating margin of 10% to 11%. We expect full year free cash flow margin to be in the range of 7% to 8%. Starting with our guidance for the first quarter 2024 and full year 2024, we are no longer providing guidance for non-GAAP net income, and instead will guide both non-GAAP Operating Margin and Free Cash Flow Margin. We are also updating our definitions of non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations to exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets, Acquisition Related Costs, Restructuring Costs and other one-time expenses outside the ordinary course of business (for example, our Exit Costs incurred primarily in 2022) in addition to the current exclusion of Stock Based Compensation. Our guidance for the first quarter 2024 and full year 2024 reflect this change. Additionally, with this release, we are also providing a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and non-GAAP operating margin under both the prior definition and the new definition for the prior periods presented. We believe these changes will allow investors to better understand our financial performance, better align with the measures used internally by management in operating our business, and permit a better evaluation of the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure our performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, in particular the measures and effects of share-based compensation expense, employer taxes and tax deductions specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by future hiring, turnover and retention needs. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Forward-looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, guidance on financial results for the first quarter and full year of 2024 (including revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow margin); statements regarding the expectations of demand for our products, including demand from return customers, adoption of and demand for new products and features, statements about expansion of our platform, the effectiveness of our products and our competitive advantages, statements about future operating results, growth opportunities (including new user growth, expansion from delivering higher value to customers and adding new products and monetization to address user needs and market trends), future spending, business trends, capability to improve efficiency and deliver profits, and growth and value for shareholders. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), including our most recent annual report on form 10-K, and our subsequently filed quarterly reports and other SEC filings. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. The forward-looking statements in this release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Additional information regarding these and other factors that could affect our results is included in our SEC filings, which may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations page on its website at investors.semrush.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Non-GAAP Financial Measures & Definitions of Key Metrics We believe that providing non-GAAP information to investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows investors to view the financial results in the way management views the operating results. We further believe that providing this information allows investors to not only better understand our financial performance, but also to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. We also believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. We also believe free cash flow margin is useful to investors as we monitor it as a measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allows us to better understand the cash needs of our business. The non-GAAP information included in this press release should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. ARR is defined as of a given date as the monthly recurring revenue that we expect to contractually receive from all paid subscription agreements that are actively generating revenue as of that date multiplied by 12. We include both monthly recurring paid subscriptions, which renew automatically unless canceled, as well as the annual recurring paid subscriptions so long as we do not have any indication that a customer has canceled or intends to cancel its subscription and we continue to generate revenue from them. Dollar-based net revenue retention is defined as (a) the revenue from our customers during the twelve-month period ending one year prior to such period as the denominator and (b) the revenue from those same customers during the twelve months ending as of the end of such period as the numerator. This calculation excludes revenue from new customers and any non-recurring revenue. Free cash flow and free cash flow margin. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, and Non-GAAP Net Income. As described above, we have updated our definitions for non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and are introducing non-GAAP operating margin; the updated definitions, which apply to our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024, are as follows. We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations, excluding Stock Based Compensation, Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets, Acquisition Related Costs, Restructuring Costs and other one-time expenses outside the ordinary course of business (for example, our Exit Costs incurred primarily in 2022). We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP income (loss) from operations divided by GAAP revenue. With respect to our prior financial results (including the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and comparable periods in 2022), we define (i) non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income (loss), excluding Stock Based Compensation and (ii) non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations, excluding Stock Based Compensation. We believe investors may want to consider our results with and without the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance with that of other companies that exclude such items and to compare our results to prior periods. Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operational performance and provide for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period and company to company due to such things as differing valuation methodologies, timing of awards and changes in stock price. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP expense and income measures allows management and investors to evaluate results “as-if” the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which our acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to our internally developed intellectual property. These amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Restructuring and other costs. Restructuring and other costs include restructuring expenses as well as other charges that are unusual in nature, are the result of unplanned events, and arise outside the ordinary course of our business. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, charges for the closure of excess facilities and other contract termination costs. Other costs include litigation contingency reserves, asset impairment charges, relocation expenses associated with the migration of employees in 2022 that occurred throughout 2022 and early 2023, and gains or losses on the sale or disposition of certain non-strategic assets or product lines. Acquisition-related costs, net. In recent years, we have completed a number of acquisitions, which result in transition, integration and other acquisition-related expense which would not otherwise have been incurred, are unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are deal-specific or outside of our control, are not indicative of our operational performance (or that of the acquired businesses or assets) and are likely to fluctuate as our acquisition activity increases or decreases in future periods.

Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 04:35 PM BOSTON, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of The China Fund, Inc. (NYSE: CHN) (the ""Fund""), is pleased to announce that the Fund's investment adviser, Matthews International Capital Management, LLC (the ""Adviser""), has agreed to waive a portion of the management fee paid to it by the Fund, which will reduce the Fund's total expense ratio and the indirect cost to shareholders of investing in the Fund. In light of current economic and market conditions affecting the performance of Chinese securities generally, the Board and the Adviser believe it is appropriate and in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders to consider all available measures to reduce the expenses of the Fund. After reviewing the Fund's operating expenses and investment performance, the Board requested that the Adviser consider reducing its management fee. The Adviser has since agreed to voluntarily waive for a year from February 1, 2024, a portion of the management fee it receives from the Fund by reducing the management fee rate applied when the Fund's monthly average assets are less than $150 million from 0.80% to 0.75%. Thereafter, the fee waiver will terminate without further notice, unless the Adviser, in its sole discretion, agrees to continue the waiver. The Fund is a closed-end investment company, the shares of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""CHN."" The Fund's investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities (i) of companies for which the principal securities trading market is the People's Republic of China (""China""), or (ii) of companies for which the principal securities trading market is outside of China, or constituting direct equity investments in companies organized outside of China, that in both cases derive at least 50% of their revenue from goods and services sold or produced, or have at least 50% of their assets, in China. While the Fund is permitted to invest in direct equity investments of companies organized in China, it presently holds no such investments. The Fund's investment manager is Matthews International Capital Management, LLC. Investment in shares of the Fund involve investment risk, including possible loss of principal, and there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is also subject risks associated with international investing, such as currency fluctuation, government regulations, economic changes, and differences in liquidity. Foreign securities markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the U.S. market. Additionally, this Fund focuses its investments in Chinese securities, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that region. All of these factors may subject the shares of the Fund to greater price volatility and adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, similar to other exchange-traded funds, the Fund's shares generally are purchased at their market price and not at the Fund's net asset value (""NAV"") per share. The market price of the Fund's shares may be more (i.e., premium) or less (i.e., discount) than their NAV per share. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their NAV per share. Both the market price of the Fund's shares and the Fund's NAV per share tend to fluctuate with the value of its underlying securities.

(AKRO) initiates a $300.0 million public offering of common stock, with a 30-day option for an additional $45.0 million. J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, and Evercore ISI are the joint book-running managers. The offering is subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Akero Therapeutics' decision to commence an underwritten public offering of $300 million worth of its common stock is a strategic move to raise capital. From a financial perspective, this influx of cash could be indicative of the company's plans to accelerate its drug development programs, expand its operations, or pay off existing debts. The offering size represents a significant capital raise for a clinical-stage company, which typically requires substantial investment to progress through various stages of drug development.The additional 30-day option granted to underwriters to purchase up to $45 million more in shares could provide a buffer to raise additional funds if the demand is higher than anticipated, reflecting a positive market sentiment towards the company. It's important to note that the success of such offerings often depends on the current market conditions, investor appetite for biotech stocks and the company's own growth prospects.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of the new shares on their investments and the potential for share price volatility post-offering. The involvement of reputable financial institutions like J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley as joint book-running managers could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's value proposition and future prospects. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is known for its high volatility and the significant capital required for research and development. Akero Therapeutics' move to raise capital through a public offering is not uncommon in the industry, especially for a company in the clinical stage. The funds raised are likely earmarked for advancing their pipeline products, which could potentially address unmet medical needs in the metabolic disease space.Market response to such offerings can be influenced by the company's current pipeline status, historical performance and the perceived potential of its drug candidates. The market will also be observing the uptake of the offering and may adjust the stock's valuation based on the final terms and the success of the capital raise. A successful offering could signal market confidence, while a less successful one might raise concerns about the company's valuation or the market's appetite for risk in the biotech sector. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an automatically effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approach allows for a more efficient capital-raising process, as the company can offer and sell securities to the public without a lengthy SEC review process each time. However, it is subject to market and other conditions, which means that there's uncertainty about the timing and size of the offering.It's crucial for investors to understand that the preliminary prospectus supplement will provide important details about the offering, including the use of proceeds and risk factors. The legal language stating that the press release does not constitute an offer to sell securities is standard to comply with SEC regulations and to avoid potential legal issues related to premature offers to sell or buy securities before all necessary regulatory documents have been filed and become available to the public. 03/04/2024 - 04:21 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

PennantPark Investment Corporation Announces Monthly Distribution of $0.07 per Share,2024-03-04T21:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"PennantPark Investment Corporation (PNNT) announces a monthly distribution of $0.07 per share for March 2024, payable on April 1, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024, sourced from taxable net investment income.","PennantPark Investment Corporation Announces Monthly Distribution of $0.07 per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary PennantPark Investment Corporation (PNNT) announces a monthly distribution of $0.07 per share for March 2024, payable on April 1, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024, sourced from taxable net investment income. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a monthly distribution by PennantPark Investment Corporation represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. The specified amount of $0.07 per share is a key figure for both current and prospective investors as it directly impacts the yield of the investment. When assessing the company's performance, one should compare this distribution rate with the sector's average yield and historical payments of the company to determine if it aligns with investor expectations and market trends.Further analysis of the company's ability to sustain these payments is crucial. This involves evaluating taxable net investment income, which is the income available for distribution after accounting for the company's tax obligations. A consistent or increasing net investment income trend could be indicative of a solid financial position and operational efficiency, while any fluctuations might warrant a deeper investigation into the company's revenue streams and cost management strategies. Tax Expert The tax implications of the distribution are significant for shareholders. The fact that the distribution is expected to be paid from taxable net investment income suggests that it may be treated as ordinary income, as opposed to qualified dividend income which is often taxed at a lower rate. Shareholders will need to consider this when estimating their individual tax liabilities.Moreover, the mention of Form 1099 reporting indicates that shareholders will be provided with the necessary documentation to accurately report income received. It is important to note that the tax characteristics reported at the year-end may influence investment decisions, as investors seek to manage their tax exposure effectively. The company's ability to provide clear tax documentation in its periodic SEC filings is also a reflection of its transparency and governance standards. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, regular distributions can signal stability and can be attractive to income-focused investors, potentially influencing the stock's demand. The announcement's timing and consistency with previous distributions are also important. If PennantPark Investment Corporation has a history of reliable distributions, this can enhance investor confidence and possibly support the stock price.However, it's pertinent to analyze broader market conditions and sector performance to gauge the relative attractiveness of this distribution. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, a steady dividend yield might be more appealing than in a high-interest-rate environment where alternative investments could offer higher returns. Additionally, the stock's performance after previous distribution announcements could provide insights into investor sentiment and expectations. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM MIAMI, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PennantPark Investment Corporation (the ""Company"") (NYSE: PNNT) declares its monthly distribution for March 2024 of $0.07 per share, payable on April 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024.

(PFLT) declares a monthly distribution for March 2024 of $0.1025 per share, payable on April 1, 2024. The distribution is expected to be paid from taxable net investment income, with specific tax characteristics to be reported to stockholders. The company, operating as a regulated investment company, generates qualified interest income and short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax for non-U.S. stockholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a monthly distribution by PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. The distribution amount of $0.1025 per share is a critical figure for investors, as it directly affects the yield on their investment. This yield, when annualized and compared to the stock's price, allows for the calculation of the distribution yield, a key metric for evaluating the performance of income-generating assets like PennantPark.Investors should note that the distribution is payable from taxable net investment income, which suggests that the company is generating sufficient income to cover its distributions. However, it is imperative to analyze the company's payout ratio and compare it to industry standards to assess the sustainability of these distributions. A payout ratio that is too high could signal potential cash flow issues in the future.The tax treatment of distributions is also significant, especially for non-U.S. stockholders. The ability to classify part of the distributions as interest-related dividends exempt from U.S. withholding tax enhances the attractiveness of PennantPark's stock for international investors. This tax efficiency could potentially increase the stock's demand in global markets. Tax Expert Understanding the tax implications of distributions from a regulated investment company (RIC) like PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. is essential for both U.S. and non-U.S. investors. The final tax characteristics being reported on Form 1099 are crucial for investors' personal tax planning and compliance. The distinction between ordinary income and qualified interest income can have significant tax consequences.For non-U.S. shareholders, the exemption of certain dividends from U.S. withholding tax under the U.S. tax law enhances the net received amount, potentially making the investment more lucrative compared to those without such tax benefits. Investors should ensure they have the proper documentation to take advantage of this benefit. Moreover, the transparency provided by the company by making these tax characteristics available on their website indicates a commitment to shareholder communication. Market Research Analyst The announcement of monthly distributions can influence investor perception and subsequently, the market performance of a company's stock. In the case of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., the consistency of distributions can be perceived as a sign of financial health and stability, which could bolster investor confidence. However, market analysts will monitor the coverage ratio, which indicates whether the company earns enough to cover its dividend payments, to provide a more comprehensive view of its financial stability.Additionally, the impact on the stock price around the ex-dividend date is often observed. Typically, a stock's price may drop by approximately the amount of the distribution on the ex-dividend date, reflecting the payout's adjustment in the stock's value. This behavior is a standard market reaction and does not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM MIAMI, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.

The company aims for adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024 through strategic growth drivers. ThredUp also highlights AI innovation, customer experience improvements, and industry recognition. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from ThredUp Inc. show a positive trajectory in revenue growth, with a year-over-year increase of 14% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. The gross margin, despite being slightly down due to a one-time inventory write-off in Europe, remains robust at over 60%, indicative of healthy profitability levels relative to revenue. The reduction in net loss as a percentage of revenue from the previous year suggests improving cost management and operational efficiency.However, the net loss figures are still significant, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving net profitability. The company's focus on strategic growth drivers and achieving adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024 signals an emphasis on sustainable financial performance. Investors should note the positive trend in active buyers and orders, which demonstrates customer base growth and may contribute to future revenue increases. Market Research Analyst ThredUp's performance must be contextualized within the online resale market, which is experiencing growth driven by consumer interest in sustainability and affordability. The reported increase in active buyers and orders reflects a strong market position and successful customer acquisition strategies. ThredUp's AI-powered search and generative AI initiatives indicate an investment in technology to enhance the customer experience, which could lead to increased customer retention and order values.The Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform recognition by Good Housekeeping signals industry acknowledgment and could enhance brand reputation. However, the competitive landscape of online resale is becoming increasingly crowded and the company's ability to maintain differentiation will be crucial for long-term success. Economist The financial outlook provided by ThredUp Inc. for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024 shows an expectation of continued revenue growth and an improved gross margin, suggesting confidence in their business model and market conditions. The projected adjusted EBITDA loss margin indicates a path towards profitability, a positive sign for investors.However, it is important to consider broader economic factors such as consumer spending trends, inflation and potential regulatory changes in the secondhand market, which could impact ThredUp's performance. The company's growth strategy in the U.S. and expansion in Europe must be agile to adapt to these macroeconomic conditions. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM Quarterly revenue of $81.4 million, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year.Fourth quarter gross margin of 61.9% and an increase in gross profit of 12% year-over-year, which included a $1.9 million inventory write-off in Europe, an impact of 230 basis points to gross margin.Record full year revenue of $322.0 million, representing 12% growth year-over-year.

See “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a detailed reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA loss to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of why we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful. Recent Business Highlights AI Innovation: ThredUp recently debuted an AI-powered search experience that makes it easy and intuitive to find secondhand items in its marketplace. They’ve also begun to leverage generative AI that will soon give customers the ability to create outfits they love and are strategically implementing AI across operations in its distribution center network to enhance inventory management and processing.Customer Experience Improvements: After implementing Delivery Promise and Thrift Promise, which aim to deliver purchase-to-doorstep shipping in three days or less and ensure the highest levels of customer satisfaction with every order, ThredUp’s Q4 return rate decreased by 700 basis points compared to the same quarter of 2022.Industry recognition: ThredUp's Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) was named a winner in Good Housekeeping’s 2024 Sustainable Innovation Awards, which recognizes products and services that have embraced a “people, purpose, and planet” approach to sustainability. Financial Outlook For the first quarter 2024, ThredUp expects: Revenue in the range of $79.0 million to $81.0 millionGross margin in the range of 68.5% to 70.5%, representing gross profit dollar growth of 9% year over year at the midpoint of revenue and gross margin guidance.Adjusted EBITDA loss margin in the range of 3.0% to 1.0% For the full fiscal year 2024, ThredUp expects: Revenue in the range of $340.0 million to $350.0 millionGross margin in the range of 69.5% to 71.5%, representing gross profit dollar growth of 14% year over year at the midpoint of revenue and gross margin guidance.Adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% ThredUp is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance of the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA loss to net loss because certain items are out of ThredUp’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Historically, these items have included, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and provision for income taxes. Accordingly, a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA loss in order to calculate forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA loss margin is not available without unreasonable effort. However, for the first quarter of 2024 and full year 2024, depreciation and amortization is expected to be $5.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively. In addition, for the first quarter of 2024 and full year 2024, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be $7.5 million and $33.0 million, respectively. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could result in the projected net loss being materially less than indicated by the currently estimated Adjusted EBITDA loss margin.

Negative Negative aspects include a decrease in net revenue, active clients, and net revenue per active client YoY. The company reported a net loss and negative free cash flow in Q2 fiscal 2024. The financial outlook for Q3 2024 shows a significant YoY decrease in net revenue and a negative adjusted EBITDA margin. Financial Analyst Stitch Fix's Q2 fiscal 2024 report indicates a significant year-over-year revenue decline of 18%, with a corresponding decrease in active clients. The gross margin improvement, however, suggests effective cost management, particularly in inventory health and transportation. Despite this, the company reported a net loss and negative free cash flow, which could be concerning for liquidity in the future, especially without bank debt as a buffer.The financial outlook for Q3 and the full fiscal year 2024 shows continued revenue decline, which could signal ongoing challenges in customer retention and market competition. Investors should note the projected negative Adjusted EBITDA in Q3, indicating potential operational challenges ahead. The addition of a 53rd week in the fiscal year may complicate year-over-year comparisons and should be taken into account when evaluating performance. Market Research Analyst The decrease in active clients and net revenue per active client (RPAC) suggests that Stitch Fix may be losing market share or facing increased competition. It's crucial to understand the customer acquisition and retention strategies the company is employing in the context of the broader retail and e-commerce landscape. The company's decision to cease UK operations and focus on continuing operations may reflect a strategic pivot to optimize resources and stabilize the core business.Furthermore, the emphasis on reimagining client experience could be an attempt to differentiate Stitch Fix from other players in the market. However, the effectiveness of these transformation efforts will be key in determining whether they can reverse the downward trend in active clients and revenue. Economist Examining the macroeconomic factors, such as consumer spending patterns and discretionary income levels, could provide additional context to Stitch Fix's performance. The apparel industry is sensitive to economic cycles and any downturn could exacerbate the company's challenges. The report does not mention external economic conditions, but these factors could have a significant influence on the company's outlook.Additionally, the report's mention of improved gross margin due to inventory health and transportation leverage might indicate that the company is successfully adapting to inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, which have been prevalent in recent economic conditions. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stitch Fix, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFIX), the trusted online personal styling service, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, ended January 27, 2024. “The original Stitch Fix vision, to create an easier and more enjoyable way for people to shop for clothing and accessories, remains both relevant and compelling,” said Matt Baer, Chief Executive Officer. “Our transformation efforts are grounded in fully realizing that vision and include both strengthening the foundation of our company and reimagining our client experience. I am encouraged by the progress we continue to make and am confident we have the right strategic priorities in place to set us up to drive sustainable, profitable growth.” During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the accounting requirements for reporting the UK business as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of the UK business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures below relate to our continuing operations. Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Key Metrics and Financial Highlights Net revenue from continuing operations of $330.4 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year.Active clients from continuing operations of 2,805,000, a decrease of 184,000, or 6%, quarter-over-quarter; and a decrease of 572,000, or 17%, year-over-year.Net revenue per active client (“RPAC”) from continuing operations of $515, a decrease of 3% year-over-year.Gross margin of 43.4%, an increase of 250 basis points year-over-year, which reflects improved inventory health and transportation leverage.Net loss from continuing operations of $35.0 million and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.29.Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $4.4 million, which reflects continued cost management discipline.Free cash flow from continuing operations was negative $26.1 million in the second fiscal quarter, as expected, due to the timing of receipts related to our inventory purchases in the first fiscal quarter.We ended the quarter with $229.8 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments attributable to continuing operations; and no bank debt. Financial Outlook Our financial outlook for our continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ending April 27, 2024 is as follows: Q3 2024Net Revenue from Continuing Operations$300 million - $310 million(22)% - (19)% YoYAdjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations$(5) million - $0 million(2)% - 0% margin Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to July 31. The fiscal year 2023 was a 52-week year and the fiscal year 2024 is a 53-week year, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter ending August 3, 2024. Our financial outlook for our continuing operations for fiscal year 2024, which includes the 53rd week, is as follows: Fiscal Year 2024Net Revenue from Continuing Operations$1.29 billion - $1.32 billion(19)% - (17)% YoY(20)% - (18)% YoY adjusted to a 52-week period (1)Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations$10 million - $20 million1% - 2% margin (1) Full fiscal year 2024 net revenue from continuing operations has been adjusted to remove the impact of the 53rd week for year-over-year comparative purposes. Stitch Fix has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations outlook to GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations because it does not provide an outlook for GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations due to the uncertainty and potential variability of restructuring and other one-time costs related to continuing operations, net other income (expense), provision for income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations. Because Stitch Fix cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure outlook to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. We caution, however, that such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

accounts payable and accrued liabilities $897 $1,430 Capitalized stock-based compensation $2,568 $3,409 Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that this supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between continuing operations of companies. We believe free cash flow from continuing operations (“Free Cash Flow”) is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash from continuing operations we have available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of our non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the closest comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations include: Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest income and net other (income) expense as these items are not components of our core business;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our provision for income taxes, which may increase or decrease cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;Adjusted EBITDA excludes the non-cash expense of stock-based compensation, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, an important part of how we attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business;Adjusted EBITDA excludes costs incurred related to discrete restructuring plans and other one-time costs attributable to our continuing operations that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time, however these costs do include cash outflows; andFree Cash Flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from continuing operations excluding interest income, net other (income) expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring and other one-time costs related to our continuing operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended(in thousands) January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023Net loss from continuing operations $(34,956) $(63,444) $(61,127) $(111,596)Add (deduct): Interest income (2,673) (632) (4,921) (1,380)Other (income) expense, net (578) 663 (989) 840 Provision for income taxes 169 131 338 318 Depreciation and amortization (1) 9,401 9,559 18,840 19,088 Stock-based compensation expense 21,065 25,262 40,967 56,391 Restructuring and other one-time costs (2) 12,019 34,742 19,969 40,897 Adjusted EBITDA $4,447 $6,281 $13,077 $4,558 (1) For the three and six months ended January 27, 2024, depreciation and amortization excluded $3.4 million and $7.6 million reflected in “Restructuring and other one-time costs.” For the three and six months ended January 28, 2023, depreciation and amortization excluded $1.8 million reflected in “Restructuring and other one-time costs.”(2) For the three and six months ended January 27, 2024, restructuring charges were $8.4 million and $16.3 million and other one-time costs were $3.6 million in one-time professional services fees. For the three and six months ended January 28, 2023, restructuring charges were $34.6 million and $35.5 million and other one-time costs were $0.1 million and $5.4 million in retention bonuses for continuing employees. Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash Flow as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, reduced by purchases of property and equipment that are included in cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Free Cash Flow for each of the periods presented: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended(in thousands) January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023Free Cash Flow reconciliation: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations $(22,295) $22,357 $(1,736) $20,783 Deduct: Purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations (3,774) (5,510) (7,427) (11,398)Free Cash Flow $(26,069) $16,847 $(9,163) $9,385 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations $(624) $5,700 $8,564 $3,699 Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations $(4,622) $(2,976) $(8,730) $(6,757) Operating Metrics (in thousands) January 27, 2024 October 28, 2023 July 29, 2023 April 29, 2023 January 28, 2023Active clients 2,805 2,989 3,121 3,288 3,377 Active Clients We define an active client as a client who checked out a Fix or was shipped an item via Freestyle in the preceding 52 weeks, measured as of the last day of that period. A client checks out a Fix when she indicates what items she is keeping through our mobile application or on our website. We consider each Women’s, Men’s, or Kids account as a client, even if they share the same household. Net Revenue per Active Client We calculate net revenue per active client based on net revenue over the preceding four fiscal quarters divided by the number of active clients, measured as of the last day of the period. Net revenue per active client was $515 and $530 as of January 27, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively. Supplemental Unaudited Financial Information During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased operations of our UK business and met the accounting requirements for reporting the UK business as a discontinued operation.

Announces Offering Of $300 Million Of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2030 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kosmos Energy Ltd. plans to offer $300 million in convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private placement, with an option for additional $45 million. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations and guaranteed by certain subsidiaries. The company intends to use proceeds to repay debt, pay for capped call transactions, and cover offering expenses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Kosmos Energy Ltd. to offer $300 million in convertible senior notes due 2030 reflects a strategic move to manage its capital structure. From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds to repay a portion of existing commercial debt could potentially improve the company's debt profile by extending maturities and reducing the cost of capital, assuming the new notes carry a lower interest rate than the existing debt.Furthermore, the inclusion of capped call transactions is a sophisticated financial strategy aimed at minimizing the dilution impact on existing shareholders upon conversion of the notes. Such transactions can be complex, involving the purchase of options that effectively cap the price at which the conversion will impact the share price. This can be beneficial for current shareholders as it provides a hedge against dilution up to a certain stock price level.However, the conversion features of the notes and the associated derivative transactions with the option counterparties could introduce volatility to the stock price. These activities may affect the market price of Kosmos Energy's common stock and the notes themselves, influencing not only the conversion decisions of noteholders but also the perception of the stock by the broader market. Market Research Analyst Convertible notes are often attractive to institutional investors as they offer the potential for upside participation in the equity of the issuer while also providing downside protection through the fixed income component. For Kosmos Energy, the market's reception of this offering will depend on investor appetite for energy sector exposure, particularly in the context of fluctuating oil prices and evolving energy market dynamics.It's important to note that the private placement nature of the offering limits participation to qualified institutional buyers, which may influence the liquidity and market for these notes. Additionally, the company's decision to use the proceeds to repay existing debt and pay for the cost of capped call transactions suggests prudent financial management, which could be viewed favorably by the market.However, the impact on the company's stock could be two-fold, depending on the execution of the capped call transactions and subsequent market transactions by the option counterparties. These could either stabilize or destabilize the stock's market price, impacting investor sentiment in the short term. Legal Expert The offering of convertible notes is subject to specific legal and regulatory considerations, especially since Kosmos Energy is conducting a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. This rule allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering, thus expediting the capital-raising process and reducing disclosure requirements.However, the securities issued under this exemption are 'restricted securities' and are subject to holding period requirements and other conditions before they can be resold in the public market. The legal intricacies of this transaction, including compliance with the Securities Act and state securities laws, ensure that only sophisticated investors with the ability to bear the investment risk are participating in the offering.Moreover, the lack of registration under the Securities Act implies that the notes and any common stock issuable upon conversion, will have limited transferability, which can affect their liquidity. This legal structure is critical in protecting both the company and the investors by ensuring that the offering is conducted in compliance with securities laws. 03/04/2024 - 04:08 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE/LSE: KOS) (“Kosmos” or the ""Company"") announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2030 (the ""notes"") in a private placement. The Company also expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The notes will rank pari passu with the Company’s existing senior notes and the Company’s revolving credit facility. The notes will be guaranteed (i) on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that guarantee on a senior basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes, and (ii) on a subordinated, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that borrow under or guarantee the Company’s commercial debt facility and guarantee on a subordinated basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes. Upon conversions of the notes, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted, and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to (i) repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s commercial debt facility; (ii) pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below; and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties, and expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the additional notes to pay the cost of such additional capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantees and any shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes in the offering, nor shall there be any sale of such notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Total Adjusted EBITDA for INNOVATE Corp. declined by 23.5% in Q4 2023. - Financial Analyst The reported revenue decline of 11.8% for the quarter and 13.1% for the year, coupled with an increase in net loss of 37.1% for the quarter, is a notable concern for stakeholders. This contraction in revenue and widening of losses may indicate operational challenges or a contraction in market demand. It is essential to scrutinize the company's cost structures, operational efficiencies and market positioning to understand the underlying causes. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease of 23.5% for the quarter is significant, as EBITDA is often used as an indicator of a company's financial performance and its ability to generate cash flow. Market Research Analyst INNOVATE Corp's diversified portfolio includes infrastructure, life sciences and broadcasting segments, which can typically offer stability against market volatility. However, the segment-specific performances show variability, with Infrastructure reporting strong results, while the overall company performance declines. The strategic focus on ATSC 3.0 in Spectrum Broadcasting could provide new revenue streams but is still in the 'early innings' and thus its future contribution to the bottom line remains uncertain. Understanding the competitive landscape and consumer trends within each segment is crucial for forecasting the company's potential for recovery and growth. Medical Research Analyst The Life Sciences segment's mention of strong North America unit sales and 'significant milestones' suggests progress, but without specific data, the impact on the financials is unclear. MediBeacon and R2's achievements could be pivotal if they translate into successful product commercialization and market penetration. The clinical and regulatory milestones, especially for companies in life sciences, can have substantial effects on investor confidence and the company's valuation, pending further details on these developments. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM - Infrastructure: DBM Global achieved fourth quarter revenue of $353.8 million -- Life Sciences: R2 experienced strong North America unit sales in the fourth quarter -- Spectrum: Broadcasting entered into agreements with PBS stations for new commercial opportunities with ATSC 3.0 - NEW YORK, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INNOVATE Corp.

The decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of advertising revenues at Azteca America network (""Azteca""), which ceased operations on December 31, 2022. This was partially offset by an increase in station revenues, which launched new markets and networks with its customers during 2023.For the fourth quarter of 2023, Broadcasting reported a Net Loss of $5.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 million, compared to $2.5 million in the prior year quarter.

The decrease was primarily driven by our Infrastructure segment, and, to a lesser extent, our Spectrum segment. The decline at our Infrastructure segment was driven by timing and size of projects, mostly from DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business, which was partially offset by increases at the industrial maintenance and repair business and at Banker Steel, while revenues at our Spectrum segment decreased primarily as a result of the termination of HC2 Network, Inc.

The increase in Net Loss was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher interest rates, increased amortization of debt issuance costs on the debt, and higher outstanding principal balances at all segments, as a result of new debt issued subsequent to the comparable period, an increase in net loss from our Life Sciences segment primarily as a result of higher equity method losses recognized from Pansend's investment in MediBeacon due to additional investments during 2023, which resulted in previously suspended losses being recognized as the investment's carrying amount was reduced to zero, an increase in net loss from our Spectrum segment related to a one-time benefit from the termination of Azteca in the comparable period, an increase in tax expense as a result of current state tax expense at certain tax paying entities due to increase in taxable income, an increase in net loss from our Other segment as a result of a write-off of prepaid rent, and an impairment of leasehold improvements as a result of unutilized space at our Non-Operating Corporate segment. The increase in Net Loss was partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A""), and decrease in depreciation and amortization. The overall decrease in SG&A was primarily driven by the unrepeated internal operational restructuring project in the comparable period at our Infrastructure segment, as well as decreases in SG&A at our Non-Operating Corporate segment and our Life Sciences segment driven primarily by R2 as a result of cost reduction initiatives. The overall decrease in depreciation and amortization was driven by Banker Steel, as certain intangibles were fully amortized subsequent to the comparable period.

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by an increase in recurring SG&A expenses at our Infrastructure segment and by our Life Sciences segment primarily as a result of higher equity method losses recognized from Pansend's investment in MediBeacon due to additional investments during 2023 resulting in previously suspended losses being recognized as the investment's carrying amount was reduced to zero. Additionally contributing to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was our Spectrum segment as a result of a one-time benefit from the termination of Azteca in the comparable period and by our Other segment from the elimination of equity method income from our investment in HMN, which was sold on March 6, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by our Non-Operating Corporate segment due to a decrease in SG&A expenses and our Life Sciences segment driven by R2 due to a decrease in SG&A expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives.

Under NYSE rules, the Company’s common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE during the Cure Period, subject to the Company’s compliance with other NYSE continued listing requirements.

About INNOVATE Corp. INNOVATE Corp., is a portfolio of best-in-class assets in three key areas of the new economy – Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum. Dedicated to stakeholder capitalism, INNOVATE employs approximately 4,000 people across its subsidiaries. For more information, please visit: www.INNOVATECorp.com. Contacts Investor Contact:Anthony Rozmusir@innovatecorp.com(212) 235-2691 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, INNOVATE refers to certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including Total Adjusted EBITDA (excluding discontinued operations, if applicable) and Adjusted EBITDA for its operating segments. In addition, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which could limit its usefulness. Adjusted EBITDA Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with meaningful information for gaining an understanding of our results as it is frequently used by the financial community to provide insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and the other items listed in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA can also be a useful measure of a company’s ability to service debt. While management believes that non-U.S. GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our U.S. GAAP financial results. Using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure has inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance. The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, consists of Net income (loss) attributable to INNOVATE Corp., excluding discontinued operations, if applicable; depreciation and amortization; other operating (income) loss, which is inclusive of (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets, lease termination costs, asset impairment expense and FCC reimbursements; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); non-controlling interest; share-based compensation expense; legacy accounts receivable expense; restructuring and exit costs; and acquisition and disposition costs. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release contains, and certain oral statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain, ""forward-looking statements."" Generally, forward-looking statements include information describing actions, events, results, strategies and expectations and are generally identifiable by use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “might,” or “continues” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and inherently involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation, any statements regarding INNOVATE’s plans and expectations for future growth and ability to capitalize on potential opportunities, the achievement of INNOVATE’s strategic objectives, expectations for performance of new projects and realization of revenue from the backlog at DBM Global, anticipated success from the continued sale of new products in the Life Sciences segment, anticipated developments regarding the FDA approval process at MediBeacon, anticipated performance of new channels and LPTV frequencies, expanded uses for LPTV channels in the Spectrum segment and the deployment of datacasting, anticipated agreements in the Spectrum segment with public broadcast networks, anticipated 5G broadcasting opportunities in the Spectrum segment, anticipated developments regarding Federal Communications Commission approval to convert existing station to 5G broadcast, our intentions to regain compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards, and changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility (including developments and volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic), including interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets, and the impact of such changes and volatility on INNOVATE’s financial position. Such statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of INNOVATE’s management and the management of INNOVATE’s subsidiaries and portfolio companies. The Company believes these judgments are reasonable, but you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance, results or the creation of stockholder value and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, including those that may be identified in subsequent statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. Such important factors include, without limitation: our dependence on distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations and payments on our obligations; the impact on our business and financial condition of our substantial indebtedness and the significant additional indebtedness and other financing obligations we may incur; our dependence on key personnel; volatility in the trading price of our common stock; the impact of recent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increases in overall price levels, including in transportation costs; interest rate environment; developments relating to the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine and Israel; increased competition in the markets in which our operating segments conduct their businesses; our ability to successfully identify any strategic acquisitions or business opportunities; uncertain global economic conditions in the markets in which our operating segments conduct their businesses; changes in regulations and tax laws; covenant noncompliance risk; tax consequences associated with our acquisition, holding and disposition of target companies and assets; the ability of our operating segments to attract and retain customers; our expectations regarding the timing, extent and effectiveness of our cost reduction initiatives and management’s ability to moderate or control discretionary spending; our expectations and timing with respect to any strategic dispositions and sales of our operating subsidiaries, or businesses; the possibility of indemnification claims arising out of divestitures of businesses; and our possible inability to raise additional capital when needed or refinance our existing debt, on attractive terms, or at all. Although INNOVATE believes its expectations and assumptions regarding its future operating performance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. These risks and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements attributable to INNOVATE or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made, and unless legally required, INNOVATE undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Announces Pricing of Senior Secured Notes Due 2030 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. announced a $865 million offering of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030, part of a refinancing transaction to prepay existing borrowings and extend the maturity of term loan B facility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a substantial debt offering, such as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings' $865 million in Senior Secured Notes, is a significant event for the company and its investors. The 7.875% interest rate on these notes is a critical figure, as it reflects the cost of capital for the company and influences its debt servicing obligations. Comparing this rate to the current yield curve and industry benchmarks is essential to assess the attractiveness of these notes to institutional investors and the implied risk as perceived by the market.Furthermore, the refinancing transaction intended to extend the maturity of the company's term loan B facility from 2026 to 2028 suggests a strategic move to manage the company's debt profile and liquidity risks. The use of proceeds to prepay existing debt and cover transaction fees indicates an effort to optimize the capital structure and potentially improve financial flexibility. However, investors must consider the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-transaction to evaluate the impact on its financial health. Legal Expert In the context of securities law, the decision by Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings to offer the Notes to 'qualified institutional buyers' under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S is noteworthy. These exemptions allow the company to bypass the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, which can expedite the offering process and reduce disclosure obligations. However, this also limits the potential buyer pool and necessitates a thorough understanding of the restrictions on resale, as the notes have not been registered.It is also important to note that the security interests in the company's and guarantors' assets, including a first-priority basis for certain assets and a second-priority basis for accounts receivable, establish the collateral backing of the notes. The structuring of these security interests will significantly affect the recovery rate for investors in the event of default, which is a critical consideration for risk assessment. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the Senior Secured Notes offering by Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings provides insight into the company's market positioning and strategic initiatives. The fact that the offering is part of a broader refinancing strategy implies that the company is actively managing its debt in response to market conditions and its operational needs. The impact on the company's credit rating and investor perception will depend on the successful execution of the refinancing and the broader market's appetite for high-yield debt.Investors and analysts should monitor the uptake of the offering and subsequent performance of the notes in the secondary market, as this will provide an indication of the market's confidence in the company's financial strategy and its ability to meet its debt obligations. Additionally, the broader economic context, including interest rate trends and the health of the advertising industry, which Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings operates within, will play a role in the long-term performance of the investment. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN ANTONIO, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

(ARQT) announced the closing of a public offering, selling 18,157,895 shares at $9.50 per share, raising approximately $172.5 million. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares, leading to a total gross proceeds before expenses. Various investment firms acted as lead managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Arcutis Biotherapeutics' underwritten public offering represents a significant capital infusion for the company, amounting to approximately $172.5 million in gross proceeds. This financial maneuver is indicative of the company's strategic initiatives to bolster its cash reserves, potentially to accelerate its R&D efforts or to expand its commercial footprint within the immuno-dermatology sector.Investors should note that the offering price of $9.50 per share provides a reference point for the market valuation of the company at the time of the offering. The full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares suggests a strong market demand and confidence in the company's future prospects.It is also noteworthy that the offering was managed by prominent financial institutions, which may enhance investor perception of the company's credibility and the offering's success. However, it is important to consider the dilutive effect on existing shareholders, as the increase in outstanding shares could potentially reduce earnings per share in the short term. Market Research Analyst Arcutis Biotherapeutics' successful public offering is a testament to the market's interest in the immuno-dermatology space, a niche within the biopharmaceutical industry that focuses on treating immune-mediated skin diseases. This sector has been gaining attention due to the unmet medical needs and the potential for innovative treatments to disrupt the current market.From a market perspective, the capital raised may enable Arcutis to invest in marketing and sales efforts to gain a competitive edge or to fund further clinical trials, which could lead to new product offerings and drive long-term growth. The company's ability to secure funding through a shelf registration statement also demonstrates a well-planned financial strategy, providing flexibility to access capital markets swiftly in the future.Additionally, the involvement of multiple reputable underwriters could enhance the stock's liquidity and broaden its investor base, which might have positive implications for the stock's trading volume and stability. Biopharmaceutical Industry Analyst The closing of this substantial public offering by Arcutis Biotherapeutics is indicative of the company's stage of development and its trajectory within the biopharmaceutical industry. For a commercial-stage company, securing such an amount of funding is crucial for sustaining operations and advancing the pipeline of products, particularly in a field like immuno-dermatology where research and development costs can be high.Investors and stakeholders should be aware of the inherent risks and long development cycles associated with the biopharmaceutical industry. The capital raised could mitigate some of these risks by ensuring that the company has sufficient resources to overcome regulatory hurdles, conduct pivotal clinical trials and navigate the complex approval processes.The use of a shelf registration statement for the offering is a strategic approach that allows the company to remain agile and responsive to market conditions, which is especially important in the fast-evolving biopharmaceutical sector. 03/04/2024 - 04:00 PM WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc.

(TSX-V:FG)(GR:3FA)(OTCQB:FGLDF); (""Falcon"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the Company has received drill permit approval to conduct a diamond drilling program at its Great Burnt Copper Project in central Newfoundland. The Company initially plans to test up to ten geophysical anomalies with a maximum of 1100 metres of drilling. The Company will provide further guidance on an estimated drill start date once logistics for the program are determined and service providers are confirmed.Mr. Karim Rayani, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We are extremely pleased to have been able to expand our footprint in the Great Burnt Copper District. This property will be explored for its potential to host orogenic gold and copper-bearing massive-sulphide mineralization that may contain gold. Falcon's new claims overlie the northern continuation of the conductive trend which is associated with lithologies that host the copper-rich Great Burnt and gold-rich South Pond deposits held by Benton Resources Inc. - Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd. Great Burnt Copper-Gold joint venture. The northern conductive trend has never been drill-tested or subjected to any systematic exploration program. Our desktop studies have identified geophysical targets within Falcon's project that are drill-ready, and with the recent drill permit approval we are now in the logistical planning phase. We look forward to updating our exploration and drilling plans in the coming months.""Falcon holds 2,275 hectares in the Great Burnt Camp, with licenses located north of Benton Resources Inc. - Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd. Great Burnt Copper-Gold joint venture (see Figure 1). Benton Resources Inc. (""Benton"") recently optioned the Great Burnt Copper-Gold Project from Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd. (""Spruce"") in an agreement that allows Benton to earn a 70% interest in the property (see press release dated August 17, 2023). The Benton-Spruce Ridge property is host to the Great Burnt Copper Zone, a deposit with an indicated resource of 381,300 tonnes at 2.68% Cu and inferred resources of 663,100 tonnes at 2.10% Cu. (https://www.spruceridgeresources.com/great-burnt.php). Recent drilling by Benton at the Great Burnt Copper Deposit reported drill results that returned 7.20% Cu, 7.12 g/t Ag, and 0.05% Co over 12.30 metres (see press release dated December 5, 2023). Previous drilling in 2020 by Spruce reported 8.06% Cu over 27.2 m (TSXV: SHL press release dated March 18, 2021). The Great Burnt Greenstone Belt is prospective for copper and gold, and further hosts the South Pond A and South Pond B copper-gold zones, and the End Zone copper prospect along a 14 km mineralized corridor. The mineralized corridor occurs along a conductive trend, and this conductive trend continues into Falcon's Great Burnt Copper Property (see right hand side image in Figure 2).The Great Burnt Copper PropertyThe property is hosted within the Great Burnt Greenstone Belt (GBGB) which hosts massive sulphide deposits that have been interpreted as Besshi-type. These types of deposits generally occur as laterally extensive sheets of pyrrhotite- or pyrite-rich sulphide rock within mixed volcanic-sedimentary environments. Sulphide lenses can be several metres thick and extend for several kilometres. Besshi-type massive-sulphide deposits are generally copper dominant, commonly contain other lithophile elements like cobalt or lead, and can contain precious metals such as gold and silver. The property is also located 4 km west of the Crest Resources-Exploits Discovery joint venture project within the Exploits Subzone. The Exploits Subzone contains deep-seated gold-bearing structures of the Dog Bay-Appleton Fault- GRUB Line deformation corridor that contains the high-grade Keats Gold Zone of New Found Gold.Figure 1.

The jury ruled in favor of Avadel on one patent but against on another. Avadel plans to vigorously defend its position, including a possible appeal, to overturn the unfavorable ruling. The company remains optimistic about the commercial launch and transformative potential of LUMRYZ™ for narcolepsy patients. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The jury ruling in the patent lawsuit between Avadel Pharmaceuticals and Jazz Pharmaceuticals is a significant development with potential implications for both companies' market positioning and financial health. The mixed outcome, with Avadel winning on one patent but losing on another, suggests a nuanced legal landscape. From a legal perspective, the decision to appeal is a strategic move that could either mitigate or exacerbate the impact of the loss, depending on the appeal's outcome.For stakeholders, the immediate concern would be the potential for injunctions or financial damages that could affect Avadel's bottom line and market share. However, the assurance that the commercial launch of LUMRYZ™ will continue indicates confidence in the drug's market viability despite the legal challenges. The legal process can be protracted and the costs associated with ongoing litigation or an appeal could influence Avadel's financials over time. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst In the pharmaceutical industry, patent litigations can have a profound impact on a company's ability to market exclusive treatments, affecting revenue and competitive advantage. Avadel's position that the jury's decision will not affect the commercial launch of LUMRYZ™ is a bold statement that underscores the product's strategic importance to the company's portfolio.Analyzing the competitive landscape, LUMRYZ™'s continued presence in the market could be crucial for Avadel in maintaining a foothold in the narcolepsy treatment space. The drug's potential to 'transform lives' is not only a clinical assertion but also a commercial one, indicating the expected value proposition to patients and healthcare providers. The outcome of this legal dispute will likely influence investor sentiment and could lead to volatility in Avadel’s stock price as the market reacts to each new development. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the jury ruling for Avadel are multifaceted. On one hand, the validation of one patent provides a degree of protection and could reassure investors of Avadel's intellectual property portfolio's strength. On the other hand, the loss regarding the additional patent raises concerns about potential royalty payments or a settlement that could strain Avadel's financial resources.Investors should monitor the company's quarterly filings for any contingent liabilities or legal expense accruals that may arise from this case. The mention of an appeal process indicates that legal expenses will likely remain elevated, which could impact profit margins. The company's commitment to the commercial success of LUMRYZ™ suggests that they anticipate the revenue generated will offset these costs and not hinder their long-term financial strategy. 03/04/2024 - 03:37 PM DUBLIN, Ireland, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: AVDL), today issued a statement in response to a jury ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (“Court”) in a patent suit brought by Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc. regarding LUMRYZ™. Avadel is pleased with the jury’s decision ruling in favor of Avadel with respect to one of the contested patents. As it relates to the jury’s decision against Avadel regarding the additional contested patent, the company is disappointed in the outcome. Avadel will vigorously defend its position with the pursuit of all options, including an appeal, to overturn the unfavorable aspect of the jury’s decision upon final entry of the decision by the Court. Avadel does not expect the jury’s decision to impact the ongoing commercial launch or potential for LUMRYZ™ to transform the lives of people living with narcolepsy. About LUMRYZ™ (sodium oxybate) for extended-release oral suspension LUMRYZ, is an extended-release sodium oxybate medication approved by the FDA on May 1, 2023, as the first and only once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy. The FDA approval of LUMRYZ was supported by results from REST-ON, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults with narcolepsy. LUMRYZ demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the three co-primary endpoints: EDS, clinicians’ overall assessment of patients’ functioning (CGI-I) and cataplexy attacks, for all three evaluated doses when compared to placebo. With its approval, the FDA also granted seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity to LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy due to a finding of clinical superiority of LUMRYZ relative to currently available oxybate treatments. In particular, the FDA found that LUMRYZ makes a major contribution to patient care over currently available, twice-nightly oxybate products by providing a once-nightly dosing regimen that avoids nocturnal arousal to take a second dose. About Avadel Pharmaceuticals plcAvadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: AVDL) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming medicines to transform lives. Our approach includes applying innovative solutions to the development of medications that address the challenges patients face with current treatment options. Avadel’s commercial product, LUMRYZ™, was approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as the first and only once-at-bedtime oxybate for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy.

Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Upsizing and Pricing of $825 Million of Senior Unsecured Guaranteed Notes due 2032,2024-03-04T20:24:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) has priced $825 million senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2032 in an exempt offering. The Notes bear 7.000% interest and will be used to repurchase existing Secured Notes. The offering is expected to close on March 18, 2024.","Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Upsizing and Pricing of $825 Million of Senior Unsecured Guaranteed Notes due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) has priced $825 million senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2032 in an exempt offering. The Notes bear 7.000% interest and will be used to repurchase existing Secured Notes. The offering is expected to close on March 18, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upsizing and pricing of $825 million in senior unsecured guaranteed notes by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. reflects a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. By issuing these notes at a 7.000% interest rate, which is above the current average for corporate debt, the company is likely addressing a higher risk perception among investors or a strategic decision to lock in long-term financing despite the higher cost. This move to repurchase or redeem the existing 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 suggests a shift from secured to unsecured debt, which could imply a stronger balance sheet or a desire for greater financial flexibility.The closing of this offering, contingent on customary conditions, indicates a forward-looking approach to managing debt maturities. However, investors should consider the implications of the new debt's unsecured status, which typically ranks below secured debt in a liquidation scenario, potentially increasing the risk profile for the bondholders. Additionally, the exclusion of certain subsidiaries from the guarantee could impact the overall risk assessment of the notes.From a market perspective, this refinancing activity could be received with varying sentiments, depending on the investors' outlook on the company's future cash flows and the broader industry dynamics. The use of liquidity on hand in conjunction with the proceeds from the notes to address existing debt obligations also provides insights into the company's liquidity management strategies. Legal Expert The offering's exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 is a significant legal aspect of this transaction. Utilizing Rule 144A, Cleveland-Cliffs is targeting qualified institutional buyers, which allows for a more expedited and less public process than a public offering. The reliance on Regulation S for sales to non-U.S. persons also indicates a strategic approach to tap into international markets while complying with U.S. securities laws.It is critical to note that the unregistered status of these notes means they cannot be sold in the U.S. to the general public without registration or an applicable exemption. This limitation could impact the secondary market liquidity of the notes. Furthermore, the absence of a redemption notice for the Secured Notes at this stage is a reminder of the procedural and legal steps that must be followed for such corporate actions, which can affect the timing and execution of the intended debt restructuring. Market Research Analyst The decision by Cleveland-Cliffs to upsize its note offering could be indicative of strong demand from institutional investors or an anticipation of future capital needs. The steel industry, where Cleveland-Cliffs operates, is cyclical and capital-intensive, often requiring significant financing for operations and growth initiatives. With this upsized offering, the company may be positioning itself to take advantage of potential growth opportunities or to cushion against market downturns.The annual interest rate of 7.000% on the new notes should be evaluated against the backdrop of the current interest rate environment and credit spreads for similar issuers and maturities. This rate could reflect market expectations of inflation, interest rate trends and the company's creditworthiness. The impact of such a debt issuance on the company's stock performance will hinge on how the market interprets the company's leverage, interest coverage ratios and overall financial health in the context of industry performance and economic conditions. 03/04/2024 - 03:24 PM CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) announced today that it has upsized and priced $825 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2032 (the “Notes”) in an offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). The Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 7.000% and will be issued at par. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company’s material direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than certain excluded subsidiaries. The offering is expected to close on March 18, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes, along with liquidity on hand, to repurchase in a tender offer or otherwise redeem all of the Company’s outstanding 6.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Secured Notes”).

(TSXV-SXL) (“SLAM” or the “Company”) announces that CEO Mike Taylor is doing a presentation at The Atlantic Edge Investors Program at PDAC at 3:00 PM Tuesday, March 5 about SLAM’s Mine Road zinc copper silver acquisition reported in a news release September 6, 2023. The Mine Road project is host to 6 volcanic massive sulphide (“VMS”) occurrences spread over a 9.555 hectare group of mineral claims adjacent to the former producing Heath Steele mine in the mineral-rich Bathurst Mining Camp (“BMC”) of northern New Brunswick. For more information on the Atlantic Edge Program, click the Atlantic Edge Investors Program. Historic Mine Road Drilling: Diamond drill hole IL2014-003 cored a 9 metre interval grading 14.51% zinc, 5.86% lead, 0.67% copper and 139.9 g/t silver on the Railroad zone. Diamond drill hole IL2018-01 intersected 7.0 meters of 0.9% copper on the Roche Trend, 5 kilometres southwest of the Railroad Zone. This drilling data is a small sample of the wealth of data resulting from $1,448,000 in exploration expenditures applied to the Mine Road project during the past 12 years. Current assessment work credits of $428,776 are available for future claim renewals. Drill-Ready VMS Targets At Mine Road: The Railroad and Roche zones are open to test for potential extensions at depth and along strike. Other targets include the Island Lake, Captain West, Sandburn Brook and Brunsman VMS occurrences along with a number of untested airborne conductors and magnetic anomalies. Infrastructure: The Mine Road project is located on the Mine Road (Route 430) which connects the former Heath Steele mine to the city of Miramichi 60 kilometres to the southeast. The claims are accessed from this paved road and a series of logging roads. Electric power is available from lines that connect Heath Steele to the New Brunswick power grid. Mine Road Project: SLAM has acquired 3 additional mineral claims since acquisition of the Mine Road project. The expanded project now covers 9,555 hectares of mineral potential adjacent to the former producing Heath Steele mine property where 21 M tonnes were mined from 1957 to 1996.

Negative None. 03/04/2024 - 03:08 PM CLEARWATER, FL, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire - REMSleep Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: RMSL) gives an update on FDA process and REMSleep status. We have had numerous inquiries asking for REMSleep regulatory status update. REMSleep was asked to answer questions and perform added shelf-life testing. We have initiated the shelf-life testing and are waiting on results. We hope to get test results in the next six weeks. Then we have to resubmit the results. We believe we submitted the perfect 510(K) application and were stunned the agency requests more information. We were fortunate to find the top expert for 510(K) submissions and he is now on-board with REMSleep going forward, which will make a huge difference in guiding us to the finish line. We are hardly unaware of the frustration. However, REMSleep is in chains until we receive our 510(K). Once we receive our 510(K) everything changes overnight. REMSleep consultants are confident we will receive our 510(K) and we will never give up until we are successful. Once we receive our 510(K) we will begin to realize our specific aims. Specific AimsObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 39 million people annually in the United States. It can be caused by a range of factors including BMI, anatomical factors, familial history, smoking and the use of alcohol or sedatives. Its incidence increases with age, and it is almost twice as likely to affect men than women. OSA is strongly associated with poor cardiovascular health, metabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and obesity and cognitive decline including an increased risk of dementia. OSA is most commonly treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and the National Council on Aging estimates that 33 million adults in the US use a CPAP machine. There is a bi-directional relationship between OSA and congestive heart failure (CHF) in which each exacerbates the other. OSA worsens CHF symptoms by causing low oxygen levels, increased blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia. Conversely CHF can cause accumulation of fluid in the lungs and can alter rates and patterns of respiration. As its name implies, CPAP delivers continuous airway pressure which enhances inhalation but makes exhalation more difficult. This difficulty is a significant cause of discontinuation and non-compliance with current usage recommendations of 4 hours per night and 4 nights per week. An alternative is Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) which delivers higher pressure during inhalation and reduced pressure during exhalation, which makes exhaling easier thereby improving comfort and compliance. BiPAPs have been shown to be more effective for severe OSA and OSA that is complicated by CHF, however their cost and complexity limit widespread use relative to the CPAP. REMSleep has addressed this problem by developing a novel CPAP nasal pillow interface that has been engineered to reduce pressure and enable better airflow. Adaption of this interface to conventional CPAP machines delivers the performance features of a BiPAP which will directly affect individuals with severe OSA or OSA that is complicated by CHF. REMSleep has completed development of 1st and 2nd generation nasal pillow interfaces and is advancing completion of a third generation that contains design improvements that improve airflow and comfort. The objective is the ability of this interface to improve comfort, physiologic parameters associated with sleep, sleep quality and compliance to 8 hours per night and 7 nights per week. This objective will be met through three specific tasks: Task 1. Engineering and design improvements: Our goal is to improve delivery of air through the nostrils in a manner that is comfortable enough to be worn 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and does not compress the nostril in any way. Task 2. Biocompatibility testing in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 10993 1:2018. Task 3. This new design will have measurable physiologic parameters of sleep quality, comfort, and compliance to 8 hours per day and 7 days per week. Successful completion of these tasks will result in the production of a nasal pillow interface that will improve the utility of CPAP machines for the general population by increasing comfort, relieving pressure during exhalation. For people with severe OSA or OSA complicated by CHF, these improvements may improve the performance of the CPAP to approach the benefits of the more complex and costly BiPAP. These improvements will have overall positive effects on sleep quality which impacts cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive health. About REMSleep Holdings, Inc.REMSleep Holdings, Inc. is a medical device manufacturer dedicated to forever changing the level of treatment provided to obstructive sleep apnea patients. Our focus is primarily designing and manufacturing devices and products for the treatment of sleep apnea and other respiratory conditions. With over 30 years of collective experience in CPAP therapy, the REMSleep team has extensive knowledge and understanding of CPAP and the challenges of patient compliance.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in quarterly revenue by 24.7% year-over-year for Paymentus Holdings, Inc. is indicative of the company's ability to expand its market share and effectively capitalize on the growing demand for digital payment solutions. The substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA by 95.4%, representing a 30% contribution profit, is particularly noteworthy as it suggests significant operational efficiency and cost management. The robust EBITDA margin expansion implies a healthy cash flow position, which is critical for the company's reinvestment strategies and potential shareholder returns.Furthermore, the 28.4% increase in transaction volume for the quarter highlights the scalability of Paymentus's platform. Investors should note that this metric is a vital indicator of user adoption and network effects, which can lead to a reinforcing cycle of growth. However, it is also important to monitor the competitive landscape, as the payments industry is known for rapid innovation and disruption. Market Research Analyst The impressive full-year transaction growth of 24.9% underscores Paymentus's growing footprint in the bill payment sector. This trend is reflective of the broader shift towards automated and electronic payment methods, driven by consumer convenience and improved security protocols. As Paymentus continues to harness this momentum, the company's strategic positioning within the industry could attract partnerships, potentially leading to diversified revenue streams.However, it is essential to consider market saturation and consumer behavior shifts as potential risks. The ability of Paymentus to maintain this growth trajectory in the face of increasing competition and potential economic downturns will be critical for long-term sustainability. Stakeholders should also scrutinize the company's investment in innovation and customer acquisition to ensure continued relevance in a rapidly evolving market. Legal Expert Non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are frequently used by companies to provide a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding non-recurring, irregular and non-cash items. Paymentus's reliance on these measures and the significant year-over-year increase indicate management's confidence in the underlying business fundamentals. Nevertheless, it is crucial for stakeholders to review the reconciliations provided to GAAP measures to fully understand the adjustments made.Additionally, the recasting of prior year non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to align with updated methodology merits attention. This action could improve transparency and comparability, but it may also affect the perception of the company's performance trends. Investors and analysts should examine the rationale and impact of these changes to ensure they have an accurate understanding of the company's financial health. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM Quarterly revenue increased 24.7% year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA grew 95.4% year-over-year, reflecting 30% of contribution profit CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Paymentus Holdings, Inc.

All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. Use of Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Measures We do not meaningfully reconcile guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, because we cannot provide guidance for the more significant reconciling items between net income and adjusted EBITDA without unreasonable effort. This is due to the fact that future period non-GAAP guidance includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include, without limitation, items included in the supplemental financial information for reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP results. Such items include acquisition related amortization expense for acquired intangibles, foreign exchange gains and losses, adjustments to our income tax provision and certain other items we believe to be non-indicative of our ongoing operations. Such adjustments may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, as well as nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains/losses or other items that may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. The exact amount of these adjustments is not currently determinable but may be significant. In addition, we do not meaningfully reconcile guidance for contribution profit, because the determination of contribution is subject to variables outside our control, such as an increase in the average payment amount, changes in the payment mix, or the payment channel used by consumers that can influence contribution profit, and cannot be determined without unreasonable effort, if at all. Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross profit, contribution profit, non-GAAP net income (including those amounts as a percentage of revenue), non-GAAP earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP operating expense and free cash flow. We use non-GAAP measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management and our board of directors to more fully understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and helps management project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and capitalized software development costs. Contribution profit is defined as gross profit plus other cost of revenue. Other cost of revenue equals cost of revenue less interchange and assessment fees paid by us to our payment processors. Interchange and assessment fees paid by us to our payment processors are excluded from contribution profit because we believe inclusion is less directly reflective of our operating performance as we do not control the payment channel used by consumers, which is the primary determinant of the amount of interchange and assessment fees. We use contribution profit to measure the amount available to fund our operations after interchange and assessment fees, which are directly linked to the number of transactions we process and thus our revenue and gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before other income (expense) (which consists of interest income (expense), net and foreign exchange gain (loss)), depreciation and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and income taxes, adjusted to exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense and certain nonrecurring expenses that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution profit. Non-GAAP operating expense is defined as total operating expense excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring expenses. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangibles amortization supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although we exclude amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS are defined as net income and net income per share, respectively, excluding certain nonrecurring items such as discrete tax items, one-time expenses or other non-cash items, including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we have excluded stock-based compensation from the calculation of our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to be consistent with our methodology for non-GAAP operating expenses, which we believe enhances the understanding of our operating performance and enables more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022 were recast to conform to the updated methodology and are reflected herein for comparison purposes. We believe non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS enhance the understanding of our operating performance and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized internal-use software development costs. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our investors with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We use these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance and liquidity, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance and liquidity. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP measures presented in this press release. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies; other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results included at the end of this release.

The Partnership estimates net proceeds of approximately $984.4 million for debt repayment, note redemption, and general purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement of $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes by USA Compression Partners, LP is a significant capital market transaction with implications for the company's financial structure. The 7.125% interest rate on the new notes is notably higher than the 6.875% rate of the notes due for redemption, indicating a potential increase in debt servicing costs. This could affect the company's cash flow and financial flexibility, especially in the context of a potentially rising interest rate environment.Investors will be interested in the company’s rationale for the timing and the terms of the offering, as well as the use of proceeds. Repaying existing borrowings and redeeming older notes can be a strategic move to manage the maturity profile of the debt and potentially lower the overall cost of capital in the long term. However, the immediate impact on the company's leverage and interest expense will be a key factor in assessing the financial health of the company post-transaction. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the private placement's success will depend on institutional investors' appetite for energy sector debt, particularly in the midstream segment where USA Compression Partners operates. The offering's reception may reflect broader market sentiment towards credit risk and the energy industry's outlook. The company's decision not to list the notes on any securities exchange suggests a strategic preference for private, less liquid markets, which typically involve a more selective pool of investors.Understanding the market dynamics, including the demand for high-yield debt and the current credit spreads for similar instruments, will be crucial. If the offering is well-received, it could signal confidence in the company's long-term prospects and the energy sector's resilience. Conversely, a lukewarm reception might indicate market concerns over sector-specific risks or a more cautious approach to credit investments amid economic uncertainty. Legal Expert The legal aspects of the notes offering, particularly the reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S for the sale to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, are key for compliance with securities regulations. These rules allow the company to raise capital efficiently without the more extensive disclosure requirements of a public offering. It is crucial for investors to understand that the notes, being unregistered, carry certain restrictions on their transferability, which could affect their liquidity and pricing in the secondary market.Moreover, the statement that the notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system means they will trade over-the-counter (OTC), which generally involves less transparency compared to exchange-traded securities. This could impact the ease with which investors can ascertain the market value of these notes and execute trades. 03/04/2024 - 03:13 PM AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USA Compression Partners, LP (NYSE: USAC) (the “Partnership”) today announced the pricing of a private placement to eligible purchasers by the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiary, USA Compression Finance Corp., of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2029 at par.

The test targets individuals at risk of elevated PFAS exposure, as identified by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Organizations can also utilize the test for workforce, community, and research population screening. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of a consumer-initiated, physician-ordered blood test for PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) by Quest Diagnostics represents a significant advancement in individual health monitoring and public health awareness. PFAS are a group of manufactured chemicals that have been linked to various health issues, including cancer, immune system effects and hormonal disruptions. The ability to detect and measure these chemicals in individuals provides valuable data for epidemiological studies and potential regulatory actions.From a medical research perspective, the test could lead to increased detection rates of PFAS exposure, prompting further research into the health implications of these chemicals. Longitudinal studies could be designed to monitor the health outcomes of individuals with known PFAS levels, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the risks associated with exposure. Furthermore, the test could serve as a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing PFAS exposure. Market Research Analyst Quest Diagnostics' release of this test could potentially open up a new market segment focused on environmental health testing. As awareness of PFAS and their potential dangers grows, consumer demand for such testing services is likely to increase. This move may position Quest Diagnostics ahead of competitors in the diagnostic industry. The service could appeal to a broad range of stakeholders, including individuals in affected communities, employers concerned about occupational health and researchers studying PFAS impacts.Moreover, this development could have implications for the stock market, as investors may view the introduction of innovative testing services as a growth opportunity for Quest Diagnostics. The company could see an increase in revenue streams if the test is widely adopted. However, it is essential to monitor how the market responds to this new offering and whether Quest Diagnostics can effectively capitalize on the increasing public concern over environmental contaminants. Economist The economic implications of such a test are multifaceted. On one hand, it could lead to increased healthcare spending as individuals seek to understand their PFAS exposure levels and potentially require treatment or monitoring for related health conditions. On the other hand, it could also drive policy changes that lead to stricter regulations on PFAS emissions and usage, potentially impacting industries that manufacture or use these chemicals. Such regulations could have downstream economic effects, including shifts in industry practices, job market changes and alterations in the competitive landscape.In the long term, the availability of PFAS testing could influence public health policies and healthcare costs associated with exposure-related illnesses. If the test results in more proactive health management and prevention strategies, it could ultimately lead to cost savings for the healthcare system. However, if the test leads to the identification of widespread PFAS exposure without effective treatment or mitigation strategies, it could result in increased long-term healthcare costs. 03/04/2024 - 02:45 PM Directed at individuals who may be at risk of elevated PFAS exposure, the new test detects and measures PFAS identified by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and MedicineOrganizations interested in workforce, community, and research population testing may also access the testSECAUCUS, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX), the world's leader in diagnostic information services, announced the availability of the first consumer-initiated, physician-ordered blood-draw test for PFAS chemicals with the option to confer over the phone with a physician about the results.Available at questhealth.com, the new test, PFAS (Forever Chemicals) Test Panel, is performed by Quest Diagnostics to identify the level of potentially harmful chemicals called per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) - also known as ""forever chemicals"" because they can accumulate and linger in the environment and body.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health effects potentially associated with PFAS exposure include increases in cholesterol levels, decreases in birth weight, lower antibody response to vaccines, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and changes in liver enzymes.""Scientists and the general public are increasingly aware that PFAS may be dangerous to human health, but access to quality, convenient testing to assess exposure is limited,"" said Jack Kain, PharmD, director and medical science liaison of Drug Monitoring and Toxicology, Quest Diagnostics. ""Our PFAS blood test is based on the latest science and aligns with several facets of new CDC guidance as well as recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Not everyone needs a PFAS test, but people at high risk of elevated exposure may benefit from greater access to the insights provided by this novel test.""Testing may be right for people who likely have had elevated exposure to PFAS. These may include people who have been exposed to PFAS while on the job, such as firefighters, or who used a water supply near a commercial or industrial location, as well as those living near a facility that manufactures fluorochemicals or areas of documented PFAS environmental contamination.The new test from Quest features several unique innovations. It is the first PFAS blood test available as a consumer-initiated test with physician consult to report a sum of PFAS chemicals based on level of health risks identified by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The physician consultation, available to any individual who purchases the test, involves a telephone discussion between the individual and a third-party licensed physician about the results. In addition to providing personalized results, each easy-to-read test report includes information on ways to reduce exposure risk and can be shared with a personal physician.The test is also widely available; individuals can visit most of Quest's approximately 2,100 patient service centers in the U.S. for a blood draw*.In addition to offering the test to consumers, Quest is making the test available via B2B channels for organizations seeking workforce, community, or research-based testing for at-risk populations due to concerns about elevated PFAS exposures. The company plans to introduce a version of the test specifically for physicians to aid patient care later this year.PFAS Testing Based on the Latest Science In recent years, a growing body of science has revealed potential health risks of exposure to PFAS. In July 2022, NASEM recommended offering PFAS testing to patients who are likely to have a history of elevated exposure.The Quest test aligns with several recommendations from NASEM on PFAS testing, including:Use of serum or plasma blood specimens (blood taken from an arm) instead of capillary blood specimens (from a fingerstick).Quantifying levels of several specific PFAS chemicals identified for potential health risks.Reporting the sum of those levels by three general risk categories.According to NASEM, individuals whose results are in the third, or highest, category (levels of 20 ng/mL or above) may benefit from additional medical care, such as thyroid function testing and assessment of signs of kidney and testicular cancer. While most individuals have some level of PFAS exposure, an estimated 9% of Americans have PFAS levels of 20 ng/mL or higher, typically due to environmental or occupational exposure.In January 2024, the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry unveiled updated guidance to help providers and patients consider PFAS blood testing, based largely on the NASEM recommendations.About PFAS PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used in thousands of industrial and consumer products and which may enter the body through contaminated food and water. While there is no current medical treatment available to reduce PFAS levels, individuals can take steps to limit or reduce their exposure.PFAS chemicals are associated with $22 billion in healthcare costs, according to a study published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society[1]. Some individuals are at increased risk of prolonged exposure due to certain environmental and occupational factors. This includes firefighters, people living near industrial locations such as manufacturing plants, military bases, and airports, and those living in communities with known PFAS environmental contamination. According to the Environmental Working Group, more than 4,600 communities across the U.S. are at risk, as of August 2023.Human health effects from exposure to low environmental levels of PFAS are uncertain. More research is needed to assess the human health effects of exposure to PFAS. Finding PFAS in an individual's blood does not mean that the levels of PFAS harmed the individual's health. For more information about PFAS chemicals see:CDC: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Your Health.EPA: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).Consumer-Initiated Testing with a Physician Consult The PFAS (Forever Chemicals) Test Panel is available for individuals to purchase directly on questhealth.com. Unlike traditional direct-to-consumer tests, each test involves physician oversight and consultation on request with a licensed physician. Specifically, when an individual purchases a PFAS test online, a physician from PWNHealth, an independent, third-party physician network, will review the request and place an order. Once the order is submitted, an individual can schedule an appointment for a blood draw at a Quest Diagnostics patient service center. When testing is completed, results are provided in an easy-to-read report on a secure patient portal. An individual may then request a separate telephone consult with a PWNHealth physician to review the results. In addition, a PWNHealth care coordinator will actively contact any individual whose test results suggest elevated PFAS exposure (20ng/mL or higher) to recommend a physician consultation.A Solution for Population Testing Public Health Departments, Employers, Military Sites, Municipalities, and other Organizations Quest is also offering the PFAS test panel on a limited basis to organizations seeking to provide PFAS testing for workforce, community, research, and other population-based testing. For additional information about B2B testing program, interested parties may contact Quest Diagnostics at PFAStesting@questdiagnostics.com.*PFAS blood testing does not identify the sources of a person's exposure or predict future health outcomes. This test assesses PFAS levels at the time of the blood sample collection. This PFAS test is not intended for use in the diagnosis of any disease or other conditions, or for use in the cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease or condition. Only a physician can diagnose a health condition or outcome. This test is not appropriate for forensic use. Not available for purchase in AK, AZ, HI, or NY.** In January 2024, the CDC provided new information on its website that recognizes the value of PFAS blood testing by a CLIA-certified laboratory. As knowledge and guidelines about PFAS (""forever chemicals"") and PFAS testing continue to evolve, questhealth.com may update its test offering accordingly.About Quest Quest, through questhealth.com, empowers consumers by making affordable, high-quality, trusted healthcare easy.

CEO Tim Vanderhook highlights accelerating growth and innovation, emphasizing the company's position to capitalize on the evolving advertising landscape. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results by Viant Technology Inc. indicate a period of significant growth, which is particularly noteworthy in the context of the advertising technology industry. The deprecation of third-party cookies is a substantial shift in digital advertising, affecting how companies target and measure their ads. Viant's focus on Household ID technology positions it advantageously as a privacy-centric alternative to cookies. Their technology allows advertisers to continue programmatic advertising without relying on cookies, suggesting potential for increased market share as the industry adapts to privacy changes.Moreover, the introduction of Viant's new AI product suite, which is said to drive more return on ad spend for customers, could be a game-changer. This innovation may lead to an enhanced competitive edge and customer loyalty, as advertisers seek more efficient and effective ad spend methodologies. The company's R&D investment over a decade also demonstrates a long-term commitment to innovation and could signal sustainability in its growth trajectory. Financial Analyst Analyzing the fiscal performance, Viant's strong fourth quarter results are indicative of a company that is not only growing but also managing to innovate in a challenging environment. The financial health of a company is critical for investors and a strong performance in both quarterly and annual terms can be a positive sign. As advertisers pivot their budgets towards Viant's solutions, there's an implication of both increased revenue streams and a potential rise in market share.However, it's important to consider the scalability of their Household ID technology and AI product suite. Investors should look for signs of sustainable profitability and the company's ability to manage increased demand without compromising service quality. Additionally, the market will be observing how Viant manages its operational expenses amid this growth and innovation phase, as these factors will influence net income and, consequently, investor returns. Advertising Technology Expert The transition away from third-party cookies is a significant inflection point in the advertising technology sector. Viant's emphasis on Household ID technology is a strategic move to navigate the post-cookie landscape. This technology enables advertisers to target and measure campaigns at the household level, which is increasingly important as individual-level tracking becomes more restricted.The development of an AI-driven product suite by Viant could represent a substantial advancement in programmatic advertising, offering more sophisticated targeting and measurement capabilities. This could lead to higher efficiency and effectiveness of ad campaigns, which is crucial for advertisers seeking to maximize their return on investment. Viant's positioning in this regard could attract new customers and retain existing ones in an industry that is highly sensitive to technological advancements and privacy regulations. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Viant Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: DSP), a leading people-based advertising technology company, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Our strong fourth quarter results capped off a year of accelerating growth and innovation at Viant,” said Tim Vanderhook, Co-Founder and CEO, Viant. “With the impending deprecation of cookies, I believe we are at a tipping point in the market where advertisers are looking for new platforms for their omnichannel programmatic advertising needs, and we are seeing this materialize in customers shifting budgets to Viant. We have over ten years of R&D invested in our Household ID technology which enables advertisers to plan, buy, and measure their spend in cookie-free environments, and our new AI product suite drove even more return on ad spend for our customers.

A year ago, we set a goal of showing improved profitability each quarter of 2023, and I am very pleased with our team’s ability to deliver on that commitment by a wide margin. We look forward to building on our momentum in the year ahead.” Guidance: For the first quarter 2024, the Company expects: Revenue in the range of $49.0 million to $52.0 million Contribution ex-TAC in the range of $33.0 million to $35.0 million Non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $31.0 million to $32.0 million Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million Contribution ex-TAC, non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP.

We are not able to estimate gross profit, total operating expenses or net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis or reconcile the guidance provided for contribution ex-TAC, non-GAAP operating expenses, or adjusted EBITDA to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures; in particular, the impact of future traffic acquisition costs and other platform operations expenses, as well as the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation related to equity grants that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price and the potential forfeitures of equity grants. We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future GAAP financial results.

The Company’s management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company’s operational trends, financial performance, and cash generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. Contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure. Gross profit is the most comparable GAAP financial measure, which is calculated as revenue less platform operations expense. In calculating contribution ex-TAC, we add back other platform operations expense to gross profit. Contribution ex-TAC is a key profitability measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, develop short- and long-term operational plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. “Traffic acquisition costs” or “TAC” represents amounts incurred and payable to suppliers for the cost of advertising media, third-party data and other add-on features related to our fixed CPM pricing option and certain arrangements related to our percentage of spend pricing option. In particular, we believe that contribution ex-TAC can provide a measure of period-to-period comparisons for all pricing options within our business. Accordingly, we believe that this measure provides information to investors and the market in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Non-GAAP operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure. Total operating expenses is the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP operating expenses is defined by us as total operating expenses plus other expense (income), net, less TAC, stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, and certain other items that are not related to our core operations, such as restructuring and other charges and transaction expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses is a key component in calculating adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the measures we use to provide our quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community. Additionally, non-GAAP operating expenses is used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. We believe that the elimination of TAC, stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and certain other items not related to our core operations provides another measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, provides additional insight into our core controllable costs, and is a useful metric for investors because it allows them to evaluate our operational performance in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net income (loss) before interest expense (income), net, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other items that are not related to our core operations, such as restructuring and other charges, transaction expenses and the extinguishment of debt. Net income (loss) is the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure we calculate by dividing adjusted EBITDA by contribution ex-TAC for the period or periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC are used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by our management and board of directors to evaluate adjusted EBITDA relative to our profitability after costs that are directly variable to revenues, which comprise TAC. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of contribution ex-TAC provide information to investors and the market in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation and certain other items that are not related to our core operations, such as restructuring and other charges, transaction expenses and the extinguishment of debt, as well as the income tax effect of such adjustments. Net income (loss) is the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of stock-based compensation and certain other items that are not related to our core operations provides measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business and additional insight into our core controllable costs. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) provides information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted, adjusted to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation and certain other items that are not related to our core operations, such as restructuring and other charges, transaction expenses, and the extinguishment of debt, as well as the income tax effect of such adjustments. Earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted is the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted is used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of stock-based compensation and certain other items that are not related to our core operations provides measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business and provides additional insight into our core controllable costs. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock—basic and diluted provides information to investors and the market generally that aids in the understanding and evaluation of our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the Company’s financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of the Company’s liquidity. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. The presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results, cash flows or leverage will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items. Management encourages investors and others to review Viant’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Meanwhile, the details about the construction of the project will be released for bidding very soon.The Lets'emot Regional Aquatic Centre is designed to feature an eight-lane lap pool, a leisure pool, a whirlpool, an activity space and a community room. Once operational, this indoor facility will provide more learning spaces for vital water safety education, for children and adults alike.It will also create additional employment and volunteer opportunities, while filling a void in the community's access to a nearby indoor pool facility. Currently, the nearest indoor pool to Agassiz is located in Chilliwack, 26 km away - a distance Mayor Sylvia Pranger of the District of Kent walked for more than five hours to raise funds for the pool back in April 2023.The Ferny Coombe Pool, Agassiz's beloved and lone pool, is a seasonal outdoor pool built in 1978. Already past its initial life expectancy, it cannot be repaired for any significant structural or mechanical failure, and has recently lost its diving board.The name ""Lets'emot"" - a Halqmeylem word meaning ""One Heart, One Mind"" - was chosen as the official name for this aquatic center. It encapsulates the collaborative efforts of the communities of Cheam First Nation, District of Kent, Seabird Island Band, Sq'éwlets First Nation, Stó:lō Tribal Council, the Sts'ailes Nation, the District of Kent and the Village of Harrison Hot Springs, that support having a much-needed year-round aquatic facility for their community and neighbours.""The District of Kent will be incorporating the concept of ‘Lets'emot' in its plans for the new indoor pool in the spirit of embracing all neighbouring communities,"" says Mayor Pranger. ""The Lets'emot Regional Aquatic Centre will be a future hub for recreation and will promote accessibility, inclusion, and social connection, to ensure that everyone feels welcome to use the facility.""As part of its Fueling Futures program, Enbridge - part of the Agassiz community for almost 70 years - has contributed $50,000 to the Lets'emot Regional Aquatic Centre.To further bolster the fundraising efforts, the District of Kent has set up a dedicated page, Jump In and Help Us Fill the Pool!, providing details on various ways to donate.Artist rendering of the Lets'emot Regional Aquatic Centre, targeted for opening by the end of 2025.

The company will present at the Cowen Healthcare Conference and release Q4 earnings on March 12, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The guidance provided by MaxCyte indicates a cautious but stable outlook for the company's core revenue, projecting a flat to 5% growth in 2024 compared to 2023. This conservative estimate suggests management is not expecting significant market expansion or revenue spikes in the near term. The decline in core revenue from 2022 to 2023, however, is a point of concern, indicating a potential slowdown in their primary business segment.The increase in SPL Program-related revenue from $4.6 million in 2022 to $11.4 million in 2023 is noteworthy, showing a diversification in revenue streams. However, the expected decrease to approximately $3 million in 2024 raises questions about the sustainability and volatility of this income source. The exclusion of revenue from the sale of Vertex/CRISPR’s CASGEVY™ in the 2024 outlook suggests a strategic decision or a lack of visibility into the deal's fruition, which could be a risk factor for investors.The projected year-end cash position of $175 million for 2024, down from approximately $210 million in 2023, reflects significant cash burn. This could be attributed to ongoing investments in technology and market expansion but warrants monitoring as it impacts the company's financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst The cell-engineering and gene therapy sectors are rapidly evolving, with increasing demand for platform technologies like MaxCyte's Flow Electroporation® and ExPERT™. MaxCyte's strategic licensing partnerships (SPLs) and technology platforms position the company as a critical enabler in the development of next-generation cell therapies. Their collaboration with clients in pre-clinical and clinical programs is a long-term growth driver, as it embeds their technology in multiple developmental pipelines.However, the market should be aware of the competitive landscape and the risk of technological obsolescence. MaxCyte's future growth is contingent upon maintaining technological leadership and securing more SPLs. Their confidence in expanding their SPL portfolio indicates a robust pipeline, but the market will be looking for tangible outcomes and further partnerships to validate this optimism. Biotechnology Industry Analyst MaxCyte's Flow Electroporation® and ExPERT™ platform are integral to the cell therapy and gene editing industries, offering a method to introduce molecules into cells with high efficiency and viability. This technology is crucial for the development of therapies in oncology, regenerative medicine and other fields. The company's ability to sign three new SPLs early in the year demonstrates its relevance in a high-growth industry.However, the biotech industry is subject to stringent regulatory hurdles and long development cycles. The company's financial performance is therefore not only a reflection of its current market position but also of the success rate and progression speed of its clients' therapeutic candidates. Investors should consider the inherent risks of the biotech sector, such as delays in clinical trials or regulatory approvals, which can significantly affect revenue projections and cash flow. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM ROCKVILLE, Md., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MaxCyte, Inc., (NASDAQ: MXCT; LSE: MXCT), a leading, cell-engineering focused company providing enabling platform technologies to advance the discovery, development and commercialization of next-generation cell therapeutics and innovative bioprocessing applications, today provided revenue guidance for the full year of 2024 and reaffirmed 2023 preliminary results previously announced in January. 2023 Preliminary ResultsTotal revenue for the fiscal year of 2023 is expected to be between $41.1 million and $41.3 million, compared to $44.3 million for fiscal year 2022.

The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will accrue interest semiannually. Tandem intends to use the net proceeds for capped call transactions, repurchasing existing notes, and buying back common stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. regarding their convertible senior notes offering is a significant financial event that warrants a detailed analysis. Convertible notes are a form of debt that can be converted into equity, typically at the discretion of the bondholder. This mechanism allows companies like Tandem to raise capital without immediately diluting shareholders, but with the potential for future dilution.For Tandem, the proceeds are earmarked for several strategic actions, including repurchasing existing convertible notes due in 2025 and buying back shares of common stock. These moves may indicate that Tandem's management believes their stock is undervalued or that they wish to reduce debt obligations and deliver shareholder value. However, the repurchase of common stock could also signal the company's intention to support the stock price in the short term.The capped call transactions accompanying the notes are designed to minimize potential dilution from the conversion of these notes and are typically viewed favorably by existing shareholders. However, the cap means that shareholders will not benefit from any share price appreciation above a certain threshold.It's important to consider the impact of these transactions on Tandem's financial health. The interest payments on the new notes, the potential dilution of shares and the effectiveness of the capped calls in offsetting dilution, will all play critical roles in the company's financial future. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Tandem's actions may influence investor sentiment and stock market performance. The initial announcement could lead to increased volatility in the price of Tandem’s stock as market participants react to the news. The repurchase of the 2025 notes and common stock and the establishment of capped call transactions, suggest that the company is actively managing its capital structure and investor expectations.Furthermore, the market's reaction to these transactions often depends on the perceived strength of the company's underlying business and its future growth prospects. If investors believe that Tandem is well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities in the diabetes care sector, they may view this offering as a positive step towards strengthening the company's balance sheet and investing in growth.Conversely, if the market perceives this move as a sign of financial stress or a lack of attractive investment opportunities, it could negatively impact the stock price. The timing and success of these transactions, particularly in a market sensitive to interest rate changes and economic outlook, will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike. Legal Expert Legally, Tandem's offering of convertible notes is subject to regulatory conditions and market factors. The use of Rule 144A allows Tandem to sell securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for a public offering, which expedites the process and reduces disclosure requirements. However, this also limits the potential buyer pool, as retail investors are excluded.The notes being unregistered under the Securities Act means they cannot be sold to the general public without an exemption or unless they are subsequently registered. This restriction is a standard legal framework for private placements but does limit liquidity for the securities.The legal structuring of the capped call transactions and the repurchase of the 2025 notes will require careful navigation of securities laws to avoid inadvertent market manipulation or insider trading violations. The unwinding of existing capped call transactions and the potential market impact of these transactions must be managed transparently to maintain investor trust and adhere to legal standards. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM), a global insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private placement (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Tandem also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $37.5 million principal amount of notes. The notes will be general unsecured obligations of Tandem and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears. Upon conversion, Tandem will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. Tandem expects to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below, to repurchase for cash certain of its 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 notes”) and to repurchase up to $30.0 million of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions, each as described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Tandem expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include additional repurchases of the 2025 notes from time to time following this offering, or the repayment at maturity, of the 2025 notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Tandem expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Tandem’s common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected to offset the dilution to Tandem’s common stock as a result of any conversion of the notes, with such offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, Tandem expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or purchase shares of Tandem’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, including with, or from, certain investors in the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Tandem expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of Tandem’s common stock or other securities of Tandem in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the observation period relating to any conversion of the notes on or after December 15, 2028 that is not in connection with a redemption, or, to the extent Tandem elects to unwind a portion of the capped call transactions, following any repurchase, redemption, exchange or early conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Tandem’s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder's ability to convert its notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of such notes. Concurrently with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Tandem expects to enter into one or more privately negotiated transactions with one or more holders of the 2025 notes to repurchase for cash certain of its 2025 notes on terms to be negotiated with each holder (each, a ""note repurchase transaction""). The terms of each note repurchase transaction will depend on a variety of factors. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the 2025 notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. This press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2025 notes, and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 notes. In connection with any note repurchase transaction, Tandem expects that holders of the 2025 notes who agree to have their 2025 notes repurchased and who have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such notes (the “hedged holders”) will unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying Tandem’s common stock and/or entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Tandem’s common stock. The amount of Tandem’s common stock to be purchased by the hedged holders or in connection with such derivative transactions may be substantial in relation to the historical average daily trading volume of Tandem’s common stock. This activity by the hedged holders could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, resulting in a higher effective conversion price of the notes. Tandem cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes or Tandem’s common stock. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Tandem entered into capped call transactions (the “existing option transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing option counterparties”). To the extent Tandem effects any note repurchase transactions, it intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties to terminate a portion of the existing option transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of 2025 notes repurchased (such terminations, the “unwind transactions”). In connection with any such termination of any of the existing option transactions, Tandem expects such existing option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates will unwind various derivatives with respect to Tandem’s common stock and/or sell shares of Tandem’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after pricing of the notes. This activity could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Tandem’s common stock at that time and could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market value of the notes. As discussed above, Tandem also intends to use up to $30.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock. Tandem expects to repurchase such shares from purchasers of notes in the offering in privately negotiated transactions with or through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate concurrently with the pricing of the offering (the “share repurchases”), and Tandem expects the purchase price per share of Tandem’s common stock repurchased in the share repurchases to equal the closing price per share of Tandem’s common stock on the date of pricing of the offering. These share repurchases could increase, or reduce the size of any decrease in, the market price of Tandem’s common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, resulting in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of Tandem’s common stock will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. This press release is not an offer to repurchase Tandem’s common stock, and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of Tandem’s common stock. The notes and any shares of Tandem’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Stewart, a former series champion in NASCAR, IndyCar and USAC competition, enters his fourth motorsports discipline at the highest level with the Top Fuel division in NHRA, as the Indiana driver makes his Top Fuel ""rookie"" showing in an 11,000-horsepower Dodge dragster at Gainesville Raceway. ""I'm trying to get through this learning curve right now with the Top Fuel dragster,"" said Stewart, who takes the wheel of the TSR Dodge//SRT Direct Connection dragster after his wife Leah Pruett made the decision to sit out the 2024 campaign to start a family. Pruett will serve as strategist and driving coach for the TSR team. ""This is probably one of the biggest challenges I have ever faced in my racing career. I've been through so many divisions and types of racecars that I have had to learn in my career, and this might be the toughest of all of them. Now just trying to figure these cars will be the most exciting part of it for me. ""I think it's a huge advantage for a rookie in my situation. I have confidence in the team, and I know that they are way stronger at this point of the season than I am. It gives me a big confidence boost. It allows me to literally just work on all the little nuances in learning how to drive a new car. This is way different than anything I've ever done in motorsports in my life. It's not like a NASCAR or IndyCar track where I can go and make 100 laps in a day easily. This is a situation where on a great day, you're going to have four maybe five runs in testing, so every lap that we get is super important right now."" While Stewart makes his initial Top Fuel appearance at Gainesville, his TSR teammate, veteran Matt Hagan, seeks his third consecutive Gatornationals Funny Car win in the nitro-burning TSR Direct Connection Dodge//SRT Hellcat when qualifying begins on Friday, March 8. Hagan matched legends Don ""Snake"" Prudhomme and Kenny Bernstein last year by scoring a fourth NHRA World Funny Car Championship and the first world title for Tony Stewart Racing. Hagan recorded a season-high six NHRA national event victories in 2023 and now is just one win away from a coveted 50 career triumphs entering the 2024 NHRA Mission Drag Racing Series. ""It would be really unbelievable to win Gainesville a third time,"" said Hagan. ""It's so hard to win any of these races and anything can happen. We're going to work really hard to kick the season off well again. Gainesville has been a better track to me the last few years. We have a lot of data to work with from the last two years. ""We have a group that is well-oiled with a lot of chemistry, synergy and energy as we have proven with last year's championship. I'm super confident in everything that my guys do. Tony is going to be learning to drive the dragster this season, so it'll give us an opportunity to help those guys also if they need it. I have confidence in Tony and his TSR dragster team just like my Funny Car squad. I'd love to win Gainesville for a third time."" Hagan and Stewart have tested their respective new TSR Direct Connection Dodge//SRT racecars in recent weeks in preparing for the NHRA Amalie Gatornationals, and will debut brand new 2024 TSR Dodge//SRT Direct Connection red-and-black race car liveries when the pair hit the strip at Gainesville. Nitro qualifying is scheduled for Friday, March 8, at 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST. Saturday qualifying takes place at 1:20 p.m. and 4 p.m. EST with Sunday's final eliminations set for 10:30 a.m. EDT. @DodgeMoparMotorsports on InstagramThe @DodgeMoparMotorsports Instagram channel continues to share content capturing Dodge//SRT Mopar drivers on the track.

The Tender Offer is set to expire on March 11, 2024, with a settlement date expected on March 12, 2024. The company may redeem any outstanding notes post-Tender Offer.

The Offer is contingent on completing a Notes Offering generating at least $450 million. Citizens JMP Securities, LLC acts as the dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer initiated by CoreCivic to repurchase its 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2026 represents a strategic financial maneuver. This action indicates a proactive approach to debt management, potentially aimed at reducing interest expenses and improving the company's balance sheet. The premium offered over the principal amount suggests a willingness to incentivize note holders, which could be indicative of CoreCivic's liquidity position and current capital structure strategy.From a financial perspective, the tender offer's timing and conditions, including the concurrent notes offering, may reflect CoreCivic's assessment of the interest rate environment and credit conditions. If the new notes are issued at a lower interest rate, the transaction could result in interest savings. However, if market conditions have not improved sufficiently, the company could face higher interest costs or less favorable terms, which would impact future financial flexibility.Investors and stakeholders should consider the tender offer's potential effects on CoreCivic's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. A successful tender offer coupled with a favorable notes offering could enhance CoreCivic's credit profile, while an under-subscribed tender offer or an unfavorable notes offering could signal market skepticism about the company's creditworthiness or strategic direction. Market Research Analyst The tender offer for CoreCivic's senior unsecured notes is a signal to the market about the company's current operational health and its management's outlook on capital allocation. The offer price exceeding the principal amount could be seen as an attempt to quickly reduce debt levels, which may be viewed positively by investors seeking a stronger balance sheet and by analysts evaluating the company's risk profile.Market conditions, including investor appetite for corporate debt and the overall economic outlook, will play a critical role in the success of both the tender offer and the subsequent notes offering. A successful tender offer followed by the issuance of new notes at a lower interest rate could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in CoreCivic's financial strategy and its ability to navigate the current economic landscape.The impact on the stock market will depend on investor perception of the tender offer's success and the terms of the new notes. A favorable outcome could lead to a positive reassessment of CoreCivic's stock, while any negative developments could put downward pressure on the company's share price. Debt Capital Markets Expert The mechanics of the tender offer, including the use of a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and the premium offered over the principal amount, are indicative of CoreCivic's strategic approach to managing its debt maturity profile. By repurchasing the 2026 Notes, CoreCivic is effectively reducing its future debt obligations and potentially averting refinancing risk amidst uncertain market conditions.The conditions set forth, particularly the successful completion of a new notes offering, suggest that CoreCivic is looking to optimize its capital structure. The minimum proceeds condition from the new notes offering indicates a threshold that CoreCivic deems necessary to fulfill its strategic financial objectives, which likely includes maintaining a certain level of liquidity and possibly funding other corporate initiatives.It is crucial to consider the broader implications of such a tender offer on the debt capital markets. CoreCivic's actions could influence peer companies' capital market strategies, especially in sectors with similar financial profiles or where market participants are closely monitoring industry trends for cues on optimal capital management practices. 03/04/2024 - 02:24 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoreCivic, Inc.

Market Research Analyst The recent shipment and tonnage data released by Saia, Inc. is a strong indicator of the company's operational performance and can be a proxy for wider economic activity. An 11.8% increase in LTL shipments per workday in January and a 19.0% increase in February, compared to the same months in the previous year, suggests a robust demand for freight services, which could be reflective of an expanding economy or increased market share.However, the decline in LTL weight per shipment by 7.5% and 6.7% for January and February respectively, indicates a change in the type of goods being shipped or a shift in customer mix. This could potentially impact revenue per shipment and should be monitored for trends that could affect profitability.The 11.0% increase in LTL tonnage per workday in February is particularly noteworthy as it signifies not just more shipments, but heavier ones on average, which is typically more revenue-intensive. This data could suggest that Saia is effectively leveraging its network to optimize load consolidation and route efficiency. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the implications of Saia's reported increases in LTL shipments and tonnage as potentially positive signals for the company's quarterly financial performance. The growth in these metrics often correlates with higher revenue generation, given the increased volume of goods transported.However, the reduction in weight per shipment could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it may lead to more shipments being required to transport the same amount of goods, which could drive up operational costs. On the other hand, it might also reflect an optimization in shipment consolidation or a strategic shift towards lighter, higher-margin goods.Investors should also be aware of the cautionary note regarding the possibility that actual quarterly results may differ materially from these early indicators. This uncertainty emphasizes the importance of considering a range of factors, including broader economic conditions and sector-specific challenges, when evaluating the company's prospects. Economist The data provided by Saia, Inc. can serve as a microcosm for examining broader economic trends, particularly in the transportation and logistics sector. An increase in LTL shipments and tonnage typically reflects higher business activity levels and consumer demand, which are positive signs for the economy.However, the decline in weight per shipment could suggest a shift towards a service-based economy or a rise in e-commerce, which often involves the transportation of smaller, lighter packages. This shift may have implications for labor markets, fuel consumption and transportation infrastructure.It's also important to consider the potential impact of inflation on transportation costs and how this might affect Saia's pricing power and cost structure. The ability of the company to pass on increased costs to customers without losing volume will be crucial for its profitability in an inflationary environment. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM JOHNS CREEK, Ga., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Saia, Inc.

NEOS Investments Announces First Monthly Distribution for $QQQI (14.42%),2024-03-04T18:50:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NEOS Investments announces the first monthly distribution for QQQI, the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF, with a yield of 14.42% and a distribution amount of $0.5939 per share.","NEOS Investments Announces First Monthly Distribution for $QQQI (14.42%) Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NEOS Investments announces the first monthly distribution for QQQI, the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF, with a yield of 14.42% and a distribution amount of $0.5939 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of the first monthly distribution for QQQI, the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF, at a distribution yield of 14.42% is a significant event for investors. This high yield is indicative of the ETF's strategy to generate income through options-based strategies, which can offer higher yields compared to traditional equity investments. However, the sustainability of such a high distribution rate should be scrutinized, as options strategies can also carry higher risks. Investors would benefit from understanding the underlying option strategies employed by NEOS Investments to assess the associated risk-return profile.Moreover, the timing of the distribution, shortly after the ETF's inception on January 30, 2024, may attract income-seeking investors, potentially increasing the ETF's assets under management. The impact on the stock market could be limited to the sectors and stocks within the Nasdaq-100 that the ETF is involved with and any associated options activity may influence the volatility of those securities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the introduction of a new high-income ETF like QQQI can alter the competitive landscape among income-focused investment products. A monthly distribution frequency is particularly attractive to investors who require regular income streams, such as retirees. This could lead to a shift in capital from other income-generating assets to QQQI, depending on investor perception of the ETF's performance and risk profile relative to its peers.It's also important to consider how the ETF's performance aligns with market benchmarks and investor expectations for income and growth. The ETF's standardized performance will be a critical factor for investors to watch, as it will provide a clearer picture of how QQQI stacks up against other investment options in the market. Economist The distribution yield of 14.42% for QQQI may have broader economic implications, especially in the context of the current interest rate environment. If the yield offered by QQQI is significantly higher than the average yield on fixed-income securities or dividend yields from equities, it could reflect an aggressive income-generating strategy that might be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or economic downturns.An influx of investments into high-yield ETFs like QQQI might also indicate investor sentiment towards the market's risk appetite. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors tend to search for higher yields, which could lead to a greater acceptance of risk. Conversely, a rising interest rate environment might make such high-yield strategies less appealing as safer alternatives begin to offer competitive returns. 03/04/2024 - 01:50 PM WESTPORT, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NEOS Investments, an asset management firm comprised of leaders and pioneers in the options-based ETF space, is proud to announce the first monthly distribution for QQQI, the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

The 30-Day SEC yield** for QQQI is 0.33% The Gross Expense Ratio for QQQI 0.68% *The Distribution Yield is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying an ETF’s Distribution per Share by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions are not guaranteed. **30-day SEC Yield is calculation based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.

Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. An investment in NEOS ETFs involves risk, including possible loss of principal. The equity securities purchased by the Funds may involve large price swings and potential for loss. The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. The use of leverage by the Fund, such as borrowing money to purchase securities or the use of options, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. The earnings and prospects of small and medium sized companies are more volatile than larger companies and may experience higher failure rates than larger companies. Small and medium sized companies normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies, which may tend to make their market price fall more disproportionately than larger companies in response to selling pressures and may have limited markets, product lines, or financial resources and lack management experience.

The Company sold 151 EksoHealth units and launched GaitCoach software. Despite a net loss of $15.2 million for the full year, Ekso remains optimistic about long-term growth. Positive Record revenue of $18.3 million in 2023, a 42% increase year-over-year Sold 151 EksoHealth units in 2023 Launched GaitCoach software for EksoNR Net proceeds of $3.9 million from a registered direct offering in January 2024 Gross margin of approximately 50% for the full year 2023 Cash on hand at December 31, 2023, was $8.6 million Operating cash burn of $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 Negative Net loss of $15.2 million for the full year 2023 Cash decreased from $20.5 million in 2022 to $8.6 million in 2023 Deferred payment determination by CMS for Ekso Indego Personal Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. show a substantial year-over-year revenue increase of 42%, which is a positive indicator of the company's growth trajectory. The sale of 151 EksoHealth units in 2023 is a concrete demonstration of product demand and market penetration. The gross margin improvement from 48% to 50% suggests enhanced operational efficiency, likely due to lower device costs. However, investors should note the increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which reflect the company's strategic reinvestment into its growth and the integration of the HMC business unit.Despite the positive revenue trends, the company's net loss remaining relatively flat year-over-year and a significant reduction in cash on hand from $20.5 million to $8.6 million could raise concerns about the company's cash burn rate and financial sustainability. The registered direct offering in January 2024, which raised approximately $3.9 million, appears to be a response to this cash burn, although it may not be sufficient to alleviate longer-term liquidity concerns. Investors should closely monitor subsequent financial statements for indications of improved cash flow management and profitability. Market Research Analyst Ekso Bionics' record sales performance in the exoskeleton technology sector underscores the growing demand for medical devices that enhance mobility. The introduction of the GaitCoach software for EksoNR signals the company's commitment to innovation and its strategy to offer comprehensive solutions that span the continuum of care. This positions Ekso Bionics favorably in a market that is increasingly receptive to technologically advanced medical aids.However, the deferral of payment determination by CMS for personal exoskeletons, including the Ekso Indego Personal, introduces an element of uncertainty regarding future revenue streams from this product line. The company's ability to provide compelling pricing documentation to CMS will be crucial in establishing a reimbursement rate that could significantly impact adoption rates and market growth. The case-by-case processing of individual claims may lead to variability in revenue recognition, which could affect the predictability of cash flows. Medical Technology Analyst The reported increase in research and development expenses, particularly due to the acquisition of the HMC business unit, indicates Ekso Bionics' strategic focus on expanding its product portfolio and enhancing its technological capabilities. The integration of HMC's expertise could accelerate the development of next-generation exoskeletons, potentially leading to advanced features and improved patient outcomes.With the medical exoskeleton market poised for growth, driven by an aging population and the prevalence of neurological disorders, Ekso Bionics' robust exoskeleton portfolio positions the company to capitalize on these market trends. The company's ability to drive long-term growth will hinge on continued innovation, as well as navigating regulatory landscapes, such as securing favorable CMS payment determinations, which are critical for widespread adoption and reimbursement. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM Sold Record Number of Annual EksoHealth Units in 2023 SAN RAFAEL, Calif., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc.

Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $2.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2022.

General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $2.5 million, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023 were $8.5 million, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional headcount associated with the acquisition of HMC. Research and development expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023 were $5.0 million, compared to $3.6 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional headcount and an increase in research activity associated with the acquisition of HMC. General and administrative expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023 were $10.7 million, compared to $11.0 million in the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of expenses incurred in 2022 associated with the acquisition of HMC, partially offset by an increase in audit services incurred in 2023 in connection with HMC. Net loss applicable to common shareholders for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was $15.2 million, or $1.10 per basic and diluted share, compared to $15.1 million, or $1.16 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2022. Cash on hand at December 31, 2023 was $8.6 million, compared to $20.5 million at December 31, 2022. In January 2024, the Company closed a registered direct offering, resulting in total net proceeds of approximately $3.9 million. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, the Company used $12.1 million of cash in operations, compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2022.

Positive Strong revenue growth expected for Akoya Biosciences in 2024. 25.0% increase in Q4 2023 revenue compared to the prior year period. Gross margin of 62.7% in Q4 2023, driven by product mix and improved margin. Operating expenses decreased by 11.8% in Q4 2023. Expansion of installed base to nearly 1,200 instruments. Key partnerships and collaborations announced in the spatial biology field. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported quarterly revenue growth of 25% and the annual revenue increase of 29% by Akoya Biosciences are indicative of robust demand for their spatial biology solutions. The growth outpaces average industry benchmarks for the biotech sector, which generally hovers around 10-15% annually. The company's ability to expand its gross margin from 56.8% to 62.7% in Q4 suggests a strategic shift towards higher-margin products or cost efficiencies in production, which is a positive indicator for profitability.Furthermore, the reduction in operating expenses by 11.8% while scaling revenue is a testament to operational leverage. This is a critical metric for investors as it implies that the company is becoming more efficient with its resource allocation. The cash and cash equivalents position of $83.1 million provides the company with a cushion to sustain operations and invest in growth initiatives without immediate need for additional financing, which is reassuring for shareholders concerned about dilution.However, the projected operating cash flow breakeven by year-end 2024 is a forward-looking statement that hinges on continued revenue growth and expense management. Investors would need to monitor subsequent quarters closely to ensure that the company is on track to meet these projections. Market Research Analyst Akoya's expansion of its installed base to 1,183 instruments, including both PhenoCyclers and PhenoImagers, represents a 26.7% year-over-year increase. This growth in the installed base is a key driver for recurring revenue streams from reagents and services, which are typically high-margin offerings. The strategic partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific and the deployment of the MaxFuse algorithm are likely to enhance Akoya's competitive positioning in the spatial biology market, potentially increasing the adoption rate of their platforms.The significant increase of 50.3% in total publications citing Akoya’s technology suggests a growing scientific validation and awareness in the academic community, which can lead to increased commercial interest. These factors, combined with the guidance for 2024, indicate a confident outlook by the management on the company's growth trajectory and market demand. Biotech Industry Analyst Akoya Biosciences operates within the niche of spatial biology, a field that is gaining traction for its potential to revolutionize personalized medicine by allowing researchers to see how cells interact and organize in their natural context. The formation of a new Scientific Advisory Board with renowned experts like James Allison and Garry Nolan can be seen as a move to strengthen the company's scientific credibility and innovative edge.The licensing and distribution agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific could be a strategic move to leverage Thermo Fisher's extensive distribution network and amplify Akoya's market reach. The integration of ViewRNA technology with Akoya's platforms could enhance the company's product offering, potentially leading to new revenue opportunities in the rapidly growing multiomics market. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 2023 revenue $26.5 million and FY 2023 revenue $96.6 millionGuiding FY 2024 revenue range $114.0-118.0 million and operating cash flow breakeven by YE 2024 MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akoya Biosciences, Inc.

FIS Announces Pricing Terms of its Senior Note Tender Offers,2024-03-04T18:07:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) announces pricing terms for Offers to purchase senior notes totaling up to $2.25 billion.

The Offers cover 14 separate series of outstanding senior notes, with varying Total Consideration amounts based on maturity dates and reference securities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) regarding the pricing terms of its tender offer for certain outstanding senior notes is a strategic financial maneuver that may influence the company's debt structure and interest expense. The repurchase of debt, particularly when targeting notes with varying maturity dates and interest rates, can optimize the company's capital structure and potentially lead to interest cost savings.From a financial analysis perspective, the decision to buy back debt could be indicative of FIS's internal assessment that its notes are trading at a favorable price, or it could be a proactive step to manage the company's leverage and interest rate exposure. The tender offer's structure, with its tiered acceptance priority levels, suggests a calculated approach to debt management, prioritizing certain maturities and rates over others.For investors and stakeholders, this move could signal FIS's confidence in its liquidity and balance sheet strength. It's also critical to consider the implied interest rate trends and the potential impact on FIS's cost of capital. The fixed spreads over reference yields provide insight into the premium FIS is willing to pay over the risk-free rate, which in turn affects the overall attractiveness of the offer to debt holders. The timing and execution of such financial strategies are essential, especially in light of prevailing market interest rates and the company's future capital needs. Debt Market Analyst Examining the tender offer by FIS in the context of the broader debt market reveals several implications. The offered consideration for each note series reflects the current interest rate environment and the credit spread FIS commands in the market. The reference yields and fixed spreads above these yields are particularly noteworthy, as they provide a benchmark for evaluating the company's creditworthiness and the market's perception of its risk.Furthermore, the tender offer's impact on the secondary market for FIS's notes is a point of interest. A successful tender offer may lead to reduced liquidity for the affected note series, as a significant portion of these securities would be retired. This could potentially impact the pricing and trading dynamics for the remaining notes in circulation.For market participants, the tender offer details, such as the total consideration and acceptance priority levels, are critical for making informed decisions. The offer's structure could also influence the pricing strategy for FIS's future debt issuances, as current and potential investors will scrutinize the company's approach to managing its outstanding debt obligations. Economist The strategic use of tender offers as seen by FIS reflects broader economic principles, such as the cost of debt capital and the signaling effect to the market. By repurchasing its higher-interest or near-maturity debt, FIS may be attempting to reduce its future interest obligations, which is a prudent move in an environment where interest rates might rise, increasing the cost of borrowing.The company's decision to repurchase its debt could also be interpreted as a signal of its economic outlook and operational performance. A firm that buys back debt might be perceived as financially stable and expecting strong cash flows, which can be reassuring for investors, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.It is also important to consider the macroeconomic context, such as inflation rates, monetary policy and economic growth forecasts, as these factors can influence corporate finance decisions. The tender offer could be a response to these macroeconomic conditions, with FIS aiming to lock in lower interest rates before potential hikes or to adjust its debt profile in anticipation of changes in the economic cycle. 03/04/2024 - 01:07 PM JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fidelity National Information Services, FIS™, (NYSE: FIS), a global leader in financial services technology, today announced the pricing terms of its previously announced 14 separate offers (the “Offers”) to purchase for cash up to $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes of the series listed in the table below (collectively, the “Notes”).

Launches New RESPONSE Rib and Pelvic Fixation System for EOS Scoliosis Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary OrthoPediatrics Corp. announced the launch of the RESPONSE™ Rib and Pelvic Fixation system to treat children with Early Onset Scoliosis. This marks the company's 71st system for pediatric orthopedic conditions, providing implants and instruments for rib and pelvic fixation. The system offers a variety of implant options, low profile implants, rib hooks, and locking options. It is compatible with existing RESPONSE™ Systems, allowing comprehensive treatment for scoliosis patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Device Analyst The introduction of the RESPONSE™ Rib and Pelvic Fixation system by OrthoPediatrics marks a significant advancement in the pediatric orthopedics sector, particularly for the treatment of Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS). The system's compatibility with existing RESPONSE™ Scoliosis Systems suggests a strategic move to provide a comprehensive solution for varying degrees of scoliosis, potentially increasing the addressable market for the company's products. The modular nature of the system and its range of implant options align with current industry trends towards personalized medicine and could lead to improved patient outcomes.From a financial perspective, the launch could open up new revenue streams for OrthoPediatrics, given that EOS is a condition requiring specialized treatment. The company's focus on pediatric orthopedics, a niche yet critical area of healthcare, positions it to capture a larger share of this market segment. The diversification within its product portfolio may also mitigate risks associated with reliance on a limited number of systems. Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon The RESPONSE™ Rib and Pelvic Fixation system presents a technical innovation in the treatment of EOS, especially for those at risk of Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome. The inclusion of low profile implants and range of motion rib hooks suggests an emphasis on minimizing the physiological impact on young patients, which is a critical concern in pediatric surgery. Moreover, the locking options for implants could translate to enhanced stability and safety during the postoperative phase.As a surgeon, the system's interoperability with other RESPONSE™ Systems is particularly noteworthy. It allows for a tailored approach to scoliosis management across different severities and anatomical challenges. This could lead to reduced surgical times and potentially better surgical outcomes, which are key factors in patient care and resource management in healthcare facilities. Healthcare Industry Analyst OrthoPediatrics' foray into the EOS treatment market with the RESPONSE™ Rib and Pelvic Fixation system is poised to impact the competitive landscape of pediatric orthopedic devices. EOS represents a condition with specific clinical needs and the company's targeted approach could differentiate it from competitors that offer more generalized orthopedic solutions.The pediatric orthopedic device market is subject to stringent regulatory standards and the successful launch of a new system like this often hinges on clinical data supporting its efficacy and safety. As OrthoPededics continues to collaborate with pediatric orthopedic surgeons, it is likely to gain valuable insights that can inform future product development and potentially lead to a robust pipeline of innovative solutions for EOS and related conditions. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM WARSAW, Ind., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OrthoPediatrics Corp. (“OrthoPediatrics” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: KIDS a company focused exclusively on advancing the field of pediatric orthopedics, today announced it has launched a new RESPONSE™ Rib and Pelvic Fixation system to treat children with Early Onset Scoliosis (“EOS”).

Greg Odle, President of the OrthoPediatrics’ Scoliosis Division echoed his excitement for the launch of this new system, saying “We are excited to enter the Early Onset Scoliosis treatment market with the RESPONSE™ Rib & Pelvic System.

Scammers target vulnerable groups like seniors and small business owners, creating a sense of urgency to make immediate payments. 03/04/2024 - 01:00 PM National Consumer Protection Week Serves as a Great Reminder on How to Recognize and Avoid Potential Scams OAKLAND, Calif., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Scammers continue to take advantage of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) customers. In fact, in 2023, PG&E received nearly 43,000 reports from customers who were targeted by scammers impersonating the company, and customers lost approximately $875,000 in fraudulent payments, with the average customer losing $785. That's why PG&E joins the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to help customers recognize and avoid potential scams during National Consumer Protection Week from March 3-9, 2024. Reports of utility scams targeting customers were at an all-time high during 2023. Unfortunately, that number is likely just the tip of the iceberg for overall scam attempts, as many go unreported. The number of reports is continuing at a high level thus far in 2024, as PG&E received over 2,500 reports of attempted scams in January alone, with customers paying scammers over $67,000 during the month. ""Scammers will attempt to create a sense of urgency by threatening immediate disconnection of your utility services if you don't make immediate payment. Remember, PG&E will never ask you for financial information over the phone, nor will we ask for payment via pre-paid debit cards or money transfer services like Zelle. If you receive a call like this, hang up, and then either log onto PGE.com to confirm your account details, or you can call our customer service number,"" said Matt Foley, lead customer scam investigator for PG&E. Scammers are opportunistic and look for times when customers may be distracted or stressed and are constantly contacting utility customers asking for immediate payment to avoid service disconnection. As a reminder, PG&E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption, and we will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of cryptocurrency, or third-party digital payment mobile applications like Zelle or Venmo. Scammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams. Signs of a potential scam Threat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment for an alleged past due bill.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a prepaid card then call them back supposedly to make a bill payment.Request for prepaid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks the customer for the prepaid card's number, which grants the scammer instant access to the card's funds.Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a rebate.How customers can protect themselves Customers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person. If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill. Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts. Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. The numbers don't lead back to PG&E if called back, however, so if you have doubts, hang up and call PG&E at 1-833-500-SCAM. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911. Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information. For more information about scams, visit pge.com/scams or consumer.ftc.org.

(NASDAQ: EOSE) reported strong financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with revenue growth, improved gross margins, and cost control measures. The company's commercial opportunity pipeline increased significantly, with a positive 2024 outlook and plans for increased manufacturing volume. Positive Revenue for Q4 2023 totaled $6.6 million, a 148% increase year-over-year. Full-year revenue was $16.4 million, with a gross margin improvement of 41%. Operating expenses decreased by 10% in Q4 2023 and 7% for the full year. Cash balance as of December 31, 2023, was $69.5 million, excluding restricted cash. Commercial opportunity pipeline grew to $13 billion, with a $534.8 million orders backlog. 2024 revenue expected to range from $60 million to $90 million, with plans for a positive contribution margin in Q4 2024. Successful milestones achieved in automation and product launch, with plans for increased power density and international expansion. Partnerships with SABIC Specialties and TETRA Technologies to reduce costs and improve battery quality. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Eos Energy Enterprises detailing a significant year-over-year improvement in gross margins and a substantial increase in revenue for the fourth quarter reflects a positive trend in operational efficiency and market penetration. The transition to the Eos Z3 Cube and the semi-automated manufacturing line appears to have contributed to a more cost-effective production process, as evidenced by the 41% improvement in gross margins. This operational leverage is crucial for investors as it suggests the company's ability to scale profitably.Moreover, the 77% increase in the commercial opportunity pipeline and a 15% increase in order backlog indicate strong market demand and potential for future revenue growth. The expectation of a positive contribution margin by Q4 2024 aligns with the company's strategic focus on profitability. However, it is essential to monitor the execution of the state-of-the-art manufacturing line 1, as any delays could impact the projected financial outcomes. Investors should also consider the competitive landscape and the potential impact of macroeconomic factors on the company's performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Eos's focus on long-duration energy storage systems is timely, as there is a growing shift towards renewable energy integration and the need for stable grid operations. The company's strategic partnerships and expanded agreements, such as with SABIC Specialties and TETRA Technologies, are poised to enhance its supply chain and reduce costs, which could strengthen its market position.The international momentum mentioned, with shipments to Italy and renewable goals in key markets, suggests that Eos is expanding its global footprint. This international diversification could mitigate risks associated with domestic policy changes or market saturation. The energy storage industry is becoming increasingly competitive and Eos's ability to deliver a differentiated product with a focus on safety and efficiency could provide a competitive edge. Stakeholders should assess the company's innovation capabilities and the scalability of its technology in the context of global energy storage demand. Energy Sector Analyst Eos Energy Enterprises' advancements in zinc-based energy storage technology represent a significant development in the energy sector. Zinc batteries are considered safer and more environmentally friendly compared to lithium-ion counterparts and improvements in power density up to 695 kWh for longer duration applications enhance the viability of Eos's products in the market.The company's focus on cost reduction through design simplification and improved manufacturing processes is essential for long-term sustainability in the energy storage market. The reduction in cycle times and scrap rates indicates operational excellence, which is critical for maintaining competitiveness. Additionally, the company's alignment with macro-level regulations and the push for American-made energy storage solutions could benefit from current geopolitical and supply chain concerns. 03/04/2024 - 04:01 PM Full-year gross margins improved by 41% year over yearEDISON, N.J., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (""Eos"" or the “Company”), a leading provider of safe, scalable, efficient, and sustainable zinc-based long duration energy storage systems, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and announced 2024 outlook. Fourth Quarter Highlights Revenue totaled $6.6 million, a 148% increase compared to prior year, as the Company fully transitioned production to the Eos Z3TM Cube on its semi-automated manufacturing line.Cost of Goods Sold totaled $30.4 million, a 66% gross margin improvement compared to prior year resulting from the Eos Z3 battery’s simple design that utilizes low-cost raw materials combined with a streamlined manufacturing process.Operating expenses totaled $18.5 million; a 10% reduction compared to Q4 2022. Cash balance of $69.5 million (excluding restricted cash) as of December 31, 2023. Commercial opportunity pipeline of $13 billion, a 77% increase compared to prior year with a $534.8 million orders backlog as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 15% compared to December 31, 2022. Full Year Highlights Revenue totaled $16.4 million, compared to $17.9 million in the prior year as the company launched the Eos Z3 Cube that has current cycle times of less than 3-minutes, down 70% since product launch, with scrap rates running below 3%. Costs of Goods Sold was $89.8 million, a $63.5 million decrease compared to prior year, a 41% gross margin improvement driven by lower raw material input costs combined with initial Z3 program benefits.Operating expenses of $79.5M, a 7% decrease compared to prior year, primarily driven by tighter cost control measures. Eos Chief Executive Officer Joe Mastrangelo said, “Eos transitioned its entire manufacturing capacity from Gen 2.3 to the new Eos Z3 Cube. We’ve already begun seeing the anticipated operational benefits associated with the Z3 battery design that provides improved power density along with lower unit costs from its simpler mechanical design.” Mastrangelo concluded, “We remain focused on executing the path to profitability outlined in our December 12 strategic outlook call that includes bringing into service the state-of-the-art (SotA) manufacturing line 1. I’m pleased to report that the timeline for expanding affordable American made battery storage capacity remains unchanged. There continues to be strong demand signals for longer duration energy storage, and we’re excited to work with our customers to fulfill this growing need with a safe, secure and differentiated alternative.” 2024 Outlook For full year 2024, the Company expects to recognize $60 million to $90 million in revenue as state-of-the-art (SotA) line 1 is expected to begin initial commercial production in Q2 2024. The Company then plans to increase manufacturing volume throughout 2024 that aligns production with customer requirements as well as the planned realization of its cost-out roadmap.The Company forecasts positive contribution margin in Q4 2024 as multiple cost reduction actions are implemented throughout the year. Contribution margin is defined as sales price less direct labor and direct materials and includes the benefit of the production tax credits. The cost out program should deliver initial benefits in late Q1 2024, with majority of the benefits being achieved in Q4 2024 as the Company ramps up production volume. Recent Business Highlights Project AMAZEAt the end of January, the Company’s automation partner, ACRO Automation, fully powered on the core Eos Z3 battery assembly and finishing operations on SotA line 1. Achieving this milestone begins system integration, implementing final controls logic and full mechanical completion followed by the automation system debugging to prepare for Factory Acceptance Testing in Wisconsin. The Company is currently on schedule for full SotA line 1 commissioning in Turtle Creek during Q2 2024. Eos Z3 Product LaunchIn mid-February, the Company produced the 100th Eos Z3 Cube which took less than 5 months compared to Gen 2.3 where over one and a half years were required to produce the first 100 units. Since the Z3 launch in September, the Company has reduced Eos Z3 battery cycle times from an average of 10 minutes at launch to 3 minutes, with scrap rates below 3%. The Company will continue manufacturing on its semi-automated manufacturing line until SotA line 1 is commissioned. The 2024 revenue assumptions tie factory output with customer delivery requirements and the Company’s cost-out roadmap to minimize working capital requirements. Path to ProfitabilityDuring the first quarter, the Company entered a multiyear agreement with SABIC Specialties’ US business unit to supply conductive composite thermoplastic for the Eos Z3 battery module while also expanding its partnership with TETRA Technologies. TETRA is designated as Eos’s preferred strategic electrolyte supplier for the Eos Z3 Cube. These expanded partnerships position Eos to better achieve scale, reduce costs per battery, and improve overall quality and performance as the Company progresses on its cost-out roadmap with initial savings to be realized in late Q1 2024. As of Q4 2023, the Company achieved nearly 30% product cost out, which is more than 35% of the Z3 cost reduction goal stated on the December 12 strategic outlook call. The Company expects the Eos Z3 Cube to achieve a power density up to 695 kWh for longer duration applications by the end of Q1 2024 with planned increases to deliver 800 kWh by the end of 2024. Commercial OutlookThe Company continues to build a strong foundation both domestically and internationally, with its commercial opportunity pipeline increasing to $13 billion as of Q4 2023. There are 1.9 GWh in late-stage opportunities, including a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Pine Gate Renewables to expand the existing partnership with closing anticipated by the end of Q1 2024. Recent macro-level regulations continue to drive a shift toward longer duration discharges combined with the need for safe, secure American made energy storage solutions. In addition, the Company is seeing increased international momentum as three key markets recently communicated renewable goals for the next decade. Most recently, an Eos Z3 Cube was shipped to Sicily, Italy to test a diverse set of potential use cases that is expected to provide further opportunities for international growth.

Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and, except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Key Metrics Backlog. Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure for backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company. Pipeline. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects. Booked Orders. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”) or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.

Positive outlook for Q1 and Fiscal Year 2025 with revenue projections and non-GAAP operating income expectations. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of 33% year-over-year for GitLab Inc.'s fiscal fourth quarter is a strong indicator of the company's expanding market presence, particularly in the DevSecOps sector. This performance is noteworthy, especially when considering the broader economic context where many tech companies are facing headwinds. The non-GAAP operating margin expansion signifies improved operational efficiency, which is a positive signal to investors about the company's ability to manage costs while scaling up.However, the reported GAAP net loss highlights the ongoing investments and expenditures that exceed current revenues. This is not uncommon for growth-stage tech companies, but it warrants close monitoring as it could impact long-term financial sustainability. The breakeven cash flow achieved a year ahead of schedule is a significant milestone, demonstrating fiscal discipline and a potential shift towards profitability.The forward-looking guidance suggests a cautious but continued growth trajectory. The projected revenue for the next fiscal year indicates confidence in the company's product offerings and market strategy. Yet, the anticipated non-GAAP operating income (loss) range suggests there may still be challenges ahead in achieving consistent profitability. Market Research Analyst GitLab's customer base growth, with a 23% increase in customers with more than $5,000 of ARR, reflects a broadening appeal and adoption of its DevSecOps platform across different market segments. The impressive 52% increase in customers with more than $1M of ARR underscores the platform's scalability and the value perceived by large enterprise clients.The Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate of 130% is a critical metric, as it indicates not only customer retention but also the ability to upsell existing customers, which is a testament to the platform’s value proposition. The growth in Total RPO (Remaining Performance Obligations) and cRPO (Current Remaining Performance Obligations) by 55% and 40% respectively, also points to a strong sales pipeline and future revenue visibility.These customer metrics are crucial for investors, as they provide insights into the company's market penetration and potential for future revenue streams. The continued investment in product areas, as evidenced by the launch of new features and the appointment of a new CTO, suggests an ongoing commitment to innovation, which is vital for maintaining competitive advantage in the fast-evolving DevSecOps space. Technology Industry Analyst The integration of AI throughout the software development lifecycle is a strategic move by GitLab that aligns with industry trends toward automation and efficiency. The release of Remote Development workspaces into general availability reflects an understanding of the needs of modern development teams for consistent, reproducible environments, which can lead to faster project initiation and reduced time to market for software products.GitLab's launch of new products like GitLab Duo Pro and an Enterprise Agile Planning SKU indicates a targeted approach to both deepen engagement with existing customers and attract new ones by offering specialized tools that address specific pain points. These moves are likely to resonate well with the developer community and could enhance GitLab's competitive positioning.The company's recognition in industry awards for AI/ML solutions and DevSecOps reinforces its reputation as a leader in these domains, which could positively influence customer perceptions and contribute to future sales growth. The appointment of a former Google VP as CTO may bring new perspectives and drive technological advancements, further strengthening GitLab's market position. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM Quarterly revenue of $163.8 million, up 33% year-over-year Fiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights: Total revenue of $163.8 millionGAAP operating margin of (21)%; Non-GAAP operating margin of 8%GAAP net loss per share of $(0.23); Non-GAAP net income per share of $0.15 Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights: Total revenue of $579.9 millionGAAP operating margin of (32)%; Non-GAAP operating margin of (0.2)%GAAP net loss per share of $(2.75); Non-GAAP net income per share of $0.20 SAN FRANCISCO, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- All-Remote - GitLab Inc.

We believe this puts us in a strong position to continue to win the large market opportunity in front of us.” “In Q4, revenue grew 33% year-over-year, and we delivered over 1,900 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion year-over-year, demonstrating continued business momentum driven by our commitment to deliver value to customers with our market-leading DevSecOps platform,” said Brian Robins, GitLab chief financial officer. “I’m pleased to share that with consistent execution across the business in FY24 we delivered breakeven cash flow a year ahead of our commitment and recorded our second consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating profit while continuing to invest in key product areas.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. We have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP financial guidance measures because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance for operating income (loss) and net income (loss) per share to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available. Conference Call Information GitLab will host a conference call today, March 4, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. (PT) / 4:30 p.m. (ET) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 financial results. Investors and analysts should register for the call in advance by visiting https://gitlab.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ZHG1dzEdTSG_dNGnPWmWOw#/registration. A replay of the call will be available on GitLab’s investor relations website (ir.gitlab.com). About GitLab GitLab is the most comprehensive DevSecOps Platform that empowers organizations to maximize the overall return on software development by delivering software faster and efficiently, while strengthening security and compliance. GitLab’s single application is easier to use, leads to faster cycle time and allows visibility throughout and control over all stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle. With GitLab, every team in your organization can collaboratively plan, build, secure, and deploy software to drive business outcomes faster with complete transparency, consistency and traceability. Non-GAAP Financial Measures GitLab believes non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance. GitLab uses this supplemental information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. GitLab believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with its GAAP financial information, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data. We define non-GAAP financial measures as GAAP measures, excluding certain items such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, foreign exchange (gain) loss, gain from a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, equity method investment loss and impairment, changes in the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration, charitable donation of common stock, restructuring charges, a non-recurring income tax adjustment related to bilateral advance pricing agreement (“BAPA”) negotiations, and other expenses that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. Shares used for net income per share on a non-GAAP basis include incremental dilutive shares related to restricted stock units, options, and shares issuable under GitLab Inc.’s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that are anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments in property and equipment and any non-recurring income tax payments related to BAPA, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, and strengthening our financial position. One limitation of free cash flow is that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments. Additionally, free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period.

Operating Metrics Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”): We define annual recurring revenue as the annual run-rate revenue of subscription agreements, including our self-managed and SaaS offerings but excluding professional services, from all customers as measured on the last day of a given month. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating, for all customers during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts of subscriptions, including our self-managed license, self-managed subscription, and SaaS subscription offerings but excluding professional services. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate: We calculate Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with our customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, price adjustments, user growth within a customer, contraction, and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate.

MSCI upgrades VEON to 'AA' ESG Rating,2024-03-04T18:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"VEON's ESG rating upgraded to 'AA' by MSCI, placing the company in the 'Leaders' category among telecommunication services companies. The upgrade reflects VEON's commitment to sustainable and ethical business operations, with a focus on employee engagement, data security, and corporate governance.","MSCI upgrades VEON to 'AA' ESG Rating Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary VEON's ESG rating upgraded to 'AA' by MSCI, placing the company in the 'Leaders' category among telecommunication services companies. The upgrade reflects VEON's commitment to sustainable and ethical business operations, with a focus on employee engagement, data security, and corporate governance. Positive None. Negative None. ESG Analyst An upgrade in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating of a company such as VEON by MSCI is a significant event for investors who prioritize sustainable and ethical investment opportunities. The elevation to an 'AA' rating from 'A' reflects VEON's commitment to improving its ESG practices, which can have several implications for the business and its stakeholders.From an ESG perspective, such a rating upgrade typically indicates better risk management and a more sustainable long-term strategy. Companies with high ESG ratings may have access to cheaper capital, as they are often seen as lower risk by investors. Moreover, they might attract a broader investor base, especially with the increasing interest in socially responsible investing. This could potentially lead to a more stable shareholder base and could also provide some insulation against market volatility.VEON's above-average score in labor management suggests that it could benefit from higher employee engagement and satisfaction, which can translate into better productivity and innovation. The focus on good corporate governance, highlighted by an independent Board of Directors, is another positive signal to investors, indicating robust checks and balances which can prevent corporate malfeasance and protect shareholder interests. Telecommunications Industry Analyst VEON's position as a 'Leader' in the telecommunications sector, according to MSCI's ESG rating, highlights the company's competitive edge in a rapidly evolving industry. The telecommunications industry is increasingly scrutinized for its ESG practices, given its significant environmental footprint and the critical nature of data security for consumers.VEON's adherence to recognized data security standards and its practices in end user data management are crucial, as data breaches or misuse can lead to significant reputational and financial damage. The company's exit from Russia, as noted by MSCI, may also be seen as a move to mitigate geopolitical and ethical risks, which can be particularly relevant for global telecommunications companies operating in diverse political landscapes.The emphasis on digital inclusion through the '4G for all' initiative could foster increased market penetration and user loyalty, which are important factors for growth in the telecommunications sector. Such initiatives can also help in achieving financial inclusion, especially in the emerging markets where VEON operates, potentially leading to long-term customer retention and revenue growth. Market Research Analyst VEON's upgraded ESG rating and strategic focus on sustainability may positively influence consumer perception and brand value, especially among the increasingly socially-conscious consumer base. This could lead to a stronger market position and potentially higher market share as consumers and businesses alike prefer to associate with companies that demonstrate ethical practices and corporate responsibility.Investor sentiment can also be impacted by such ESG upgrades, as it may signal improved management quality and operational efficiency. In the long term, VEON's dedication to ESG principles could result in enhanced competitiveness and resilience, which are key drivers of shareholder value. However, it is important to monitor whether these improvements will translate into tangible financial performance and whether VEON can sustain its ESG leadership in a dynamic industry. 03/04/2024 - 01:00 PM Amsterdam, 4 March 2024: VEON (NASDAQ: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services, announces that, MSCI has raised the Company’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating to 'AA' from 'A'. This upgrade positions VEON within the ‘Leaders’ category amongst the 131 telecommunication services companies evaluated by MSCI, demonstrating our commitment to sustainable and ethical business operations. “Our 'AA' rating from MSCI demonstrates VEON’s success in integrating and implementing a strategy aimed at making a positive societal impact, ensuring ethical governance and contributing to environmental stewardship. This upgrade and our position in the ‘Leaders’ category for our industry reflects VEON's persistent efforts to incorporate sustainable and responsible ESG practices across our operations, raising the bar consistently and with dedication. “I am particularly pleased to see that VEON has scored above the industry average for labour management, with MSCI noting our focus on employee engagement and satisfaction. The ESG rating agency also named VEON’s exit from Russia as a factor contributing to the rating upgrade. MSCI also noted VEON’s good practices in end user data management, noting that our data security framework is on par with industry peers and features certification to widely recognized data security standards. “Finally, corporate governance is another area where VEON excelled in comparison to our peers, according to MSCI, with a majority independent Board of Directors. This Board makeup reflects not only globally accepted good practices, but also the fact that VEON has no controlling or majority shareholder,” said Kaan Terzioglu, VEON Group CEO. VEON’s focus on “4G for all” and digital services resulted in significant improvements in digital and financial inclusion in the 6 markets where our Group companies operate: Pakistan, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Our digital operators amplify their positive social and environmental impact, prioritizing inclusive workplace practices and broader initiatives that drive diversity and inclusion, as well as supporting environmental sustainability.

FanDuel Becomes an Official Sports Betting Partner of Carolina Panthers Ahead of Upcoming North Carolina Launch,2024-03-04T18:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"FanDuel partners with the Carolina Panthers to launch mobile sports betting in North Carolina, engaging sports fans with exclusive events and digital content.","FanDuel Becomes an Official Sports Betting Partner of Carolina Panthers Ahead of Upcoming North Carolina Launch Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FanDuel partners with the Carolina Panthers to launch mobile sports betting in North Carolina, engaging sports fans with exclusive events and digital content. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The alliance between FanDuel and the Carolina Panthers is a strategic move that taps into the burgeoning market for sports betting, which has been gaining momentum since the Supreme Court's 2018 decision to overturn the federal ban on sports wagering. This partnership is poised to leverage the Panthers' brand and fan engagement to drive FanDuel's user base growth, particularly with the imminent launch of mobile sports betting in North Carolina.From a market research perspective, the timing of this partnership is crucial. It coincides with the state's opening of the sports betting market, which is expected to see a surge in user registration and activity. By aligning with a popular NFL team, FanDuel aims to capture a significant share of the market early on. The use of team marks and collaborative content creation can enhance brand visibility and loyalty, potentially translating into higher revenues for FanDuel and increased fan engagement for the Panthers.However, the impact on FanDuel's market share and financial performance will depend on how effectively they can convert pre-registrations into active users and how well they can maintain user engagement throughout the sports season. Additionally, the competitive response from other betting platforms and regulatory developments will be key factors to monitor. Financial Analyst The partnership announcement is likely to have positive implications for FanDuel's financial outlook, as sports betting partnerships with major sports franchises have historically led to increased user acquisition and retention. The direct access to the Panthers' fanbase provides a channel for FanDuel to market its platform, potentially leading to a higher customer lifetime value (CLV) and reduced customer acquisition costs (CAC).Investors will be keen on observing FanDuel's quarterly financial reports following the launch of mobile sports betting in North Carolina to assess the impact on revenue and profit margins. The partnership could be a significant driver for growth in the short-term, especially as FanDuel leverages exclusive events and digital content to attract and retain users.Long-term benefits hinge on sustained user engagement and the ability to navigate the regulatory environment, which can be volatile in the gaming industry. The partnership's success will also depend on the company's ability to innovate and offer competitive odds and betting experiences in a market where consumers have multiple options. Legal Expert The legal landscape of sports betting in the United States has been rapidly evolving since the Supreme Court's ruling in 2018. Each state has the autonomy to regulate sports betting within its borders, which has led to a patchwork of regulations. North Carolina's decision to launch mobile sports betting creates a new frontier for companies like FanDuel.It is critical for FanDuel to adhere to state-specific regulations and ensure responsible gambling practices are in place. The partnership with the Carolina Panthers must operate within the legal frameworks established by North Carolina, which will govern promotional activities, the use of digital signage and the conduct of exclusive events.Legal compliance is not only a requirement but also a strategic advantage. Companies that navigate the regulatory environment effectively can secure a more stable and long-term presence in the market. Non-compliance, on the other hand, can lead to fines, reputational damage and even the revocation of operating licenses, which would have severe financial ramifications. 03/04/2024 - 01:00 PM Sports fans in North Carolina can now pre-register on the FanDuel Sportsbook app NEW YORK, March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FanDuel, North America's premier online gaming company, today announced a new multi-year partnership with the Carolina Panthers as an Official Sports Betting Partner.

The company anticipates breakout growth in 2024 with regulatory submissions made for proprietary ablation catheter, testing of smaller robot, and upcoming commercial launches. However, revenue growth faced challenges due to product dependencies, impacting system revenue. Despite this, Stereotaxis maintains a strong balance sheet to support its product ecosystem and aims for profitability in the future. Positive None. Negative Revenue growth remained challenging in 2023 due to the loss of royalties and recurring shortages of catheters from partners. System revenue was weaker than expected in Q4 2023 due to delays in hospital construction schedules. Full year gross margins were 56% of revenue, with system gross margins at 8% reflecting significant overhead allocations. Operating loss and net loss increased in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year. Negative free cash flow for the full year 2023 was ($9.1) million. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Stereotaxis indicate a mixed performance. A key indicator of concern is the year-over-year decrease in total revenue from $28.1 million in 2022 to $26.8 million in 2023. This decline is primarily attributed to the loss of catheter royalties and production shortages from their partner, which has negatively impacted recurring revenue streams. Despite this, the company has seen an increase in system revenue, suggesting an uptick in product adoption. However, with system revenue being described as 'lumpy', investors should be cautious about the predictability of this income stream.From a profitability perspective, the company's gross margin remains relatively high, particularly in recurring revenue, which is typically a positive sign for potential long-term profitability. However, the reported operating and net losses for both the quarter and full year, alongside negative free cash flow, raise concerns about the company's current expense management and the timeline to profitability. The strong balance sheet with $20.6 million in cash and no debt provides some cushion and strategic flexibility, yet the increased losses year-over-year highlight the need for a critical assessment of future cash burn rates and funding requirements. Market Research Analyst Examining Stereotaxis' strategic initiatives, there is potential for significant market impact. The company's regulatory submissions in Europe and the United States for their proprietary robotically-navigated ablation catheter, if approved, could open up new market opportunities and catalyze growth. The anticipation of European regulatory clearance and FDA clearance for their smaller, highly-accessible robot could enhance the company's competitive edge in the surgical robotics market. Additionally, the planned commercial launches of a new guidewire, a product ecosystem in China and a digital surgery solution indicate Stereotaxis' commitment to innovation and expansion.However, the market response to these launches will be critical to monitor, as the company's revenue growth has been challenged despite these strategic efforts. The acknowledgment of key product dependencies and the importance of securing a stable supply chain for robotic catheters are crucial factors that could influence future market performance and customer confidence. Medical Technology Analyst From a technological standpoint, Stereotaxis' focus on innovation within the medical robotics field is noteworthy. The development of a robotically-navigated ablation catheter and a more accessible robotic system could represent significant advancements in minimally invasive endovascular intervention. These technologies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes and operational efficiencies within healthcare settings.However, the success of these innovations hinges on regulatory approvals and subsequent market adoption. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and effectively commercialize its product ecosystem will be determining factors in its long-term success. Additionally, the mention of a digital surgery solution suggests a move towards integrating robotics with digital health platforms, which could be transformative for the industry but also requires careful execution to ensure market readiness and compatibility with existing healthcare infrastructures. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM ST. LOUIS, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stereotaxis (NYSE: STXS), a pioneer and global leader in surgical robotics for minimally invasive endovascular intervention, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “We enter 2024 having made significant progress in realizing our strategic transformation. This is the year in which we expect all the key puzzle pieces to come together, setting us up for breakout growth to follow,” said David Fischel, Chairman and CEO. “Our innovation strategy has a strong foundation, and we are pleased with where we stand. Regulatory submissions for our proprietary robotically-navigated ablation catheter have been made in both Europe and the United States, following stellar results from initial clinical use. We have begun formal testing of our smaller highly-accessible robot, and anticipate achieving European regulatory clearance mid-year followed by FDA clearance in the second half of the year. We also expect commercial launches later this year of a guidewire that expands our technology into several new indications, a comprehensive product ecosystem in China, and a digital surgery solution enabling broad operating room connectivity. These innovations collectively serve as a foundational product ecosystem for a high-growth medical robotics company poised to transform endovascular surgery. They are transformational as they structurally improve our clinical, commercial, financial, and strategic foundation.” “Revenue growth amidst this transition has remained challenging. Revenue in 2023 was pressured by the loss of royalties and recurring shortages of catheters from our partner, highlighting the importance of overcoming key product dependencies. These headwinds counteracted growth in robotic system revenue for the year. System revenue remains lumpy, but we continue to benefit from a significant backlog and pipeline of orders. We were pleased in the fourth quarter to receive our first greenfield robotic system order from Germany in over a decade, and we anticipate continued growth in orders and system revenue as it becomes clear to physicians and hospitals that the supply of robotic catheters is secure.” “We retain a strong balance sheet which allows us to bring our transformative product ecosystem to market, fund its commercialization, and reach profitability. We have multiple shots on goal for breakout growth in 2025.” 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial ResultsRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $4.6 million, compared to $7.3 million in the prior year fourth quarter. System revenue of $0.1 million and recurring revenue of $4.5 million, compared to $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in the prior year fourth quarter. System revenue was weaker than expected due to delays in hospital construction schedules but does not reflect our normalized expectation. Recurring revenue was in line with recent quarters. Revenue for the full year 2023 totaled $26.8 million compared to $28.1 million in 2022. Full year system revenue was $8.7 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year, reflecting increased system deliveries. We started 2024 with system backlog of $14.7 million. Full year recurring revenue was $18.0 million compared to $21.3 million, reflecting the absence of catheter royalties received in the prior year and recurring catheter production shortages by our partner. Gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were approximately 60% and 56% of revenue, respectively. Full year gross margins were 79% for recurring revenue and 8% for system revenue. System gross margins reflect significant allocations of overhead and other direct expenses. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $8.0 million. Excluding $2.6 million in non-cash stock compensation expense, adjusted operating expenses in the current quarter were $5.4 million, down from the prior year adjusted operating expenses of $6.2 million. Adjusted operating expenses for the full year 2023 were $26.2 million, compared to $26.8 million in the prior year. Operating loss and net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 were ($5.3) million and ($5.0) million, respectively, compared to ($4.5) million and ($4.2) million in the previous year. Adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss for the quarter, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, were ($2.7) million, and ($2.4) million, respectively, compared to ($1.9) million and ($1.6) million in the previous year. For the full year 2023, adjusted operating loss of ($11.3) million and adjusted net loss of ($10.2) million compared to an adjusted operating loss of ($8.3) million and an adjusted net loss of ($7.8) million in the prior year.

Cash Balance and LiquidityAt December 31, 2023, Stereotaxis had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $20.6 million and no debt. Forward Looking ExpectationsStereotaxis anticipates double digit revenue growth for the full year 2024 driven by revenue recognition of system backlog and new system orders. Cognizant of the volatility in quarterly revenue and challenge in reliably anticipating revenue in any specific quarter, Stereotaxis is providing specific revenue guidance only for the first quarter of 2024 of approximately $7.0 million. Stereotaxis’ balance sheet allows it to advance its transformative product ecosystem to market, fund its commercialization, and reach profitability without the need for additional financing.

(SDHC) will participate in the Wolfe Research Housing Conference on March 5, 2024, in New York, NY. The company reported positive net new orders, home closings, and backlog growth compared to the same period last year. Positive Positive net new orders, home closings, and backlog growth Participation in Wolfe Research Housing Conference Executive Vice President hosting one-on-one meetings with institutional investors Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported growth in net new orders and home closings by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. reflects a positive trend in the housing industry. An increase of 13.9% in net new orders and 18.0% in home closings indicates robust demand and operational efficiency. This performance can be attributed to various factors such as market positioning, product offerings and effective sales strategies. Investors and stakeholders should note that the company's ability to convert orders into closings efficiently may signal strong revenue recognition in the upcoming quarters.The 16.3% increase in backlog provides visibility into future revenues and suggests that the company has a healthy pipeline of work. However, it is important to monitor whether this backlog aligns with the company's capacity to deliver, as an excessive backlog could lead to delays and potential customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, the backlog figure is a critical indicator of the company's financial health, as it may impact cash flow projections and investment in growth opportunities. Financial Analyst Smith Douglas Homes Corp.'s financial performance, as indicated by the uptick in orders and closings, is likely to have a positive impact on its stock valuation. The growth rates surpassing those of the previous year demonstrate a strong year-over-year performance that may exceed industry averages. This can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially higher share prices. The reported figures also suggest that the company is effectively capitalizing on market opportunities, which can be a sign of competitive strength.Investors should consider the implications of these results on the company's earnings per share (EPS) and whether the increased operational activity aligns with profitability margins. It is crucial to assess the cost structure and any potential increases in expenses that could offset revenue gains. Furthermore, given the cyclical nature of the housing market, it is vital to evaluate these results within the context of economic indicators and housing market trends. Economist The data presented by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. can be indicative of broader economic trends. An uptick in housing orders and closings typically correlates with consumer confidence and a strong labor market, as individuals are more likely to invest in new homes when they feel financially secure. The significant backlog suggests that the housing demand exceeds supply, which can contribute to upward pressure on prices and could potentially influence inflationary trends.It is also essential to analyze these results in the context of interest rate movements and monetary policy, as these factors directly impact mortgage rates and housing affordability. A sustained increase in housing activity can stimulate related industries such as construction, home improvement and real estate services, thereby contributing to broader economic growth. However, stakeholders should be mindful of potential risks such as market saturation, changes in consumer preferences and regulatory developments that could affect future performance. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smith Douglas Homes Corp.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported monthly volumes by Nasdaq provide a snapshot of trading activity which can be a barometer for investor sentiment and market liquidity. Increased trading volumes typically suggest a higher level of investor engagement and can correlate with market volatility. Conversely, lower volumes may indicate a lack of investor confidence or interest.For stakeholders, the short-term implications of these volume statistics can include changes in transaction fee revenues for Nasdaq, as they earn more when trade volumes are high. Long-term implications might involve strategic decisions by Nasdaq to attract more listings or enhance trading technologies to maintain or increase market share.Comparing these volumes against historical trends and competitor exchanges can yield insights into Nasdaq's performance in the broader exchange landscape. Any significant deviations from expected volume patterns could signal shifts in market dynamics or trader behaviors. Financial Analyst The monthly volume data is a critical metric for investors as it influences the liquidity and, consequently, the bid-ask spread of securities. Highly liquid markets allow for more efficient price discovery and lower transaction costs, which can attract institutional investors and can be positive for the stock market.Analyzing the volume data in the context of current economic conditions, such as interest rate changes or geopolitical events, can help investors understand the potential impact on market sectors and individual stock performances. It is also essential to consider the revenue implications for Nasdaq, as trading volumes directly affect its transaction-based revenues.Investors should also be aware of the seasonality in trading volumes, as certain months may naturally experience higher or lower activity. Any anomalies in this pattern could warrant a closer examination of underlying causes. 03/04/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported monthly volumes for February 2024 on its investor relations website.

The program aims to develop semiconductor talent and expand opportunities in the industry.","Wolfspeed Launches New York Semiconductor Registered Apprenticeship Program with Support from the National Institute of Innovation and Technology Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Wolfspeed signs its first apprentice for the Registered Apprenticeship Program in Mohawk Valley Fab, supported by the National Institute for Innovation and Technology and the USDOL. The program aims to develop semiconductor talent and expand opportunities in the industry. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The establishment of Wolfspeed's Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP) in collaboration with the National Institute for Innovation and Technology and the USDOL is a strategic move to address the talent gap in the semiconductor industry. This initiative is crucial as the industry faces a shortage of skilled workers, which can hamper production capabilities and growth prospects. The program's design, which integrates on-the-job training with college instruction, is aligned with the best practices in workforce development, offering a 'learn-and-earn' approach. This is beneficial for Wolfspeed in terms of reducing recruitment costs and enhancing employee retention by investing in workforce training and development.By focusing on local talent development through partnerships with regional entities like MACNY and MVCC, Wolfspeed is also contributing to regional economic development. This could potentially create a competitive advantage for Wolfspeed, as a skilled and dedicated local workforce can lead to increased productivity and innovation. Moreover, the program's emphasis on scalability and extension across the U.S. indicates Wolfspeed's commitment to national workforce development, which could influence investor perception positively by highlighting the company's long-term strategic vision and its alignment with national interests in securing semiconductor supply chains. Financial Analyst Wolfspeed's investment in its workforce through the RAP could have financial implications that resonate with investors and stakeholders. The program is likely to enhance Wolfspeed's operational efficiency over time by cultivating a pipeline of well-trained technicians who are familiar with the company's culture and processes. This could lead to reduced downtime and improved yield, which are critical performance metrics in the semiconductor industry. The financial benefits may not be immediate but can manifest as reduced training and hiring costs, lower turnover rates and higher productivity in the medium to long term.Furthermore, the partnership with the National Institute for Innovation and Technology and the support from the USDOL may also provide Wolfspeed with access to federal resources and potential subsidies, which can offset the costs of the program. Investors should monitor the program's progress and its impact on Wolfspeed's financials, particularly as the company works towards capacity expansion goals at its Mohawk Valley Fab, which is a significant factor in future revenue growth and market share expansion. Economic Development Expert The RAP's potential impact on the broader economy and labor market should not be underestimated. By providing structured pathways for career advancement in the high-tech sector, Wolfspeed is contributing to the upskilling of the American workforce. This is likely to have a ripple effect, creating more high-quality jobs and potentially stimulating local economies, especially in the Mohawk Valley region. The emphasis on STEM education and the semiconductor industry as a career destination could inspire other companies to follow suit, leading to a more robust and competitive domestic industry. Such initiatives are aligned with national policies aimed at bolstering the U.S. semiconductor industry against global competition and supply chain vulnerabilities.The collaboration with educational institutions like MVCC also underscores the importance of industry-academia partnerships in addressing the skills gap. This can lead to the development of specialized curriculums that are directly relevant to industry needs, thus enhancing the employability of graduates. In the long run, these efforts can contribute to the nation's economic resilience and technological leadership, which are key factors in maintaining a competitive edge in the global market. 03/04/2024 - 12:47 PM Wolfspeed signs first apprentice for Registered Apprenticeship Program to support workforce development for its Mohawk Valley Fab HANOVER, Md., March 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today the National Institute for Innovation and Technology and the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) applauded U.S. semiconductor manufacturing company Wolfspeed for the establishment of its New York Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP). As the nation's leader in semiconductor talent pipeline development, the Institute serves as the USDOL's national Intermediary responsible for expanding Registered Apprenticeships (RAs) throughout the semiconductor and nanotechnology industry supply chains. Facilitated by the Manufacturers Association of Central New York (MACNY) through the Institute's Growing Apprenticeships in Nanotechnology and Semiconductor (GAINS) program, Wolfspeed's program will provide opportunities for workers that are looking to expand their skills and build a career in the semiconductor and advanced manufacturing industry. ""We commend Wolfspeed for championing domestic semiconductor manufacturing with the establishment of its Registered Apprenticeship at their Mohawk Valley Fab,"" stated Mike Russo, President and CEO of the Institute. ""As the USDOL Intermediary dedicated to expanding Registered Apprenticeships throughout the semiconductor and nanotechnology-related supply chains, we're thrilled to offer technical support and subject-matter expertise to Wolfspeed through our GAINS program. Registered Apprenticeships provide individuals from all backgrounds with the chance to obtain high-quality jobs and vital skills through a learn-and-earn framework, presenting a significant opportunity for Americans exploring career and educational pathways."" The GAINS Program equips individuals in Wolfspeed's RAP with crucial skills for career advancement. Employers and apprentices alike benefit from the Institute's resources, including the National Talent Hub – an interactive online platform facilitating skills assessments, educational and career planning, professional development support, training progress tracking, and program administration assistance. These initiatives align curriculum, cultivate regional talent pipelines and foster a dynamic workforce. ""Our GAINS program is scalable and extends to all participating employers' sites across the U.S. However, we work closely with regional partners to implement our program effectively. In New York specifically, I'd like to thank Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC) for providing the Required Technical Instruction for the program and to MACNY for serving as a group sponsor,"" stated Martha Ponge, National Apprenticeship Director at the Institute. Earlier this month, Wolfspeed celebrated the official signing of Aaron Albright as the first apprentice in the Mohawk Valley program. Albright has been with Wolfspeed for the past 18 months, initially starting on the materials handling team before advancing to the manufacturing technician team. In January 2024, he transitioned into his current role as an Equipment Apprentice. Albright and future Wolfspeed apprentices will complete a 16-month program for placement in the company's Equipment Technician career pathway in an Industrial Manufacturing Technician role. The RAP involves 2,700 hours of on-the-job training and 216 hours of college instruction provided by MVCC. ""At Wolfspeed, we are committed to making the next generation aware of the incredible career opportunities in the semiconductor industry and broader STEM fields to help power a better and brighter future,"" said Wolfspeed Chief Human Resources Officer, Margaret Chadwick. ""Our New York RAP will simultaneously train up-and-coming industry professionals while helping us develop our workforce and reach capacity expansion goals at our Mohawk Valley Fab. We are excited to work with our apprentices, building out the semiconductor industry here in the U.S., and we're grateful for collaborators like the Institute, MACNY, and MVCC who help to make these advancements possible.""

The company aims to use the proceeds, along with other sources, to complete the Tender Offer and potentially redeem any remaining 2026 Notes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst CoreCivic's announcement to offer up to $450 million in senior notes due 2029 is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at restructuring the company's debt profile. By initiating a tender offer for the 2026 Notes, the company is seeking to manage its near-term liabilities and potentially reduce the interest burden. This debt refinancing could lead to a more favorable debt maturity schedule and potentially lower interest payments, improving CoreCivic's cash flow and financial stability.Investors should note the implications of such debt issuance on the company's creditworthiness. The guarantee by CoreCivic’s subsidiaries could be seen as a positive signal, indicating a unified backing for the new obligations. However, the market's reception of the new notes and the success of the tender offer will be crucial in determining the immediate financial impact on the company's stock.The role of Citizens JMP Securities, LLC as the left lead underwriter, along with other financial institutions as bookrunners and co-managers, suggests a robust underwriting process. The involvement of reputable underwriters may enhance investor confidence in the notes offering, potentially affecting the demand and pricing of the notes. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, CoreCivic's use of a shelf registration statement for the offering of the senior notes expedites the process and demonstrates regulatory compliance with SEC requirements. The shelf registration allows the company to prepare the offering documents in advance and go to market quickly when conditions are favorable. This agility in accessing capital markets is essential for responding to fluctuating market conditions and optimizing the timing of debt issuance.It is also important to highlight that the offering and the tender offer are subject to specific legal stipulations, such as the 'no assurance' disclosure, which indicates the inherent uncertainty in such financial transactions. Investors should be aware of the legal language used in these disclosures, as it underscores the risk factors associated with the securities offering and the tender offer. Market Research Analyst Market conditions at the time of the offering will significantly influence the success of CoreCivic's notes issuance and tender offer. The interest rates for the new senior notes, in comparison to the 4.75% and 8.25% rates of the existing notes, will be a critical factor for investors. The current economic climate, characterized by interest rate trends and investor sentiment towards the corrections facility management industry, will play a pivotal role in the uptake of the new notes.Furthermore, the decision to refinance existing debt through a tender offer indicates CoreCivic's proactive approach to capital management. The market's perception of this move could impact the company's stock, as it may be interpreted as a sign of financial health or distress, depending on the context of the broader economic environment and the company's performance. 03/04/2024 - 02:12 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoreCivic, Inc. (NYSE: CXW) (“CoreCivic”) announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, up to $450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the “Notes”).

Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MicroStrategy to issue $600 million in convertible senior notes with an additional option for purchasers to buy up to $90 million more is a strategic financial move. Convertible notes are a form of debt that can be converted into equity, typically at the discretion of the bondholder. This offering can be beneficial for the company as it may lower the immediate cash interest payments compared to traditional debt, given that investors are partially compensated through the optionality of conversion into equity.However, the potential dilution of current shareholders' equity upon conversion is a critical consideration. Investors will need to weigh the company's use of proceeds, which includes the acquisition of more bitcoin, against the risk of dilution and the company's long-term strategy. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, this allocation of funds could be seen as aggressive and speculative. The success of this financial strategy will largely depend on the future performance of bitcoin and the company's ability to manage its cryptocurrency portfolio effectively. Market Research Analyst MicroStrategy's decision to raise capital through convertible notes could indicate its confidence in the company's growth prospects and a bullish outlook on its stock price, as investors will only convert their notes into shares if they believe the share price will rise above the conversion price. It's also reflective of a broader trend where companies with high growth potential leverage innovative financing instruments to fund their operations without immediately diluting shareholder value.The timing and conditions of the market will play a significant role in the success of the offering. A favorable interest rate and conversion terms will be crucial to attract qualified institutional buyers. The market's response to this offering will provide insights into investor sentiment regarding MicroStrategy's business model and its continued investment in bitcoin. The impact on the stock price will depend on the market's perception of the company's risk profile post-issuance. Cryptocurrency Analyst MicroStrategy's use of the net proceeds to acquire additional bitcoin is noteworthy, as it highlights the company's continued commitment to cryptocurrency as a core investment strategy. This move further entrenches MicroStrategy as a significant player in the cryptocurrency space and signals to the market its belief in the long-term value proposition of bitcoin. However, this strategy is not without risk, as it exposes the company to the high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets.Investors will need to consider the implications of MicroStrategy's increased exposure to bitcoin. While some may view it as a forward-thinking approach to treasury management, others may see it as an amplification of risk. The company's balance sheet and stock price could experience significant fluctuations with the volatile price movements of bitcoin. This approach could potentially affect the company's creditworthiness and investor confidence in the long term, should the cryptocurrency market face downturns. 03/04/2024 - 04:01 PM TYSONS CORNER, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) (“MicroStrategy”) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

The Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX) rose to 47.65, showing a consistent increase in investor exposure to the markets. Despite concerns, clients maintained cautious optimism in their purchases, contributing to record-setting equity market performance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst With the Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX) experiencing an uptick to 47.65 in February from 44.73 in January, there is a clear indication of heightened retail investor engagement. This surge in activity, particularly within Information Technology, Utilities and Health Care sectors, suggests a diversified approach to investment, which can reflect broader economic trends. For instance, the increased interest in Information Technology could be a response to anticipated innovation or growth within the tech industry, while the focus on Utilities often signifies a move towards more defensive, stable investments during times of market uncertainty. Health Care sector investments may be influenced by demographic trends, such as an aging population, or by advancements in medical technology and pharmaceuticals.It is important to note that the STAX serves as a barometer for retail investor sentiment and behavior. The 'moderate low' ranking, when compared to historical averages, may imply that while there is an increase in trading activity, investors are still somewhat cautious. This cautious optimism is further evidenced by the careful selection in purchases and allocations mentioned by Joe Mazzola. The record-setting ascent in equity markets, despite hotter than expected key economic indicators, could point to a potential disconnect between investor sentiment and broader economic signals, which may necessitate a reevaluation of market expectations and risk assessments. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the consecutive increase in the STAX over the past four months indicates a robust engagement from Schwab's retail clients. This pattern of net buying, particularly in sectors such as Information Technology, Utilities and Health Care, is contributing to the equity market's climb to new highs. However, this bullish behavior among retail investors contrasts with the Federal Reserve's concerns about economic indicators. The Fed's stance, as expressed by Chairman Jerome Powell, suggests that there may be underlying economic pressures that could warrant continued or increased monetary policy intervention.Investors should be aware of the potential implications of this divergence. On one hand, strong retail investor activity could sustain market momentum in the short term. On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve decides to implement measures to cool down an overheating economy, it might lead to increased volatility or a market correction. Stakeholders should closely monitor the Fed's policy decisions, as they could have significant implications for portfolio performance and risk exposure, particularly in the sectors that have seen the most pronounced buying. Economist The behavior exhibited by retail investors, as captured by the STAX, can often be an early indicator of economic trends. The sectors that saw the most pronounced buying—Information Technology, Utilities and Health Care—each play unique roles in the economy. Information Technology is typically a growth-oriented sector, often sensitive to changes in consumer demand and business investment. Utilities are generally considered non-cyclical and can be a safe haven during economic downturns. Health Care demand is relatively inelastic, making it a stable investment during various economic conditions.However, the juxtaposition of this buying behavior with the Federal Reserve's concern about 'hotter than expected' economic indicators could signal that while retail investors are driving market growth, there may be inflationary pressures that are not yet fully accounted for in their investment strategies. This could lead to a scenario where the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates to manage inflation, which historically tends to cool off equity markets. The long-term impact on the sectors favored by Schwab's clients will depend on how these macroeconomic factors evolve and how quickly investors can adapt their strategies to changing economic conditions. 03/04/2024 - 12:30 PM Schwab clients were net buyers in February, with the most pronounced buying within the Information Technology, Utilities and Health Care sectors WESTLAKE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Schwab Trading Activity Index™ (STAX) increased to 47.65 in February, up from its score of 44.73 in January. The only index of its kind, the STAX is a proprietary, behavior-based index that analyzes retail investor stock positions and trading activity from Schwab’s millions of client accounts to illuminate what investors were actually doing and how they were positioned in the markets each month. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240304841142/en/Schwab Trading Activity Index February 2024 (Graphic: Charles Schwab) The reading for the four-week period ending February 23, 2024 ranks “moderate low” compared to historic averages. “The STAX score has been on the rise since November of last year, making this the fourth consecutive month Schwab clients have increased exposure to the markets,” said Joe Mazzola, Director of Trading and Education at Charles Schwab. “Just as they did last month, more clients bought equities than sold in February, contributing to the record-setting ascent in the equity markets during the period even as they continued to demonstrate cautious optimism and discernment in their purchases and allocations.” U.S. equity markets soared to new all-time highs during the February STAX period as investors shrugged off several key indicators that came in hotter than expected. On January 31, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that the Fed remained concerned about stubbornly high inflation. The Fed left interest rates unchanged as Powell signaled the Fed would remain noncommittal to the timing of potential rate cuts or easing of monetary policy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics’ Employment Situation Summary released on February 2 showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 in January, a much higher figure than the 185,000 expected. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%. In February, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% for the month of January to 3.1% year-over-year, a greater increase than anticipated. The Producer Price index (PPI) came in at 0.3%, hot compared to expectations of 0.1%. On February 15, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that U.S. Retail Sales for January increased 0.6% year-on-year, following a downwardly revised 5.3% increase in December. When it came to corporate earnings, on the whole, companies performed better than analysts had predicted. Bullish investors appeared to put more stock into earnings growth than macro headwinds, driving both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to new all-time highs late in the February STAX period; On February 23, the Nasdaq Composite reached 16,134.22 while the S&P 500 (SPX) rose to 5,111.06. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 3.3% from 13.31 to 13.75, reflecting a modest increase in risk premium. The 10-year Treasury yield persisted above 4% throughout the period, closing at 4.26%. The U.S. Dollar Index strengthened, ending at 103.94. April Crude Oil Futures moved fractionally lower, settling at $76.49 per barrel.

Improved supplier data collection from the program has furthered our ability to identify sustainability opportunities and risks at the product-category level. By identifying risk and opportunities within our suppliers' practices and supply chains, it enables us to better direct our efforts in supporting the development of our global brands and supplier sustainability strategy by providing a clearer view of how supplier engagement can be targeted.In fiscal 2023, WBA continued to grow and expand supplier participation in the tool achieving a 68 percent increase in own brand suppliers completion of the assessment.
