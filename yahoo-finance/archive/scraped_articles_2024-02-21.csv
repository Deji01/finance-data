Motley Fool,This Is HubSpot Stock's Biggest Problem in 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hubspot-stocks-biggest-problem-2024-113500367.html,"The software company is winning new customers, but it's having issues in another area.","Shares of customer relationship management software provider HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) have doubled since bottoming out at the beginning of 2023. However, the story becomes more muddled if you zoom out a bit. Even after this momentous rally, HubSpot stock is still down 30% from its pandemic-era high.HubSpot's revenue growth rate has slowed since the days of the pandemic, but the company is still growing at an impressive rate, given its size. Revenue jumped 24% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the company expects its annual revenue this year to rise by 18% and surpass $2.5 billion. Against the backdrop of an uncertain economic environment, HubSpot's results look impressive.HubSpot is having trouble in one key areaA software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like HubSpot grows in two ways: winning new customers, and convincing existing customers to spend more. HubSpot is having no trouble at all winning new customers. The company ended 2023 with 205,091 customers, up 23% from the end of 2022.The problem is that HubSpot is struggling to grow spending with existing customers. Average subscription revenue per customer in the fourth quarter grew by just 1% year over year to $11,365. This is despite HubSpot's platform being tailor made for a land-and-expand strategy.HubSpot splits its platform into ""hubs,"" each with a different area of focus. Marketing has its own hub, as does sales, customer service, content management, operations, and commerce. Within each hub, pricing is determined by a variety of factors. Most hubs have multiple tiers, and pricing rises with the number of marketing contacts or paid users, depending on the hub.One complication of HubSpot's current pricing model is the distinction between paid users and free users. Even for customers on the priciest professional and enterprise plans, many features are accessible to any number of free users. A team of 100 employees using HubSpot's platform, for example, could only have a handful of paid users. HubSpot's revenue for most of its hubs is based on the paid user count.Story continuesA new pricing model could helpThe company plans to roll out a new pricing model in March that simplifies this situation and potentially raises prices for customers. Outside the free plan, every active user with edit access will require a paid seat. There are free view-only seats that can see information but not change it, core seats that allow for editing, and specialized seats that unlock additional functionality. Free users will be far more limited than they are under the current model.The new model will only apply to new users at first, with existing users brought on in waves through 2025. HubSpot is limiting the cost increase upon the first renewal to 5%, giving customers time to adjust to the new model without seeing a big increase in their bills right away.Because of this slow, cautious rollout, any positive impact on HubSpot's revenue likely won't show up until 2025 at the earliest.Is HubSpot stock a buy?The new pricing model will likely provide a boost to average spending per customer over the next couple of years, although the effect won't be immediate. The new model also removes some minimum seat requirements on certain plans, which may make it easier for some potential customers to adopt the platform.An acceleration in growth would be good news for investors, but it may not be enough to propel HubSpot stock higher. With the company expecting to produce adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $6.86 and $6.94 this year, HubSpot stock trades for about 85 times forward earnings.Even if the macroeconomic environment improves and this new pricing model pays off, it will be tough for HubSpot to grow quickly enough to justify this valuation. At the right price, HubSpot could be a great long-term investment as the company gains share in the CRM software market. But to me, the stock appears far too expensive to seriously consider.Should you invest $1,000 in HubSpot right now?Before you buy stock in HubSpot, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and HubSpot wasn’t one of them.

Reuters,Walgreens shares fall after losing spot in blue-chip Dow index,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-shares-fall-losing-spot-113241894.html,"The replacement comes less than two months after Walgreens nearly halved its dividend payout to conserve cash as it seeks to win back market share from rivals and expand beyond its pharmacies.

Since then, the stock has lost about 65% of its value.The company has appointed new top executives, shut unprofitable stores and unveiled the dividend cut in January as it deals with low consumer spending, a drop in COVID-19 product sales and a slow ramp-up of its nascent healthcare unit.The stock has posted a decline in seven of the past eight years and is down nearly 15% since the beginning of 2024. Shares of Walgreens trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 6.54, compared with 9 for larger rival CVS Health.S&P Dow Jones indices said late on Tuesday that adding Amazon would also increase consumer retail exposure, reflecting ""the evolving nature of the American economy"". The change is effective next week, it said.Besides dominating online retail, the Seattle-based company is a major player in cloud computing, entertainment and other industries.Amazon's shares rose 1.1% before the bell.(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)"
Motley Fool,Here Is the Only Stock Market Sector That Outperformed the S&P 500 Over the Last 5 Years,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-stock-market-sector-outperformed-113000330.html,The tech sector is more than pulling its weight in the market,"The S&P 500 had a solid performance over the last five years, surging over 85%. Considering that time frame includes the pandemic-induced crash and the 2022 inflation sell-off, I'd say that's a good overall performance.There are 11 sectors in the S&P 500. Yet only one sector, technology, has gained more than 85% over the last five years. You may be wondering, if the S&P 500 reflects the average performance of all 11 sectors, shouldn't around half of the sectors beat the market and half underperform? That would be true if each sector was similarly weighted and there weren't big outliers. But over the last five years, the technology sector has been an outlier for multiple reasons.Here's why tech is carrying the market, and the impact it could have on your investments.Image source: Getty Images.Market leadershipThe following chart is one of the most fascinating ones I've seen in a while.^SPX data by YChartsThe tech sector has been fantastic in the last five years while the other 10 sectors have all underperformed the S&P 500. What's particularly interesting about this fact is that Alphabet and Meta Platforms, two incredible performers, are actually in the communications sector while Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Yet even with those heavily weighted outperforming stocks, both the communications and consumer discretionary sector still underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years.The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. It's a good way to see what makes up the S&P 500, both in terms of individual holdings and sectors.As of Jan. 31, the information technology sector makes up a staggering 29.5% of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which is more than utilities, real estate, materials, energy, consumer staples, and communication services combined. What has happened over the last five years is that the highest-weighted sector also happened to be (by far) the best-performing. The combination of outperformance and sector weight allowed for 10 out of the 11 sectors to underperform the S&P 500.Story continuesA highly concentrated marketI think it's a mistake to downplay this impact on the broader market and your own portfolio. If you weren't invested in big tech-like stocks over the last five years, there's a good chance you underperformed the market. There have been non-tech focused sectors that have put up respectable returns as well, namely industrials and healthcare. But overall, there are really two sides of the market.Investing in an S&P 500 index fund is a big bet on the tech sector and market leaders in other sectors. Moreover, it's worth mentioning that the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 make up 30.7% of the index. Those companies are Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, Broadcom, and Eli Lilly. In other words, the S&P 500 is going to live or die by not just tech but these top holdings.A lot of the slightly smaller heavy hitters are closely correlated to these top names. For example, another 2% or so of the S&P 500 is in Visa and Mastercard. An additional 2% is in Adobe, Salesforce, and Advanced Micro Devices. As you go down the list of S&P 500 components, you'll quickly realize just how much of the index depends on the performance of a relatively small number of companies.Using (or not using) the S&P 500 as a benchmarkAside from sector allocation, massive companies versus everything else is another important point to consider. If you're investing mainly in non-megacap stocks, then your performance will likely have nothing to do with the broader market's performance because the market is so top-heavy.Ultimately, I think the key takeaway is that you could be heavily invested in the stock market and loosely correlated to the S&P 500. But if you own a lot of tech or megacap stocks, your performance could more closely resemble the S&P 500.The new normalI think it's time investors reset expectations and understand that the S&P 500 is no longer representative of the broader market, but rather, is heavily influenced by a couple dozen companies and the tech sector. Participating in the stock market can mean completely different things for different investors. And holding yourself to a benchmark like the S&P 500 may be misleading and inaccurate.Ultimately, market dynamics don't mean nearly as much as achieving your financial goals. The key is to invest in companies that match your risk tolerance, that you truly understand and believe in long term, and that can compound in value over time.Just know that you can find yourself grossly outperforming or underperforming the S&P 500, depending on your exposure to the tech sector.Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Want Decades of Passive Income? 3 Stocks to Buy Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-decades-passive-income-3-112900928.html,These REITs have been great passive income producers.,"Investing in real estate is a popular method of generating passive income. However, you don't need to buy a rental property to earn income from the sector. A much easier option is to invest in a real estate investment trust (REIT).Prologis (NYSE: PLD), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) are excellent REITs for those seeking to collect durable income. Here's why they stand out as great income options.Cashing in on growing warehouse demandPrologis is the leading industrial REIT. The company owns interests in over 5,600 warehouses across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. It leases space in its warehouses to tenants across various industries. Those leases supply it with steady rental income. It uses that money to pay a growing dividend (currently yielding 2.6%) and invest in expanding its portfolio. Demand for warehouses is durable and growing, driven by the rising adoption of e-commerce. Prologis is in an excellent position to capitalize on this trend. It owns a vast land bank that could support $40 billion of future development. The company also has an elite balance sheet, giving it the financial flexibility to invest in development projects and make acquisitions. Prologis' growth drivers and financial strength should enable it to continue boosting its dividend. It has increased its payout at a more than 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, double the pace of the S&P 500. Given its financial strength and catalysts, it should be able to continue lifting its dividend in the decades to come. Built to generate incomeRealty Income built its business to support dependable monthly dividends that rise over time. The diversified REIT owns 13,250 retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties across the U.S. and Europe. The company focuses on properties leased to tenants immune to disruption from e-commerce and economic downturns (e.g., grocery stores and warehouses). These features enable it to generate very durable rental income to support its 5.9%-yielding dividend. Story continuesThe REIT has increased its monthly payout 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including for the last 105 straight quarters. Realty Income expects to continue boosting its dividend in the future. The company aims to grow its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by 4% to 5% per year. Growth drivers include rising rental rates, acquisitions, and development projects. Realty Income has an elite balance sheet and low dividend payout ratio, giving it the flexibility to continue expanding its portfolio and increasing its monthly dividend. It's routinely adding new growth platforms, including recently making its first investments in data centers and new European markets. Focused on growing housing marketsCamden Property Trust is a residential REIT centered on high-growth markets. It owns 172 properties with over 58,600 apartment homes across 15 major markets, predominantly in the South. The company's focus on markets with above-average employment and population growth rates helps drive strong occupancy and rental growth. That provides the REIT with steadily rising income to support its 4.3%-yielding dividend. The company's pursuit of growth markets also provides new investment opportunities. Camden is investing over $500 million to build five new communities (including two featuring single-family rental homes) that will add over 1,500 units over the next two years. Meanwhile, it has nine more communities under development. It could invest nearly $1.4 billion to build over 3,350 additional homes. Camden has an strong balance sheet, giving it the flexibility to grow its portfolio and dividend. In addition to development projects, Camden will acquire operating communities and land to support new developments. The company's growth drivers should enable it to continue increasing its dividend in the future. Durable dividend stocksREITs are great income-generating investments. They collect steady rental income, giving them stable cash flow to pay dividends that tend to rise over time. That has been the case with Prologis, Realty Income, and Camden Property. Add in the fact that they have three of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry and focus on sectors with enduring demand, and they're great stocks to buy for those seeking long-term income streams.

Motley Fool,Why Did Berkshire Hathaway Sell 100% of Its Markel Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-berkshire-hathaway-sell-112000558.html,"In 2021, Berkshire Hathaway took a $620 million stake in Markel. Today it owns none. What changed?","Led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is known for its long-term investing strategy. Many of its larger positions have remained in its portfolio for decades.Given the company's usual patience, it was surprising to see it buy $620 million of Markel (NYSE: MKL) stock in early 2022, only for the entire stake to be liquidated last quarter.Clearly something changed after Berkshire originally took its position, but given a recent pullback in Markel stock, there's reason to believe that Buffett and Berkshire could be back soon. This may be your chance to buy Markel stock before that happens.Markel is a miniature BerkshireWhen Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, the company was a tiny textile manufacturer with troubled finances. Today, the company is worth nearly $900 billion.As you may already know, Berkshire didn't remain a textile manufacturer for long. In 1967, Berkshire purchased National Indemnity Company, the first of many insurance businesses that would be added to its growing portfolio of holding companies.Buffett used these insurance businesses in a clever way. Insurance premiums are paid upfront and returned to policyholders only when a claim is filed. In the meantime, the insurer keeps the premium, which is akin to a free loan. Buffett invested these funds in a variety of companies that owned iconic brands, such as American Express and Coca-Cola.With a history stretching back to 1930, Markel began as an insurance company, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the company pursued a strategy similar to Berkshire's. That is, Markel began allocating its insurance premiums to an investment portfolio designed around long-term capital appreciation.With very similar business models, Markel and Berkshire have been joined at the hip since the 1990s. This similarity is likely the reason Berkshire initially acquired a position in Markel. It is also likely the reason it sold its entire position last quarter.Story continuesBRK.B data by YCharts.Why Berkshire likely bought and then sold Markel stockIn recent decades, Buffett has been a big fan of share repurchases. In 2020, Berkshire repurchased $24.7 billion of its own stock. In 2021, that figure increased to $27.1 billion. The company continued to buy back stock in 2022, but with much less money, only $7.9 billion. Share repurchases in 2023 remained depressed despite Berkshire amassing a record $157 billion cash balance.Why did Berkshire slow down its share repurchase program? Likely for the same reasons it sold Markel stock.All you need to do is track each company's price-to-book valuation multiple. It is this valuation multiple that Buffett has publicly referenced in the past to justify previous share buyback programs. When the multiple gets low, he likes to buy back more Berkshire stock. When it gets high, share repurchases slow down.With this in mind, it's not hard to see what happened with Berkshire's Markel position. In early 2022, when Berkshire first purchased Markel shares, they traded at roughly 1.2 times book value, a sizable discount to Berkshire's valuation at the time. In buying Markel stock, Berkshire was essentially purchasing a miniature version of itself at a discount.Last quarter, Markel shares traded roughly in line with Berkshire stock, at a valuation of around 1.4 times book value. It is at that valuation that Berkshire usually slows down its share repurchases, and it likely made sense for the company to wind down its Markel position now that the valuation gap had closed.BRK.B Price to Book Value data by YCharts.It's important to remember that we usually learn of Berkshire's portfolio changes only after they occur. That means the company liquidated its Markel position several months ago, likely at higher prices. Since 2024 began, Markel's stock price has moved sharply lower.While Markel's valuation hasn't reached the lows that originally got Berkshire invested, it's getting close. If Markel shares continue to weaken, don't be surprised to see Berkshire jump back in, especially given that its own stock trades at multiyear highs.Markel stock at these levels is likely a better investment for Berkshire than repurchasing its own stock. It's likely a good investment for others, too.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Forget Microsoft: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-microsoft-2-artificial-intelligence-111500500.html,These companies could see their stock significantly outperform Microsoft over the next two years.,"Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The industry is developing rapidly and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That trajectory would see the market hit close to $2 trillion before the end of the decade.As a result, excitement over AI triggered countless tech stocks to soar over the last year. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the biggest winners, with its shares up 56% in the last 12 months. The company is one of OpenAI's largest investors, a position that affords Microsoft with exclusive access to some of the start-up's most advanced AI models.The Windows company is an exciting way to invest in AI. However, companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI ventures could have more room to run over the long term. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options. One is carving out a lucrative role in the AI chip market, while the other is leading in the software side of the industry.MSFT EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartMicrosoft's earnings could hit just under $16 per share over the next two fiscal years, while AMD's and Amazon's may reach about $7 per share. On the surface, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer.However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Microsoft at 35, AMD at 52, and Amazon at 41) would yield stock prices of $546 for Microsoft, $346 for AMD, and $283 for Amazon. Considering their current positions, these projections would see Microsoft's stock rise 35%, AMD's 99%, and Amazon's 66% by fiscal 2026.These estimates show that AMD and Amazon have significantly more growth potential over the next two years. So forget Microsoft. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.1. Advanced Micro DevicesAMD's stock has climbed 111% year to date alongside its growing prospects in AI. The tech company is gearing up to challenge AI's leading chip supplier Nvidia with a new line of graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the hardware necessary for training AI models.Story continuesLast December, AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI GPUs, designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings. They've already caught the eye of some of the industry's biggest players.In November 2023, Microsoft announced Azure would become the first cloud platform to implement AMD's new GPU to optimize its AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has similarly signed on to use AMD's MI300X chips. However, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD is seeking to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.AMD supplies chips to PC and notebook manufacturers across tech, with a 23% market share in laptop central processing units (CPUs). Consequently, AMD could significantly profit from increased demand for AI-equipped PCs, carving out its own niche in the burgeoning AI market.2. AmazonAs the biggest name in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon has multiple use cases for AI and ways to bolster its business with the technology.Since the start of 2023, Amazon responded to the rising demand for AI by expanding its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In September, the company debuted Bedrock, a tool offering a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications.AWS also introduced CodeWhisperer, a platform that generates code for developers, and HealthScribe, a feature capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations. In addition to improved cloud capabilities, AI could help Amazon better track shopping trends and effectively recommend products to customers on its retail site. Meanwhile, the company recently announced an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will improve the customer experience.Amazon is on a promising growth path in AI and has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with the competition. Over the last 12 months, the tech company's free cash flow has risen by 904% to $32 billion.In Amazon's fourth quarter, revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating analyst estimates by nearly $4 billion. Its earnings per share hit $1, compared to expectations of $0.80.Amazon is in steep competition with Microsoft in the cloud market, with both ramping up their AI expansions. However, Amazon's leading market share in the industry potentially gives it a leg up. Alongside massive growth potential in its earnings per share, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer buy over Microsoft's for anyone looking to invest in AI.

Motley Fool,1 Cash-Gushing Stock Down 70% to Buy and Hold Forever,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-cash-gushing-stock-down-111500866.html,"This healthcare upstart, with a free-cash-flow margin of 27% even after removing stock-based compensation, deserves a long look from investors.","Most stocks suffering a 70% decline in share price tend not to qualify as anything close to a cash cow capable of generating immense free cash flow (FCF). But Doximity (NYSE: DOCS), with its digital platform for healthcare professionals, is the exception to this theory, with a top-tier gross profit around 90% and FCF margins of 35%.So, does the 70% decline in share price indicate there is something fundamentally wrong with the business, leaving this immense cash generation at risk? Or could this be an opportunity for patient investors?Here's why I'm thinking it'd be the latter.Doximity: The go-to app for healthcare professionalsDoximity has widespread adoption among healthcare professionals: Its members include over 80% of U.S. physicians, 50% of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and 90% of graduating medical students. This makes it something of a LinkedIn for healthcare professionals.The company serves its members through an array of services, such as:In telehealth, it provides anonymized video- and voice-calling capabilities for doctors through Doximity's Dialer product.A curated news feed for clinicians that keeps healthcare professionals updated on personalized news, clinical data, and research.Doximity's mass adoption creates a massive professional network that can be used for collaboration and communication.It provides recommended jobs, a salary map, hospital reviews, career preferences, and a residency navigator, giving its members valuable transparency in the healthcare job market.Doximity facilitates messaging, digital faxes, and e-signatures among healthcare professionals, helping to reduce burnout from physical paperwork.Following its 2022 acquisition of Amion, Doximity now helps physicians set schedules, whether at the team level or for a whole enterprise.Thanks to the combination of these uses, Doximity has over 560,000 active prescribers on its platform. Considering that the total U.S. physician population is just over 1 million, according to Statista, this figure is amazing.Story continuesIn its most recent quarter, Doximity reached new all-time highs in daily active users. That makes its app valuable territory for marketers at pharmaceutical companies and healthcare systems. All 20 of the largest hospitals and healthcare systems and all 20 of the biggest pharmaceutical companies advertise with Doximity.This access to all these doctors on the company's app has advertisers quickly shifting their budgets from traditional marketing. The company has seen its revenue rise 126% in the 2 1/2 years since its initial public offering (IPO).But this shift in marketing spending isn't merely a result of advertisers following where doctors spend time. Doximity also has best-in-class return on investment (ROI). Chief executive officer Jeffrey Tangney said, ""When our clients sat down at the end of the year to do their annual reviews of all the programs and all the partners that they work with, again, they're telling us that we win in terms of ROI.""The icing on the cake for investors: Despite already working with the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies and healthcare systems, Doximity has a growth story that should still be in its early chapters. It holds less than a 5% market share among prescription brands that have over $100 million in sales across the U.S. So there is ample room for the company to grow alongside its largest customers.Phenomenal margins help make Doximity a cash cowWith a gross profit margin of 91% and a net profit margin of 35%, Doximity has one of the best margin profiles in the stock market.DOCS gross profit margin (quarterly) data by YCharts.If Doximity were large enough to qualify for the S&P 500 index, its gross and net profit margins would rank as the ninth and 20th best, respectively.This high net income margin is all the more striking because Doximity historically converts all of it to free cash flow.DOCS free cash flow data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.Doximity still generates an FCF margin of 27% even after accounting for rather generous stock-based compensation. This outsize FCF generation -- and a cash balance of over $700 million -- allowed the company to lower its share count by 4% over the last year and could easily fund similar stock buybacks for years to come.These outstanding margins could be an early indicator of what could prove to be a wide moat surrounding Doximity's operations, thanks partly to its unmatched reach in the healthcare professional community.Doximity's leadership position and best-in-class advertising ROI look fairly priced with its enterprise value-to-FCF ratio of 29 (which is being used here instead of its price-to-FCF ratio of 38, due to the company's $700 million in net cash).The company is consistently taking market share in a digital healthcare industry expected to grow by 5% to 7% in 2024. So Doximity's stock, after its fall from grace since its IPO, looks like an intriguing opportunity for investors thinking decades ahead.Should you invest $1,000 in Doximity right now?Before you buy stock in Doximity, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Doximity wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Surprising Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Billionaires Are Selling and 1 They're Buying Hand Over Fist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-surprising-artificial-intelligence-ai-111200676.html,"Though it's powering the AI revolution, Nvidia's shares are out of favor. But fund managers can't seem to get enough of global internet search leader Alphabet.","Are you already a successful tech stock investor who manages billions of dollars for yourself and others? If not, there are probably a few things about investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that you could learn from the small group of folks who are.Gaining insights from the actions of the world's most successful investors is probably easier than you think. The Securities and Exchange Commission makes just about anyone who manages more than $100 million in assets disclose their recent trading activity every three months.Image source: Getty Images.The latest round of quarterly disclosures just came out, and you might be surprised by which AI stocks billionaires are selling and which ones they're buying.Surprising AI stock that billionaires are selling: NvidiaDuring the final three months of 2023, at least three well-regarded hedge funds each sold more than 1 million shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Israel Englander of Millennium Management, Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International, and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management significantly trimmed their long positions in the chip designer.These billionaires didn't drop Nvidia stock from their portfolios entirely, but it's a relatively small bet for all three. At the end of December, Point72 had the largest Nvidia position -- worth 0.64% of its total portfolio.Nvidia isn't the only company designing chips that can run accelerated applications. However, it can charge a lot more for its products because new competing chips designed by Advanced Micro Devices and Amazon don't run Nvidia's proprietary CUDA platform.Significant switching costs could give Nvidia pricing power for years to come. Investors confident the AI revolution will continue driving growth have driven the stock up to a recent valuation of 96 times trailing earnings.Unfortunately, semiconductor sales are highly cyclical, and when they fall, they tend to fall fast. Hedge fund managers have been selling the stock because they know that much of the 240% gain it accrued over the past year could quickly be wiped away if management delivers discouraging guidance when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday after the markets close.Story continuesAn AI stock that billionaires keep buying: AlphabetMillennium Management significantly raised its Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stake in the fourth quarter, acquiring 2.4 million of the company's Class A shares. It wasn't alone. Susquehanna International bought nearly 780,000 Class A shares, which come with voting rights and trade at a slightly higher price than the Class C shares.James Simons and Renaissance Technologies also piled into Google's parent company. In the fourth quarter, Renaissance bought 1.8 million Class A shares and 1.4 million Class C shares.Why billionaire fund managers are attracted to AlphabetWhen OpenAI stunned the world in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, it caught Alphabet by surprise. Alphabet's own chatbot, formerly known as Bard, was downright disappointing by comparison. What many investors don't realize, though, is that Alphabet was an AI-first business for years before anyone heard of ChatGPT.Alphabet has rebranded Bard as Gemini. With a more comprehensive large language model to work from, Gemini could become as valuable as ChatGPT is for OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. Billionaires aren't betting on Alphabet based on Gemini, though. They like this stock because it can deliver market-beating gains over time even if Gemini is a total flop.Google's core products such as Search, Android, Chrome, Maps, Gmail, and YouTube have each had more than 1 billion monthly active users for several years. Search, its oldest and arguably most valuable product, still dominates its space with a 91.5% market share.Microsoft, the world's largest company by market capitalization, has been hurling resources at the Bing search engine since 2009. Even with help from ChatGPT, its share of the global search market was just 3.4% in January.A good time to follow the billionaires?Fund managers will be the first to tell individual investors that not every stock pick they make is going to be a winner. Piling into a stock just because a billionaire did can be disastrous to your portfolio, but adding some shares of Alphabet to a diversified portfolio looks like a smart move right now.At recent prices, you can buy Alphabet's Class A shares for about 20.9 times forward earnings estimates. That is a reasonable price to pay for a business that has grown its earnings per share by 191% over the past five years. Patient investors could realize market-beating gains even if its bottom line grows at half its previous pace.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Can Be Risky; Here's a Terrific Way to Do It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-110900451.html,You don't have to pick winners and losers in the artificial intelligence industry if you follow a simple strategy of investing in ETFs.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) was the dominant theme in the stock market last year, and a growing number of businesses are using the technology.According to Goldman Sachs, 36% of companies in the S&P 500 index mentioned AI in their conference calls with investors during the fourth quarter of 2023, which was up from 31% just three months prior. Investors' interest is beyond piqued, but it will be increasingly difficult to pick winners and losers in the AI race amid the expanding playing field.Shares of Nvidia, for example, have soared more than 40% in 2024 already, after jumping nearly 240% in 2023. Shares of Upstart Holdings, on the other hand, have plunged 32% so far this year after a 210% jump last year. AI is central to both companies, but their businesses are very different, and AI alone isn't always enough to buoy investors' enthusiasm.But investors don't need a crystal ball to profit from the AI revolution. Here's how they can own a portfolio of AI stocks while limiting exposure to the inevitable failures.Image source: Getty Images.Exchange-traded funds can offer the perfect balance of risk and rewardRather than purchasing several individual AI stocks (which involves picking winners and losers) investors can buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on AI. An ETF can hold hundreds of individual stocks, and it's managed by professionals who make adjustments to the portfolio as necessary.Therefore, investors can benefit from the upside offered by the AI industry while protecting themselves from companies that might fail -- and if past technology booms have taught us anything, there will be many failures.A number of AI ETFs have come to market in the last few years, but here's why the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEMKT: IRBO) and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ: BOTZ) are two great picks.1. iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO)The goal of the IRBO ETF is to give investors exposure to companies at the forefront of the AI and robotics industries. It holds 111 stocks and securities from all over the world, so it's one of the most diversified options available.Story continuesIRBO is also quite evenly distributed compared to other AI ETFs, because its top 10 holdings account for just 13% of the total value of its portfolio -- and that top 10 includes some of the best AI names investors want to own:StockIRBO ETF Weighting1. Arm Holdings1.84%2. Nvidia1.34%3. Meta Platforms1.33%4. Advanced Micro Devices1.27%5. Alchip Technologies1.24%6. Spotify Technology1.19%7. MicroStrategy 1.19%8. DigitalOcean 1.17%9. Informatica1.17%10. Megaport1.15%Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings accurate as of Feb. 15, 2024, and are subject to change.Semiconductor design company Arm Holdings is IRBO's top position. Its stock has soared 60% in 2024 already, which is why it has amassed the largest weighting in the ETF by a wide margin. IRBO also owns the two main semiconductor heavyweights in the AI space: Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.IRBO also owns a stake in a number of companies that are using AI to enhance their core businesses. For example, Meta Platforms uses AI to deliver more relevant content recommendations to users on Facebook and Instagram. Music streaming platform Spotify uses it for a similar purpose.The IRBO ETF has delivered an annual return of 8% since inception (2018), which underperforms the 10.2% average annual return of the S&P 500 going back to 1957. However, IRBO's one-year return is 36%, compared to 22% for the S&P 500.I normally wouldn't focus too much on a single year, but it happens to be the time frame in which AI has really gathered momentum. If stocks like Arm, Nvidia, AMD, and Meta Platforms continue to soar, it will help drive IRBO to market-beating returns.2. Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)While the BOTZ ETF is similar to IRBO in name and objective, its makeup is very different. It holds just 42 stocks and securities, so it's far more concentrated.In fact, its top 10 holdings account for a whopping 70.6% of the total value of its portfolio. Its top holding -- Nvidia -- makes up almost 20%:StockBOTZ ETF Weighting1. Nvidia19.93%2. Intuitive Surgical10.58%3. ABB LTD8.70%4. Keyence Corporation6.78%5. Fanuc Corp4.96%6. UiPath 4.75%7. Dynatrace4.36%8. SMC Corp3.93%9. Daifuku Co3.39%10. Yaskawa Electric3.21%Data source: Global X. Portfolio weightings accurate as of Feb. 16, 2024, and are subject to change.More than half of the stocks in the BOTZ top 10 are listed outside the U.S. For example, ABB Ltd is a Swiss engineering giant that develops hardware and software solutions for electrification and automation. Similarly, Japanese companies Keyence Corporation and Fanuc Corp develop products and equipment required to automate factories and manufacturing processes.BOTZ also holds U.S.-based powerhouses like Intuitive Surgical, which makes robotics products to improve clinical outcomes in the healthcare industry. Then there is UiPath, which develops automation software -- this stock has become a favorite for tech investor Cathie Wood.ETFs that are heavily weighted toward their top holdings can be a double-edged sword for investors. BOTZ has generated a 9.85% average annual return since inception (2016), which is better than IRBO. It has also crushed both IRBO and the S&P 500 over the past year with a 38.6% return.However, if Nvidia stock suffers a steep decline, it could have an outsize negative impact on those returns because the company makes up such a large portion of the ETF.For that reason, BOTZ might be a good choice for investors with a more aggressive risk profile, whereas IRBO could be the right pick for those who are more conservative.Should you invest $1,000 in iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF right now?Before you buy stock in iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF , consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF wasn’t one of them.

Banks were among the leading decliners as HSBC Holdings Plc tumbled more than 6% after reporting an 80% plunge in fourth-quarter profit.Weak earnings from commodities trader Glencore Plc and Rio Tinto Plc, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, weighed on the basic resources sub-index, which slumped to a four-month low. On the positive side, Carrefour SA gained after the French grocer announced a share buy-back, even as quarterly sales disappointed.Positive economic surprises have buoyed European stocks even as traders trimmed bets on interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank. Volatility measures are at historical lows, suggesting some complacency has crept into a market still facing potential headwinds, including rising bond yields, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.“European stocks could consolidate recent gains in the near term as investor sentiment looks overheated,” BI strategists Laurent Douillet and Tim Craighead wrote in a report. “Rising government bond yields haven’t curbed enthusiasm so far, as highly leveraged companies slightly outperform, and remain a key 2024 risk for equities.”US equity futures dipped ahead of the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting, as well as much-anticipated earnings from Nvidia Corp. later Wednesday. The company at the heart of the AI revolution boasts the best performance in the S&P 500 this year after more than tripling in 2023, and is responsible for a third of the benchmark’s year-to-date gain.Story continues“It feels like these earnings today are a barometer of where we are in the global cycle,” said Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at St James’s Place. “Concentration in the stock market has got to levels where one company’s earnings can have a big macro effect. It’s gone beyond being just a portfolio construction issue; it’s a macro challenge which you can’t get away from.”The 10-year Treasury yield and a gauge of the dollar were steady.Elsewhere, Chinese shares rose after policymakers took more steps to revive investor confidence, defying broader weakness in Asia following a tech-led retreat on Wall Street.A gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms jumped as much as 4% before paring gains, while the CSI 300 Index of mainland shares rose 1.4%. Property developers led the gains after banks ramped up funding help for the troubled sector. A fresh crackdown on trading by quant funds also reduced concerns about short selling. That’s in contrast with losses in other Asian markets.In the commodity space, aluminum surged on speculation that a fresh wave of US sanctions against Russia may target the metal, potentially disrupting supplies. Iron ore clawed back some of its losses after Chinese steel mills recorded an increase in output.
