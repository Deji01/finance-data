Higher Treasury yields continued to weigh on investor sentiment while the recent rally in oil spurred concern about a flare-up in inflation.Never miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.Just a few hours ahead of Powell’s remarks, Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said it will likely be appropriate to lower rates only in the fourth quarter — emphasizing the bumpy nature of inflation progress. Data Wednesday showed US companies boosted hiring last month by the most since July and some wage gains accelerated.“The narrative of falling inflation and imminent Fed rate cuts that drove the stock market’s first quarter gains is wobbling,” said Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management. “Worries about the potential for delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts, rising oil prices and rising long-term yields weigh on investors.”The S&P 500 also came under pressure amid a slide in chipmakers. Intel Corp. said losses have deepened at its factory network. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. halted some chipmaking after the biggest earthquake to hit its home island in 25 years.Treasury 10-year yields rose seven basis points to 4.42%. The dollar fluctuated. Oil climbed as OPEC+ chose to stick with oil supply cuts for the first half of the year.Story continuesTo Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley, the stronger-than-expected APD employment report built on this week’s theme: Most numbers have pointed to an economy that is leaning a little more to the hot side than the cool side.“That said, there hasn’t been anything that would derail the idea of second-half rate cuts,” he noted. “A major upside surprise in Friday’s jobs report or more hot inflation readings next week could change the outlook, but for now, the numbers still appear to be in the “more of the same” zone the Fed has said it wanted to see.”Traders have already gotten burned trying to anticipate when central bankers would pivot to easing as sticky inflation led authorities to keep rates elevated. Late last year, for example, markets were betting on six Fed cuts in 2024. Fast forward, and investors are even doubting whether the Fed will be able to deliver on its projection of three total reductions by year-end.The Fed could risk losing its credibility if it cuts interest rates too soon, according to Eric Veiel, chief investment officer and head of global investments at T. Rowe Price Group Inc.“Jerome Powell said very early on he is a student of what happened in the seventies,” he said on Bloomberg Television Tuesday. “If they go ahead and start cutting now, I think they are in danger of making the same mistake.”In the 1970s, the central bank was too quick off the mark in easing policy before inflation was truly vanquished. That’s an error that even Paul Volcker – widely considered the greatest US central banker – committed in 1980 as the economy weakened, only to reverse course later and drive the US into a deeper downturn.“We still expect the Fed to start normalizing policy at midyear,” said Tiffany Wilding and Andrew Balls at Pacific Investment Management Co. “However, the Fed’s subsequent rate-cutting path could be more gradual.”Corporate Highlights:Walt Disney Co. and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger are poised to triumph over Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management in a costly, months-long proxy battle, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Blue Owl Capital Inc. has agreed to buy Kuvare Asset Management, the latest deal to underline a push by private-markets investment firms to tap pools of assets in the insurance market.Cal-Maine Foods Inc. reported third-quarter earnings per share and net sales that topped consensus expectations.

However, that also requires people to have extra money to put into the stock market or save for retirement. When their stock price is up, companies are more inclined to take risks and spend money because they can leverage their increased stock price to get more cash as needed.Don't Miss:Long overdue disruption in the moving industry is underway. Here’s how to invest in it with just $100.Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.But that's not the only marker. Unemployment statistics have reportedly hit all-time lows. The unemployment rate was 3.61% in 2022 — a record at that time, according to CNN. It dropped even lower in 2023 to 3.6%.Inflation also continues to drop. Lower inflation doesn't mean things are getting cheaper; it means things are getting more expensive at a slower rate, which can give consumers time to allow wages to catch up to inflation.Gross domestic product (GDP) has also continued to grow at a relatively respectable rate. GDP grew 2.5% in 2023, an increase from 1.9% in 2022.Much of this indicates a strong economy in which consumers would seemingly be thriving. But according to a recent Harris Poll by American Political Studies (CAPS) at Harvard University, nearly 1 in 2 voters say their financial situation is ""getting worse."" In June 2022, the same poll showed 64% of respondents saying their financial situation was getting worse. While the number of respondents saying their situation is declining has slowly dropped over the past 18 months, that's a year and a half of voters struggling financially.Story continuesTrending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.Most groups said their financial situation was getting worse, with the exception of Democratic voters, those ages 35 to 44, urban voters and Black voters who say their situation is ""improving.""More than half of female voters — 53% — said their situation is getting worse, compared to only 21% saying it's improving. Hispanic and Republican voters saw the largest disparity, with 65% of GOP voters saying it's getting worse compared to 14% saying it's improving. Twenty percent of Hispanic voters reported their situation is improving and 60% say it's getting worse.Male respondents were relatively evenly spread with 34% improving, 41% getting worse and the rest with ""just as well off."" Young voters ages 18 to 24 have a relatively wide disparity with only 30% saying it's improving while 51% noting it's getting worse.While some of this disparity can be explained by politics, with Democratic voters saying their situation is getting better under Biden, there might be some indications of broader issues.Household debt has skyrocketed alongside increases in interest rates to levels well beyond those of the 2008 crash. Americans now have $1.13 trillion in credit card debt and $4.89 trillion in nonhousing debt. As interest rates rise, consumers spend substantially more on interest, decreasing expendable income. In 2008, nonhousing debt reached $2.71 trillion.Similarly, debt associated with housing has also continued to skyrocket. U.S. households now hold a record $12.61 trillion in household debt, up from $9.99 trillion in 2008.Interest rates have begun slowly coming down in recent months, with the Federal Reserve signaling rate cuts will begin later this year. This could ease the situation among voters going into the 2024 election.Read Next: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for investors in the upcoming series.Here’s why you should never copy the CIA’s venture capital investment strategy.""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Biden Says Economy Is 'Strong,' But 50% Of Voters Say Their Financial Situation Is Getting Worse As Markets And Employment Hit Record Highs originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.
