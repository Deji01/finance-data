Motley Fool,Why Duolingo Stock Flew 34% Higher in February,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-duolingo-stock-flew-34-191957257.html,"Duolingo's latest numbers have Wall Street buzzing, and the company is turning heads in the e-learning market.","Shares of Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL) rose by 33.6% in February, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. A thoroughly Street-thumping earnings report erased the language-learning expert's prior price drop, which started around the holidays.Duolingo's Q4 by the numbersYour average Wall Street analyst expected the company would report fourth-quarter earnings of roughly $0.17 per diluted share on sales near $148 million. In actuality, it generated earnings of $0.26 per share on revenue of $151 million. In other words, its 45% year-over-year revenue growth outpaced the Street's expectations by a hair while the bottom line swung up from a $0.35 loss per share much faster than expected.More importantly, Duolingo presented stellar growth in its user and subscriber metrics. Monthly active users (MAUs) rose 46% from the year-ago period while the more deeply engaged daily active users (DAUs) increased by 65%. Most of Duolingo's users are still on its ad-supported free plan, but the count of paid subscribers also jumped 57%.The green owl's long-term ambitionDuolingo's 2023 was all about innovation. It launched math and music courses (exclusively for users on the mobile iOS platform for now, to be followed by web-based and Android versions later), plus innovative features driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that arguably rival real-life tutors.The numbers don't lie. Duolingo saw massive user growth and became significantly more profitable last year. Its focus on a fun, engaging product pairs well with its low-cost marketing strategy that's mainly focused on a brilliantly managed social media presence. I'm sure you've seen Duo, the company's green owl mascot, which made an irreverent appearance in this year's Super Bowl ads.In the long run, Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn wants to ""develop the best education in the world and make it universally available."" That's an ambitious goal, but one that seems well within Duolingo's reach when you look at its rampant business growth and innovative learning experiences.Story continuesThe customer bases for its math and music services -- which are presented in the classic Duolingo format -- are already growing faster than its language service did in the early days. Expand that success to other topics for which learning by gamified repetition could be effective, and you could get a legit full-spectrum learning platform a couple of decades down the line.The full development of von Ahn's expansive vision may take a while, but I'm here for it. Duolingo is one of my favorite stocks to buy right now, even after February's steep price jump.Should you invest $1,000 in Duolingo right now?Before you buy stock in Duolingo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Duolingo wasn’t one of them.

Make It Stop.Equities fluctuated after the S&P 500 saw its 15th record this year. While the market has defied concerns about a peak, warnings about a consolidation or a pullback have surfaced. Treasuries fell, with syndicate desks calling for around $30 billion of new high-grade bond sales this week.Speaking Wednesday and Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to double down on his message that there’s no rush to cut rates. Meantime, data is forecast to show labor-market cooling, which would reinforce bets on policy easing as soon as June.“If the S&P 500 is going to make this the eighth-straight week it hits an all-time high, it will likely need to hear encouraging words from Powell about rate cuts in his two days of congressional testimony, and avoid any major surprises from jobs data,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,130. Tesla Inc. sank 7%. Nvidia Corp. overtook Saudi Aramco to become the third-most valuable public company. New York Community Bancorp slid after Friday’s credit downgrades. US 10-year yields rose four basis points to 4.22%. Bitcoin topped $67,000. Gold hit $2,100.The S&P 500 saw its 16th weekly gain in the last 18 — something that hasn’t happened since 1971, according to Deutsche Bank AG. If the gauge makes 17 out of 19 this week, it will be for the first time since 1960’s, the firm noted.“We’re seeing some incredible levels being broken from many different risk assets,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “Some of this is justified, but others are a sign of froth. This means that the risks are rising in the stock market, and thus investors need to avoid becoming too complacent.”Story continuesTo Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research, the US equity market is likely to push higher until economic data signals a significant slowdown ahead or inflation looks sticky enough to keep the Fed from cutting rates deeply and quickly.“The market’s relentless rally, in which it embraces even the mostly slightly bullish news and ignores any bad news (known as a ‘Teflon’ market because nothing sticks) is raising this question: Can anything make the stock market decline?” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report.“The answer, of course, is ‘yes’.”Slowing growth, reduced rate-cut expectations, falling earnings expectations are among the factors that could lead to that, he added.Nouriel Roubini, the economist known for his bearish outlook ahead of the 2008 global financial crisis, expressed optimism that US growth will remain brisk this year — though that might be a negative for stocks.“There actually is a serious possibility of what people refer to as a ‘no landing,’ that growth remains above potential and inflation remains sticky,” Roubini told Bloomberg Surveillance. “Paradoxically, the good news on growth may be bad news for the market if that implies the Fed is not going to cut as much and as soon as people expect.”Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he expects the Fed’s first cut — which he has penciled in for the third quarter — will be followed by a pause the following meeting to assess how the policy shift is affecting the economy.Powell heads to Capitol Hill for his semiannual testimony before Congress — two years after the central bank began its aggressive battle against surging inflation. With the economy powering along and inflation inching toward the Fed’s sweet spot, Powell will make the case for why officials are in no rush to lower rates.Fed officials’ most recent quarterly forecast in December was for three quarter-point cuts this year — and the bond market has embraced that view, based on the prices of swap contracts that reference future Fed meeting dates.“If Powell says something to the effect that rate cuts will come in the second half of the year, then that can catalyze a move to pricing in two cuts,” said Steve Bartolini, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc.Bets on rate cuts and the artificial-intelligence euphoria spurred a fourth-consecutive month of gains for stocks — defying concerns over and over again that the market has topped after its almost 35% run since the start of last year.The gains have left strategists scrambling to lift their end-2024 targets.Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian was the latest to ratchet up her target for the S&P 500 to among the highest on Wall Street.She now expects the benchmark to end the year at 5,400, compared with her earlier target of 5,000. Indicators are flashing bullish signals on stronger earnings growth ahead and “surprising” profit margin resilience, she said.The S&P 500’s advance to a record high — fueled by a small group of supercharged technology stocks — doesn’t resemble past bubbles, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Stocks with an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of above 10 account for 24% of total US equity market capitalization, versus 28% during 2021 and 35% during the tech bubble, strategist David Kostin wrote. However, the breadth of “extreme valuations” is far more contained with the number of stocks trading at those multiples down sharply from the peak in 2021, he added.“This time is different,” Kostin said. “Unlike the broad-based ‘growth at any cost’ in 2021, investors are mostly paying high valuations for the largest growth stocks in the index. We believe the valuation of the Magnificent 7 is currently supported by their fundamentals.”Corporate Highlights:Apple Inc. was hit Monday with a €1.8 billion ($2 billion) penalty from the European Union over an investigation into allegations it shut out music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology SA, on its platforms.American Airlines Group Inc. agreed to buy 260 short-haul aircraft that include a massive deal for Boeing Co. 737 Max jets, a key endorsement of the planemaker as it works through a crisis of confidence following a near-catastrophic accident in January.JetBlue Airways Corp. formally abandoned its pursuit of Spirit Airlines Inc. more than a month after a federal judge blocked the $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds.Arkhouse Management Co. and Brigade Capital Management boosted their offer for Macy’s Inc. by 14% after the retailer rebuffed a previous proposal.Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management disclosed a 5.2% stake in Deliveroo Plc ahead of a governance change set to weaken the founder’s control over the UK delivery platform.Vista Outdoor Inc. rejected a $2 billion takeover offer from MNC Capital, saying that a separate offer from Czechoslovak Group to buy its ammunition products business is more favorable to shareholders.Super Micro Computer Inc. and Deckers Outdoor Corp. have been added to the S&P 500 index in the latest quarterly weighting change. The two firms will replace Whirlpool Corp. and Zions Bancorp NA prior to the start of trading on March 18.Key Events This Week:Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda speaks, TuesdayChina Caixin services PMI, TuesdayChina kicks off its 14th National People’s Congress, TuesdayEurozone S&P Global Services PMI, PPI, TuesdayUS factory orders, ISM services, S&P Global Services PMI, TuesdaySuper Tuesday in the US, with North Carolina, California, Texas and Oklahoma among more than a dozen states holding Republican and Democratic primariesCanada rate decision, WednesdayEurozone retail sales, WednesdayUS ADP employment, JOLTS job openings, WednesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee, WednesdayFed issues Beige Book, WednesdayFed’s Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis) and Mary Daly (San Francisco) speak, WednesdayChina trade, forex reserves, ThursdayEuropean Central Bank’s rate decision, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, trade, ThursdayPresident Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union address, ThursdayFed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, ThursdayCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, ThursdayEurozone GDP, FridayUS nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, FridayNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, FridayECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann speaks, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 1:03 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%The MSCI World index was little changedCurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro rose 0.2% to $1.0858The British pound rose 0.3% to $1.2695The Japanese yen fell 0.3% to 150.51 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 6.7% to $67,058.04Ether rose 2.3% to $3,560.39BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced four basis points to 4.22%Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 2.39%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.12%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.5% to $78.76 a barrelSpot gold rose 1.6% to $2,116.59 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Michael Mackenzie, Elizabeth Stanton and Esha Dey.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplacePrivate Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a DatabaseThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less ChocolateTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Make It Stop.What to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a DiveShares of Super Micro Computer Inc. are up as much as 28% in intraday trading Monday and on track to close at an all-time high following news that the company is set to be added to the S&P 500 Index later this month. The move extended gains for the server and software provider to more than 1,000% in the past twelve months, dwarfing Nvidia’s nearly 260% rally during the same period.The gain this year alone has added about $48 billion to Super Micro’s market capitalization, pushing its total value to nearly $64 billion.“It makes sense for it to be included in the S&P,” said Shana Sissel, CEO at Banrion Capital Management LLC. “It could actually drive the S&P higher, because now you have a name other than Nvidia that will be driving returns.”Super Micro’s addition to the S&P 500 Index means that the benchmark will have even more AI representation outside of the top technology companies that have lead the broader market higher this year. Deckers Outdoor Corp. will also be added to the index, replacing Whirlpool Corp. and Zions Bancorp.The San Jose, California-based company’s surge received an additional boost in January when it reported preliminary results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and signaled strong demand for AI.“In just over a year, its stock price soared from around $102 to over $1,000, attributed to increased demand for AI—related products and positive growth forecasts,” Rosenblatt Securities Inc. analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note dated March 4. Mosesmann has a buy rating and the Street-high price target of $1,300 for shares of Super Micro.Story continuesTo be sure, the stock has experienced some volatility in recent weeks. At the end of February, short sellers betting on declines in the stock notched paper gains of $1.2 billion when shares tumbled 20% in one day. Since then, the shares have traded even higher, putting year-to-date paper losses for the group at more than $3.2 billion, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.Read more: Super Micro Short Sellers Notch $1.2 Billion as Shares Fall (1)And, while stocks generally leap on the news that they’ll be joining the S&P 500 Index, gains are usually muted once they’re added, Sissel said.“For people who think this means that all of a sudden this pushes Super Micro Computer up even more, I’d temper that,” she said. “Following the completion of the inclusion, you usually see the stock sell off a little bit.”Still, Wall Street is overall bullish on the company. Super Micro has 11 buy ratings, four holds and only one sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The current average price target of $819 implies a roughly 28% downside for shares, but analyst targets often lag rallies like the one that Super Micro has seen.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplacePrivate Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a DatabaseThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less ChocolateTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,2 Stocks That Can Bounce Back in March,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-bounce-back-march-183521600.html,Not every stock is close to matching the market hitting new highs. Sirius XM and Baidu could turn things around this month.,"Stocks are rolling this month. The major market indexes hit all-time highs on the first trading day of March. There are plenty of high fives to go around. Let's take a look at some of the ""down low -- too slow"" investments that could be bounce back here.Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) aren't crashing the bull party. Both stocks are trading at least 35% below their 52-week highs. They are all considerably lower than their all-time highs. March is still young. Let's explore some of the ways that these three out-of-favor investments can move higher this month.1. Sirius XMIt's easy to see why Sirius XM isn't a hot stock right now. It's now been 18 years since Howard Stern rattled the airwaves of terrestrial radio by moving to Sirius. It was 16 years ago that Sirius and XM received regulatory approval to join forces. It's been a long time since satellite radio turned heads.A look at Sirius XM's recent performance makes it clear why Sirius XM is no longer on the radar of most growth investors. Organic revenue growth has been limited to single-digit upticks for seven consecutive years before turning negative in 2023. Yes, Sirius XM's top line declined 0.6% last year. Guidance it initiated last month calls for a 2% slide in revenue for all of 2024. It doesn't mean that the satellite radio monopoly is destined for an uninspiring finish like a fading album track. There's another side to the Sirius XM story.Image source: Getty Images.Sirius XM has been pronounced dead before. Remember when the ""connected car"" was going to be the end of Sirius XM? Smartphone users able to stream their free or nearly free apps through their dashboards may have been a challenge for a premium subscription service like Sirius XM, but it continued to grow. Remember 2020, when the pandemic had us spending more time at home and less time in our cars? It would've been easy for subscribers to cancel the platform then, but revenue kept inching higher and churn was held surprisingly in check.Story continuesIt's 2024. Companies are calling workers back to in-office work. If the economy holds up and borrowing costs continue to contract it should lead to a boost in car sales, the biggest driver of new Sirius XM subscriptions.Along the way, Sirius XM has gone from being a growth investor darling to one that is setting off radars in the value and income investing camps. The stock is now trading for 13 times trailing earnings. Its current yield is at an all-time high of 2.5%, a payout that will become more attractive if fixed income rates continue to move lower this year. It's been topping $1 billion in annual free cash flow for years, and it's been using that to aggressively repurchase its stock.Sirius XM isn't fading out as a media stock. It's time to pump up the volume.2. BaiduThere isn't a lot of love for Chinese stocks from stateside investors these days. The geopolitical risks are certainly heightened right now, but it doesn't mean that the country's largest search engine isn't a bargain.Like Sirius XM, Baidu is also trading for just 13 times trailing reported earnings. If we switch to adjusted earnings, Baidu's profit multiple drops to just 9. Remember when Baidu was trading at a juicy premium to the leading global search engine that it defeated on its home turf? Times have changed.Baidu did struggle with flat revenue growth in 2020 and again in 2022. It bounced back last year, posting positive year-over-year gains in all four quarters with a 9% increase in net revenue for all of 2023. This is an even better bottom-line growth story. Baidu has trounced Wall Street profit targets lately, beating analyst estimates for 23% for four consecutive quarters. The irony here is that while U.S. investors have been bidding up artificial intelligence to stratospheric valuations, Baidu has been an AI leader for years and it's being ignored. Baidu has leaned on AI to be a pioneer in everything from self-driving cars to helping provinces control water pressure levels. The term ""AI"" was used 62 times in last week's earnings call.If you can stomach the risks of buying into a Chinese tech juggernaut -- and they are admittedly high risks and you'll need to have a contrarian streak in you -- picking up Baidu for just 8 times next year's adjusted earnings estimate seems like a good deal. If you're looking for a cheap AI play, start looking at the other end of the planet.Should you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?Before you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 29% in February,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nvidia-stock-jumped-29-181209566.html,A strong earnings report and continuing AI hype caused the stock to surge.,"Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) breathless rise continued last month as the artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker benefited from more signs that demand for AI infrastructure is still soaring. The company also delivered its own stellar earnings report, contradicting any naysayers who expected Nvidia's growth to finally begin moderating.According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished February up 28.6%. As you can see from the chart below, Nvidia gained in the first half of the month on continued excitement over AI chips, and then, after a brief pullback, surged on its earnings report on Feb. 21.NVDA ChartAnalysts are still underestimating NvidiaNvidia shares rose through the first half of the month as strong earnings reports from AI stocks like Meta Platforms and Arm Holdings signaled that demand and interest in AI remained robust and growing. Meanwhile, investor demand for AI stocks continued to send prices in the sector soaring.There was also some noteworthy reporting on Nvidia, including that it's creating a new business to target custom AI chips for cloud computing companies and others, which could be a way of strengthening its competitive advantage in the space.Nvidia also benefited from a series of price target hikes from Wall Street as the consensus on the stock remains overwhelmingly bullish.A Wells Fargo note on Nvidia peer Super Micro Computer threw some cold water on the AI rally, but Nvidia shares jumped 16% on Nov. 22 after the company delivered another blowout earnings report.Revenue skyrocketed 265% to $22.1 billion, ahead of estimates at $20.4 billion, and was paced by a 409% surge in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 486% to $5.16, which also beat the consensus at $4.60.The company's guidance impressed as well, calling for $24 billion in revenue in the first quarter, well ahead of the consensus at $21.9 billion, and management sees margins continuing to expand.Story continuesImage source: Nvidia.Nvidia can still go higherThe AI stock jumped out of the gate in March as well after another stock delivered a bullish report for the sector. This time it was Dell Technologies that said it's starting to see soaring demand for its AI servers.Thus far, the evidence shows that the AI boom is still picking up speed, and Nvidia remains in the driver's seat. Don't be surprised to see the stock deliver further gains in the coming months as cloud infrastructure companies and others race to build out new AI capabilities.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:COIN) to be temporarily unable to handle the load.Don't Miss:This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.Harvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.For a brief time, many Coinbase users saw zero account balances and were unable to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.The chaos reminded some traders of Robinhood Market Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HOOD) 2021 fiasco caused by the unexpected rise in meme stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME).A popular Reddit post titled ""Dear Coinbase – Enjoy your Robinhood Moment"" expressed disappointment in the similarities.While the incident caused Coinbase's stock to dip slightly, it's still up about 215% over the past year, largely because of the rise of Bitcoin and the increased trading fees generated from the cryptocurrency.The increased trading fees that both Coinbase and Robinhood have achieved are likely all part of what Buffett was voicing his displeasure over.Trending: Investing in startups isn’t just for Silicon Valley elite. Ordinary individuals like you have the power to support innovative ventures and reap substantial rewards. Buffett's late business partner Charlie Munger bluntly assessed Robinhood in 2021, saying, ""I think it's just God awful that something like that brought investments from civilized men and decent citizens.
