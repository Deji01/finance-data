Motley Fool,Work for a Company That Partially Pays You in Stock? Beware This Pitfall,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-partially-pays-stock-beware-170018322.html,Getting some of your pay in stock isn't necessarily a great thing. Read on to see why.,"Image source: Getty ImagesMany people's compensation is limited to a paycheck that hits their bank account weekly, every two weeks, once a month, or at another cadence. But if you work for a public company, you may receive a combination of cash and shares of its stock as compensation.This isn't necessarily a bad way to get paid. When you receive a $100,000 salary, that's all you're getting -- $100,000. When you receive $80,000 of your salary in cash and the remaining $20,000 in stock, over time, that $20,000 in shares could grow to be worth $25,000, $30,000 or more.Bonus offer: unlock best-in-class perks with this brokerage accountRead more: best online stock brokers for beginnersOn the flipside, when you're paid in stock, there's a chance that your shares will lose value over time. So in that regard, you're taking a risk, which is probably a pretty obvious drawback of this compensation model. But getting paid in stock has the potential to backfire on you for a less obvious reason, too.When your portfolio is no longer well diversifiedYou'll often hear that it's important to maintain a diversified portfolio because doing so can not only lead to solid growth over time, but protect you from excessive losses. The problem with being paid in stock, though, is that if you keep accumulating shares of the same company, eventually, they might comprise a very large chunk of your portfolio.That could lead to a huge imbalance. And it could also prove problematic if those share prices then take a dive.Let's say you're issued 10 shares of Company X each month as part of your compensation. When you first start out, the 10, 20, or 30 shares you have might comprise just 3% or 4% of your brokerage account's investment mix. But in time, as you continue to collect those shares, they might eventually account for 20%, 30%, or 50% of your portfolio.Meanwhile, let's say your total stock portfolio eventually grows to be worth $100,000. If you have 50%, or $50,000, of your portfolio in Company X and its share price falls by 20%, you're suddenly looking at a portfolio value of just $90,000, or a $10,000 hit. That's a pretty big decline. If Company X only makes up 10% of your portfolio, or $10,000, a 20% drop in its stock price would constitute a $2,000 hit to your total portfolio instead.Story continuesHow to keep your portfolio nicely balanced when you're paid in stockIf you work for a company that pays you partially in stock for many years, you might eventually accrue a large number of shares. So what you'll need to do is figure out what percentage of a single stock is too high for your taste and make plans to unload shares accordingly.Some people may be okay with a single stock comprising up to 20% of their portfolio. Others may be more comfortable limiting that percentage to 5% or 10%.Once you land on the right number for you, you can start selling shares of your stock once they've been in your portfolio for at least a year and a day. That way, you're looking at long-term capital gains taxes on your profits, as opposed to short-term gains, which apply to investments held for a year or less. Long-term capital gains are taxed a lot more favorably, which means you'll pay the IRS less money on your profits.Of course, capital gains taxes are only a problem if you're selling shares at a profit. But ideally, that is what you'll be doing.Being paid partly in cash and partly in stock isn't all that uncommon. But make sure to manage your investments accordingly under that setup so you don't wind up with a portfolio imbalance that causes problems. And if you decide that it's time to start unloading some of your company's shares, time those sell-offs strategically to minimize the tax blow.Alert: our top-rated cash back card now has 0% intro APR until 2025This credit card is not just good – it’s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

MarketWatch,"Beware Nvidia and the S&P 500 ‘index waltz,’ says this market-beating fund manager",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beware-nvidia-p-500-index-142700502.html,The current stock-market mania could come for your retirement accounts.,"Hot stocks aren’t always great for the stock market. - Getty Images/iStockphotoStock-market manias are contagious: They don’t just affect the stocks at the center of the mania. They spread, affecting everything else.Most Read from MarketWatch‘She cleaned him out’: My dying father, who had stage 4 cancer, moved in with his girlfriend. In 3 months, she sold his house and pocketed the money.Ending 6% commissions could create a ‘Venus flytrap situation’ for home buyers, economist saysMy wife and I owe $450,000 on a $1.2 million house with a 3.5% mortgage rate. Our payments will soon increase. Should we pay it off or invest in stocks?‘I was devastated by her infidelity’: I’m still on the deed of my ex-wife’s house, but our divorce decree says she gets the property. Am I sitting on a golden goose?Mortgage rates fall, providing some relief to home buyersThat’s a major and rising risk for ordinary 401(k) and IRA investors right now. It’s a danger as they get sucked into mania stocks like skyrocketing chip maker Nvidia NVDA (current value: $2.4 trillion, or 36 times last year’s … revenues). But it’s also a danger if you think you’re shunning these hot names by buying simple index funds like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.To understand this danger, listen to Francois Rochon, a veteran money manager for private clients who is based just north of the border in Montreal. In a fascinating letter to clients, the founder and CEO of Giverny Capital warns them to beware of the “index waltz.”Here’s how it works. You start out with a few massive stocks that are booming and leaving the rest of the market behind. That’s what we’ve seen over the past year and change with the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks: Nvidia, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Google parent Alphabet GOOG, Facebook parent Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla TSLA. They were responsible for the lion’s share of the performance of the broader S&P 500 last year. Today those seven stocks alone account for just under 30% of the entire index’s total value.Story continuesWhat happens to the rest of the fund industry when a few big stocks leave the market in the dust? They start to look really bad. Any fund manager who either doesn’t own these stocks, or who holds a more rational weighting in them, wakes up to find they “are underperforming the index and a number of their clients are jumping ship to invest in index funds,” Rochon says.Which has been pretty much the story for a while now.And these managers, like most human beings, respond out of self-interest to the incentives being presented to them. “Some of those managers, motivated not to lose their jobs, are throwing in the towel and buying up the index’s largest stocks in increasing numbers to curb their underperformance,” Rochon points out. These desperate purchases “propel these stocks to new highs,” and that in return makes other fund managers who are holding out look even worse. So they eventually give in and rush to buy the booming megacaps.It’s a vicious circle. (Or a virtuous one, if you happen to be holding the right stocks.)This may be where we are now. It is notable that ordinary U.S. investors are now flooding into the stock market again, after shunning it during the bear market of the previous two years. According to the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for the mutual-fund and exchange-traded-fund industry, investors have bought $73 billion worth of U.S. stock funds since the latest market boom began around Halloween. That includes $45 billion in the first three weeks of March alone.But in the first 10 months of 2023, when the market was much lower, they sold $155 billion worth of U.S. stock funds. In other words: Buy high, sell low.But what can’t go on forever, won’t. Sooner or later, the music for this “index waltz” stops. We have seen this in previous manias. None of the 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500 50 years ago are still there today. None. Ah, yes, those Kodak, Sears and Xerox shares! Good times. Those companies couldn’t fail, right?Rochon’s argument is not that investors should get out of the stock market, but simply that they should temper their euphoria for some of the biggest stocks on the market. Rochon, a so-called value investor and a devotee of the late Charlie Munger, is adamantly opposed to trying to time the market, arguing reasonably that nobody can predict its next short-term moves. But he must have some idea what he is doing, because his U.S. stock picks have beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 3.9 percentage points a year over a span of 30 years.Meanwhile, the latest mania is especially concentrated among large-cap growth stocks, such as the Magnificent Seven. Cheaper, less exciting value stocks have been left behind. So the Vanguard Value ETF VUV has substantially underperformed the Vanguard Growth ETF VUG, especially since the mania around artificial intelligence and the Magnificent Seven really took off early last year. For that matter, so have international stocks. Dialing back on the euphoria doesn’t have to mean getting out of the market altogether.Or you can just keep dancing to the index waltz.Most Read from MarketWatchIs the 3% cash-back Robinhood Gold card worth it? ‘There’s one audience this card is really good for.’This small-cap stock is expected to take off — if its weight-loss pill trial succeedsHome Depot seals biggest-ever deal by buying building-products provider SRS for $18.25 billionIs the stock market open on Good Friday?Good Friday’s PCE data brings latest inflation reading — but markets are closed"
Motley Fool,Nvidia Stock Soared 82.5% in the 1st Quarter of 2024 -- Here's What Drove the Leading AI Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-soared-82-5-160000409.html,Surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips has fueled Nvidia stock's powerful performance.,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 82.5% in the first quarter of 2024. (The market's quarter ended on Thursday, as U.S. financial markets were closed on Friday for the Good Friday holiday.) That performance made the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, behind only Super Micro Computer, a server specialist that's also benefiting from strong demand for AI products and services.For context, in the first quarter, the S&P 500 gained 10.2%, and notched an all-time closing high on Thursday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 9.1%.Nvidia stock's top catalyst: AI, particularly generative AIThe main catalyst behind Nvidia stock's amazing performance so far in 2024 can be stated in two words: artificial intelligence. More specifically, it's generative AI, which has significantly expanded the potential applications of AI. This tech enables users to quickly generate new content of various types based on a variety of input categories, such as images and sounds.Generative AI captivated the tech world in November 2022 when OpenAI broadly released ChatGPT. This chatbot's popularity skyrocketed, leading to a frenzy among companies and other entities to obtain generative AI capabilities.Nvidia's data center: Its primary platform beneficiary of robust demand for AI capabilitiesNvidia's data center platform is its primary beneficiary of the strong demand among entities of all types to acquire generative AI capabilities. The data center is Nvidia's largest platform, accounting for 83% of its total revenue in its quarter ended Jan. 28. This business has been growing like gangbusters, as will be quantified below.Nvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) accelerate the processing of AI and high-performance computing workloads. The company's current flagship data center GPU is the H100, and its next Hopper architecture-based GPU, H200, is scheduled to begin shipping in the second quarter of this year. Its data center GPUs based on its next-generation architecture, Blackwell, promise a huge leap in performance and are expected to launch later this year.Story continuesNvidia stock entered 2024 with momentumIn 2023, Nvidia stock rocketed 239%, earning it the No. 2 spot among the S&P 500 index's top performers. (Super Micro Computer was the best performer with a 246% gain.) For context, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite returned 26.3% and 44.6%, respectively, last year.Nvidia stock's momentum at the end of 2023 and through late February 2024 was driven by the company's release of blockbuster quarterly results on Nov. 23, 2023. In its third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 206% and 593%, respectively, year over year. Growth was powered by the data center platform's revenue soaring 279% from the year-ago period.In 2024 through Feb. 21 (when the company released its next round of quarterly results), Nvidia stock gained 36.2%.Nvidia stock got a boost from the Feb. 21 quarterly earnings releaseOn Feb. 21, Nvidia released its report for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28). It was another blockbuster report, fueled by the data center platform's phenomenal AI-driven growth.For the quarter ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS rocketed 265% and 486%, respectively, year over year. Both results easily beat Wall Street's estimates. Growth was driven by the data center platform's 409% revenue surge. The gaming and professional visualization platforms also performed well, with their year-over-year revenue jumping 56% and 105%, respectively.Investors propelled shares up 16.4% on the day following the earnings release, and the stock continued to move upward through the end of the first quarter of 2024.Nvidia is poised for further phenomenal growthNvidia is poised to turn in another fantastic quarterly report. For the period ending in late April, management guided for revenue to grow 234% and adjusted EPS to increase 396% year over year.The AI revolution is in the early stages, so Nvidia has a potentially very long runway for growth.

Motley Fool,"3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now With $1,000 and Hold Forever",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-stocks-buy-144700890.html,These industry-leading brands can grow your savings for a long time.,"The S&P 500 index is up 31% over the past year, but there are several top companies with bright prospects that are poised to deliver more gains. If you have an extra $1,000 to invest, putting that money to work in a well-selected group of growth stocks could work wonders for your savings goals down the road.To get you started, read why three Motley Fool contributors believe Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), RH (NYSE: RH), and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) could grow your money for years to come.This winning stock's story is far from overJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon has already created wild shareholder wealth for those who invested early enough. It's been one of the best stocks to ever own on the stock market, and it's up 82% over the past year alone.But there's so much more to come. Amazon is a forever stock, and it has many opportunities coming at it from its different businesses.It's still the king of e-commerce that started the whole story, and e-commerce continues to increase as a percentage of total retail sales. Amazon is better positioned than any other company to benefit from this organic growth driver. It already accounts for more than a third of all U.S. e-commerce, and no other company comes anywhere close to its market share. It keeps upgrading its systems to improve and keep a wide distance from competitors. It's getting more deliveries to more customers overnight, and it's adding millions of products so shoppers don't have to go anywhere to get what they need.Amazon Web Services (AWS) similarly has a leading position in cloud computing, and it's launching powerful generative AI tools that keep it competitive. It's the preferred solution for high-profile companies like Walt Disney and Verizon Communications, and it has a strong pipeline of new customers and expanded deals. AWS is a high-margin business that accounted for 54% of total operating income in the 2023 fourth quarter.Story continuesIt's working on developing other new businesses, such as advertising, its fastest-growing segment. Total revenue increased 14% year over year, while advertising was up 27%. It's also a high-margin business that helps pad profits, and CEO Andy Jassy said it's ""still early days.""Even if you've missed Amazon's gains until now, you can still buy in today and enjoy years of growth.A proven winner turning the cornerJeremy Bowman (RH): It's been a rough couple of years for RH, the high-end home furnishings company formerly known as Restoration Hardware, but there are signs that it is finally turning the corner on what CEO Gary Friedman called ""the most challenging housing market in three decades.""Recent results have also suffered with net income down sharply over the last year, but that sets the company up for a recovery, and Friedman predicted that RH would gain significant market share this year.2024 is set to be a transformative year for the company as it is launching its ""most compelling product transformation and platform expansion in history.""RH has also been aggressively repurchasing its stock to take advantage of the recent sell-off, which also prepares it well for a recovery. In 2023, it reduced its shares outstanding by 20%, and over the last two years, shares outstanding have fallen by 35%.The company continues to expand its physical retail footprint, unlike most of its peers, with plans to add five new design galleries in North America, and two more internationally. The company is also doubling down on marketing in anticipation of a recovery, doubling its sourcebook circulation and increasing advertising in design publications.RH has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over its history, and it seems to be entering another growth cycle as it steps up its marketing efforts and benefits from an expected decline in interest rates and a recovery in the housing market.With a return to growth expected and a substantial decline in shares outstanding, RH's profits are likely to soar over the next few years.Shopify's growth story keeps getting betterJohn Ballard (Shopify): The leading online shopping and payments platform has strung together several strong earnings reports. The stock is up 73% over the last 12 months, but with the company starting to widen its offering, it could enter a lucrative stretch of growth to reward shareholders.Shopify is not just a platform helping businesses set up an online storefront. It also continues to introduce new features to the Shop App, which serves as a mobile storefront for small businesses and a powerful shopping assistant for consumers. The app reached $100 million in gross merchandise volume in a single month during the fourth quarter.Shopify's point-of-sale solutions for physical retail locations is another emerging growth catalyst. The company's offline gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 28% year over year in Q4 2023 -- faster than Shopify's total GMV, which grew 23%.Another opportunity is business-to-business (B2B) solutions. Shopify Collective is a new service that allows merchants to source products from other brands and ship them directly to customers. B2B is a $450 billion opportunity and management expects it to be a key driver of growth in 2024.With these services, Shopify is casting a wider net to win not only more share of e-commerce spending, but increasingly, the entire commerce market, too. The stock offers lots of upside over the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Should Investors Still Buy Carnival Cruise Stock Right Now, Even After Shares Doubled?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-still-buy-carnival-cruise-141500824.html,The stock's price tag doesn't tell the whole story.,"Famous cruise line Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL) has been a hot stock over the past year. Shares have nearly doubled. Investors buying the stock as a play on recovering consumer spending following the pandemic were proven right by the market.But now it could be time to lock in profits and say goodbye to Carnival stock.The company has done an admirable job of bouncing back to pre-pandemic top-line performance, but the pandemic's impact on the business has deteriorated Carnival's earning power.Investors should avoid buying shares now; those who own stock may even consider locking in profits.Here is why.The share price doesn't tell the whole storyIt took three painful years, but Carnival's business has rebounded. The company ended 2023 with $21.6 billion in revenue, roughly on par with 2019, the year before COVID-19 turned the business upside down.At first glance, something seems amiss in the below chart. The stock still trades at a fraction of its pre-pandemic share price despite revenue recovering fully.CCL Revenue (Annual) ChartWhy is that? Carnival had to take drastic measures to keep the business afloat when lockdowns virtually reduced revenue to nearly zero. After all, the company has overhead, even if ships aren't sailing. Shares were issued, and debt was incurred to raise the cash needed to keep Carnival alive and see its recovery through.Carnival's earnings aren't what they once wereAll that bloats the stock's valuation. Investors can see Carnival's enterprise value below. That is Carnival's market cap plus debt minus cash on hand. The company's enterprise value peaked at $60 billion, and today's $50 billion is much closer to said peak. If the stock were to hit $70 again, Carnival would be a much larger company than it ever was.CCL Enterprise Value ChartYou could also look at it from an earnings perspective. At its peak, Carnival earned over $4 per share in profit. Interest from debt reduces earnings, while having more shares dilutes investors by spreading Carnival's profits thinner. Analysts believe Carnival will earn $1.00 per share this year and $1.37 next year. That's a nice year-over-year jump in earnings, but it's coming from a far lower base number than it once was.Story continuesCCL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartCarnival will likely need to grow to justify more stock price appreciation. However, remember that Carnival is a capital-intensive business. New ships cost a ton of money to build, staff, and maintain, and Carnival's debt is putting a cap on fleet expansion. Management has stated that they're pulling back on spending to pay down debt. Three new ships will be delivered next year, but none will come in 2026, and just one in 2027.Here's the bottom lineIt's hard to see Carnival, already seen as an entry-level cruise line, raising its prices to grow earnings dramatically. The likely outcome is that earnings stagnate for a few years while Carnival gets its financial legs under it. Little growth and a bloated balance sheet don't bode well for the stock.Investors sitting on gains should claim profits in case this stock starts to sink.Should you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Small Cloud Stock Gearing Up for a New Round of Innovation -- Time to Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-small-cloud-stock-gearing-140000772.html,DigitalOcean may be about to unleash its AI training infrastructure for small businesses and developers to use.,"Tiny cloud infrastructure provider DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) closed out 2023 in a less-than-ideal fashion. Generative artificial intelligence infrastructure is starting to equate to a pickup in cloud computing spending among its tech titan peers, but not so much for DigitalOcean -- at least not yet.You see, the company made an AI start-up purchase of its own last summer, and it has a new CEO at the helm. Is it too late to buy the stock?The plan to accelerate growthDigitalOcean has made a name for itself providing affordable and easy-to-use ""Droplets"" -- a bit of computing power, operating in a data center, that a developer or start-up can use to operate a website or an app, store business data and run analytics, or perform some other digital work. That combination of easy and affordable has been palpable. DigitalOcean has built a loyal following of hundreds of thousands of customers, with an extensive library of content to help educate its users about all things cloud computing.Nevertheless, the bear market took a toll on many cloud businesses in 2022 and 2023 and finally caught up with DigitalOcean. While revenue did grow 20% year over year in 2023 to $693 million, fourth-quarter sales, in particular, slowed to just an 11% rate of increase.Additionally, management said it expects revenue to increase just 10% at the midpoint of guidance for 2024. That compares to tech researcher Gartner calling for overall global end-user cloud spending to accelerate to a 20% pace this year. Clearly, small businesses and developers are feeling the effects of a slower-growth global economy, and it's hitting DigitalOcean's financials.The good news, though, is that new CEO Paddy Srinivasan (who took over in February 2024) is taking the reins of a profitable company -- both on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and free-cash-flow basis.DOCN Revenue (TTM) ChartSrinivasan has a software developer background, having worked at several big tech companies and at a couple of small ones too. He explained to me in a recent conversation that the goal will be to reignite growth via innovation. DigitalOcean has the tools to do so.Story continuesLast summer, it acquired the AI training and development start-up Paperspace, which essentially landed DigitalOcean a fleet of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are in such short supply these days. With a great deal of DigitalOcean's developer interest flowing into Paperspace, the new management team expects to lean into those GPUs and unveil some new innovative products to help make AI a cinch for its customers -- just like the core DigitalOcean platform has done for basic cloud usage.Time to bet on a DigitalOcean comeback?DigitalOcean has been a wild investment since the bear market started a few years ago, and it's only rebounded about 50% since the start of 2023, about a year and a quarter ago. Some cloud software peers have rallied more than that. Viewed through that lens, DigitalOcean could have a great deal more to gain if it executes well on an AI software product strategy.Again, all the pieces are there for this business to heat up again. It has data center infrastructure installed around the globe, and just to emphasize that important point from earlier, DigitalOcean is profitable. That could lay the foundation for the next leg of growth.One area of concern, though, is the balance sheet. There was $412 million in cash and short-term investments, but $1.48 billion in debt, at the end of 2023. Servicing that debt could be a limiting factor for DigitalOcean in the years ahead. Time will tell.At this stage, I've been happy with how DigitalOcean managed through the bear market. It's a small business, and thus a small position in my portfolio. But if Srinivasan and the new management team start to execute well later this year and next, perhaps I'll nibble some more on this top cloud stock that's looking to innovate in the AI industry. I'm more than content to wait and see as a passive investor in this promising company.Should you invest $1,000 in DigitalOcean right now?Before you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DigitalOcean wasn’t one of them.
