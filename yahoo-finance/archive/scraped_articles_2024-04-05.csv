In December, the median price of a home sold reached $382,600, marking a 4.4% rise from the same month in 2022. This marks the sixth consecutive month of year-over-year price increases. Median home prices set a new record at $389,800 in 2023.Given this backdrop, the real estate market is considered one of the best investment options. Real estate investment has long been heralded as a potent avenue for generating passive income, offering investors the opportunity to build wealth while minimizing active involvement.What Are Real Estate Notes?Real estate notes, also known as mortgage notes or promissory notes, represent the debt that is owed on a property. The mortgage note is a tradable asset, allowing the original lender to sell it to another party and transfer the right to collect payments.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Here’s How To Invest In The City’s Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech Workers.A real estate note is a legal document that outlines the terms and conditions of a loan used to purchase real estate. This financial instrument is a binding agreement between the borrower and the lender, detailing the amount borrowed, interest rate, repayment schedule and other relevant terms. Real estate notes provide a structured framework for the repayment of funds and establish the rights and responsibilities of both parties involved in the transaction.One of the key benefits of real estate notes is the potential for passive income. Investors who hold real estate notes can enjoy a consistent cash flow without the day-to-day responsibilities of property management. Additionally, the fixed and predictable nature of payments outlined in the note provides a level of financial stability, making it an appealing option for those seeking a more secure investment avenue.Story continuesTrendingWant To Grow Your Wealth Passively? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy GrailHow To Invest In Real Estate NotesReal estate notes can be purchased from banks and other financial institutions as well as crowdfunding platforms. While traditional mortgage notes sold by banking institutions have been popular among investors, crowdfunding platforms have been steadily gaining momentum as they offer relatively higher returns.Connect Invest is a popular crowdfunding platform that specializes in short-term real estate notes spanning from six to 24 months. Connect Invest's average yields range from 7.5% to 9% and have a minimum investment requirement of $500. Connect Invest's default rate stands at 1.93% for over 1,200 funded loans, significantly lower than the default rate of 5.2% on U.S. commercial real estate loans.Real Estate Notes Vs. REITs: Which Are Better?Unlike real estate notes, which are primarily a debt instrument, real estate investment trusts (REIT) investments involve the purchase of equity shares of publicly traded companies. REITs own, operate or finance income-generating real estate across various sectors.Investors in REITs receive dividends based on the income generated by the underlying real estate properties, offering a way to participate in real estate markets without the need for direct property ownership. Real estate notes pay out interest payments on mortgage loans.For instance, Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR), one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the U.S., pays $1.72 in dividends annually, yielding 12.93% on the current share price.While real estate notes involve investing in mortgages or deeds of trust offering a fixed return, REITs are investment vehicles that pool funds to invest in various real estate properties. REITs typically bear higher risk compared to real estate notes, but they offer higher returns.Read Next:Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

Bloomberg,Stock Bull Run Powers Ahead After Blockbuster Jobs: Markets Wrap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-under-pressure-jobs-data-220903022.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock market is ending the week on a positive note after a blowout jobs report signaled the US economy will continue to power Corporate America — even if that means the potential for still elevated interest rates.Most Read from BloombergNY Region Rattled by 4.8 Magnitude Quake, Biggest in 140 YearsTurkey Joins NATO Allies in Suspending Europe Arms TreatyZimbabwe Announces New Currency Called the ZiG, Backed by GoldSaudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neo","(Bloomberg) -- Stocks rose after a solid jobs report showed the US economy is powering ahead despite bets the interest rates will remain higher for longer. Bond yields climbed alongside the dollar.Most Read from BloombergTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 BillionSaudi Crown Prince MBS’s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest FaltersS&P 500 Falls 1% as Oil Jump Spurs Flight to Bonds: Markets WrapGiving Up China Is Hard, Even for Argentina’s Anarcho-CapitalistApple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car FizzlesThe S&P 500 trimmed this week’s losses that were triggered by a hawkish repricing in Fed bets and a flare-up in geopolitical tensions. Treasury 10-year yields advanced seven basis points to 4.38%. The greenback climbed against all of its developed world counterparts.US job growth in March rose by the most in nearly a year and the unemployment rate dropped, pointing to a strong labor market that’s supporting the economy. Nonfarm payrolls advanced 303,000 — following a combined 22,000 upward revision to job gains in the prior two months. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%.Wall Street’s Reaction to Jobs:Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance:This morning’s blowout jobs numbers show that the economy isn’t showing any signs of slowing down and consumer spending should be able to hold up in the near term.This good news is bad news for the bond market – it makes the Fed’s propensity to cut sooner and more often less likely and we may not see the first rate cut until July – but it could be good news for the stock market.Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management:It’s a good report from a fundamental perspective. I do still think that the inflation number next week is the one that is pivotal.I still forecast a rate cut in June, but I’m waiting for that Wednesday CPI report shows. From a basic policy perspective there’s very little need to start cutting rates because the economy is still so strong.Story continuesJason Pride at Glenmede:Oops, we did it again. Today’s employment report showed a labor market that was again ahead of expectations.On the whole, this report doesn’t by itself alter the Fed’s rate cut plan, but along with other information could be used to argue for only 2 cuts in 2024, instead of the currently expected 3 cuts.Sonu Varghese at Carson Group:Another blowout payroll report suggests the economy is running strong and far from recession. On balance, this would push out any rate cuts by the Fed, but easing wage growth means we’re not in the middle of a labor-market induced inflation surge.Jim Baird at Plante Moran Financial Advisors:This is a strong labor economy that shows little sign of stalling in the near term. What’s it mean for interest rates? There’s even less reason for the Fed to feel any sense of urgency in announcing that much-anticipated first rate cut.Josh Jamner at ClearBridge Investments:While a strong job print at the margin means less need for the Fed to cut, a cooperative wage picture limits how much impact this jobs report will likely have on the Fed’s thinking. Next week’s inflation data will likely be more important on that front.Mark Hamrick at Bankrate:There’s a lot to like in the March employment report. The economy continues to display remarkable resilience, defying high interest rates and fears of a substantial slowdown.Federal Reserve officials can remain confident that they’re satisfying the maximum employment component of their dual mandate. The big question is when and if they can begin to cut interest rates in the battle against inflation.Michelle Cluver at Global X:Although the hotter-than-expected print raises questions about the timing for the Fed’s first interest rate cut, continued labor market strength remains encouraging for the economy. Additionally, wage pressure came in line with expectations, proving some comfort in a hot report.Glen Smith at GDS Wealth Management:Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report indicates that the economy remains resilient in 2024 even in the face of rising interest rates and a fading expectation of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year. The fact that the labor market is so strong shows that companies and the economy are adapting to high interest rates.David Russell at TradeStation:The economy is strong and getting stronger, consistent with some of the recent data. A June rate cut might be at risk, but next week’s CPI number will probably be a bigger litmus test for the Fed. The bears haven’t won yet.Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo at Goldman Sachs Asset Management:The above expectation headline number of 300k+ shows that there is still strength in the labor market. That said, it is no longer overheating given average hourly earnings was in line and that participation rate ticked up slightly.We still believe that the Fed will begin insurance cuts later this year to make the soft landing a reality. Especially given that some of the recent data away from payrolls has shown a decline in macro momentum.Alex McGrath at NorthEnd Private Wealth:Stop me if you’ve seen this headline before, but we have yet again another massive jobs beat. The reason for the beat at this point is irrelevant, the main take away is that once again the Fed is put in an impossible position. The rate cut lifeboats everyone was expecting have drifted further out to see and we are staying at the vast expanse of higher for longer.George Mateyo at Key Wealth:Given the underlying economic strength, the Fed will likely need to reconsider its current stance of three rate cuts this year. But, the reason for this likely change in posture is bullish – the economy is doing well and is tolerating higher interest rates better than most had expected.Giuseppe Sette at Toggle AI:In the short term, this will fuel fears of further inflationary pressures leading the Fed to hike again. In the mid-term however, this is one more sign of a healthy economy that’s not showing signs of recession Another blockbuster NFP puts the doves on the back foot once more. When the job market so strong and inflation is resilient, why should the Fed cut at all?Rob Swanke at Commonwealth Financial Network:While the jobs number came in stronger than expected, the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings came in line, so there hasn’t been much movement for rate cut expectations in June, which remain around 60%. Besides the good news from the jobs number, participation rose, and average hours worked rose which could help boost real income and spending in the economy without driving up inflation.Chris Larkin at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley:Today’s big upside surprise in the jobs report may not have closed the door on a June rate cut, but there’s a little less daylight coming through than there was a day ago. This will make next week’s CPI and PPI even more important. For months, the stock market has brushed off almost every troublesome bit of data that has come its way, but if those inflation numbers come in hotter than expected for a third month in a row, it could dent the market’s confidence about the Fed’s commitment to cutting rates some time in Q3.Joe Gaffoglio at Mutual of America Capital Management:Throughout 2024, the labor market has been resilient and today’s jobs report keeps that trend going. Even after the downward revisions to recent reports, this report underscores the strength of the job market within the broader context of a US economy that has continued to be largely resistant to the effects of higher rates.The ongoing strength of the labor market, coupled with inflation persisting above the Fed’s 2% target, is likely to uphold Powell’s cautious approach to monetary easing.Richard Flynn at Charles Schwab UK:Today’s jobs figures are stronger than expected, indicating that there is a high level of demand in the labor market. The Fed recently demonstrated its optimism surrounding employment by raising its longer-run expectation for the so-called neutral rate, which is the Goldilocks interest rate – low enough to avoid hurting the economy or increasing unemployment, but high enough to keep inflation at bay.Bryce Doty at Sit Investment Associates:Incredibly strong jobs data puts the bond market in panic mode over Fed cuts being delayed. I keep scratching my head wondering why so many people are deciding to get jobs now when millions of job openings have been available for at least a couple of years. It’s not as though the economy suddenly produced these jobs. So people joining the workforce now must need the jobs. As a result, I’m cautious about how strong the jobs data really is for the economy.We expect a quarter point cut in the third quarter and a half point cut in the fourth quarter.Corporate Highlights:Tesla Inc. is slashing prices of its best-selling vehicle in a bid to clear its biggest-ever stockpile.The company is marking down Model Y sport utility vehicles it has in inventory, with the rear-wheel drive version going for $4,600 less than the cost to custom order the sport utility vehicle.

Strong economic data — along with rising oil prices and improving financial conditions — have challenged the Federal Reserve’s plans to cut interest rates by three quarter points by year-end, with some officials floating the potential for no reductions.It’s been a painful spell for bond investors as a result. Many came into the year expecting the Fed would cut aggressively and that Treasuries would benefit. Instead, US debt lost about 1% last quarter. Positions that will gain in value if yields rise have been in demand in the options market over the past two days as traders take further steps to protect themselves.“We have long argued that markets have been too quick to write off the US economy and to assume that benign inflation would tee up an extended monetary easing cycle,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay.While still pricing in two cuts, bond traders have decided that a third reduction is closer to a coin toss.Earlier in the week, a broader range of positioning indicators including futures open interest and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Treasury client survey showed proliferating wagers on higher yields, although a portion of those appear to now have been exited as they paid off.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was up two basis points at 4.33% as of 10:15 in London. It rose to 4.43% earlier this week, a new high for the year.Story continuesAny further move higher in yields could present a buying opportunity for longer-term investors. The bond market continues to benefit from conviction that yields are sufficiently high relative to the effective overnight rate determined by the Fed.That was the finding of BMO Capital Markets’ monthly survey of investor intentions following the employment data.

Motley Fool,"In Defiance of Recent Rhetoric, 1 Wall Street Analyst Says Tesla Stock Still Has 88% Upside",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defiance-recent-rhetoric-1-wall-191454491.html,This storied EV maker is forcing investors and analysts alike to balance short-term noise with long-term value.,"These are tough times for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shareholders. The stock is down 60% from its 2021 peak, and trading near 52-week lows thanks to a recent wave of lowered price targets. The electric vehicle (EV) maker faces stiff competition now and failed to deliver as many EVs as analysts expected in Q1.One analyst, however, still believes in the EV manufacturer's long-term potential. While Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas did lower his price target on Tesla stock from $320 to $310 this past week, his new target suggests shares will climb 88% higher over the next 12 months.Fair arguments from both sides on TeslaAlthough Tesla reclaimed the title of the world's biggest electric vehicle maker (as measured by total cars delivered) in Q1, it temporarily lost that title to BYD in the final quarter of 2023. And, even the first quarter's reclamation of this top spot is tainted. Tesla's total EV deliveries fell from 422,875 in Q1 2023 to 386,810 cars last quarter, missing the consensus expectation of 454,200 units. It all points to fading demand, manufacturing challenges, or both. That's why it's not surprising Tesla stock's turned into a proverbial punching bag of late.Morgan Stanley's Jonas believes the selling has gotten out of hand though.While he acknowledges weakening results for its automotive business are worrisome, Jonas argues the stock's present price ignores longer-term opportunities in areas like energy storage and robotics. He also believes that once the ""ongoing EV shakeout"" has run its course, Tesla will remain a premier name in the still-growing EV business.What to do with the mixed messages over TeslaThe premise behind Jonas' bullish argument holds water -- the bearish rhetoric has taken on a life of its own, seemingly inspiring more of it.On the other hand, a 12-month price target of $310 is aggressively hopeful at this time. The smart-money move to make with Tesla right now is just steering clear of any bullish or bearish bets on it, and instead wait for the clarity that surfaces when cooler heads prevail.Story continuesWhere to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
