Market Research Analyst Adamas One Corp's strategic initiatives indicate a significant push towards vertical integration within the lab-grown diamond industry. The company's focus on quality, branding and expansion into new markets, such as the technology sector, is poised to capitalize on the growing acceptance and demand for lab-grown diamonds. With over 55% of loose diamond sales in the U.S. now attributed to lab-grown varieties, Adamas One's efforts to increase production capacity and enhance their e-commerce platform could address a larger market share. The acquisition of a high-quality diamond cutter and a diamond wholesaler/retailer could streamline the supply chain, potentially improving profit margins. However, such expansions require substantial capital and the company's approach to minimize dilution for existing shareholders during fundraising will be critical to investor sentiment. Financial Analyst Adamas One's decision to engage Cappello Global Capital for capital raising to support acquisitions is a strategic move that may bolster investor confidence by professionalizing the fundraising process. The company's clear intent to avoid diluting shareholder value during this phase is a positive sign for current investors. However, the costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of new assets into the company's operations will be a critical factor to watch in the coming financial periods. Investors should closely monitor the company's financial reports, audited by the newly appointed firm Turner, Stone and Company, L.L.P., for indicators of financial health and the success of these strategic moves. Technology Industry Analyst The formation of Adamas One Technologies™ and the company's focus on leveraging lab-grown diamonds within the semiconductor space is a forward-thinking initiative. Lab-grown diamonds have superior thermal and electrical properties that make them suitable for high-performance semiconductor applications. Collaborations with a National Laboratory and the use of AI solutions through NexGen AI to extend customer base and brand position suggest a commitment to innovation. The company's progress in adapting diamond substrates for new technology opportunities could open up lucrative avenues in the semiconductor industry, provided the R&D efforts translate into viable products. 02/24/2024 - 11:31 PM SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adamas One Corp. (Nasdaq: JEWL) (“Adamas One,” “Adamas” or the “Company”), The Original Lab-Grown Diamond Company™, a high-tech company that leverages proprietary technology to produce high-quality, single-crystal, Lab-Grown Diamonds for jewelry and diamond materials for technology and other industrial uses, provides a shareholder update from our CEO below: Upon closing out our first year as a publicly traded company, listed on the NASDAQ exchange, we wanted to reach out to you, our shareholders, with an update on our business and to thank you for both your support and patience. Being a young company listed in a difficult market has been challenging, but we learned, adjusted and now we are looking forward to a good year ahead. At Adamas One Corp, our strategy to build a successful and profitable company is based on three key initiatives: First, deliver the highest quality lab-grown diamond materials for the markets we serve. Second, become a highly integrated and branded supplier of lab-grown diamond jewelry, in order to facilitate our path to increased revenue and propel us into the fastest growing market segment. Third, leverage the company’s extensive IP and continued R&D efforts to exploit opportunities in new sectors, starting with the technology industry. Additionally, we used a portion of our proceeds to update our factory with state of the art equipment, including 12 full-capacity reactors, extensive backup systems, testing equipment, lasers for initial rough cutting and various other essential equipment. In addition, we fine-tuned our recipes to increase the color and clarity of our diamonds in preparation for expanded distribution. We have also increased our staff to meet our production and sales & marketing needs. In the spring we completed the designs for nearly 200 different pieces of jewelry for our Elle Jolie ™ luxury jewelry line, which we anticipate officially launching in Q2 of 2024. Following the completion of the design process we began manufacturing utilizing our proprietary scalable process. We also entered into an agreement with a renowned high-end digital agency to partner with us on the branding, marketing, e-commerce, and fulfillment of the Elle Jolie™ jewelry line. Our goal is to compete with high-end retailers by bringing sustainable luxury to the lab grown diamond sector in a way that delivers increased revenue and high gross margin. We have already delivered the first Elle Jolie™ pieces to lead customers and plan to initially market the line Direct to Consumer (DTC) through our ElleJolie.com eCommerce website. In the summer we launched our redesigned corporate website - AdamasOne.com with a fresh look aimed at raising our corporate visibility and demonstrating the value we are building for our shareholders. The new site includes a shopping feature for Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions and provides educational materials to help raise awareness of the value and benefits of Adamas’ lab-grown diamonds for our customers. We also announced our intention to acquire a high-quality diamond cutter to further optimize our diamond manufacturing process and control all aspects of production, as the cut and polish capabilities of this entity will add significant value to the company’s holdings. Furthermore, we intend to acquire a lab-grown diamond wholesaler/retailer with a presence in New York’s diamond district. Combined with our manufacturing, these companies will enable us to complete the cycle from “seed to sale” and become one the most vertically integrated lab grown diamond companies in the world. We have hired Cappello Global Capital to assist with the capital raise needed to acquire the target assets. Our goal is to have minimal to no dilutive effect on our current shareholder base from the funds raised to complete the transactions. We announced plans to increase our presence in the semiconductor sector space with the launch of our wholly owned subsidiary, Adamas One Technologies™, and put together an experienced team to determine how we can best adapt our diamond substrate for use into new technology opportunities. Over the course of the last year we have worked with a National Laboratory in advanced material science to perform extensive testing on our diamond materials to help increase our knowledge on how to best exploit the extraordinary physical properties of lab-grown diamonds within the semiconductor space. Awareness of lab-grown diamonds has grown exponentially over the past year, and we believe that now is the right time to increase our PR profile and leverage that awareness to increase the profile of Adamas One. As such, our CEO has been a regular on a handful of talk and morning shows highlighting how the company plans to take advantage of the positive trends and additional focus on the lab-grown diamond industry. Being a top U.S. based manufacturer puts us in an excellent position to take advantage of the timing in order to get our name and brand out to the domestic and international consumers. Additionally, we have been working with our partner, NexGen AI to leverage artificial intelligence solutions to develop and extend our customer base and further solidify our brand position. These AI based outreach opportunities have already generated a number of significant B2B openings for the company. When Adamas One first started in the industry, lab-grown diamonds represented less than 1% of loose diamond sales in the U.S., currently that figure is over 55%. Over the course of the last year, we have worked to put ourselves in a position to take advantage of the growth in the market and place ourselves as a dominant manufacture and distributor in the U.S. and international lab-grown diamond markets for both jewelry and technologies. Our confidence is very high for the adaptation and use of lab-grown diamonds in the semiconductor industry and we want to make sure that we are in the forefront of that industry as well as the loose and finished goods jewelry industry. We have hired Turner, Stone and Company, L.L.P. as our new audit firm. We look to work closely with them to get our future filings done in a timely manner. We understand the importance of our filings and wanted to make sure we are always compliant and in good status. We are very excited by the rapid development of the market over the past year and continue to work diligently to position the company to thrive.

Celldex Therapeutics Presents Positive 12 Week Results from Barzolvolimab Phase 2 Study in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria,2024-02-24T19:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Celldex Therapeutics (CLDX) reports positive 12-week results from Phase 2 trial of barzolvolimab in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), meeting primary and secondary endpoints with significant decreases in disease activity.

The treatment showed rapid onset within 2 weeks, favorable safety profile, and similar improvement in omalizumab-experienced/refractory and omalizumab-naïve disease. 52-week results and Phase 3 CSU trial initiations expected in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Celldex Therapeutics regarding the positive results of their Phase 2 clinical trial for barzolvolimab presents a significant development in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), especially for patients who have not responded to existing therapies like omalizumab. The data indicating clinically meaningful and statistically significant decreases in disease activity could position barzolvolimab as a leading therapy in a market currently limited by treatment options.From a research perspective, the mechanism of action of barzolvolimab, which involves the inhibition of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, is a departure from other treatments, targeting a fundamental aspect of mast cell function and survival. This novel approach could potentially offer benefits to a broader patient population, including those who are refractory to biologics like omalizumab. The safety profile also appears favorable, which is critical for patient compliance and long-term treatment success.Looking ahead, the initiation of Phase 3 trials and the anticipated 52-week results will be crucial in determining the long-term efficacy and safety of barzolvolimab. These outcomes will not only affect the drug's regulatory approval and market potential but will also influence investor confidence in Celldex Therapeutics. Financial Analyst The positive trial results for barzolvolimab are likely to have a favorable impact on Celldex Therapeutics' financial position. The achievement of primary and secondary endpoints in a Phase 2 trial typically leads to an increase in investor confidence, potentially driving up the company's stock price. Given that CSU is a condition with limited treatment options, a successful new entrant into the market could capture significant market share and generate substantial revenue for Celldex.Investors should note the potential for market expansion if barzolvolimab is approved, especially considering its efficacy in omalizumab-refractory patients. The company's strategic planning for a Phase 3 trial indicates a strong commitment to bringing the drug to market, which could further stimulate investment. However, the long-term financial impact will depend on the outcomes of the 52-week data and subsequent Phase 3 trials, as well as the competitive landscape and pricing strategies. Market Research Analyst The CSU treatment landscape is poised for change with the introduction of barzolvolimab. Market research indicates that there is a significant unmet need for effective treatments in the moderate to severe CSU patient population, particularly among those who do not respond to antihistamines or omalizumab. The reported rapid onset of action within two weeks and sustained activity of barzolvolimab could be a strong differentiator in the market.Furthermore, the favorable safety profile reported in the trial is a critical factor in patient and physician acceptance of a new treatment. If these results are replicated in Phase 3 trials and the drug gains approval, Celldex Therapeutics could capture a sizeable portion of the CSU market. The company's ability to effectively communicate these benefits to both the medical community and patients will be key to successful market penetration. 02/24/2024 - 02:05 PM - Primary and secondary endpoints met with clinically meaningful and statistically significant decreases in urticaria disease activity across multiple dose groups -- Sustained activity with rapid onset within 2 weeks -- Similar improvement in omalizumab-experienced/refractory and omalizumab-naïve disease consistent with unique mechanism of action -- Favorable safety profile -- 52 week results and Phase 3 CSU trial initiations anticipated in 2024 -- Company to host webcast February 25th at 9:45 am ET- HAMPTON, N.J., Feb. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLDX) announced today positive 12 week results from the Company’s Phase 2 clinical trial of barzolvolimab in patients with moderate to severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to antihistamines, including patients with biologic-refractory disease. The studies will continue dosing patients until week 52. Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT with high specificity and potently inhibits its activity, which is required for mast cell function and survival. CSU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals for 6 weeks or longer without identifiable specific triggers or causes. Treatment options for patients with CSU are limited and there are no approved therapies for patients who are not adequately controlled by omalizumab. The data were presented by Dr. Marcus Maurer, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, in a late breaking oral presentation (L18) as part of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting 2024. “These data continue to support barzolvolimab’s potential to bring meaningful improvements to patients suffering from this often very severe and debilitating disease,” said Marcus Maurer, M.D. “The novel mast cell depleting mechanism of barzolvolimab addresses the root driver of chronic spontaneous urticaria providing early, durable and, most importantly, the opportunity for complete disease control for patients who are not seeing meaningful benefits from the current standard of care, including patients with omalizumab refractory disease.” “We are thrilled to share these positive results, which we believe further establish barzolvolimab as a potential transformative treatment option for patients suffering with CSU, and are actively planning for the initiation of our Phase 3 program in CSU this summer,” commented Anthony S. Marucci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Celldex Therapeutics. “We also thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this study and look forward to reporting 52 week data later this year.” Data from the 208 patients randomized in the study showed that barzolvolimab achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, with a statistically significant mean change from baseline to week 12 in UAS7 (weekly urticaria activity score) compared to placebo at all dose levels. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in the study were also achieved at week 12 and strongly support the primary endpoint results, including changes in ISS7 (weekly itch severity score) and HSS7 (weekly hives severity score) and responder analyses. Importantly, barzolvolimab demonstrated rapid, durable and clinically meaningful responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups. The majority of patients on study had severe disease (UAS7≥28).

Barzolvolimab demonstrated strong improvement in UAS7 independent of omalizumab status at Week 12. Approximately 20% (n=41) of enrolled patients received prior treatment with omalizumab and more than half of these patients had omalizumab-refractory disease. These patients experienced a similar clinical benefit as the overall treated population within their individual dosing groups consistent with the barzolvolimab mechanism of action. Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity; through 12 weeks, the most common treatment emergent adverse events in barzolvolimab treated patients were urticaria/CSU (10%), hair color changes (9%), and neutropenia/ANC decrease (8%). The rate of infections was similar between barzolvolimab treated patients and placebo with no association between neutropenia and infections. Phase 2 Study Design The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of barzolvolimab in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy, to determine the optimal dosing strategy. 208 patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 75 mg every 4 weeks, 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period. After 16 weeks, patients then enter a 36-week active treatment period, in which patients receiving placebo or the 75 mg dose are randomized to receive barzolvolimab 150 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks; patients already randomized to the 150 mg and 300 mg treatment arms remain on the same regimen as during the placebo-controlled treatment period. After 52 weeks, patients then enter a follow-up period for an additional 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is mean change in baseline to Week 12 in UAS7 (weekly activity score). Secondary endpoints include other assessments of safety and clinical activity including ISS7 (weekly itch severity score), HSS7 (weekly hives severity score) and AAS7 (weekly angioedema activity score). For additional information on this trial (NCT05368285), please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov Webcast The Company will host a conference call/webcast tomorrow to discuss the results at 9:45 a.m. ET.

This historic event showcases innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem and highlights the potential for dynamic blockchain solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Blockchain Technology Analyst The recent development by OrdinalsBot, in collaboration with Marathon Digital Holdings, to mint the entire supply of a BRC-20 token in a single transaction is a significant technical milestone within the blockchain industry. This action demonstrates the evolving capability of the Bitcoin blockchain to support more complex operations, traditionally associated with platforms like Ethereum. By utilizing Slipstream, a service designed to facilitate such transactions, the companies are pushing the boundaries of Bitcoin's utility beyond its original design as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.In the broader context, this could signal a shift in the perception of Bitcoin's blockchain, potentially attracting interest from developers and enterprises seeking a more robust and versatile infrastructure. The introduction of Trio, a utility token for the OrdinalsBot platform, further underscores the expanding functionality of Bitcoin's network, which could lead to increased adoption and innovative applications. The impact on the business model of OrdinalsBot and Marathon Digital Holdings could be substantial, as they position themselves at the forefront of this emerging market segment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement by OrdinalsBot has implications for the valuation of Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA). The ability to mint a full token supply in one transaction could be seen as a competitive advantage, potentially streamlining processes for issuing tokens and reducing associated costs. This efficiency gain may translate into an attractive feature for potential clients and partners, which could lead to revenue growth for both OrdinalsBot and Marathon Digital Holdings.Furthermore, the pre-seed funding of $1.5 million secured by OrdinalsBot last year, along with the support from notable investors and advisors, suggests confidence in the company's trajectory. The successful launch of Trio and other projects in the pipeline could contribute positively to the company's expansion and financial performance, which investors should monitor closely for future growth opportunities. Cryptocurrency Market Analyst The minting of a BRC-20 token's full supply in a single transaction by OrdinalsBot, leveraging Marathon Digital Holdings' Slipstream service, has potential market implications. This development may influence the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market by introducing a new utility token, Trio and showcasing the expanded capabilities of Bitcoin's blockchain. As one of the first BRC-20 utility tokens, Trio could pave the way for more fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, which might attract interest from both developers and investors.As the cryptocurrency market is highly responsive to technological innovations, this news could lead to speculative trading behaviors around Marathon Digital Holdings' stock and the newly minted Trio token. The long-term impact on the cryptocurrency market will depend on the adoption rate of Trio and the subsequent projects launched by OrdinalsBot. It is essential for market participants to assess the viability and demand for these new offerings within the ecosystem. 02/24/2024 - 01:48 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OrdinalsBot, a premier technology infrastructure company which provides API solutions for Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20s, has minted the full supply of a BRC-20 token in a single Bitcoin transaction via Slipstream, a new service launched by Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA). This Bitcoin block represents a historical moment for the industry, being the first full supply of a BRC-20 token to be minted in a single transaction. This historic block is the first full supply of a BRC-20 token minted in a single transaction, showcasing the potential for a more dynamic Bitcoin blockchain. The block also includes a large file and a collection, not possible to achieve with standard transactions. OrdinalsBot’s work with Marathon Digital Holdings also represents an important moment for the Bitcoin ecosystem, as both companies combine their expertise to develop innovative solutions that further enrich the ecosystem. The collaboration is anticipated to further accelerate OrdinalsBot’s growth trajectory. Toby Lewis, cofounder of OrdinalsBot, said, ""It has been excellent working with the Marathon Digital Holdings team, and we believe we are on the verge of creating unprecedented value for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem."" Jullian Duran, product lead at Marathon Digital Holdings, said, “OrdinalsBot are leaders in the space who are working to innovate Bitcoin transacting. We appreciate their support of Slipstream, and we look forward to future collaborations.” The BRC-20 token mined in this particular block is a new utility token for the OrdinalsBot platform. Trio will be launched to help drive growth of the platform and adoption of their technology across the sector. Trio, one of the first BRC-20 utility tokens, is engineered to augment the capabilities of the OrdinalsBot tool for users in the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering new opportunities for developers and users alike. Brian Laughlan, Co-Founder of OrdinalsBot, commented, “BRC-20 introduced a new paradigm for fungible tokens with its fair mint mechanism, where people can only mint a specified max amount per transaction. The downside of this is that it makes it almost impossible for a project to take full control of their token supply. Via Slipstream, anyone can mint the full supply in one transaction.” OrdinalsBot has achieved notable growth, securing $1.5 million in pre-seed funding last year. Investors and advisors include Kestrel0x1, Sora Ventures, UTXO Management, Sebastien Borget (co-founder of Sandbox), Domo (inventor of the BRC-20 protocol), and others. The company’s commitment to providing state-of-the-art inscription services and developer tools has been recognized by clients and industry experts. Looking forward, OrdinalsBot is preparing to launch several projects that promise to significantly contribute to the company’s expansion and enhance customer value. “Our commitment to innovation in the Bitcoin Ordinals space remains unwavering,” Brian Laughlan added. “Projects we have in the pipeline are set to solidify our position as a premier infrastructure provider, enabling developers and transforming data inscription on the blockchain.” For press enquiries, please contact: info@ordinalsbot.com.

News Release Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reports its operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and 2022, showcasing a significant increase in net earnings attributable to shareholders. The company's investment and derivative gains, as well as operating earnings, have contributed to this positive financial performance. Berkshire's non-GAAP financial measures are also highlighted in the press release, emphasizing transparency and meaningful financial reporting. Positive Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reports a notable increase in net earnings attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 compared to 2022. The company's investment and derivative gains have significantly improved, contributing to the overall positive financial performance. Operating earnings for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. have also shown a substantial increase, reflecting a strong business performance. The press release emphasizes the use of non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful and transparent financial reporting to investors and the public. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by Berkshire Hathaway highlight significant net earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, contrasting sharply with the net loss reported for the full year of 2022. These figures are primarily driven by substantial investment and derivative gains, which include a noteworthy unrealized gain in their equity security investments and a remeasurement gain from an acquisition. The substantial increase in net earnings per share for both Class A and Class B shares represents a considerable turnaround from the previous year's losses.From a financial analysis standpoint, the volatility of investment gains and losses, as noted by Berkshire, suggests that operating earnings may provide a more stable measure of the company's performance. The reported increase in operating earnings year over year indicates an improved operational efficiency and profitability across Berkshire's diverse business segments. This is particularly evident in the insurance underwriting profits, which have shifted from a slight loss in 2022 to a significant gain in 2023.Moreover, the repurchase of shares to the tune of approximately $9.2 billion in 2023 reflects management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company, often seen as a positive signal to investors. The increase in insurance float also suggests growth in the insurance business, which is key for Berkshire's investment capacity. Market Research Analyst Analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's performance within the context of the broader market reveals the impact of market conditions on investment portfolios. The substantial unrealized gains in 2023 contrast with the unrealized losses of the previous year, indicating a potential market recovery or successful adjustments in investment strategy. The disclosure of a $2.4 billion remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of more interest in Pilot Travel Centers underscores strategic business decisions that may influence future revenue streams.The sector-specific performance, such as consistent earnings from the railroad segment and a notable increase in insurance-investment income, reflects resilience and adaptability in these industries. The utilities and energy sector showed a slight decrease in earnings, which may be attributed to fluctuating energy prices or operational challenges. Understanding these nuances is crucial for stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability of Berkshire's earnings and the potential impact of economic factors on its diverse portfolio. Economist The data presented by Berkshire Hathaway provides an opportunity to assess the economic implications of the company's performance. The significant earnings in a period following a net loss year suggest a robust recovery that may be partially reflective of broader economic trends. The reported foreign currency exchange losses related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt highlight the influence of global currency fluctuations on multinational corporations like Berkshire.The increase in insurance float by $5 billion suggests an accumulation of capital that can be deployed for investments, enhancing the company's ability to leverage economic opportunities. This strategic positioning, coupled with the share repurchases, indicates a proactive approach to capital management that could play a pivotal role in Berkshire's long-term economic prospects amidst a dynamic financial landscape. 02/24/2024 - 08:00 AM OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (BRK.A; BRK.B) – Berkshire’s operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the following paragraphs. However, we urge investors and reporters to read our 2023 Annual Report, which has been posted at www.berkshirehathaway.com. The limited information that follows in this press release is not adequate for making an informed investment judgment. Earnings (losses) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and 2022 are summarized below. Earnings (losses) are stated on an after-tax basis. (Dollar amounts are in millions, except for per share amounts). Fourth Quarter Full Year 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire shareholders $ 37,574 $ 18,080 $ 96,223 $ (22,759 ) Net earnings (loss) includes: Investment and derivative gains (losses) 29,093 11,455 58,873 (53,612 ) Operating earnings 8,481 6,625 37,350 30,853 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire shareholders $ 37,574 $ 18,080 $ 96,223 $ (22,759 ) Net earnings (loss) per average equivalent Class A Share $ 26,043 $ 12,355 $ 66,412 $ (15,494 ) Net earnings (loss) per average equivalent Class B Share $ 17.36 $ 8.24 $ 44.27 $ (10.33 ) Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding 1,442,785 1,463,422 1,448,880 1,468,876 Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding 2,164,177,636 2,195,133,576 2,173,319,709 2,203,313,642 Note: Per share amounts for the Class B shares are 1/1,500th of those shown for the Class A. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) require that we include the changes in unrealized gains/losses of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains/losses in our earnings statements. In the table above, investment gains (losses) in 2023 include gains of $29.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $53.0 billion in the full year and in 2022 include gains of $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter and losses of $53.8 billion in the full year due to changes during the fourth quarter and the full year in the unrealized gains that existed in our equity security investment holdings. Investment gains (losses) in 2023 also include after-tax realized losses on sales of investments of $330 million in the fourth quarter and after-tax realized gains of $3.6 billion in the full year and in 2022 include after-tax realized gains on sales of investments of $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter and $54 million in the full year. In 2023 investment gains also include a net remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion related to Berkshire’s acquisition of an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers. The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules. An analysis of Berkshire’s operating earnings follows (dollar amounts are in millions). Fourth Quarter Full Year 2023 2022 2023 2022 Insurance-underwriting $ 848 $ 160 $ 5,428 $ (30 ) Insurance-investment income 2,759 2,000 9,567 6,484 Railroad 1,355 1,469 5,087 5,946 Utilities and energy 632 739 2,331 3,904 Other businesses 3,691 3,709 15,112 14,040 Other* (804 ) (1,452 ) (175 ) 509 Operating earnings $ 8,481 $ 6,625 $ 37,350 $ 30,853 * Includes foreign currency exchange losses related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of approximately $684 million in the fourth quarter and gains of approximately $211 million in the full year in 2023 and in 2022 includes foreign currency exchange losses of approximately $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and gains of approximately $1.3 billion in the full year. Approximately $2.2 billion was used to repurchase Berkshire shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 bringing the total for the year to approximately $9.2 billion. On December 31, 2023 there were 1,441,483 Class A equivalent shares outstanding. At December 31, 2023, insurance float (the net liabilities we assume under insurance contracts) was approximately $169 billion, an increase of $5 billion since yearend 2022. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Berkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use Berkshire’s financial information. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains/losses and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. Although the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire’s operations, the generation of investment gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, as previously described, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, we are required to include the changes in unrealized gains/losses of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains/losses in our periodic earnings statements. In sum, investment gains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.

Pre-tax operating earnings, investment gains, and net earnings are detailed, with a focus on separating operating businesses from investment gains.","BIGLARI HOLDINGS INC. NEWS RELEASE Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Biglari Holdings Inc. (BH) releases its 2023 Annual Report, showcasing earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and 2022. Pre-tax operating earnings, investment gains, and net earnings are detailed, with a focus on separating operating businesses from investment gains. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Biglari Holdings Inc. as reflected in their annual report presents a notable turnaround in net earnings, with a significant recovery from a net loss in 2022 to substantial net earnings in 2023. The pre-tax operating earnings have also increased year-over-year, indicating improved core business operations. However, the most striking figure is the swing in investment gains, which went from a substantial loss in the previous year to a robust gain. This volatility in investment performance could be indicative of an aggressive investment strategy or a favorable market shift that the company capitalized on.Investors should consider the sustainability of these investment gains, as they may not be replicable year over year. The management's statement about the non-significance of quarterly or annual fluctuations in investments suggests a long-term investment perspective. However, stakeholders should scrutinize the 10-K for the nature of these investments and the risk profile of the company's portfolio. Understanding the company's operational efficiency and growth prospects requires a deep dive into the segments contributing to pre-tax operating earnings. Market Research Analyst Biglari Holdings' performance must be contextualized within the broader market and industry trends. The increase in pre-tax operating earnings suggests that the company has been effective in navigating market conditions and possibly outperforming competitors. A detailed analysis of industry benchmarks and comparison with peers would provide a clearer picture of Biglari's competitive position. Moreover, the change in investment gains could reflect broader market recovery or specific strategic choices that led to outperformance. Stakeholders would benefit from an understanding of how Biglari's business segments are responding to industry-specific challenges and opportunities.Given that Biglari Holdings operates in various sectors, including restaurants and insurance, the diverse sources of revenue add complexity to the analysis. It is crucial to evaluate the company's adaptability to consumer trends, regulatory changes and economic cycles. The resilience of their business model in the face of potential headwinds such as inflation, labor shortages, or supply chain disruptions should be a focal point of the analysis. Tax Specialist The report indicates a significant tax impact on net earnings, with income taxes and income attributable to noncontrolling interest moving from a positive figure in 2022 to a negative one in 2023. This shift could be a result of the improved profitability of the company, leading to higher tax liabilities. It's essential to evaluate the company's tax strategy and the effective tax rate to understand the sustainability of after-tax earnings.Additionally, the presence of noncontrolling interest suggests that there are minority stakeholders whose interests must be accounted for in the net earnings attributable to Biglari Holdings shareholders. The tax implications of investment gains and the structure of any noncontrolling interests should be analyzed for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health and the potential impact on shareholder value. 02/24/2024 - 07:29 AM San Antonio, TX, Feb. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Biglari Holdings Inc.'s (NYSE: BH.A; BH) 2023 Annual Report to the shareholders has been posted on the Internet, where it can be accessed at www.biglariholdings.com.

The study reveals increased tolerance to peanuts, tree nuts, egg, milk, and wheat in multi-food allergic patients as young as 1 year old, reducing the risk of severe allergic reactions. Positive None. Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 02:00 PM Detailed results from the NIH-sponsored Phase III OUtMATCH study showed treatment with Xolair increased the amount of peanuts, tree nuts, egg, milk and wheat that people as young as 1 year consumed without an allergic reaction The U.S. FDA recently approved Xolair as the first and only medicine for children and adults with one or more food allergies Allergic reactions can be life-threatening and it is estimated that food-related anaphylaxis results in 30,000 medical events treated in emergency rooms in the U.S. each year1-3 Basel, 25 February 2024 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today data from Stage 1 of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored pivotal Phase III OUtMATCH study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Xolair® (omalizumab) in patients allergic to peanuts and at least two other common foods were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and featured in a late-breaking symposium at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting. The study showed treatment with Xolair increased the amount of peanuts, milk, egg, wheat and tree nuts (cashew, hazelnut and walnut) that it took to cause moderate to severe allergic reactions in multi-food allergic people as young as 1 year. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of Xolair across its approved indications and in previous clinical trials.4 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the expanded use of Xolair in children and adults with IgE-mediated food allergies based on the OUtMATCH data. “Over the past 35 years, I have seen how debilitating food allergies can be for patients and their loved ones, as they are consumed by the fear of accidental exposure,” said Robert Wood, M.D., director of the Eudowood Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, and principal investigator of the OUtMATCH study. “While allergic reactions to exposures are common and often severe, there have been limited treatment advancements for food allergy. The results of the OUtMATCH study showed that anti-IgE therapy could significantly reduce the occurrence of allergic reactions across multiple foods in the event of an accidental exposure.” “Living with food allergies has a profound impact on patients and their families, causing significant stress and requiring constant vigilance,” said R. Sharon Chinthrajah, M.D., associate professor of medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research and OUtMATCH co-lead study investigator. “The OUtMATCH study demonstrated that anti-IgE therapy increased most patients’ threshold for an allergic reaction. This presents an important new treatment option for patients and families in its potential to reduce the risk of allergic reactions from accidental exposures they may face in day-to-day life.” One hundred eighty patients ages 1 to 55 years old entered Stage 1 of the OUtMATCH study unable to tolerate up to 100 mg of peanut protein (equivalent to about one third of a peanut), and up to 300 mg of at least two other food proteins among milk, egg, cashew, walnut, hazelnut and wheat. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges (including a placebo ingredient) to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Results showed that, compared to placebo, a statistically significant (p<0.001) higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were able to consume at least 600 mg of peanut protein and at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg and cashew protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Additionally, compared to placebo, a higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were also able to consume at least 1,000 mg of walnut, hazelnut and wheat protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Detailed results are included in the table below. OUtMATCH Primary and Secondary Endpoints Results in Paediatric Population (n=177)Percentage of Patients Successfully Consuming Predefined Threshold Dose of Seven Foods Approximate Equivalents5 Xolair Treated Patients Placebo Treated Patients Number of Patients Primary Endpoint Peanut (≥600 mg) 95% CI for difference: 47 to 70; p<0.001 2.5 peanuts or 1/2 teaspoon of regular peanut butter 67% 7% 177 Key Secondary Endpoints Cashew (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 19 to 52; p<0.001 3.5 cashews 41% 3% 99 Egg (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 46 to 79; p<0.001 1/4 of an egg 67% 0% 71 Milk (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 30 to 74; p<0.001 2 tablespoons of 1% milk 66% 10% 62 Additional Secondary Endpoints Walnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 27 to 68 3 walnut halves 64% 13% 78 Hazelnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: -2 to 78 4.5 hazelnuts 65% 14% 24 Wheat (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 13 to 88 3.5 saltine crackers 75% 13% 20 Additionally, out of three adult OUtMATCH participants, two completed Stage 1 of the study; the adult who received Xolair met the primary endpoint compared to the placebo-enrolled adult patient. Adverse event rates in the study were similar between Xolair and placebo. The most common adverse event in Xolair-treated children and adolescents was injection site reaction (9%). “The Phase III OUtMATCH results represent a major advance and reinforce our commitment to addressing critical gaps in care for conditions like food allergy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Now recently FDA-approved, Xolair provides a new way to help manage food allergies for children and adults who live with the constant fear of life-threatening allergic reactions.” While efficacy cannot be established from uncontrolled, open-label studies, for 38 children who continued Xolair for 24-28 weeks in an open-label extension, the percentage of patients who were able to consume 600 mg or more of peanut protein and 1,000 mg or more of egg, milk and/or cashew protein without moderate to severe dose-limiting symptoms was maintained. About 3.4 million children and 13.6 million adults in the U.S. will have been diagnosed with IgE-mediated food allergies, based on estimates for 2024.1,2 Food allergy prevalence has been on the rise for the past 20 years.6 There are 160 different foods that cause IgE-mediated food allergy.7 Allergic reactions can range from mild to moderate, including hives and swelling, to severe and life-threatening, such as anaphylaxis.3 More than 40% of children and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction at least once, and it is estimated that food-related anaphylaxis results in 30,000 medical events treated in emergency rooms in the U.S. each year.1-3 On 16 February, 2024, the FDA approved Xolair for the reduction of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods in adult and paediatric patients aged 1 year and older with IgE-mediated food allergy. People taking Xolair for food allergies should continue to avoid all foods they are allergic to (commonly referred to as “food allergen avoidance”). Xolair should not be used for the emergency treatment of any allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Xolair is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce allergic reactions in people with one or more food allergies. In the U.S., Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. About the OUtMATCH StudyThe Omalizumab as Monotherapy and as Adjunct Therapy to Multi-Allergen Oral Immunotherapy in Food Allergic Children and Adults (OUtMATCH; NCT03881696) study is an NIH-sponsored, three-stage, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Xolair safety and efficacy in patients aged 1 to 55 years who are allergic to peanuts and at least two other common foods. Stage 1 included 180 patients (177 children and adolescents; 3 adults) who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or Xolair injections either every two weeks or every four weeks for 16 to 20 weeks. The Xolair dose and dosing interval were determined by total serum IgE level and body weight at baseline. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges where they were given gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein, two other food proteins they were allergic to, and a placebo ingredient. The food challenges were conducted in a carefully controlled setting with investigators looking for signs and symptoms of allergic reaction to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing dose-limiting symptoms, which were defined as moderate to severe allergic reactions, including skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. The OUtMATCH study is being sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) at 10 clinical sites across the U.S. led by Johns Hopkins Children's Center and co-led by Stanford School of Medicine. The study is also supported by Genentech and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About Xolair Xolair is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimises the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.

Financial Analyst Share buyback programs often signal a company's confidence in its own financial health and future prospects. In the case of Tenaris S.A., the announcement of a $1.2 billion buyback program represents a significant capital allocation decision. By opting to cancel the acquired shares, Tenaris is effectively reducing its shares outstanding, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially enhance shareholder value. The timing of buyback programs can be critical, as they are often executed when management believes the shares are undervalued. The non-discretionary agreement with the financial institution ensures that the buyback is conducted without Tenaris's influence, which is designed to prevent potential market manipulation and adhere to regulatory compliance.From a financial perspective, the market will often react positively to such news, as it may imply that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. It is also an indication that the company is generating enough cash flow to fund significant share repurchases without compromising its operational capabilities or investment opportunities. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such a program, as the capital used for share repurchases could alternatively be used for expansion, debt reduction, or other investments that might also drive long-term growth. Market Research Analyst It is essential to understand the broader market implications of Tenaris's share buyback program. The steel pipe manufacturing industry is influenced by global demand for energy, as Tenaris's products are primarily used in the oil and gas sector. With the cyclical nature of these industries, Tenaris's decision to engage in a buyback program could reflect an internal analysis that anticipates stable or increasing demand for its products. Moreover, buybacks can be a tool for adjusting capital structure and improving financial ratios, which may make the company more attractive in the eyes of investors and analysts.Additionally, the market will monitor the execution of this buyback program closely, as the timing and volume of share repurchases can affect stock price dynamics. If the Bank executing the buyback operates during market downturns or periods of low liquidity, it could provide a floor for the stock price. However, it is also important for investors to scrutinize the long-term effects on the company's balance sheet and whether the buyback aligns with broader strategic initiatives that include investment in innovation and market expansion. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding share buybacks is complex and highly regulated to ensure fair market practices. Tenaris's compliance with the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 is crucial to maintain the integrity of the financial markets. These regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and market manipulation by stipulating strict rules on how and when a company can repurchase its own shares. The non-discretionary nature of the agreement with the Bank ensures that Tenaris remains at arm's length from the decision-making process related to the timing of the share purchases.This legal framework provides a safeguard for investors, ensuring that the buyback is conducted in a manner that is both transparent and compliant with the law. The fact that Tenaris can continue to purchase shares during closed periods, as allowed under the Regulations, indicates the robustness of the compliance measures in place. Investors should take comfort in the company's adherence to these regulations, which helps to mitigate legal risk and uphold market confidence. 02/25/2024 - 11:55 AM LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaris S.A.
