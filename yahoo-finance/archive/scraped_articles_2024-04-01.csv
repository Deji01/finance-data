But the bigger forces bringing down rent inflation remain intact.New data from Apartment List published last week showed that median rent costs nationwide rose by 0.6% in March, the second straight monthly increase after six consecutive monthly declines. The median cost of rent now stands at $1,388.Over the last 12 months, however, rent costs are down 0.8% and look set to continue easing inflation pressures.March saw monthly rents rise in 81 of the top 100 cities, though only 42 cities recorded year-over-year growth. Regionally, the Sun Belt has logged notable rent declines as an influx of multifamily units cooled off the market.The surge in new apartment supply has also pushed vacancies up, with the national index hitting 6.7%, the highest since July 2020. The figure solidifies the two-year trend of easing multifamily occupancy, and supply isn't set to slow.In its report, Apartment List noted 2023 saw a record number of multifamily units completed, ""and an even greater number of new units are expected to come on the market this year.""Rent has been a major influence on inflation, with the cost of shelter, while moderating on a monthly basis, still accounting for about two-thirds of the annual increase in consumer prices seen in February.However, the slowdown in rent prices that began back in 2022 is still feeding through the data and is expected to bring inflation pressures down later this year.""The Apartment List National Rent Index has proven to be a strong leading indicator of the CPI housing and rent components, since our index captures price changes in new leases, which are only later reflected in price changes across all leases (i.e., what the CPI measures),"" the report said.""And while rent growth as measured by our index was cooling over the course of 2022, the CPI measure continued to rise. But as we had long been predicting, the shelter component of CPI finally turned the corner last spring and has been steadily cooling off ever since. As the official measure of shelter inflation continues to trend down, it will help ease overall inflation as well.""Mon, April 1, 2024 at 10:50 AM PDTInes FerréTesla hikes prices in US and China despite rivals' cuts and incentivesTesla (TSLA) stock slid 2% on Monday after the electric vehicle giant rose prices across a number of regions on the first day of the second quarter.Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:In the US, Tesla hiked prices of its popular Model Y SUV across all three trim levels by $1,000.

The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.""TMTG has historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities,"" the filing read.""TMTG expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future, as it works to expand its user base, attracting more platform partners and advertisers.""Truth Social has lured about 9 million users since its inception. But its success largely depends on the ""reputation and popularity"" of former President Donald Trump.""TMTG may be subject to greater risks than typical social media platforms because of the focus of its offerings and the involvement of President Trump,"" the company said, citing risks that include the harassment of advertisers and criticism of Truth Social's moderation practices.""The value of TMTG's brand may diminish if the popularity of President Trump were to suffer.""The filing also revealed stakeholders are still subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares.Trump maintains a roughly 60% stake in Truth Social, a stake currently worth more than $3 billion at current trading levels.The opportunity to cash in by selling some of his stake in the company could help the former president as he faces a $454 million fraud penalty and grapples with a campaign fundraising shortfall ahead of his 2024 election rematch against Biden.The only exception to the lockup period would be if the company's board votes to make a special dispensation. Although possible, experts told Yahoo Finance last week the attempt would likely result in multiple lawsuits on the behalf of public shareholders.Read more here.

Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity while readings below 50 indicate contraction.""Demand was positive, output strengthened and inputs remained accommodative,"" Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, said in the company's release.Notably, this could be a welcome sign for stocks. An uptick in the manufacturing sector has been highlighted by Wall Street strategists searching for further signs the broadening of the stock market rally has more room to run.""We see continued signs of a manufacturing upcycle, signaling an end to the third-longest manufacturing downturn in history,"" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients last month.""Inventory levels are now just back to normal, a re-stocking cycle could be next, and early indicators suggest a manufacturing upcycle ahead. Historically, when the manufacturing PMI has been in expansion, S&P 500 EPS has grown 12% on average on a trailing [12 month] basis.""Kwon's team at Bank of America noted this turnaround while boosting its S&P 500 earnings forecast this year to $250 from $235.Mon, April 1, 2024 at 8:50 AM PDTBrian SozziThis something to watch on McDonald'sTrue story.After burning 3,251 calories on Friday (did two, one-hour bootcamp training classes), I decided to reach for a rare fast-food treat. A McDonald's (MCD) spicy chicken sandwich and a diet soda. I didn't look at the price for the product on the menu board and I quickly tossed the receipt. But I do remember leaving there feeling the purchase was a lot for a chicken sandwich and a diet soda.So a new McDonald's note today from Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo is well-timed.Gargiulo's point is that McDonald's has been more aggressive the past year in raising prices to combat inflation. In turn, a trip to McDonald's may no longer be affordable to lower income consumers and traffic could take a hit. This cohort's go-to in a land of McDonald's inflation: food-at-home.How aggressive McDonald's has been on price hikes is neatly captured in the below chart from Gargiulo.Given the prices on these signature fast-food burgers, maybe a frozen dinner from Conagra (CAG; reports earnings later this week) is the better financial option for most!The inflationary burger.

On a per-share basis, estimated earnings for the first quarter have dropped by 2.5% since Dec. 31. This decline is smaller than the five-year average drop of 3.7% and 10-year average decrease of 3.4%. The vibe: analysts are feeling more optimistic than the norm ahead of first quarter earnings season, likely due to the market's robust advance.Companies: Approximately 112 companies from the S&P 500 have issued first quarter earnings guidance, with 79 issuing warnings and the rest upside versus estimates.

Shares of Alphabet are up 8% year to date, lagging the Nasdaq Composite’s 9% gain and S&P 500’s 10.16% advance.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is out with a few reasons this morning for why the stock is sucking wind.Out of all of them, I am most intrigued by the call out on management concerns. CEO Sundar Pichai has had a challenging 12 months on the AI front — from falling behind Microsoft (MSFT) on AI to not quieting concerns about AI bias. Is he in the hot seat with investors? I wouldn’t go that far yet, but it warrants watching.Those Jefferies mentions:Generative AI is a long-term threat to Alphabet's core search behemoth.Thill says ""some investors"" are asking if Pichai has led with ""enough force"" in responding to the AI threat.

You may also need a pair of sunglasses when looking at how markets and certain stocks will start in April.A little data analysis from yours truly (hat tip to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre for the stats):The S&P 500 is the best-performing major US index year to date, up 10.16%. (It's the only major index to be up by double-digits.)Four well-known sector ETFs are up by double-digits year to date: Energy (XLE), Financials (XLF), Industrials (XLI), and Communication Services (XLC). Energy is the best performer, tracking the renewed move higher in oil prices.The main real estate ETF, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE), is down 1.3% year to date, one of the worst performers despite the prospect of lower interest rates at some point this year.Two of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks — Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) — are down double-digit percentages year to date.The best Dow performer year to date is Disney (DIS), +35% and hovering at a record high ahead of this week’s showdown between Disney CEO Bob Iger and activist Nelson Peltz. More on that from Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal here.The worst Dow performer year to date: Boeing (BA), -25%. No surprise here.The best-performing Nasdaq 100 stock that is not named Nvidia (NVDA): Constellation Energy (CEG), +58%.

Motley Fool,Is Moderna Stock Going to $214? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-stock-going-214-1-195203793.html,"Moderna, famous for its coronavirus vaccine, is only at the start of a trip skyward, a market professional believes.","For many, Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) stock is yesterday's news. The stock earned a great deal of attention during the coronavirus pandemic, as it was one of the early developers of a vaccine to fight off the global health scourge. Since then, it's been a bit of an off-radar stock, largely because it hasn't yet commercialized any other medications.The lack of attention at the moment presents a fine opportunity to grab a deep-bargain stock, in the opinion of one analyst tracking Moderna. Here's why he thinks the biotech is poised for a monster comeback.Potential price appreciation of over 100%Piper Sandler's Edward Tenthoff is resolutely and emphatically bullish on Moderna's future. At the end of March, he reiterated both his overweight (read: buy) recommendation on the stock and his target of $214 per share price appreciation over the next 12 months or so. Tenthoff's confidence is apparent, as that level is more than double Moderna's most recent closing price of around $106.Moderna's coronavirus profit-generating heyday is behind it, although it still makes plenty of revenue selling Spikevax (the updated version of its COVID-19 vaccine). Yet the Piper Sandler pundit believes a new phase of the biotech company's life is about to kick off. He wrote in an analyst note that Moderna's mRNA-1345, a vaccine guarding against the widespread respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is likely to win Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval within several weeks.Meanwhile, recent clinical trials indicate that investigational vaccines against viral threats such as Epstein-Barr (EBV) and norovirus are efficacious and safe. As such, they could be brisk sellers for the company.Fresh technology, great potentialModerna is most renowned for harnessing messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA; not coincidentally the company's ticker symbol) in the service of developing medicines. This is relatively new and still edgy technology that promises medical progress on a host of afflictions. The idea that Moderna is only at the start of a long and lucrative journey is entirely plausible, as is a potential doubling -- and then some -- of its current share price.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Moderna right now?Before you buy stock in Moderna, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Moderna wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Bank of America Stock Is Going to $44. Is It a Buy at Around $37?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-192033371.html,The skillfully-managed lender is doing particularly well in certain key areas like the capital markets.,"As April gets underway, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stock trades around $37.50 per share, quite close to its 52-week high.Although some analysts can get jittery when a stock approaches a near-term peak, one of Bank of America's fellow lending giants doesn't appear to be. In fact, it recently raised its price target on BofA stock by 10% and maintained its equivalent of a buy recommendation.Is this enthusiasm realistic, though?All's well, according to WellsThe banking peer providing the price target boost was Wells Fargo. As March came to a close, its prognosticator Mike Mayo upped his Bank of America price target to $44 per share over the next 12 months or so, from the preceding $40. In doing so, he kept his overweight rating intact on the stock.Mayo's move came on the back of the analyst's uptick in his estimate for Bank of America's current (first) quarter per-share earnings figure.He said one factor in this was more-robust-than-expected capital markets -- the company is energetically active in investment banking. In fact, it set new revenue records for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023 in its global markets division. Other bright spots, in Mayo's view, include what he termed the bank's ""solid"" credit and expense management. All should result in a return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) of around 13%.A bank for believersBanks are cyclical businesses, so if you're a believer in the near future of the U.S. economy, Bank of America is a good stock play. It's not the most efficient or dynamic of the big four -- for my money, JPMorgan Chase tops it in both respects -- but it's an influential lender that's effectively managed and should continue to do well as long as our economy keeps humming.Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

Early pricing discussions are for a yield in the mid-10% area, people with knowledge of the matter said.Representatives for Rakuten and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is leading the deal, didn’t respond to requests for comment.A call for investors was held at 11 a.m. New York time and the notes are expected to price later this week, the people said.Rakuten’s latest deal follows a $1.8 billion bond offering in January which yielded 12.125%, a record high yield for a Japanese firm issuing in US dollars, Bloomberg previously reported.

Motley Fool,Is Devon Energy Stock Going to $59? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-stock-going-59-185205601.html,The high-yield energy stock received another upgrade recently.,"High-yield energy stock Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) has a 15.5% upside over the next 12 months or so. At least it does if you believe analysts at Wells Fargo, who just raised the price target on Devon Energy stock to $59 from $46 previously and upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight.""Devon Energy's improving asset baseOne reason for the upgrade is enthusiasm for the company's capital allocation plan and focus on its core assets in the Delaware Basin (straddling west Texas and New Mexico). Devon Energy is allocating 60% of its $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion capital allocation in 2024 to the Delaware basin.The analyst believes that Devon's drilling activity in these assets in early 2024 will improve well efficiency. It's a view shared by management, as its 2024 plan calls for its investment in drilling in the Delaware Basin to improve well productivity by up to 10%.As previously discussed, the company has a good track record of expanding production and making extensions and discoveries to its resources.More than just a high-yield stockIf the analyst is correct, Devon Energy will be an even more attractive stock. The current production rate and free cash flow generation imply a significant return to investors (either by share buybacks or dividends) in 2024. By my calculations and management's estimates (including returning of 70% of cash flow to investors), Devon Energy could return up to 6.7% of its market cap in share buybacks and dividends this year.It's understandable if investors focus on the dividend, but the reality is management is willing to prioritize share buybacks depending on the valuation.DVN ChartA reduced share count is good news for investors because it increases their share of a claim on future cash flows from the company. In addition, if Devon continues to grow its resources and well productivity, and the price of oil stays at about $80 a barrel, investors can expect significantly more dividends in the future.

Motley Fool,Tesla's Strides in This Game-Changing Technology Make the Stock a Magnificent Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-strides-game-changing-technology-184900802.html,Tesla claims its full self-driving technology can drive you almost anywhere...with a caveat.,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has pursued full self-driving (FSD) technology for years. While it's not there yet, the company seems to have gotten closer based on its optimism on version 12.3 of its FSD software.It's a big deal, because Tesla's opportunity to implement FSD software in multiple ways, from licensing to robotaxis, has long been a critical pillar in a long-term investment thesis.How is FSD different from past versions, and what hints does Tesla give about its confidence in the technology? More importantly, does this development make the stock a buy? Here is what you need to know.Version 12.3 is different than the othersWhy did version 12.3 of Tesla's FSD software catch my attention? Tesla CEO Elon Musk has pushed this version publicly, arguably more so than any recent version. This is evidenced by a companywide mandate that all new Tesla deliveries would include a demo of the FSD technology for customers. Additionally, the company has begun marketing FSD's capabilities more aggressively, though it's doing so with the word supervision slipped in.The company has commented on social media videos of FSD in action, stating, ""Under your supervision, FSD V12.3 can drive your Tesla almost anywhere."" The company has also started rolling out a 30-day free trial of FSD for U.S. customers. Again, version 12.3 isn't perfect, but the uptick in publicity seemingly signals increased confidence in the technology.What's the significant technological difference from previous versions? Elon Musk stated in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that it had replaced 330,000 lines of coding with neural nets, technology that wasn't available several years back. It's using artificial intelligence (AI) for the first time for planning logic and vehicle controls.This leap in progress in version 12.3 could signal that computing technology is finally becoming advanced enough to move closer to perfecting FSD. What will FSD look like in a year? Three years from now? This is where having a long-term mindset can give you an advantage.Story continuesIs this the beginning of a business transition?For the time being, Tesla is having a tough time. The company's deliveries have struggled, as high interest rates make vehicle loans more expensive. The electric vehicle market is also a bit soft right now. Tesla cut prices to try to spur demand, creating a double whammy of deteriorating growth and profit margins.TSLA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) ChartThe optimistic argument is that FSD becomes a more significant part of the business. FSD is software, so it will have far higher profit margins than the vehicles, essentially creating a razor-and-blade business model where the car sells cheaply and the profit comes from the recurring software revenue that pours in over the vehicle's lifespan.Ultimately, it's too early to tell whether Tesla is evolving into this lucrative model or if it will resemble a traditional automotive company over the long term. The lack of clarity explains why shares are down over 50% from their high.Tesla could be a bargain in hindsightSimply put, if you don't believe that FSD can be achieved, Tesla probably isn't a stock for you. However, if it does work, Wall Street could look back at this moment as a great buying opportunity. Analysts believe earnings will grow by 18% annually over the next three to five years. I'll admit that Tesla's forward P/E of 58 feels a bit lofty if these estimates are accurate.However, the success of FSD could make these estimates virtually irrelevant. Some believe that autonomous driving will grow to become a $2.2 trillion industry by 2030. Even without FSD, Tesla has many opportunities, including robotics, AI, and new EV models like the Cybertruck. With Tesla, you almost have to consider the company's track record and narrative as much as traditional valuation metrics.Those who believe the company can deliver should consider buying shares slowly, utilizing a dollar-cost averaging approach to steadily build a position over time. That way, investors aren't fully committed and can monitor how Tesla's FSD develops over the coming quarters.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,"Carnival Stock Has 54% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carnival-stock-54-upside-according-183425639.html,"Strong demand for cruises is lifting ticket prices, and that bodes well for the company's profits.","Strong demand in travel has sent Carnival (NYSE: CCL) shares up 60% over the last year, but the stock's recent pullback could be a great buying opportunity, according to analysts at Stifel Financial.Following another strong earnings report last week, Stifel maintained a buy rating on the stock. The firm knocked $1 off its previous price target, but at $25, the analysts still see 54% upside over the next 12 months or so from the current share price of $16.21.Why analysts like the stockThe cruise industry is seeing strong demand over the last few years, and it's reflected in Carnival's business performance. On many metrics, Carnival has made a full recovery from the pandemic-related disruptions a few years ago. It reported record quarterly revenue of $5.4 billion last quarter, bringing its trailing-12-month revenue to a new high of $22.57 billion.While the company is still in the process of improving its profitability back to pre-pandemic levels, its better-than-expected adjusted net loss in the quarter shows a positive direction for the business.Stifel's analyst believes that if consumer demand holds up, Carnival should beat its profit guidance for fiscal 2024, and that could fuel the stock higher.Is Carnival stock a buy?The stock appears fairly valued at around $16, as it is trading around its pre-pandemic valuation on an enterprise value-to-revenue basis. This means Carnival will have to show further improvement on the bottom line to deliver meaningful gains for investors.Carnival's operating profit was $2.4 billion over the last four quarters, almost back to the $3.2 billion it reported before the pandemic.It may not hit the analyst's price target until the company begins to report record profits beyond pre-pandemic levels. On that note, strong demand is lifting average ticket prices, which could serve as the trigger that strengthens Carnival's profits this year and sends the share price higher.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,The Biden stock market is swamping Trump’s,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-biden-stock-market-is-swamping-trumps-182858118.html,"President Biden has a roaring stock market to brag about. So far, it's not helping his standing with voters.","You probably shouldn’t take investing advice from Donald Trump.In 2020, Trump famously predicted that “the stock market will crash” if Joe Biden became president. Biden did, and equity investors have since turned a handsome profit.Since Biden took office, the S&P 500 stock index has risen a healthy 40%, capped by a five-month rally that kicked off last October and is still underway. At the same point in Trump’s presidential term, the S&P was up just 13%.There’s a huge asterisk. Stocks did well under Trump until the COVID pandemic hit in February 2020. Through each president’s first three years, in fact, the Trump stock market outperformed the Biden market by about 5 percentage points.The COVID pandemic, however, triggered a sharp stock sell-off in the first half of 2020 and a deep, though short-lived, recession. Trump loved to brag about the stock market and the economy during his time in office, but COVID left Trump with a damaged economy, contributing to his loss against Biden in 2020.Of all the things affecting stock prices, presidential policies aren’t normally in the top five. So it might seem a bit silly to compare stock market returns under the two presidents, who are heading toward a 2020 rematch in this year’s presidential election.Except that Trump himself takes credit when stocks go up, even when he’s out of office. While he was president, Trump bragged repeatedly when stocks rose, attributing the gains to his own policies. Earlier this year, three years after leaving office, Trump even claimed that stocks were rising because he was leading Biden in polls and investors were betting on another Trump presidency that would be starting 12 months hence.Back in 2020, Biden dinged Trump for his stock market boasts, arguing that Trump was playing up gains for the investor class that ordinary working people didn’t get to enjoy. But even Biden now likes to remind voters that “the stock market going strong is a sign of confidence in America’s economy.”Story continuesRising stocks certainly are bullish for the US economy, and they should be bullish for the incumbent president. More than 60% of Americans own stocks — mainly in their retirement accounts — and when investing accounts rise in value, a “wealth effect” makes people more optimistic and more likely to spend money.Broadly speaking, US stocks normally rise over time as long as the economy is growing. Presidents, however, don’t have as much of an impact on stock values as the public or even the presidents themselves might believe. Federal Reserve monetary policy is often the biggest force pushing stocks up or down, along with economy-wide trends that presidents can’t necessarily control.Amid the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, the Fed embarked on novel and potent forms of monetary easing that undergirded stock gains for much of the next 11 years. The Fed tried to back away from those policies at the end of 2018, and stocks swooned. The Fed eased up.When COVID hit and stocks sank in 2020, the Fed went straight back to its quantitative easing playbook. Congress also passed massive amounts of fiscal stimulus in 2020 and 2021. The combo helped stocks stage a quick recovery in 2021 and brought the US economy out of the COVID recession faster than any other advanced nation.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading on March 27, 2024, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)As inflation intensified in 2021 and 2022, the Fed had no choice but to start raising interest rates, which tends to depress stock gains because borrowing becomes more expensive and corporate profits are harder to come by. After a nice run-up in 2021, stocks fell in 2022, bottoming out in October of that year. The S&P 500 sawtoothed upward for about a year as investors half bet and half hoped that the Fed’s inflation battle would succeed. By last fall, it appeared that inflation was abating and the Fed’s rate hikes were finished, helping trigger the current rally.Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.On paper, Biden’s favored policies ought to be a negative for stocks. He favors a higher corporate tax rate and signed into law a modest increase in taxes on big companies in 2022. But Congress couldn’t pass the rate hike Biden called for and other tax hikes simply haven’t dented corporate profits enough to depress stocks.There’s no sign, however, that voters are rewarding Biden for a roaring stock market or for a relatively healthy economy, either. His approval rating sank in 2021 and 2022 as inflation was worsening, but it hasn’t recovered even though inflation is nearly back to normal levels. Many Americans complain that most of the price hikes in food, rent, and staples are still there, even if the overall rate of inflation has dropped.With Biden and Trump neck-and-neck in polls, Biden is likely to highlight every possible thing that might make voters feel a little more comfortable giving him another four years in the White House. Biden didn’t run for president the first time on a desire to enrich investors, but now that it’s happened, why not make sure people know about it?The only risk, as Trump ought to know, is that a president can’t do much to stop a reversal if that’s what the market decides to do.
