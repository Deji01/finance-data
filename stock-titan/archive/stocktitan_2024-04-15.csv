The project aims to commence operations in 2027, contributing to domestic lithium production for EV battery supply chains. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Ioneer's Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project is a significant step in the project's development, reflecting a comprehensive review of potential environmental consequences. Its issuance by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signals a readiness for public scrutiny and concludes years of preparatory work. The EIS's focus on relocating activities to protect Tiehm's buckwheat, an endangered species, exemplifies the evolving nature of environmental regulation where biodiversity considerations are integrated into project planning, thus mitigating risks of future legal and reputational challenges that can arise from environmental groups' opposition. The project's sustainability measures and the absence of evaporation ponds or tailings dams point to an industry trend towards more environmentally conscious mining practices. By recycling half of all water used, the project not only aligns with contemporary water management standards but also sets a benchmark for future mining operations. The commitment to protecting local flora, coupled with the $2.5 million investment in conservation, suggests a proactive approach to environmental stewardship, potentially reducing long-term liabilities associated with environmental degradation. Energy Sector Analyst From an energy perspective, Ioneer's Rhyolite Ridge Project stands out with its plans for energy independence. The on-site processing facility, designed to power the entire project through excess steam generation, aligns with broader industry trends towards renewable and self-sustaining energy sources. Such operational autonomy could offer insulation against energy price volatility, leading to more predictable long-term operating costs. Furthermore, the project's alignment with federal objectives to bolster domestic lithium production underlines its strategic importance. Lithium is a critical component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries and increased domestic supply can address supply chain vulnerabilities, reduce reliance on foreign imports and support the burgeoning EV industry. The project's anticipated production timeline suggests a potential influx of lithium and boron by 2027, which could alleviate supply constraints and contribute to stabilizing prices in the EV market. Market Analyst Investors should note the project's conditional loan commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy, which reflects governmental support and potentially enhances the project's financial viability. Given the long lead times in the mining sector, Ioneer's anticipated commercial production in 2027 is a key factor for market participants to consider in their long-term strategic assessments. The projected 24-36 months to production, post-final investment decision, is consistent with industry norms for projects of this scale. However, it's important for investors to monitor the public comment period and subsequent steps in the permitting process, as they can impact the project's final approval and timeline. The market will also need to assess how Ioneer handles operational risks, such as potential cost overruns and technical challenges, which are common in the mining industry and can significantly affect profitability and stock performance. 04/14/2024 - 09:41 PM Release of U.S. Federal Government’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement Positions Nevada Project to Commence Operations in 2027 NORTH SYDNEY, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ioneer Ltd (“Ioneer”) (ASX: INR, NASDAQ: IONR), moved one step closer toward construction at its Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron site, following the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) planned issuance of the project’s draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as referenced in the BLM’s statement on 12 April 2024.1 The pending release of this draft EIS is the first to be issued from the Biden Administration as part of its efforts to accelerate domestic lithium production. It is the result of years of effective collaboration between Ioneer and federal, state and local agencies and Tribal Nations. It marks a key milestone in the environmental permitting review process for the proposed greenfield project in Esmeralda County, Nevada, set to inject a critical supply of integral transition materials into the U.S. EV battery production supply chain. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240414358303/en/Image 1: Revised Plan Based on Stakeholder Feedback: 2020 Proposed Plan of Operations: 292.9 acres of disturbance within critical habitat before concurrent reclamation to establish functional pollinator habitat. 2.98 acres of direct impact to Tiehm’s buckwheat subpopulations. Subpopulations 4, 5, 6a, 6b, and 7 affected.(Graphic: Business Wire) The draft document will include Ioneer’s efforts to redesign and relocate proposed project activity away from Tiehm’s buckwheat, an endangered species classified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in December 2022. The draft EIS will also detail Ioneer’s investments as part of a formal protection plan and propagation strategy for the Nevada plant. The draft EIS will be available for public comment beginning Friday, 19 April. Reaching this stage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process reflects federal inter-agency collaboration and agreement that the draft document is ready for public input. Following the prescribed 45-day comment period, which will include BLM-organized public meetings, the BLM will incorporate feedback into a final draft and issue a final EIS and a Record of Decision (ROD), expected in October 2024. Upon issuance of a positive ROD, construction at Rhyolite Ridge can begin following a Final Investment Decision (FID). Based on that timeline, Ioneer anticipates production to begin in 2027. “The forthcoming release of the draft EIS represents six years of hard work to help build America’s critical minerals supply chain and reaffirms the viability of our investment in Nevada. Rhyolite Ridge will help accelerate the electric vehicle transition and secure a cleaner future for our children and grandchildren. As we move through the final steps in the federal permitting process, Ioneer will keep working to ensure this world-class project will operate efficiently and sustainably,” said James Calaway, Ioneer’s Executive Chairman. “This news sets a clear path forward to construction and brings us one step closer to making Rhyolite Ridge a reality. Rhyolite Ridge will be a significant, reliable and sustainable source of critical minerals for the United States,” said Bernard Rowe, Ioneer’s Managing Director. “Ioneer is committed to working with the local community, Tribal Nations and state and federal agencies to help the U.S. secure a domestic supply of the critical minerals vital to the clean energy transition.” Once operational, Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project will be a leading example of responsible and sustainable mining. In July 2022, Ioneer submitted a revised plan of operations for federal permitting review, to avoid any direct impact to Tiehm’s buckwheat. After listing and designation of critical habitat, which the company supported, Ioneer worked closely with the agencies and stakeholders to develop a third iteration to detail plans to further reduce indirect impacts to the plant and reduce activity within designated critical habitat. At the request of the BLM and FWS to further minimise impacts to the plant and its critical habitat, Ioneer’s revised design, set to be released on Friday, additionally changed the location of the quarry and overburden storage facilities to avoid any direct impacts to nearby subpopulations of Tiehm’s buckwheat and mitigate any potential indirect impacts. Figure 1 (Refer to Images 1-3): Summary of progressive changes to avoid direct impacts to Tiehm’s buckwheat subpopulations (solid purple areas) and minimise disturbance within the designated critical habitat (dashed purple line). Project related surface disturbance is shown in solid grey areas. The critical habitat extends 500m in all directions from the sub-populations and covers 368 hectares (910 acres). To date, Ioneer has voluntarily invested $2.5 million in conservation efforts and committed an additional $1 million annually to ensure the plant and its surrounding habitat are protected. Ioneer will work to ensure the plant and its habitat for pollinators are protected as it works to transplant seedlings grown at its dedicated greenhouse. Ioneer’s investments to protect Tiehm’s buckwheat represent one piece of a comprehensive sustainability strategy at the proposed site. The on-site processing facility, supported by the company’s $700 million conditional loan commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, will generate excess steam sufficient to power the entire project – meaning the operation will not be required to be connected to the energy grid and be entirely energy independent. Ioneer’s approach to water management also differs from other current and proposed domestic producers. Rhyolite Ridge will recycle half of all water used. The Project will not have evaporation ponds or tailings dams and large parts of the quarry will be backfilled with overburden as mining progresses and ultimately concludes.

"Europe’s IT, Business Services Sector on the Rebound in Q1: ISG Index™",2024-04-15T08:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Europe's IT and Business Services Sector Rebounds in Q1 with 2.5% Market Growth, Led by BFSI Sector: ISG Index™","Europe’s IT, Business Services Sector on the Rebound in Q1: ISG Index™ Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Europe's IT and Business Services Sector Rebounds in Q1 with 2.5% Market Growth, Led by BFSI Sector: ISG Index™ Positive Europe's IT and business services demand rose in Q1, driven by BFSI sector growth. EMEA ISG Index™ reports a 2.5% rise in the combined market, reaching US $7.5 billion. Managed services ACV increased by 3%, with two mega deals signed in the quarter. BPO saw a significant 40% surge, reaching US $1.1 billion, fueled by industry-specific services. XaaS segment grew by 2% year on year, with IaaS advancing by 7% and SaaS declining by 8%. The U.K. remains the largest market with US $1.2 billion in managed services ACV. ISG forecasts 3% growth for managed services and 15% revenue growth for XaaS in 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent uptick in Europe's IT and business services sector reflects a nuanced recovery of a market that had previously seen a decline over four consecutive quarters. This growth, particularly in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, indicates a potential shift in the regional economic climate. Enterprises appear to be cautiously reopening their purses for managed services and cloud-based solutions, suggesting a strategic pivot towards digital transformation to navigate a post-pandemic economy.The BFSI sector's nearly 5 percent year-on-year growth in managed services AcV suggests that financial institutions may be investing heavily in IT to not only reduce costs but also to enhance their digital offerings in a highly competitive sector. This could have a ripple effect on technology providers, possibly indicating an uptrend in their business and potentially their stock performance.However, the overall decline in data center and standalone application development and maintenance (ADM) services reflects a shift towards bundled services, which may imply consolidation in the market. This could result in fewer but larger contracts, impacting small to mid-sized service providers. Investors should note these changing dynamics as they could influence the performance of companies within this sector. Financial Analyst The financial performance in Europe's IT and business services is a barometer for broader economic health and investor sentiment within the region. The increase in annual contract value (ACV) signifies a positive outlook from businesses willing to invest in technology, which is an essential driver of productivity and innovation.From an investment perspective, the reported 3 percent and 15 percent growth forecasts for managed services and XaaS in 2024 respectively, while lower than previous estimates, still represent a robust opportunity for growth-oriented investors. The entry of generative AI into the market as a potential growth catalyst, particularly for data services, should be carefully monitored. As AI continues to evolve, it could open new revenue streams for tech companies and service providers adept at harnessing its capabilities.Investors would be well-advised to track the performance of companies in the travel, transportation and leisure sectors, where managed services ACV saw significant growth. On the contrary, they should be cautious with sectors like manufacturing and telecommunications, where ACV has declined. Technology Industry Consultant The resurgence in business process outsourcing (BPO) and the substantial growth in bundled infrastructure and ADM services underscore a strategic shift in the outsourcing industry. Companies are increasingly seeking comprehensive, integrated solutions that offer both cost-efficiency and technological agility. This trend may indicate an opportunity for service providers who can offer end-to-end solutions to gain market share at the expense of those offering piecemeal services.The geographic performance variations, such as the decline in France and growth in the Nordics, suggest that regional economic policies and market maturity could be influencing the distribution of IT and business services demand. Such insights are vital for service providers and investors looking to allocate resources or capital more effectively across European markets.Lastly, the contrasting performance within the as-a-service segment, with infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) growing while software-as-a-service (SaaS) declined, could indicate market saturation or a pivot towards more infrastructure-centric IT investments. It would be prudent for investors to closely monitor the SaaS providers for signs of recovery or further decline, which could significantly impact their valuations and long-term investment viability. 04/15/2024 - 04:00 AM Combined market up 2.5%, breaking string of 4 straight down quarters year-on-year BFSI, region’s largest sector, is catalyst for growth LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Europe’s demand for IT and business services in the first quarter rose for the first time in a year, powered by growth from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, according to the latest state-of-the-industry report from Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The EMEA ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of US $5 million or more, shows ACV for the combined market (both managed services and cloud-based as-a-service) rose 2.5 percent, to US $7.5 billion, in the first quarter. The market’s year-on-year growth in Q1 broke a string of four consecutive quarters the region was down versus the prior year. “The European market is on the rebound,” said Steve Hall, president, ISG EMEA. “Both managed services and cloud services were higher in Q1, and managed services was up nearly 5 percent year on year for BFSI, the region’s largest business sector. Business process outsourcing was strong, and we also saw a surge in bundled ADM and infrastructure activity across the region.” Q1 Results by Segment Managed services ACV in the first quarter rose 3 percent, to US $3.9 billion. There were 277 managed services contracts signed in the quarter, down 8 percent from the prior year, but up 9.5 percent sequentially from the fourth quarter. Among those contracts were two mega deals (ACV of US $100 million or more). The volume of smaller deals (under US $30 million) was down 10 percent year on year as economic uncertainty weighed on discretionary spending. With companies still focusing on cost reduction, the ACV of restructured contracts climbed 12 percent. Within managed services, IT outsourcing (ITO) was down 7 percent, to US $2.8 billion, driven by declines in data center and standalone application development and maintenance (ADM) services. Meanwhile, the ACV of bundled infrastructure and ADM services was up more than 80 percent. Business process outsourcing (BPO) soared 40 percent, to US $1.1 billion, fueled by rising demand for industry-specific services. By industry, managed services ACV was sharply higher (up 80 percent) in the travel, transportation and leisure sector. BFSI, Europe’s largest industry for outsourcing, saw its ACV climb nearly 5 percent, offsetting weakness in the next two largest sectors – manufacturing (down 5 percent) and telecommunications (down 10 percent). ACV in the as-a-service (XaaS) segment rose 2 percent year on year, and 9 percent from the prior quarter, to US $3.6 billion – its best quarterly result since the fourth quarter of 2022. This segment’s first-quarter growth ended a streak of four consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines. Within this segment, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) advanced 7 percent, to US $2.5 billion, fueled in part by growing interest in the data services required to feed generative AI models, while software-as-a-service (SaaS) declined 8 percent, to US $1.0 billion. Geographic Performance The region’s largest market, the U.K., generated US $1.2 billion of managed services ACV, its fifth consecutive quarter with ACV of more than US $1 billion, although it was down 4 percent versus the prior year. DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), the region’s second-largest market, saw its ACV decline 6 percent, to US $647 million, while France slipped out of its usual number-three spot as its ACV fell 27 percent, to US $471 million. The Nordics eclipsed France to become Europe’s third-largest ACV market in the first quarter, with ACV of US $600 million, up 45 percent year on year. 2024 Global Forecast ISG is forecasting 3 percent growth for managed services, down 125 basis points from its January forecast, and maintaining its forecast of 15 percent revenue growth for XaaS in 2024. “Looking ahead to the rest of the year, economic conditions are forecasted to be less volatile than in 2023, but challenges persist,” Hall said. “The global economy is expected to slow down, impacted by monetary policies to combat inflation, which is expected to decline. “In this environment, outsourcing could see a boost as companies seek to balance cost management and service quality. GenAI, meanwhile, is poised to be a growth catalyst, with large hyperscalers expected to manage increasing workloads. The data layer, integral for training AI models, presents a prime opportunity for service providers.” About the ISG Index™ The ISG Index™ is recognized as the authoritative source for marketplace intelligence on the global technology and business services industry.

Phoenix Motor Announces Record Revenue Guidance for Q1 2024,2024-04-15T07:45:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Phoenix Motor Inc. (PEV) projects a substantial revenue increase for Q1 2024, with guidance ranging from $8 million to $9 million, compared to $1.8 million in Q1 2023.

The surge is attributed to strategic moves like acquiring Proterra's transit business and launching new products to meet market demands. CEO Denton Peng highlights the company's innovative product line, growing EV market demand, and supportive government policies as key drivers. Phoenix Motor aims to expand its market presence and lead the shift towards sustainable transportation. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The remarkable increase in projected revenue that Phoenix Motor Inc. has announced signifies a potential expansion trajectory within the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The heavy-duty transit buses and medium-duty vehicle electrification provider's forecast mirrors a broader industry trend where electrification is rapidly gaining traction due to environmental considerations and shifts in consumer behavior.Upon examining the figures, a surge from $1.8 million to a projected $8-9 million is an impressive leap. It reflects not just market demand but also strategic efficiency. Their acquisition of Proterra's transit business appears to be a calculative move, potentially streamlining operations and expanding product offerings. The introduction of new products tailored to the commercial transportation sector demonstrates adaptability and innovation-driven growth, which are vital attributes in a technology-forward industry.The company's alignment with government policies on electrification could also be securing a more stable operational environment. Federal incentives and an infrastructure supportive of EVs often act as catalysts for growth within this sector. Phoenix Motor's revenue guidance may serve as a barometer for investor confidence and industry health, particularly in the sustainable transportation niche. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Phoenix Motor Inc.'s revenue guidance cannot be overstated. A quintuple increase in year-over-year revenue suggests confidence in operational strategy and market positioning. It's vital, however, for stakeholders and potential investors to understand the nuances within these numbers.Increased revenue on paper is promising, but the cost of achieving it, through actions like Proterra's acquisition, must be prudently examined. The profitability of new products and the ROI from strategic initiatives are key determinants of financial health beyond top-line growth.Long-term, the trajectory puts Phoenix Motor in a positive light, indicating potential for market dominance and share price appreciation. Yet, the market's volatile nature, especially in technology and environmental sectors, necessitates vigilance. Future earnings, profit margins and cash flow projections would complement this revenue guidance to paint a more comprehensive financial picture. Environmental Economist Phoenix Motor Inc.'s focus on EVs is not just a business decision but aligns with global carbon reduction goals. The significant projected increase in revenue suggests that environmentally sustainable transportation solutions are no longer peripheral but a central part of economic planning and industrial strategy.Government policies favoring electrification are an important economic instrument, steering markets like the one Phoenix Motor operates in towards greener solutions. These policies often create a more favorable business environment for companies like Phoenix, potentially increasing their market value.The long-term economic impact of companies growing in the sustainable transport sector can be sizeable. They contribute to a shift in consumer behavior and industrial standards, which can lead to lower carbon economies. Phoenix's current trajectory could signal a broader economic shift where sustainability becomes a cornerstone of value generation and economic resilience. 04/15/2024 - 03:45 AM ANAHEIM, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 15, 2024 / Phoenix Motor Inc.

Negative None. 04/14/2024 - 01:25 PM Crane led the combined generation and utility business from 2012-2022 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Exelon is saddened to announce the death of Chris Crane, who served as the company’s president and chief executive officer from 2012 until his retirement in Dec. 2022. Crane steered Exelon through several transformational milestones including the successful mergers with Constellation Energy in 2012 and Pepco Holdings in 2016, creating the largest utility business by customer count, and the later creation of a standalone transmission and delivery company with the spinoff of the generation and retail energy business as Constellation Energy in 2022. Crane died on April 13 in Chicago. During Crane’s tenure, Exelon became an industry leader in grid reliability and developing initiatives to improve safety and customer service and combat climate change. He was also an advocate for equity-building programs at the company and in the communities served by Exelon, with particular attention to STEM careers for young women and job training and placement for work-ready adults. Crane joined Exelon (then Unicom Corporation) in 1998 and was named chief nuclear officer in 2004. In that role he oversaw a broad range of generation and business development initiatives, including improving operations and increasing output of the nuclear fleet and innovative decommissioning strategies. He was named president of Exelon Generation in 2007, with added responsibility for power trading and the company’s competitive retail organization. “Chris was an industry giant, with a list of accomplishments that chart the growth and success of both the energy generation and utility businesses,” said Calvin Butler, president and chief executive officer of Exelon, who succeeded Crane in Dec. 2022. “However, what I most appreciate about Chris, and what I know he would want us to remember, is his dedication to our customers and communities. He helped expand our thinking on how an energy company could affect the greater good, launching programs that make up the fabric of Exelon’s culture today.” “I was saddened to learn the news of Chris Crane’s passing,” said Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Chair Pedro J. Pizarro, president and CEO of Edison International. “Chris was a respected leader known for his operational expertise and was a friend to me and to so many others in our industry. Throughout his career, Chris dedicated significant time and focus to advancing clean energy sources, especially nuclear energy, and to helping ensure that the clean energy transition benefits customers in all communities. “Among his accomplishments as EEI Chair, Chris led an initiative to enhance the industry’s workforce development efforts and to address employment gaps and acute socioeconomic needs within underserved communities. He was a champion for high-potential students who aspire to pursue careers in STEM and focused on enhancing STEM/vocational education and awareness opportunities, identifying and eliminating barriers to entry, and creating tangible job opportunities within our industry,” Pizarro added. In 2017, Crane signed on as a champion of the United Nations’ inaugural HeForShe campaign, committing to invest $3 million in STEM programs for young women and girls and to improve the company’s retention of women. Under his leadership, Exelon signed the White House pay equity pledge, and became a member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable for excellence in supplier diversity. Crane held several key industry roles throughout his career, including chair of the Edison Electric Institute, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, and the Nuclear Energy Institute. He also served as chair of the board of Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry and was a member of the board of the Economic Club of Washington, DC.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) ADV increased by 6%, driven by commodities performance. Asia Pacific and Latin America also saw growth in commodities trading. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Observing the CME Group's international ADV growth, particularly the 38% surge in energy products and a similar uptrend in agricultural and metal commodities, suggests a robust demand for risk management tools in the commodities sector.Their strategic positioning as a derivatives marketplace allows for a diversified portfolio of futures and options, catering to a broad spectrum of client needs amidst global economic fluctuations. Evidently, the increased volume in EMEA and Asia Pacific regions highlights a growing reliance on derivatives for hedging purposes, which is an attractive quality for investors seeking stability in turbulent markets. Commodities Trading Specialist The data released by CME Group indicates a heightened global economic volatility, particularly in regions such as EMEA and Asia Pacific. The significant 50% increase in energy trading in EMEA reflects a response to geopolitical tensions and energy market disruptions.Similarly, the rise in agricultural products trading by 38% may be attributed to climate change and supply chain uncertainties, encouraging traders to lock in prices and manage potential risks. These trends are important for stakeholders to monitor, as they affect commodity pricing and trading strategies. Financial Analyst The record-setting ADV reported by CME Group not only underscores market participants' need for risk management solutions but also reflects positively on CME's financial health. Investors should note the correlation between increased trading volume and potential revenue growth for the Group.Furthermore, the uneven growth across regions, with comparatively lower increases in regions like Latin America and Canada, may suggest regional economic disparities or market penetration opportunities. The company's ability to capitalize on these trends will be pivotal in their long-term financial outlook and stock performance. 04/15/2024 - 03:00 AM Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) ADV up 6% in Q1 2024 Significant commodities volume growth in EMEA and Asia PacificLONDON and SINGAPORE, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that its quarterly international average daily volume (ADV) reached a record 7.4 million contracts in Q1 2024, up 2% year on year.

The Lucita property was acquired under an option agreement with Pan American Silver Corp. (Pan American or PanAm) in 2020 and is now 100% owned by Defiance (see News Releases December 2, 2020, and January 10, 2024). Pan American completed several work programs at Lucita, including surface sampling and reconnaissance drilling in 1996, 2011, and 2012. These work programs identified numerous near-surface vein systems with high-grade Ag, Au, Zn, and Pb values.Defiance's Lucita North (previously called Panuco) and Lucita South projects are located in the Zacatecas mining district within the Central Mexican Silver Belt, a northwest-trending belt of world-class mining districts including Sombrerete, Fresnillo, Zacatecas, and Guanajuato. The mineralized systems at both Lucita and Defiance's San Acacio project have similar characteristics to other ore deposits in the belt, such as Juanicipio (Mag Silver/Fresnillo), Santo Niño (Fresnillo), Cozamin (Capstone), Francisco I. Madero (Peñoles), and San Nicolas (Agnico Eagle/Teck).Figure 1.

Multiple mapped structures have returned high-grade Ag and highly anomalous to high-grade Pb, Zn, Au ± Cu along the majority of their exposed strike length (e.g., Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa, Lucero, Pilitas, and Chucho Blanco; Table 1 and Figure 2). Various highlighted surface results from in situ and previously mined material are presented in Table 1. Vein system widths at surface in Lucita North range from 0.1 - 19 meters. In particular, the Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa system is a high-priority target for the Company. This system contains 3 distinct zones from northwest to southeast: Gloria, Aurora, and Plomosa. This system has one of the best polymetallic surface geochemical anomalies in the district and is prospective for both intermediate-sulfidation epithermal vein and potential carbonate-replacement-style mineralization at depth.

Several mapped structures have returned high-grade samples (e.g., Paty, Palenque, and Lucita; Table 1 and Figure 3), including a sample from the Paty vein grading 2350 g/t Ag. Additionally, substantial historic workings and multiple mineralized surface samples were encountered along the Palenque structure. Widths of these structures at surface in Lucita South range from 0.1 - 4 meters. These encouraging surface results led to the Company's first-pass diamond drill program at Palenque (see News Release April 13th, 2022 and August 9th, 2022). Drilling along the Palenque structure confirms the continuation of silver and gold grades at depth and identified blind mineralization in low-angle faults and within specific stratigraphic units. Well-mineralized samples from both surface and drill core, as well as the potential for very high grades as demonstrated in the Palenque, Paty, and Lucita veins, present significant exploration upside in the Lucita South project.

The widely spaced drill holes returned very encouraging results over a multi-kilometer strike length. Highlights include:DDLU-21-05: 3.48m of 513.57 g/t Ag from 152.52 to 156.00m, including 0.25m of 3260.00 g/t Ag (See News Release April 13th, 2022)DDLU-22-10: blind discovery of a wide 49.87m zone with 58.79 g/t Ag from 370.23m to 420.1m including 3.05m of 264.29 g/t Ag and 2.25m of 235.29 g/t Ag (See News Release August 9th, 2022)Lucita NorthPan American previously conducted two diamond drill programs in 1996 and 2011-2012 for a total of 5103.35m (Figure 2). These programs shallowly tested several vein systems, including Plomosa near the historic Plomosa silver mine and Lucero. Drilling encountered positive results (see News Release December 2nd 2020). Ongoing relogging and sampling of the historic drill core continue to reveal high-level alteration zones and high-grade intercepts that warrant follow-up both down dip and along strike. Discussion of ResultsThe most prominent structures at Defiance's Lucita property are northwest-southeast and east-west trending mineralized veins, breccias, and alteration zones. These structural orientations are characteristic of the most important mineralizing events of the world-class ore deposits in the Central Mexican Silver Belt. Intersections of these two mineralizing events often localize zones of significant mineralization.A remarkable feature of the Lucita property is the presence of both polymetallic Ag-Zn-Pb±Au±Cu style mineralization and Ag-Au dominant low-sulfidation epithermal-style mineralization. The most prospective targets in the Lucita North project are the Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa system, the Pilitas-Tules intersection zone, and the Lucero vein. In Lucita South the Palenque, Lucita, and Paty veins are high-priority follow-up drill targets.Lucita NorthThe Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa vein system is a large, regional structure similar in orientation and length to Defiance's Veta Grande system. The Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa system contains a high-density of altered and mineralized structures with high grades at and near surface.The mineralization style is dominantly multiphase, intermediate-sulfidation epithermal style veins and breccias; this is best exhibited in the Aurora zone. The Gloria zone also contains an outstanding example of polymetallic, breccia-style mineralization with metal assemblages and textures reminiscent of carbonate-replacement style deposits. The eastern portion of the Plomosa remains to be mapped, but preliminary findings indicate the presence of multiple mineralization styles (Figure 4). Figure 4. Photos of various polymetallic mineralization along the Gloria-Aurora-Plomosa system, representing high-grade to highly anomalous Ag, Pb, Zn, Au and Cu in semi-massive sulfides and oxide material in Gloria (A & B), Aurora (C) and Plomosa (D). Samples are highlighted in Table 1.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/2950/205501_90d73138e438eb75_004full.jpgThe Pilitas-Tules intersection zone is of particular interest due to the presence of east-west Ag-rich structures that intersect earlier northwest-southeast structures. The northwest-southeast breccia-vein zones are understood to be exposed at a high-level of the epithermal system, and therefore present important drill targets at depth. This architecture and mineralization style is reminiscent of the structures that are known to host significant mineralization in the Fresnillo district.Lucita SouthThe Palenque, Lucita, and Paty veins are east-west structures that display Ag-Au dominant mineralization characteristic of low-sulfidation epithermal vein systems. This style of mineralization was targeted by Mag Silver in the Fresnillo district and led the discovery of the Juanicipio mine. An important intersection of the east-west Paty vein, which contains the highest-grade surface sample from previously mined material (2350 g/t Ag), with a northwest-southeast trending structure represents an additional Fresnillo-style target. Discussion of Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QAQC) and Analytical ProceduresQAQC for Defiance rock sampling (2021-2024): Samples were selected based on the lithology, alteration, and mineralization characteristics; sample size averaged 3.3 kg. At least one blank or one standard was included within every 20 samples. Standard materials are certified reference materials (CRMs) from OREAS; the suite of standards contains a range of Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, and Zn values. Blanks and standards have been used to confirm the validity of the analytical results.Samples were analyzed by ALS Limited. Sample preparation was performed at their Zacatecas, Mexico, prep facility, and analyses were performed at the Vancouver, Canada, analytical facility. All elements except Au and Hg were analyzed by a multi-element geochemistry method utilizing a four-acid digestion followed by ICP-MS detection [ME-MS61m]; mercury was analyzed after a separate aqua regia digest by ICP-MS. Overlimit assays for Ag, Pb, and Zn were conducted using the OG62 method (multi-acid digest with ICP-AES/AAS finish). Gold was measured by fire-assay with an ICP-AES finish [50g sample, Au-ICP22].QAQC for historical Pan American sampling (2011-2012): Details of sample selection are understood to be in accordance with industry best practice; however, detailed procedures of historical sampling are not recorded. The Pan American Lucita property report states that standards and blanks were included in laboratory submissions of surface samples. This report also describes the QAQC protocol for the drilling conducted in 2011 and 2012; certified reference material from GEOSTAT was used as a standard, and sterile basalt drill core from the La Preciosa project in Durango was used as blank material. Both sample preparation and sample analysis were performed by SGS Labs in Durango, Mexico. All elements except Au were analyzed first by a multi-element geochemistry method utilizing a two-acid Aqua Regia digest with an ICP-AES finish [ICP14B]. Reported Ag values were assayed using AAS21E (3 acid digest with AAS finish), and overlimit Ag samples (>300 ppm) were analyzed by fire-assay with a gravimetric finish [30g sample, AAS21E]. Method ICP90Q (sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-OES finish) was used for overlimit samples of other elements (e.g. Pb, Zn, Cu). Gold was measured by fire assay with an AAS finish [30g sample, FAA313].

The deal includes 54 dealership locations generating $2.7 billion in annual revenues. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approval. Positive Acquisition of Inchcape U.K. dealerships for $439 million will significantly increase Group 1 Automotive's presence in the U.K. market. Inchcape U.K. dealerships generated approximately $2.7 billion in annual revenues in 2023. The deal includes 54 dealership locations across major hubs in England and Wales, selling over 63,500 new and used vehicles annually. Group 1 Automotive's total acquired revenues are expected to reach approximately $3.7 billion with the addition of Inchcape dealerships. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, pending approval from the Financial Conduct Authority. Group 1 Automotive's U.K. dealership count will increase to 109, with a total of 256 locations in the U.S. and U.K. post-acquisition. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Inchcape U.K. dealerships by Group 1 Automotive represents a significant consolidation in the automotive retail sector. From a market research perspective, the move not only increases Group 1's market share and presence in the U.K. but also diversifies its brand offerings. The inclusion of premium brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz suggests a strategic alignment with market trends favouring luxury vehicles. The strengthened geographic coverage in the Central and North West regions of England and Wales may result in increased competitive advantage against other automotive retailers in the region.Furthermore, the deal's scale, valued at approximately $439 million with Inchcape's annual revenues of $2.7 billion, indicates a calculated revenue multiple that is congruent with industry norms for retail acquisitions. The leveraging of the U.S. credit facility to finance the transaction at a pro-forma leverage ratio of 2.2x is noteworthy for its measured approach, maintaining liquidity while expanding operations. This level of financial prudence is essential to facilitate ongoing capital allocation strategies that are shareholder-focused, such as dividends and share repurchases. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of this acquisition for Group 1 Automotive, one should consider the potential for revenue growth alongside the risks associated with the expansion. The increase in dealership count to 109 in the U.K. and a total of 256 locations in the U.S. and U.K. suggests economies of scale could drive margin improvements and cost synergies. The transaction's all-cash nature involves a substantial outflow of capital; hence its impact on short-term liquidity must be assessed. Nonetheless, the CFO's remarks about pro-forma leverage and liquidity remaining 'within targets' suggests financial stability post-acquisition.It is also imperative to consider the long-term strategic benefits, such as enhanced buying power and cross-brand marketing opportunities. The deal could lead to improved negotiating terms with manufacturers and suppliers. However, the integration of such a large number of new locations will require adept management to avoid operational disruptions and to fully realize the anticipated synergies. Investors should monitor the post-acquisition integration process carefully, as its success will be critical in achieving the projected value from the deal. 04/15/2024 - 02:30 AM 54 Dealership Locations in the United KingdomHOUSTON, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

The company plans to continue infill drilling and development work to support cash flow generation amidst rising oil prices. The total recoverable volumes from the new discoveries are expected to exceed management's requirements for additional future development, extending the life of the concession beyond 2032. Positive None. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 02:00 AM Three Oil Discoveries in the Gulf of ThailandSINGAPORE, SINGAPORE / ACCESSWIRE / April 15, 2024 / Valeura Energy Inc. (TSX:VLE)(OTCQX:VLERF) (""Valeura"" or the ""Company""), the upstream oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the Thrace Basin of Türkiye, is pleased to announce three oil discoveries on its assets in the offshore Gulf of Thailand. Sean Guest, President and CEO commented:""I am pleased to announce that our exploration drilling campaign has resulted in three new oil discoveries, one in the Nong Yao D area, and two in the north-east portion of the Wassana concession.As we continue to pursue adding value through growth, near-field exploration forms an important part of sizing up the organic potential of our assets. With successful results like these, the opportunity set before us is continuing to expand.Following this exploration drilling campaign we are returning to both infill drilling and development work, which is intended to increase production rates over the coming months to support cash flow generation, particularly as we see benchmark oil prices rise to new highs for this year. We are also planning for further exploration drilling elsewhere in our portfolio later in the year.""Nong Yao DThe Nong Yao-13 well (G11/48 concession, 90% working interest) was drilled to 5,399 feet measured depth (""MD"") (3,342 feet true vertical depth (""TVD"")) and discovered just over 30 feet of new oil pay across several intervals. Importantly, this result confirms that oil has successfully migrated into this area of the block, a factor that was seen to be a risk in the Nong Yao D area. The particular intervals comprising the discovery are relatively shallow new zones which have not been produced elsewhere on the concession. These reservoirs are believed to be recurring across the Nong Yao D area and further analysis on the seismic data is warranted. This work will seek out potential locations for follow-up exploration and appraisal drilling in the vicinity, with the ultimate objective of amassing sufficient volumes to justify a future development.Niramai and Wassana NorthTwo wells were drilled north of the Wassana oil field (G10/48 concession, 100% interest) with the objective of identifying sufficient oil volumes in this northern area of the block to justify a future development project. The Niramai-4 well was an exploration/appraisal well approximately one kilometre north-east of the successful Niramai-1 oil discovery, which was originally drilled in 2009. The Niramai-4 well was drilled to 7,312 feet MD (5,581 feet TVD) and discovered over 90 feet of new oil pay across two key reservoirs.Following evaluation, the well was then sidetracked with a high-angle well known as Niramai-4 ST1 to test the Wassana North prospect, a separate fault block immediately north of the Wassana field. The well was drilled to 12,388 feet MD (5,782 feet TVD) and discovered approximately 40 feet of new oil pay. The deepest oil-bearing zone is of particular interest in that the wellbore intersected the reservoir significantly downdip of the crest and oil is interpreted to be present to the base of the reservoir, with no oil-water contact identified in the well. This indicates further potential, both deeper than penetrated, and more laterally expansive in the updip portion of the structure.While reservoir properties and volumetric estimates are still being calculated for both wells, when combined with the pre-existing Niramai volumes, the total recoverable volumes are believed to exceed management's requirements to support an additional future development on the G10/48 block. Such a development expansion is beyond the scope of the Wassana field re-development project currently being evaluated, but has the potential to extend production and the life of the concession beyond its current economic limit in 2032. Management anticipates that that these new volumes will contribute to the Company's next year end reserves and resources.Drilling PlanThe Company's contracted drilling rig has been mobilised to the Nong Yao field, where it will soon begin drilling two infill development wells on the Nong Yao A platform, intended to add to production rates in the near term. Thereafter, and once commissioning work is complete on the Nong Yao C Mobile Offshore Production Unit, the rig will begin development drilling on the Nong Yao C accumulation. The Company is targeting first oil from Nong Yao C in early Q3 2024.For further information, please contact:Valeura Energy Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 01:10 AM – Columvi, in combination with chemotherapy, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for people with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma – – Data from the STARGLO study will be submitted to health authorities and presented at an upcoming medical meeting – SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today the Phase III STARGLO study met its primary endpoint of overall survival. The study demonstrated that people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have received at least one prior line of therapy and are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant, lived longer when treated with Columvi® (glofitamab-gxbm) in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) versus Rituxan® (rituximab) in combination with GemOx. Safety of the combination appeared consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. The data will be submitted to health authorities and shared at an upcoming medical meeting. “People with this aggressive lymphoma facing relapse or progression after initial treatment have limited options – particularly those who are ineligible for stem cell transplant,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Genentech’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Building on Columvi’s established benefits, these data demonstrate the potential of this combination regimen to improve survival outcomes in earlier lines of treatment.” Columvi was the first fixed-duration bispecific antibody to receive accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission to treat people with R/R DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. These approvals were based on positive results of Columvi as a monotherapy from the pivotal Phase I/II NP30179 study in patients with R/R DLBCL who had previously received two or more prior treatments. Columvi is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to be off-the-shelf and ready for infusion, so patients can start treatment soon after diagnosis. This is particularly important for patients with highly aggressive disease who are at risk of rapid disease progression. Columvi is given as a fixed-duration treatment, offering people with R/R DLBCL who have failed two or more lines of therapy a treatment end date and the possibility of a treatment-free period, unlike continuous treatments. About the STARGLO Study The STARGLO study [GO41944; NCT04408638] is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Columvi® (glofitamab-gxbm) in combination with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GemOx) versus Rituxan® (rituximab) in combination with GemOx in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior line of therapy and who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant. Outcome measures include overall survival (primary endpoint), progression-free survival, complete response rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response (secondary endpoints), and safety and tolerability. About Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive (fast-growing) blood cancer and is the most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in the U.S. While many people with DLBCL are responsive to treatment, the majority of those who relapse or are refractory to subsequent treatments have poor outcomes. DLBCL not otherwise specified is the most common category of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and accounts for about 80% or more of cases. It applies to cases that do not fall into any specific disease subgroups of LBCL. About Columvi® (glofitamab-gxbm) Columvi is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to target CD3 on the surface of T cells and CD20 on the surface of B cells. Columvi was designed with a novel 2:1 structural format. This T-cell engaging bispecific antibody is engineered to have one region that binds to CD3, a protein on T cells, a type of immune cell, and two regions that bind to CD20, a protein on B cells, which can be healthy or malignant. This dual-targeting brings the T cell in close proximity to the B cell, activating the release of cancer cell-killing proteins from the T cell. A clinical development program for Columvi is ongoing, investigating the molecule as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines for the treatment of people with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other blood cancers. Columvi U.S. Indication Columvi (glofitamab-gxbm) is a prescription medicine to treat adults with certain types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) that has come back (relapsed) or that did not respond to previous treatment (refractory), and who have received 2 or more prior treatments for their cancer. It is not known if Columvi is safe and effective in children. The conditional approval of Columvi is based on response rate and durability of response. There are ongoing studies to establish how well the drug works. What is the most important information I should know about Columvi? Columvi can cause Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a serious side effect that is common during treatment with Columvi, and can also be serious and lead to death. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS, including: fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher chills or shaking fast or irregular heartbeat dizziness or light-headedness trouble breathing shortness of breath Due to the risk of CRS, you will receive Columvi on a “step-up dosing schedule”. A single dose of a medicine called obinutuzumab will be given to you on the first day of your first treatment cycle (Day 1 of Cycle 1). You will start the Columvi step-up dosing schedule a week after the obinutuzumab dose. The step-up dosing schedule is when you receive smaller “step-up” doses of Columvi on Day 8 and Day 15 of Cycle 1. This is to help reduce your risk of CRS. You should be hospitalized during your infusion and for 24 hours after receiving the first step-up dose on Day 8. You should be hospitalized during your infusion and for 24 hours after receiving the second step-up dose on Day 15 if you experienced CRS during the first step-up dose. You will receive your first full dose of Columvi a week after the second step-up dose (this will be Day 1 of Cycle 2). If your dose of Columvi is delayed for any reason, you may need to repeat the “step-up dosing schedule”. If you had more than mild CRS with your previous dose of Columvi, you should be hospitalized during and for 24 hours after receiving your next dose of Columvi. Before each dose of Columvi, you will receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS and infusion-related reactions. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for CRS during treatment with Columvi and may treat you in a hospital if you develop signs and symptoms of CRS. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop your treatment with Columvi if you have severe side effects. Carry the Columvi Patient Wallet Card with you at all times and show it to all of your healthcare providers. The Columvi Patient Wallet Card lists the signs and symptoms of CRS you should get emergency medical help for right away. What are the possible side effects of Columvi? Columvi may cause serious side effects, including: Cytokine Release Syndrome. Neurologic problems. Columvi can cause serious neurologic problems that may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for neurologic problems during treatment with Columvi. Your healthcare provider may also refer you to a healthcare provider who specializes in neurologic problems. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of neurologic problems, including: headache confusion and disorientation difficulty paying attention or understanding things trouble speaking sleepiness memory problems numbness, tingling, or weakness of the hands or feet dizziness shaking (tremors) Serious Infections.

The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of phages in patients with high medical needs. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The enrollment of the first patient in PHAXIAM Therapeutics' phase 1 study to treat endocarditis infections marks a significant step in addressing a condition with high mortality rates and growing concerns over antibiotic resistance. The focus on the effectiveness of phage therapy, especially through intravenous administration, presents a potential shift in treating bacterial infections that could have substantial implications for healthcare practices and pharmaceutical development.Assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics of the anti-S. aureus phages will provide important data that could not only pave the way for new treatment protocols but may also impact the market of antibacterial therapies. With the projected release of findings in the third quarter of 2024, stakeholders in the healthcare sector, particularly those involved in infectious disease treatment, are likely to watch these developments closely. Positive outcomes could lead to increased investments in phage therapy research, potentially affecting PHAXIAM's market positioning and investor interest. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the advancement of PHAXIAM Therapeutics' clinical study could have a meaningful effect on the company's valuation and future funding prospects. The successful initiation of the phase 1 trial may already generate optimism among investors, aware that any progress in addressing the substantial medical need in endocarditis treatment can translate into significant market opportunities.Furthermore, the anticipation of study results in Q3 2024 may influence stock performance leading up to the announcement. Should the data be favorable, PHAXIAM might witness an increase in stock value, driven by the potential of their phage therapy to meet unmet medical needs. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials, including the possibility of negative or inconclusive results, must be factored into any financial forecasts. Healthcare Economist Exploring the economic implications of phage therapy in the treatment of infections like endocarditis is noteworthy. By potentially reducing mortality rates and the need for invasive surgeries, phage therapy could decrease healthcare costs associated with managing endocarditis. Additionally, should PHAXIAM's phage therapy prove effective, it might alleviate some of the economic pressure caused by antibiotic resistance, which is a mounting global health concern with significant direct and indirect costs.Success in this phase 1 study could shift resource allocation within healthcare systems towards more innovative treatments. Long-term, this aligns with the larger economic aim of improving health outcomes while controlling expenditures. It will be essential to monitor how this aligns with payers' willingness to reimburse for such therapies, which could influence the adoption rate and market penetration of PHAXIAM's product. 04/15/2024 - 01:30 AM The study plans for the enrolment of 12 patients in 5 French clinical centersFirst study results expected in Q3 2024This study will enable an evaluation of the intravenous administration of phages, particularly adapted to targeting indications with very high medical stakes. Lyon (France) and Cambridge (MA, US), April 15, 2024 – 7:30am CEST - PHAXIAM Therapeutics (Nasdaq & Euronext: FR0011471135), today announces the enrolment of the 1st patient in the phase 1 clinical study in endocarditis infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium (inner lining of the heart) and valves, usually caused by bacteria. It can lead to heart failure, valve damage and stroke. It remains one of the most fatal heart diseases, with a death rate from 30 to 40%. S. aureus, responsible for around 30%1 of cases, is the main cause of endocarditis infections. Its treatment involves antibiotics, sometimes combined with surgery to repair damage to the heart valves. Given the increase in the incidence and mortality of endocarditis due to S. aureus in the context of growing antibiotic resistance, the development of innovative therapies has become a necessity to control and reduce the mortality rate of infectious endocarditis. The design of PHAXIAM's multicentric phase 1 study in this indication received the necessary approvals from the French regulatory agency ANSM and Sud-Est II-Lyon Ethics committee. The trial plans to enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve, recruited across 5 French clinical centers (Henri Mondor in Créteil, Hôpital Bichat-Claude Bernard in Paris, University Hospital of Nantes, University Hospital of Nancy and La Pitié-Salpêtrière in Paris). The first patient has been enrolled at Henri Mondor Hospital by the team of Professor Pascal Lim, the study's Principal Investigator. Patients will be treated between 2 and 4 days with a combination of two anti-S. aureus phages, intravenously administered once or twice a day, until the day of surgery. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of intravenous administration of PHAXIAM’s phages, to study their pharmacokinetics in the blood and to measure their concentration in the valve resected during surgery. These key data for PHAXIAM and wider for the development of phage therapy will be used to define the optimal intravenous administration method and will also be used for future efficacy studies of phage therapy in indications using this administration pathway. The first results of the study are expected during the 3rd quarter of 2024. Prof. Pascal Lim, Head of Cardiac Intensive Care at Hôpital Henri Mondor and Principal Investigator of the study, stated: ""The treatment of endocarditis infection linked to S. aureus presents many challenges, and we are very pleased to take part in this study, which will evaluate phage therapy for the first time in this highly fatal condition. In this way, we hope to contribute to improving the treatment of patients who often face a therapeutic impasse.” Thibaut du Fayet, Chief Executive Officer of PHAXIAM, concluded: ""The inclusion of the first patient in the phase 1 study in endocarditis infection is a key step in our development strategy, which aims to provide phage therapy to patients suffering from diseases of high medical needs. The first results of this study, expected in Q3 2024, will enable us to analyse the safety and first efficacy signals of our anti-S. aureus phages with intravenous administration, in an indication where reducing mortality, which is still between 30% and 40%, is a major medical challenge. We look forward to these data, which, if positive, will give us a significant competitive advantage and will pave the way for the use of this administration route for our phages in other indications with significant unmet medical needs, such as bacteraemia.” About PHAXIAM Therapeutics PHAXIAM is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for resistant bacterial infections, which are responsible for many serious infections.

The implied Enterprise Value is approximately €3.9 billion, with expected synergies. The transaction is expected to bring significant benefits to both companies and stakeholders. Positive The acquisition by Prysmian at $290.00 per share in cash represents a premium of 20% to the 30-day VWAP and 29% to the 90-day VWAP. Encore Wire's implied Enterprise Value is approximately €3.9 billion, with a multiple of 8.2x EV/2023A EBITDA and 6.3x EV/2023A EBITDA including run rate synergies. The transaction is expected to bring additional future opportunities for employees and significant benefits for stakeholders. Prysmian expects to maintain a significant presence at Encore Wire's McKinney, Texas campus post-transaction. The strategic rationale behind the acquisition includes increasing exposure to growth drivers, enhancing North American presence, leveraging operational efficiency, broadening product offerings, and generating €140m in run-rate EBITDA synergies within 4 years. The pro forma financials for the combined group show net sales of over €17.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately €2.1 billion. The transaction will be financed through a mix of cash on Prysmian's Balance Sheet and newly committed debt facilities. The Transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to various approvals and customary closing conditions. Encore Wire may solicit alternative acquisition proposals during a 35-day 'go-shop' period following the merger agreement execution. J.P. Morgan Securities and O'Melveny & Myers LLP are advising Encore Wire, while Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Succursale Italia and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are advising Prysmian. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Encore Wire by Prysmian marks a strategic expansion in North America for the latter, which could potentially enhance Prysmian's market positioning and share. Analyzing the premium of approximately 20% over the 30-day volume weighted average share price offered by Prysmian underscores the value they see in Encore Wire's operational efficiency and service model, which, when integrated, may lead to substantial cost synergies. Additionally, the expected run-rate EBITDA synergies of €140m within four years post-closing reflect a clear path towards improving the combined entity's financial performance.Investors should consider the implications of the transaction financing, with a mix of Prysmian's cash reserves and newly committed debt. The capital structure post-acquisition will influence the company's leverage and financial flexibility. Long-term, the expanded geographic and product mix might provide a hedge against regional economic downturns and could diversify the combined company's revenue streams. Financial Analyst The transaction's implied Enterprise Value (EV) suggests a significant commitment from Prysmian to cement its foothold in the North American market. The multiples of 8.2x EV/2023A EBITDA and 6.3x EV/2023A EBITDA including run rate synergies appear to be in line with the industry standards for such mergers and acquisitions, considering the synergistic benefits and the strategic fit. However, it is essential for investors to monitor the integration process post-acquisition for any indicators that the anticipated benefits are being realized.The 'go-shop' period clause in the merger agreement is a mechanism that could potentially affect the stock price of Encore Wire in the short-term, as it may lead to competitive bidding. This could play in favor of the shareholders should there be another entity willing to offer a higher premium for the acquisition. Legal Expert The acquisition process will be subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, which are standard procedures but can impact the timeline and certainty of the transaction's completion. The statement from both companies suggests confidence in meeting these conditions. However, investors should remain aware of the potential for regulatory hurdles, particularly in a merger that could significantly change the market dynamics. It's also prudent to note the legal advisors involved, O’Melveny & Myers LLP for Encore Wire and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz for Prysmian, which are firms with a strong track record in facilitating large corporate transactions, indicating thorough due diligence and legal oversight. 04/15/2024 - 12:05 AM MCKINNEY, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Encore Wire (NASDAQ: WIRE) today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Prysmian (BIT: PRY) will acquire Encore Wire for $290.00 per share in cash (the “Transaction”). The Transaction represents a premium of approximately 20% to the 30-day volume weighted average share price (VWAP) as of Friday, April 12, 2024 and approximately 29% to the 90-day VWAP as of the same date. At the terms of the Transaction, Encore Wire’s implied Enterprise Value is approximately €3.9 billion1 representing a multiple of 8.2x EV/2023A EBITDA and 6.3x EV/2023A EBITDA including run rate synergies. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that reflects the remarkable value Encore Wire has created with our expansive single-campus model, low-cost production, centralized distribution and product innovation,” said Daniel L.

The study demonstrated that people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have received at least one prior line of therapy and are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant, lived longer when treated with Columvi® (glofitamab) in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) versus MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) in combination with GemOx. Safety of the combination appeared consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. The data will be submitted to health authorities and shared at an upcoming medical meeting. “People with this aggressive lymphoma facing relapse or progression after initial treatment have limited options – particularly those who are ineligible for stem cell transplant,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Building on Columvi’s established benefits, these data demonstrate the potential of this combination regimen to improve survival outcomes in earlier lines of treatment.” Columvi was the first fixed-duration bispecific antibody to receive accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and conditional marketing authorisation from the European Commission to treat people with R/R DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. These approvals were based on positive results of Columvi as a monotherapy from the pivotal Phase I/II NP30179 study in patients with R/R DLBCL who had previously received two or more prior treatments. Columvi is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to be off-the-shelf and ready for infusion, so patients can start treatment soon after diagnosis. This is particularly important for patients with highly aggressive disease who are at risk of rapid disease progression. Columvi is given as a fixed-duration treatment, offering people with R/R DLBCL who have failed two or more lines of therapy a treatment end date and the possibility of a treatment-free period, unlike continuous treatments. About the STARGLO studyThe STARGLO study [GO41944; NCT04408638] is a Phase III, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Columvi® (glofitamab) in combination with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GemOx) versus MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab) in combination with GemOx in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior line of therapy and who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant.1 Outcome measures include overall survival (primary endpoint), progression-free survival, complete response rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response (secondary endpoints), and safety and tolerability.1 About Columvi® (glofitamab)Columvi is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody designed to target CD3 on the surface of T-cells and CD20 on the surface of B-cells. Columvi was designed with a novel 2:1 structural format. This T-cell engaging bispecific antibody is engineered to have one region that binds to CD3, a protein on T-cells, a type of immune cell, and two regions that bind to CD20, a protein on B-cells, which can be healthy or malignant. This dual-targeting brings the T-cell in close proximity to the B-cell, activating the release of cancer cell-killing proteins from the T-cell. Columvi is part of Roche’s broad and industry-leading CD20xCD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody clinical development programme that also includes Lunsumio® (mosunetuzumab), which aims to provide tailored treatment options that suit the diverse needs, preferences, and experiences of people with blood cancers and healthcare systems. Roche is investigating Columvi as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, including Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin), in earlier lines of treatment for people with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other blood cancers. About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)DLBCL is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.2 DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL.2 While it is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline, as many as 40% of people will relapse or have refractory disease, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.3 Improving treatments earlier in the course of the disease and providing much needed alternative options could help to improve long-term outcomes. Approximately 160,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.2, 4 About Roche in haematologyRoche has been developing medicines for people with malignant and non-malignant blood diseases for more than 25 years; our experience and knowledge in this therapeutic area runs deep.

The drug received FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The advancement of SAR443579 / IPH6101 to Phase 2 by Innate Pharma and the triggering of a €4 million milestone payment from Sanofi are of significant interest to investors and stakeholders in the biopharmaceutical sector. The transition from early-stage clinical trials to Phase 2 indicates a certain level of confidence in the potential efficacy and safety of the treatment, suggesting that the companies are one step closer to potentially bringing a new therapy to market.Financially, milestone payments such as the one received by Innate Pharma are critical components of partnership agreements in the drug development industry. They provide non-dilutive funding which can support ongoing research and development costs and are often seen as positive indicators of a drug candidate's progress. However, investors should be aware that the drug is still in the trial phase and commercialization is contingent on successful completion of all clinical trial phases and regulatory approval processes. Moreover, the specific amount of the milestone payment suggests a modest financial impact relative to the overall cost of drug development. Medical Research Analyst The progression of the NK cell engager SAR443579 / IPH6101 to Phase 2 for the treatment of blood cancers represents a potential breakthrough in oncology, particularly for conditions with high unmet medical needs such as relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). NK cell engagers are a novel class of immunotherapies designed to direct natural killer (NK) cells to target and kill cancer cells, an approach that could complement or offer an alternative to existing treatments such as chemotherapy and CAR-T therapies.The fact that SAR443579 has received FDA Fast Track Designation is noteworthy, as this status is granted to expedite the development of drugs which treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This designation can lead to an expedited review process, potentially bringing the drug to market more quickly if clinical trials are successful. However, while promising, the efficacy and safety profile of SAR443579 will be further scrutinized in this next phase of the trial and the outcomes of Phase 2 will be pivotal in determining the drug's future. 04/15/2024 - 01:00 AM Partner Sanofi advances SAR443579 / IPH6101, ANKET® platform lead asset, a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46xCD16 NK cell engager, to Phase 2 dose expansion in blood cancers Dosing of the first patient in the dose expansion part of the trial triggers a €4m milestone payment to Innate MARSEILLE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today announced that the first patient was dosed in the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the Sanofi-sponsored clinical trial of SAR443579 / IPH6101 (NCT05086315), evaluating SAR443579 as a monotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers with high unmet needs, including relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high-risk myelodysplasia. SAR443579 is an investigational trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46xCD16 NK cell engager from a joint research collaboration between Innate Pharma and Sanofi. SAR443579 received FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Efficacy and safety results from the dose-escalation part of the trial were shared in a poster presentation at the American Society of Hematology 2023 Annual Meeting in San Diego, California. “The progression of SAR443579 to the Phase 2 expansion part of the clinical trial in blood cancers is another step in bringing this innovative NK cell engager to patients,” said Dr. Sonia Quaratino, Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “SAR443579 has shown promising clinical efficacy in the dose escalation of the Phase 1/2 in R/R AML patients, and we look forward to the dose expansion part of the study."" Under the terms of the 2016 research collaboration with Sanofi, the progression to the dose expansion part of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate of €4m. “Our goal is to continue to develop the best and most impactful treatments for patients with cancer,” said Peter Adamson, Global Development Head, Oncology, Sanofi.“We are encouraged by our progress in this study for patients with AML, and look forward to sharing results in the future as data continues to emerge.” More information about the Phase 1/2 trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov.
