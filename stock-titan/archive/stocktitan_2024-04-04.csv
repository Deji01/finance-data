Negative None. 04/04/2024 - 03:01 AM KGC anticipates pro golf sponsees' performances in future LPGA tournaments, including Andrea Lee, who placed 5th in the 2024 Fir Hills Seri Pak Championship.CERRITOS, Calif., April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Korea Ginseng Corp. US (KGCUS) aka JungKwanJang is currently sponsoring pro golfers A-Lim Kim, Andrea Lee, and Yu Liu in The Ladies Professional Golf Association(LPGA). All three players participated in the Fir Hills Seri Pak Championship in Palos Verdes Estates, California. Despite the windy weather, all three players exceeded performance expectations. Especially Andrea Lee, a Stanford University alum who won the 2022 AmazingCre Creek Portland Classic Tour, who tied for fifth in the Fir Hills Seri Pak Championship. Korean red ginseng, which has long been used as a health supplement and tonic for its disease-prevention and health-boosting properties in East Asia, has been loved by diplomats, ambassadors, and sports players, due to its effectiveness in supporting healthy blood flow. Healthy blood circulation is an essential component of maintaining overall health, and measures relating to regulating blood flow are quickly gaining traction. Oftentimes, side effects of poor circulation are cold hands and feet and can result in swelling and numbing in severe cases. In addition, poor circulation can result in fatigue due to the lack of sufficient nutrients delivered throughout the body. Especially during the tour season, athletes tend to experience travel fatigue from consistently sitting in fixed positions with limited mobility on planes and cars as they go from one tournament to another. This travel fatigue is often a result of the lack of muscle movement during sitting because this slows down the circulation of blood and lymph fluid. This tires the muscles and joints that need blood and lymph to supply these organs with oxygen and nutrients and take away waste. Ginseng is often known for its benefits in supporting healthy blood circulation. There have been over 430+ studies such as research by Dr. Chul Min Ahn Et Al indicates that patients who consumed Korean red ginseng for eight months experienced a notable increase in blood flow within the coronary arteries and the major vessels that supply the heart, compared to those who were given a placebo. This suggests that optimized circulation from Korean red ginseng intake could help these athletes experiencing travel fatigue due to continuous limited mobility. Korea Ginseng Corporation will continue to sponsor pro-golfers who use Korean red ginseng. They will continue to supply products to keep the athletes in the best condition possible and are anticipating a great tour season for each player this year. About Korea Ginseng Corp. Korea Ginseng Corp. (KGC), a global herbal dietary company, is home to the world's number one ginseng brand, JungKwanJang. Established in 1899, it is one of the most proven and trusted herbal dietary supplement manufacturers, providing the highest quality, traditionally harvested Korean Red Ginseng products to support health and well-being.

The company secured a private placement, developed new technologies, and achieved positive clinical outcomes. Financially, Celyad projects sufficient funds till Q2 2025, with a focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency. Positive Celyad Oncology successfully completed a strategic shift towards innovation in immunotherapy. The company secured a private placement of EUR 9.8 million to cover operating expenses till Q2 2025. Celyad developed new technologies like multiplex shRNA non-gene edited technology and multispecific NKG2D-based CAR T-cell platform. Financially, Celyad projects sufficient funds till Q2 2025, with a focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency. The company reported a net loss of €8.5 million for 2023, a significant improvement from €40.9 million in 2022. Celyad anticipates the arrival of a new CEO in the first half of 2024, indicating a potential leadership change. The company will attend important industry events like the AACR Annual Meeting and ASGCT Annual Meeting to showcase its latest research and technologies. Negative Celyad reported a decrease in revenue from €0.1 million in 2022 to zero in 2023. The company recognized a non-cash impairment of EUR 14.9 million on a statutory basis, reflecting business strategy changes. Net cash used in operations remained high at €15.2 million in 2023, indicating ongoing financial challenges. The net assets of the company fell below half of the Company’s capital, potentially raising concerns among shareholders. Celyad's license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in both 2023 and 2022, highlighting a lack of income from key partnerships. Financial Analyst The financial results of Celyad Oncology highlight a strategic pivot towards a focus on research and development, particularly in the field of CAR T-cell therapy. The company's shift from clinical development to prioritizing R&D and IP monetization is reflected in the significant reduction in research and development expenses from €18.9 million to €4.6 million year-over-year. This downsizing is indicative of a broader industry trend where biotech firms streamline operations to conserve cash during development phases. The reported treasury position of €7.0 million, with a runway extending into the second quarter of 2025, suggests a relatively stable financial situation in the short term. However, the absence of revenue generation and the reliance on private placements for funding raise questions about the company's long-term financial sustainability and its ability to monetize its research outcomes. Medical Research Analyst The operational highlights of Celyad Oncology, particularly the development of multiplex short hairpin RNA technology and multispecific NKG2D-based CAR T-cells, underscore the company's innovative efforts in immunotherapy. The ability of their CD19/NKG2DL multispecific CAR T-cells to potentially counteract relapses due to CD19 antigen loss is a notable advancement. The scientific community will be looking forward to the updated results to be presented at the ASGCT Annual Meeting. These developments could have significant implications for the treatment of certain cancers, potentially leading to partnerships or licensing agreements that could provide financial upside for the company. Market Research Analyst The strategic shift of Celyad Oncology towards R&D discovery and IP monetization could position the company favorably within the competitive landscape of the CAR T-cell therapy market. By focusing on the monetization of its IP portfolio, Celyad may attract strategic partnerships and licensing deals that could provide a more consistent revenue stream compared to the volatile income from clinical programs. However, the market for CAR T-cell therapies is highly competitive with significant entry barriers and the success of this strategy will largely depend on the company's ability to maintain a technological edge and secure advantageous collaborations. 04/04/2024 - 01:00 AM MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Celyad Oncology (Brussels:CYAD) (Paris:CYAD) (NASDAQ:CYAD) (the “Company”), today announces its financial results for the fiscal year 2023 ended December 31, 2023, and provides a business update.

I am glad to report that, throughout the past year, the hard work and dedication of the entire Celyad Oncology team has generated remarkable achievements and positive changes throughout the Company, confirming the value creation potential of our strategic choices.” 2023 corporate accomplishments The Company has secured an EUR 9.8 million private placement from historical shareholders intended to cover our operating expenses well into the second quarter of 2025. 2023 operational highlights Multiplex short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) non-gene edited technology – The company developed a chimeric micro-RNA (miRNA) cluster to enable multiplexing of shRNAs, designed for easy, efficient, and tunable downregulation of up to four target genes simultaneously in CAR T-cells and data presented and published in 2023.

After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2024 and 2025, the Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures into the second quarter of 2025, i.e over at least the next 12 months from the date that the financial statements are issued. Key financial figures for full-year 2023, compared with full-year 2022, are summarized below: Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Full year 2023 Full year 2022 Revenue 0.1 - Research and development expenses (4.6) (18.9) General and administrative expenses (6.0) (10.5) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 0 14.7 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets 0 (35.1) Other income/(expenses) 2.1 9.0 Operating loss (8.5) (40.9) Loss for the period/year (8.5) (40.9) Net cash used in operations (15.2) (28.0) Treasury position (1) 7.0 12.4 (1) “Treasury position” is an alternative performance measure determined by adding Short-term investments and Cash and cash equivalents from the statement of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's purpose of this measure is to identify the level of cash available internally (excluding external sources of financing) within 12 months. The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in 2023 and in 2022. Research and Development (R&D) expenses were €4.6 million in 2023 as compared to €18.9 million in 2022, a year-over-year decrease of €14.3 million. The decrease in the Company’s R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company’s decision to discontinue some of clinical and preclinical programs after the Company’s decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy over the last few months of 2022, as well as a decrease of the employee expenses mainly related to headcount reduction to support the Company’s reorganization. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €6.0 million in 2023 as compared to €10.5 million in 2022, a decrease of €4.5 million. This decrease is mainly related to the decrease in employee expenses related to headcount reduction and management changes to support the Company’s reorganization and to a decrease in insurance costs and consulting fees. There is no change in fair value of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as Management has determined that there has been no event (such as a firm sublicense or collaboration contract) that increases the probability of the projected future revenue or cash outflow due to Celdara Medical, LLC and Dartmouth College, indicating that the probability is remote, similar to December 31, 2022. The Company’s other income is principally associated with grants received from the Walloon Region mainly in the form of recoverable cash advances (RCAs) and R&D tax credit income as well as the gain on sale of Property, plant & equipment from the terms of the asset purchase agreement between Celyad and Cellistic for €1.3 million. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was €8.5 million, or €0.33 per share, compared to a net loss of €40.9 million, or €1.81 per share, for the same period in 2022. As noted above, the decrease in net loss between periods was primarily due to the non-cash impairment adjustment on the Oncology intangible assets done in 2022 and to the decrease of R&D and General and administrative expenses in 2023. Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, which excludes non-cash effects, amounted to €15.2 million, which is in line with net cash used in operations of €28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Celyad Inc. non-cash impairment An impairment review of its financial results for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 show a non-cash impairment of EUR 14.9 million on a statutory basis only. This results from the business strategy change, under which the Company has decided to discontinue the development of its remaining clinical programs, shifting from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its IP portfolio through partnerships, collaborations and license agreements. According to the accounting standards definition, as uncertainty exists on the timing and amount of the new strategy outcomes, the Company had to recognize a full impairment loss on the remaining value of the financial participation on the subsidiary Celyad Inc. This accounting conclusion, which reflects a picture of the situation on 31 December 2023, does not affect the Management’s commitment to continue the exploitation of this US subsidiary in the new business strategy of the Company. Furthermore, this impairment may be reversed once there will be no more uncertainty on the chance to recover the financial participation into Celyad Inc. The net assets of the Company per 31 December 2023, on a BE-GAAP non-consolidated basis, having fallen below half of the Company’s capital, the board of directors will submit to the ordinary shareholders meeting on the 6th of May 2024 the proposal to continue the Company’s activities in accordance with article 7:228 of the Belgian Code for Companies and Associations. The board of directors will publish a special report in this respect, by the 5th of April 2024 together with the convening notice with proposed resolutions for the shareholders’ meeting. Annual Report 2023 The Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 will be published on April 05, 2024, and will be available on the Company’s website, www.celyad.com. The Company’s statutory auditor, BDO Réviseurs d’Entreprises SRL, has confirmed that the completed audit has not revealed any material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. BDO also confirmed that the accounting data reported in the press release are consistent, in all material respects, with the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.

On February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CRE: TSXV). Subsequently, Power Nickel has exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Nisk Project and delivered notice to Critical Elements that it intends to exercise its second option to bring its ownership to 80%. The last remaining commitment to exercise the option was the delivery of a NI-43-101 Technical report which has now occurred. The Nisk property comprises a significant land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts. Power Nickel is focused on expanding the historical high-grade nickel-copper PGE mineralization with a series of drill programs designed to test the initial Nisk discovery zone and to explore the land package for adjacent potential Nickel deposits. In addition to the Nisk project, Power Nickel owns significant land packages in British Colombia and Chile. Power Nickel is expected to reorganize these assets in a related vehicle through a plan of arrangement. Power Nickel announced on June 8, 2021, that an agreement had been made to complete the 100% acquisition of its Golden Ivan project in the heart of the Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle has reported mineral resources (past production and current resources) in 130 million ounces of gold, 800 million ounces of silver, and 40 billion pounds of copper (Resource World). This property hosts two known mineral showings (gold ore and Magee) and a portion of the past-producing Silverado mine, reportedly exploited between 1921 and 1939. These mineral showings are Polymetallic veins containing quantities of silver, lead, zinc, plus/minus gold, and plus/minus copper. Power Nickel is also 100 percent owner of five properties comprising over 50,000 acres strategically located in the prolific iron-oxide-copper-gold belt of northern Chile. It also owns a 3-per-cent NSR royalty interest on any future production from the Copaquire copper-molybdenum deposit sold to a subsidiary of Teck Resources Inc. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Teck has the right to acquire one-third of the 3-per-cent NSR for $3 million at any time. The Copaquire property borders Teck's producing Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile's first region. For further information, readers are encouraged to contact: Power Nickel Inc.

They bought 10,000 ordinary shares at an average price of £80.6478 per share and intend to cancel them. Following the transaction, the company has 164,206,268 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement of a company purchasing its own shares is a significant event that reflects on its capital allocation strategy and market sentiment. The buyback of 10,000 shares at a price range between £80.0200 and £81.0800 suggests a strategic move to invest in the company's stock, potentially indicating the management's confidence in the business's intrinsic value. This action can be seen as a positive signal to investors, often resulting in an uptick in stock price due to the reduced supply of shares and the implicit endorsement by the company.Moreover, the cancellation of the purchased shares will lead to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, which could have a beneficial effect on earnings per share (EPS) metrics, often used by investors to gauge a company's profitability on a per-share basis. This could make the stock more attractive to value investors looking for undervalued companies with strong fundamentals.However, it's important to monitor the company's future financial flexibility as share buybacks can also signal a lack of available growth opportunities or productive investments. Additionally, the timing and price of the buyback should be evaluated to assess whether the company is buying back shares at an optimal price, avoiding overpayment which could be detrimental to shareholder value in the long term. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the repurchase of shares using the authority granted at the Annual General Meeting indicates a planned capital return to shareholders. The average price paid per share, £80.6478, along with the highest and lowest prices, provides an insight into the market conditions on the day of the transaction. The decision to execute this buyback through Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange ensures transparency and adherence to market regulations.The impact on the company's balance sheet must be considered, as the cash used for the buyback reduces the company's cash reserves, which could affect its liquidity ratio. However, this could also be indicative of efficient cash management if the company's cash reserves are robust. Furthermore, the reduction in treasury shares and the overall share count could potentially improve return on equity (ROE) by reducing the equity base against which returns are calculated.Investors should consider the context of this buyback within the company's broader financial strategy, including dividend policy, debt levels and investment plans. A holistic view of the company's financial health and strategic direction is critical for assessing the long-term implications of such a buyback. Corporate Governance Expert Share buybacks can also be evaluated from a corporate governance standpoint. The board's decision to authorize share repurchases reflects their stewardship role in managing shareholder capital. It is essential to ensure that the buyback is not being used to artificially inflate executive compensation metrics, which are sometimes tied to stock performance indicators like EPS. The timing of the buyback, following the authorization from the Annual General Meeting, demonstrates adherence to shareholder-approved corporate actions.It's also noteworthy that the company has communicated the transaction details transparently, including a full breakdown of individual purchases, which bolsters corporate transparency. Investors and analysts should assess whether the buyback aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and whether it serves the best interest of all shareholders, including minority interests.Finally, it's critical to analyze the buyback in the context of the company's overall capital allocation strategy, including investments in growth opportunities, research and development and other areas that could contribute to long-term value creation. 04/04/2024 - 02:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / April 4, 2024 / The Company announces that on 03 April 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

This analysis would help in understanding Pharming's financial stability and growth prospects, especially in the biopharmaceutical sector where R&D intensity and regulatory hurdles can significantly impact financial outcomes.Furthermore, the Form 20-F is a critical document for U.S. investors considering it contains additional details that are not typically found in European annual reports, such as risks related to currency fluctuations, legal proceedings and market-specific challenges. The cross-listing on Euronext Amsterdam and Nasdaq also suggests a broader investor base and the need for compliance with both Dutch and U.S. regulatory standards, which can affect operational costs and the company's ability to attract international investors.

The analysis would also consider the competitive landscape, including how Pharming is positioned relative to its peers in terms of innovation, market reach and financial robustness.Additionally, the timing of the report's release and its alignment with industry reporting norms could affect stock volatility. For instance, if Pharming's financial performance deviates significantly from market expectations or industry benchmarks, it could lead to a reevaluation of the company's stock by investors.

Barclays Bank PLC Updates Announcement of 16 Cash Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations,2024-04-04T04:43:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,"Barclays Bank PLC announces results of cash tender offers and consent solicitations for exchange-traded notes, providing details on expired and extended series, purchase prices, and settlement dates.","Barclays Bank PLC Updates Announcement of 16 Cash Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Barclays Bank PLC announces results of cash tender offers and consent solicitations for exchange-traded notes, providing details on expired and extended series, purchase prices, and settlement dates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Barclays Bank PLC's announcement regarding the cash tender offers and consent solicitations for its exchange-traded notes (ETNs) carries significant implications for the financial markets. The tender offer process, wherein the bank is seeking to repurchase its outstanding ETNs, can be indicative of the bank's liquidity management strategies and its balance sheet optimization efforts. Specifically, the repurchase at specified prices may suggest an attempt to manage the bank's debt profile or to take advantage of favorable market conditions.The amendments to the purchase price for certain ETNs highlight the dynamic nature of these instruments and their sensitivity to market conditions. Investors holding these ETNs should be aware that the purchase price may be less than the trading price at the expiration date, which could influence their investment decisions. This action by Barclays can also impact the secondary market for these ETNs, potentially affecting their liquidity and price volatility.From a broader perspective, such corporate actions can signal market sentiment and the bank's outlook on the economic environment. It is imperative for stakeholders to closely monitor these developments as they may affect the perceived risk and return profile of Barclays' debt instruments. Market Research Analyst The extension of the expiration deadline and amendment of the purchase price for certain ETNs by Barclays Bank PLC may reflect strategic positioning within the market. This move could be interpreted as a response to market demand, investor feedback, or internal assessments of the ETNs' future performance. The premium offered over the closing indicative note value for some series suggests a motivation to incentivize investors to part with their holdings, which could be part of a broader strategy to streamline Barclays' product offerings or reduce outstanding liabilities.It is also worth noting the role of ETNs in the investment landscape. As debt instruments that provide exposure to various indices, ETNs are subject to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Barclays' decision to adjust the terms of its tender offers may have ripple effects on the valuation of similar instruments in the market, potentially altering investor appetite for ETNs and similar products. Market participants should consider these factors and the potential for future amendments to the offers when making investment decisions. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of Barclays' tender offers and consent solicitations are multifaceted. The bank's ability to amend the terms of the offer, including the purchase price and expiration deadline, is governed by the detailed conditions set out in the initial statement and subsequent supplements. Noteholders must understand the legal ramifications of tendering their notes, especially in light of potential amendments that could affect the purchase price.Additionally, the consent solicitation process to amend certain provisions of the ETNs underscores the importance of the governance framework surrounding these financial instruments. The Proposed Amendment, once effectuated, could alter the terms of the ETNs in a manner that may be more favorable to the issuer. Investors should be well-informed about their rights and the implications of such amendments on their investments.For Barclays, the legal considerations also extend to ensuring compliance with securities laws and regulations, particularly in the communication and execution of the tender offers. The bank's adherence to disclosure requirements and its obligations to treat all note holders equitably are critical to maintaining the integrity of the process. 04/04/2024 - 12:43 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) announced today that, in connection with its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an “Offer”) to purchase any and all of its outstanding exchange-traded notes (the “Notes” or the “ETNs”) of the sixteen separate series listed in tables below (each, a “Series”) and the solicitation of consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Notes (the “Noteholders”) to amend certain provisions of the Notes with respect to each Series, it has: determined the results of the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Series included in Table 1 below (each, an “Expired Series”); and extended the expiration deadline for the Offer and Consent Solicitation with respect to each Series included in Table 2 below (each, an “Extended Series”) and amended the purchase price per Note (the “Purchase Price”) for certain Extended Series as set forth in Table 2 below. Each Offer and Consent Solicitation is subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in the Initial Statement, as supplemented by Supplement No. 3 dated April 4, 2024 (as so supplemented, and as it may be further supplemented or amended from time to time, the “Statement”). The “Initial Statement” is the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated December 7, 2023, as supplemented by Supplement No. 1 dated March 7, 2024 and Supplement No. 2 dated March 20, 2024. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meanings given in the Statement. Expired Series The Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Expired Series expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 3, 2024 (with respect to each Expired Series, the “Expiration Deadline”). For each Expired Series, the Issuer has received and accepted the specified number of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Deadline. All conditions to the Offer for each Expired Series were deemed satisfied or waived by the Issuer as of the Expiration Deadline. The aggregate purchase price of the Notes for each Series accepted by the Issuer will be the specified dollar amount set forth in Table 1 below, reflecting the previously announced Purchase Price per Note. On April 10, 2024 (the “Settlement Date”), Noteholders whose Notes have been accepted for purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer will receive the previously announced applicable Purchase Price.

Notes purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the Offers with respect to the Expired Series will be cancelled on the Settlement Date. The Issuer currently intends to effectuate the Proposed Amendment for each Expired Series promptly after the Expiration Date and redeem all outstanding Notes at any time after the Proposed Amendment becomes effective with respect to that Series. As described in the Initial Statement, the Issuer will publicly announce any decision to redeem the outstanding Notes of any Expired Series by issuing a redemption notice. The payment upon redemption to Noteholders for an Expired Series may be greater than or less than the Purchase Price for that Series pursuant to the relevant Offer but will not include any premium payment or any amount in excess of the applicable Closing Indicative Note Value on the Valuation Date of such redemption. Extended Series The Offer and Consent Solicitation with respect to each Extended Series were previously scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 3, 2024 and will instead expire at 6:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2024 (with respect to each Extended Series, the “Expiration Deadline”), unless the Offer with respect to any Extended Series is further extended or early terminated by the Issuer, in which case notification to that effect will be given by or on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the methods set out in the Statement. In addition, the Purchase Price per Note applicable to certain Extended Series has been amended. Any Purchase Price per Note that has been amended from the value specified in the Initial Statement is presented in boldface type in Table 2 below. The specified Purchase Price per Note for each Extended Series reflects a premium to the Closing Indicative Note Value of that Series on April 3, 2024.

If a Noteholder has already validly tendered and not withdrawn its Notes of an Extended Series pursuant to an Offer set forth in the Initial Statement, such Noteholder is not required to take any further action with respect to such Notes and such tender constitutes a valid tender for purposes of the relevant Offer, as amended hereby. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 3, 2024, Noteholders have validly tendered the number of Notes specified in Table 2 above. Any amendment to the Purchase Price per Note set forth above will be applicable to such Notes and may result in a lower Purchase Price than would have resulted under the terms set forth in the Initial Statement. The Purchase Price is payable on June 12, 2024, unless the relevant Offer is further extended or early terminated by the Issuer. Because the Closing Indicative Note Value for each Series is calculated based on the applicable Closing Index Level, if the applicable Closing Index Level has increased as of the Expiration Date, the Purchase Price of that Series may be significantly less than the Closing Indicative Note Value on the Expiration Date. In addition, the Notes of any Series may trade at a substantial premium to or discount from the applicable Closing Indicative Note Value. Accordingly, the Purchase Price for any Series may be lower than the trading price of the Notes of that Series on the Expiration Date. If on or prior to the Expiration Date, the applicable Closing Index Level with respect to any Series set forth in Table 2 above has increased or decreased from its level on April 3, 2024, the Issuer may amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation with respect to that Series, including by increasing or decreasing the Purchase Price of that Series, or in its sole and absolute discretion, to further extend, withdraw or terminate such Offer or Consent Solicitation. On each Trading Day while an Offer remains open, the Purchase Price for the relevant Series, as well as the Closing Index Level and the Closing Indicative Note Value for that Trading Day for the relevant Series, will be published for that Series by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, at http://ipathetn.barclays/static/tenderoffers.app. In the event that publication of the Closing Index Level for any Series on any Trading Day is delayed, the Issuer will publish such information as soon as practicable following the publication of that Closing Index Level. Subject to applicable law, the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Series is being made independently of the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each other Series, and the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to withdraw or terminate the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series if any of the conditions described in the Statement have not been satisfied or waived without also withdrawing or terminating any other Offer or Consent Solicitation. In addition, the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to extend or amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series at any time and for any reason without also extending or amending any other Offer or Consent Solicitation.

Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement. You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level of the underlying index or exchange rate, as applicable (the “index”) between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the level of such index has increased or decreased, as the case may be. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, if Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the commodity markets, the U.S. stock markets or the U.S. Treasury market, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index. Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector, the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments. A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: The ETNs are not listed on any securities exchange. A trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited. No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.

AT&T Commitment to Help Close the Digital Divide Increases to $5 Billion,2024-04-04T04:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"AT&T commits an additional $3 billion to help close the digital divide, aiming to reach 25 million people by 2030.

The company's total commitment since 2021 is now $5 billion. AT&T focuses on addressing affordability and adoption barriers to connectivity for those in need. Positive None. Negative None. Economist AT&T's commitment of an additional $3 billion towards closing the digital divide represents a significant investment in social infrastructure, which is likely to have a positive impact on the economy. By increasing digital connectivity, the initiative could stimulate economic growth in underserved areas, potentially leading to job creation and improved educational outcomes. This investment aligns with broader trends towards digitalization and could enhance AT&T's brand reputation, possibly leading to increased customer loyalty and market share.Moreover, the focus on affordability and adoption targets a key issue in the digital economy: ensuring that the benefits of technology are equitably distributed. This could lead to increased demand for AT&T's services among new user demographics. However, the long-term nature of the investment means that returns may not be immediate and the impact on AT&T's financial performance will need to be assessed over time. Additionally, the success of this initiative will depend on effective execution and the ability to measure and report on the impact of these investments. Market Research Analyst AT&T's strategy to expand internet access and digital literacy may cater to a growing consumer demand for corporate social responsibility, particularly in the tech sector. The expansion of the Connected Learning Centers (CLCs) and collaboration with local nonprofits could help AT&T penetrate deeper into local markets and establish a presence in communities that have been traditionally underserved.From a market perspective, this initiative could also serve as a differentiation factor against competitors, potentially attracting socially conscious investors and customers. However, it is important to monitor how these investments translate into actual service adoption rates and whether the enhanced infrastructure leads to a proportionate increase in revenue streams. The company's ability to leverage these initiatives into sustainable business growth will be a key factor to watch in the coming years. Telecommunications Policy Expert The commitment by AT&T to invest in digital infrastructure and literacy is timely, given the ongoing discussions around the digital divide and the need for greater broadband access. The company's pledge to support the Affordable Connectivity Program after federal funding winds down demonstrates a proactive approach to public-private partnerships, which are essential in addressing large-scale societal issues like internet access.AT&T's advocacy for renewed funding and long-term solutions highlights the importance of stable policy environments for telecommunications companies. It also underscores the role of such companies in influencing policy directions. While these investments can have a positive social impact, they also reflect a strategic positioning within the sector, as companies that can effectively navigate and shape policy environments may gain a competitive advantage. The effectiveness of these investments in influencing policy and the company's ability to secure additional funding through programs like BEAD will be important to the long-term success of their initiative. 04/04/2024 - 12:01 AM DALLAS, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Decade-long commitment of internet services and digital literacy resources aims to reach 25 million people to help close the digital divide Key Takeaways: AT&T commits an additional $3 billion, for a total of $5 billion since 2021, to narrow the digital divideAT&T aims to help 25 million people get and stay connected by 2030The company’s additional $3 billion commitment will address the main barriers to connectivity – affordability and adoption – for those who need it most.With millions in the United States still lacking internet, isolating them from digital literacy skills and a pathway to economic opportunity, AT&T* announced today it is committing an additional $3 billion by 2030 to help close the digital divide, bringing the company's total commitment to $5 billion since 2021. This cumulative commitment includes an ambitious goal to help 25 million people get and stay connected to affordable, high-speed internet access throughout this decade. Working to close the digital divide is the linchpin of AT&T's mission to leave no one behind when it comes to online opportunity. This commitment is a pillar of the work the company does to help build this country's digital infrastructure. According to a Broadband Now study1, 42 million Americans still don't have access to wired or fixed wireless broadband connections. And, many who do have access lack the digital skills to take advantage of the economic, health, education and social opportunities it provides. It is AT&T's mission to help every American connect to greater possibilities by not only expanding access to internet connections, but also addressing affordability and adoption challenges. The company's additional $3 billion commitment will address the main barriers to connectivity – affordability and adoption – for those who need it most. ""Connectivity is critical for success and prosperity in America today. Whether it's a first-generation high school graduate applying for college, a veteran accessing telehealth services, or a grandparent connecting with their family thousands of miles away — we want to help unlock greater possibility for the millions of people who remain unconnected,"" said AT&T CEO John Stankey. ""The pace of innovation and the global economy aren't waiting on anyone, and we're committed to bringing connectivity and digital literacy in reach for all Americans."" Since 2021, nearly 5 million Americans have benefited from our discounted internet service and digital literacy programs. AT&T continues to expand its network of Connected Learning Centers (CLC) in communities across the country that are equipped with high-speed internet connections and computers supplied by Dell, Inc. Our CLCs provide access to these resources, with 37 centers currently operating with support from local non-profit organizations across fifteen states. AT&T CLCs, such as the Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund (SALEF) in Los Angeles, provide not only internet connections and computers but also the skills and training needed to help people safely navigate the online world. CLC's serve kids, college students, adults and seniors with curriculum that teaches basic techniques for using email and search engines. Additionally, CLCs provide mentorship programs and customized instruction for those who need help accomplishing specific tasks online, such as paying bills, applying for jobs and submitting college applications. ""Coming to SALEF and utilizing their Connected Learning Center has allowed me to pursue U.S. citizenship,"" said Leslie Gutierrez, who is originally from Honduras. ""Without the computers and internet access within the CLC, I wouldn't have been able to gather information as quickly or complete this process as efficiently as I did. The SALEF CLC allowed me to confidently pursue my path to citizenship, and for that I am incredibly grateful."" ""As a high school senior, I'm faced with a lot of big decisions concerning what comes after graduation,"" said Gia Marie Duarte, student at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. ""Coming to SALEF made the process of figuring out my path forward a lot less daunting, as I was able to utilize the CLC to research and apply to colleges and universities. Thanks to the SALEF CLC, I have a lot to look forward to in my future."" In addition to AT&T Connected Learning Center growth and impact, communities have seen: More than $123 million in charitable contributions given to non-profit organizations that are on the frontlines of addressing the digital divide360,000 students reached through The Achievery, AT&T's free digital learning platform in collaboration with after-school program organizations288,000 adults educated through digital literacy resources, courses and workshops in collaboration with Public Library Association, National PTA and other collaborators.245,000 laptops, devices or internet connection donationsWhether it is online safety curriculum or teaching people how to manage online transactions – seniors, students and others are exploring new worlds and feeding curiosities. Increasing Coverage Throughout America's Tribal Lands More than a third of Tribal lands lack broadband connectivity2, and more than 18% of indigenous people have no internet access at all3. Since 2021, more citizens on American Tribal lands can access education programs and healthcare resources virtually, explore new job opportunities and stay current on the latest news from home. AT&T has expanded network coverage on Tribal lands by more than 40% and have opened AT&T Connected Learning Centers on the Rincon and Pinoleville Pomo Nation reservations in California and the Cherokee Nation Tribal land in Oklahoma. ""The Rincon Tribe is committed to closing the digital divide within our reservation,"" stated Bo Mazzetti, Chairman of the Rincon Tribe. ""With the help and support of AT&T, we have built a computer resource lab for our tribal youth, seniors and residents that has already improved the lives of many through student activities and workforce development. It is our continued goal to help advance our people through technology and bring access to educational services to our community. We look forward to other tribes evolving like we have had the opportunity to do."" Our additional $3B commitment will address the main barriers to connectivity – access, affordability and adoption – for those who need it most. Connectivity Services: As the Federal Government's Affordable Connectivity Program winds down later this spring – absent additional funding from Congress, AT&T will continue to offer our Access from AT&T service. Access makes the internet more affordable for customers by providing qualifying households with high-speed internet for $30 per month. This service includes Wi-Fi at no additional charge and does not include deposit fees. The company will expand connectivity offers to include AT&T Prepaid, Cricket and other connectivity solutions as they become available. At the same time, AT&T will continue to advocate that policymakers renew funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program and find a long-term solution to support families most in need. People affected by the digital divide need policies in place to help stimulate the private investment needed to create more affordable, high-speed internet access. Education Offers: AT&T continues to offer discounted wireless solutions to more than 135,000 public and private K-12 schools, colleges, and universities. Public-Private Partnerships: For those areas hardest to reach with connectivity, public-private partnerships remain key to closing the gaps that still exist around the country. In the last three years, the federal government has provided unprecedented funding for broadband infrastructure, access and connectivity. Since 2021, AT&T has won competitive bids for funding to deploy more high-speed fiber broadband in 12 states including California, Louisiana and Texas. States also are gearing up to receive more than $41 billion in federal funds for building networks as part of the Broadband Equity, Accessibility and Deployment (BEAD) program. We're looking forward to taking part in BEAD funding opportunities and helping to close the country's remaining broadband gap. Best-in-class 5G and fiber networks: With Fiber and 5G, we've aggressively expanded our coverage; increasing capacity, and strengthening network resiliency. Simply put, AT&T remains focused on becoming the best and most expansive network in America. AT&T has the best global coverage of any U.S. wireless provider4 and the largest wireless network covering 99%5 of Americans, with 5G coverage reaching 295 million people in more than 24,500 cities and towns in the U.S., including more than 210 million people with 5G+. *About AT&T We help more than 100 million U.S. families, friends and neighbors, plus nearly 2.5 million businesses, connect to greater possibility.

MINISO's success is credited to its IP collaborations, product innovation, and strategic store expansions, leading to exceptional store performance and sales growth. The brand aims to continue its global expansion by adding 550-650 new stores worldwide by year-end. Negative None. Market Research Analyst MINISO's strategic move to open a new IP collection flagship store in the American Dream Mall, New Jersey, is a significant step in its expansion strategy in the North American market. The collaboration with Sanrio, a well-established brand known for its popular Hello Kitty franchise, is likely to attract a broad customer base, especially among young consumers and families. This partnership leverages the power of brand recognition and consumer nostalgia, which can be a powerful tool in driving foot traffic and sales.Moreover, the impressive growth figures presented by MINISO, including a 39.4% YoY global revenue increase and a 128% annual growth rate in North America, point to a strong market presence and consumer demand. The company's focus on integrating popular IPs into their product lines has proven to be a successful strategy, as evidenced by the exceptional sales figures from their Times Square flagship store openings. The expansion into key locations and the aggressive store opening plans, with a target of 550-650 new stores, suggest a bullish outlook for the company's growth trajectory. Retail Industry Analyst The retail sector is witnessing a shift towards experiential shopping and MINISO's approach to creating a 'fantastical and fashionable' shopping experience aligns with this trend. By creating immersive and themed retail environments, MINISO can differentiate itself from competitors and potentially increase customer loyalty and brand engagement. The choice of the American Dream Mall, a location known for its entertainment offerings, is strategic for attracting the mall's high foot traffic and enhancing brand visibility.MINISO's same-store sales growth of 75% YoY in North America, significantly outperforming the global overseas average, indicates a highly effective regional strategy. This success can be attributed to the company's understanding of local consumer preferences and its ability to deliver a tailored shopping experience. The focus on competitive store locations and high-quality shopping experiences are key factors in driving this performance. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, MINISO's agile approach to expansion and innovation will be critical in maintaining its competitive edge. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, MINISO's reported Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) of 178 million USD and a total revenue of 160 million USD in North America for 2023 are strong indicators of the company's financial health and market penetration. The aggressive growth rate, particularly in North America, is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment and could lead to an increase in stock value. However, investors should also consider the costs associated with rapid expansion, such as increased operational expenses and potential market saturation risks.It's also important to monitor how MINISO manages its inventory in line with these expansions. The introduction of new stores increases inventory demand and efficiency in inventory management will be important to maintain profitability. Additionally, as MINISO continues to expand, the scalability of its business model and the adaptability to different market dynamics will be key factors in sustaining its growth without compromising margins. 04/04/2024 - 02:36 AM NEW YORK, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Global lifestyle brand MINISO will open a new IP collection flagship store in the iconic American Dream Mall, New Jersey, in May.

The test addresses a significant public health concern due to the spread of arboviruses like dengue and Zika. Grifols aims to improve donor screening efficiency and safety with this innovative solution. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The CE mark approval for Grifols' Procleix ArboPlex Assay represents a significant advancement in the field of transfusion medicine. As arboviruses like chikungunya, dengue, West Nile and Zika continue to pose risks, especially in the context of global warming and increased travel, the ability to screen blood effectively is paramount. A multi-virus detection system streamlines the screening process, potentially reducing the need for donor deferral and enhancing the efficiency of blood banks. The impact on the healthcare system could be profound, as it not only safeguards the blood supply but also minimizes the economic burden of transfusion-transmitted infections. Market Research Analyst In terms of market implications, the introduction of the Procleix ArboPlex Assay by Grifols could solidify the company's position in the diagnostic market. The demand for more sophisticated screening methods is likely to grow, influenced by the factors driving the spread of arboviruses. Grifols' innovation may lead to increased sales and market share in the diagnostic segment, potentially affecting the company's financial performance positively. However, the actual impact on the stock market will depend on how quickly and widely the new assay is adopted by blood banks and how it compares to competing products in terms of cost and reliability. Healthcare Industry Analyst From an industry perspective, Grifols' achievement with the Procleix ArboPlex Assay could set a new standard for blood safety protocols. The ability to detect multiple arboviruses in a single test is not only a technological feat but also a strategic move that aligns with the increasing regulatory focus on blood safety. This development may spur competitors to accelerate their own research and development efforts, possibly leading to a wave of innovation in the sector. Over the long term, this could lead to improved global health outcomes and a more resilient blood supply system. 04/04/2024 - 04:00 AM Grifols’ in vitro nucleic acid test detects four types of arboviruses, helping mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections Arboviruses are a growing emerging threat, with changes in climate and increasing global connectivity making the geographic spread more prevalent CE mark for Grifols’ Procleix ArboPlex Assay reinforces the company’s leadership in transfusion medicine and commitment to ensuring the safety of the world’s blood supply BARCELONA, Spain, April 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grifols (MCE: GRF, MCE: GRF.P NASDAQ: GRFS), one of the world’s leading producers of plasma-derived medicines and innovative diagnostic solutions, today announced that its new Procleix ArboPlex Assay has obtained the CE mark under the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), the first for an automated nucleic acid test (NAT) specifically validated for screening blood donors to detect four major arboviruses: chikungunya, dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses. These are the four most significant arboviruses of concern, all spread through mosquito vectors. Changes in climate and increasing global connectivity have made the geographic spread of – and growing exposure to – arboviruses a major public health concern. With the dengue virus alone, there were more than 5 million cases and 5,000 deaths reported globally in 2023.1 Further strengthening the Grifols Procleix portfolio for blood donor screening, the Procleix ArboPlex Assay uses plasma or serum samples to detect arboviral RNA. Currently, risk for arboviruses in blood donors is evaluated either with a monoplex test, duplex test or through a questionnaire in which donors who declare having traveled to or prior residence in arbovirus-endemic areas are temporarily deferred. Blood banks and collection centers could decide that deferrals are unnecessary if donors were tested and found negative using the Procleix ArboPlex Assay. “With its 4-in-1 arbovirus test feature, the Grifols Procleix ArboPlex Assay has the ability to speed up and overall improve donor screening laboratory efficiency,” said Antonio Martínez, president of Grifols Diagnostic Business Unit. “Certification of this new assay provides a reliable and efficient solution to ensure accurate and consistent results, demonstrating Grifols’ continued commitment to innovating blood screening safety.” The Procleix ArboPlex Assay will be available in all markets accepting the CE mark certification after completion of any additional registration and notification requirements. About Procleix ArboPlex Assay®The Procleix ArboPlex Assay is a nucleic acid test (NAT) that uses magnetic-based target capture, Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA) and chemiluminescence to detect the presence of RNA sequences of four arboviruses (chikungunya virus, dengue virus RNA, West Nile virus RNA, and Zika virus) in plasma and serum from human donors. The high sensitivity and specificity of the Procleix technology enables pathogen detection to reduce the risk of transfusing infected blood or blood components, even when the donor does not exhibit symptoms. The assay runs on the widely adopted Procleix Panther System, an automated NAT instrument from Grifols. About Procleix Panther SystemThe Procleix Panther System automates all aspects of NAT-based blood screening on a single, integrated platform, and is capable of delivering the highest result throughput per square meter. It eliminates the need for batch processing and combines walk-away freedom with intuitive design for ease of use. For more information, please visit www.diagnostic.grifols.com.

Negative Delayed filing of annual financial statements may raise concerns among investors about financial transparency and operational efficiency. 04/03/2024 - 11:01 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Christina Lake Cannabis Corp. (""CLC"" or the ""Company"") (CSE: CLC) announced today that it will not be filing its annual financial statements, accompanying management's discussion and analysis and related chief executive officer (""CEO"") and chief financial officer (""CFO"") certifications for the financial year ended November 30, 2023 (collectively, the ""Annual Filings""), within the period prescribed for the filing of such documents under Parts 4, 5 and 6 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations and pursuant to National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings, namely within 120 days of year-end, being March 31, 2024 (the ""Filing Deadline""). The delay at CLC is due to the fact that the audit is taking longer than expected, due to the high level of testing, with limited staff resources. As the Company's material item on its balance sheet is inventory and biological assets, and due to the increased production levels of the past year and additional product lines introduced, the costing and inventory allocation is taking longer than originally anticipated. Further the financings completed by the Company in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and the property acquisition completed earlier in 2024, have also increased the work level required for the audit, which requires additional time to ensure accuracy for the financial statements. CLC is working closely with its auditor DMCL LLP, and is making every effort to submit the Annual Filings in a timely fashion and expects to file no later than May 31, 2024. CLC CEO Mark Aiken made the following statement. “We support the provision of extra time to allow auditors to satisfactorily complete the 2023 audit, and ensure that their financial statements are accurate in all respects.” The Company is providing this default announcement in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders (""NP 12-203""). The Company has made an application to the British Columbia Securities Commission, as principal regulator of the Company, a management cease trade order (""MCTO"") under NP 12-203 in respect of the default regarding the Annual Filings. The MCTO will prohibit the CEO and the CFO from trading in securities of CLC for so long as the Annual Filings are not filed. The issuance of the MCTO, if issued, does not affect the ability of persons other than the CEO and the CFO of the Company to trade in the Company's securities. The application for the MCTO remains subject to the risk factors described in ""Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors"" below, including the risk that the MCTO application may not be successful or may not be completed prior to a securities commission issuing a failure-to-file cease trade order against the Company following the Filing Deadline. The Company confirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines found at sections 9 and 10 of NP 12-203 respecting Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults for so long as it remains in default as a result of the late filing of the Annual Filings. During the period of default, the Company will issue biweekly default status reports in the form of further news releases, which will also be filed on SEDAR. The Company confirms that there are no insolvency proceedings against it as of the date of this news release. The Company also confirms that there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed as of the date of this news release. ABOUT CLC Christina Lake Cannabis is a licensed producer of cannabis under the Cannabis Act.

The company is optimistic about growth and profitability in 2024. Positive Full year 2023 Revenue of $55.3 million reported by BM Technologies, Inc. (BMTX). Transfer of Higher Education Deposits to First Carolina Bank resulted in a 20 Basis Points increase in Annualized Interchange Fees. CEO Luvleen Sidhu mentioned the expected $4.4 million increase in annualized interchange revenue due to the transfer. Profit Enhancement Plan led to a significant reduction in 2023 Core Operating Expenses by approximately $9.5 million. BM Technologies is well-positioned for growth and profitability in 2024, with further cost savings and revenue growth opportunities anticipated. Investments in technology upgrades aim to deepen customer relationships, increase customer lifetime value, and unlock new revenue streams. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue of $55.3 million for BM Technologies is a tangible metric for evaluating the company's performance. The strategic move to transfer Higher Education customer deposits to First Carolina Bank (FCB) and the resultant increase in annualized interchange fees by 20 basis points is noteworthy. This shift leverages the Durbin Amendment exemption, which allows smaller banks to charge higher interchange fees. The expected $4.4 million increase in interchange revenue, based on the $2.2 billion Higher Education debit card spend, is significant as it directly impacts the bottom line.Moreover, the implementation of the Profit Enhancement Plan (PEP) and the reduction of Core Operating Expenses by approximately $9.5 million suggest a focused effort on cost management. This, combined with the untapped potential in converting Higher Education disbursement services customers to active BankMobile Vibe checking accounts, indicates room for growth in customer base and revenue. The investment in technology upgrades is also a forward-looking move, potentially increasing customer lifetime value and revenue diversification. Market Research Analyst BM Technologies' positioning as a large digital banking platform and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider is important in the context of the fintech industry's growth. The company's focus on the Higher Education sector is strategic, considering the consistent demand for financial services in this demographic. The conversion rate of less than 1 in 5 for Higher Education disbursement services customers to active checking accounts represents a significant market opportunity. By capitalizing on this, BM Technologies can potentially increase market share and customer engagement.The company's technology platform upgrade is a proactive response to the competitive landscape of digital banking. As customer expectations evolve, BM Technologies' ability to offer enhanced digital experiences will likely be a key differentiator. Their approach to deepen customer relationships and unlock new revenue streams could resonate well with investors looking for companies with a clear growth trajectory in the fintech sector. Economist The financial results of BM Technologies offer insights into broader economic trends, particularly in the fintech and BaaS industries. The company's revenue growth and strategic initiatives to enhance profitability through cost reduction and revenue diversification reflect a healthy economic approach. The Durbin-exempt status obtained through the partnership with FCB is a tactical maneuver that capitalizes on regulatory frameworks to gain a competitive edge.In the long term, BM Technologies' investment in technology and potential market expansion strategies could contribute positively to the economy by fostering innovation and competition within the banking sector. The emphasis on customer lifetime value suggests an understanding of the importance of sustainable growth, which is essential for long-term economic stability. 04/03/2024 - 04:15 PM Full year 2023 Revenue $55.3 MillionTransfer of Higher Education Deposits to First Carolina Bank (""FCB"") in December Increased Annualized Interchange Fees by 20 Basis PointsRADNOR, PA / ACCESSWIRE / April 3, 2024 / BM Technologies, Inc.

For the twelve months ending December 31, 2023, Higher Education vertical spend totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Had a Durbin-exempt bank partnership been in place during the full year of 2023, the interchange revenue for the Higher Education vertical would have been approximately $4.0 million higher.Higher Education VerticalFor the full year 2023, the Company retained 99% of its Higher Education institutional clients and disbursed $11.4 billion in refunds to students. The Company signed 10 new colleges and universities in 2023, providing 112,000 additional students access to BankMobile Disbursements and the BankMobile Vibe checking account. This compares favorably to the 60,000 additional students added in 2022 under 11 signed agreements.During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company disbursed over $2.0 billion in refunds to students. Of the $2.0 billion, approximately 14%, or $282 million, was disbursed into BankMobile Vibe checking accounts. We continue to see higher education student enrollment numbers rebound, post pandemic, in the community college segment which is increasing application flow and customer acquisition opportunities.Higher Education average serviced deposits and ending serviced deposits totaled $479 million and $361 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. Debit card point of sale spend remained strong increasing by 5% during Q4 2023 as compared to Q4 2022 and holding flat for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year. Deposits and spend per 90-day active account during the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1,710 and $1,947, respectively. For the full year 2023, deposits and spend per 90-day active account were $1,785 and $8,341, respectively.BaaS VerticalAnnualized debit card spend for highly active BaaS users (those with both direct deposit and a minimum of five customer driven transactions per month) was $19,100, and the average deposit balance per account was $1,726 at December 31, 2023. This very attractive cohort makes up approximately 22% of active accounts at December 31, 2023, as compared to 20% in the year-ago period.BaaS average serviced deposits and ending serviced deposits totaled $326 million and $313 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and debit card point of sale spend during 2023 increased 7% from the prior year.Profit Enhancement Plan (PEP)The Company continues to actively execute upon its PEP, with initiatives completed during 2023 that reduced Core Operating Expenses1by approximately $9.5 million. We expect further cost savings from this initiative in 2024.Growth Initiatives and OutlookThe Company anticipates revenue growth in 2024 driven by investments in the Higher Education vertical and the full year effect of Durbin-exempt interchange rates on the majority of serviced deposit account holder's debit card spend. The Company also expects a return to positive Core EBITDA1 in 2024 based on these higher revenues and stricter cost controls implemented as part of the Company's PEP.Technology Initiatives and OutlookJamie Donahue, President and Chief Technology Officer stated, ""The Company is actively executing on its technology transformation plan to accelerate growth opportunities and enhance the competitive advantage that already exists in our unique position in the higher education market. We have rewritten and unified our platform infrastructure to seamlessly power both our student disbursement and BaaS experiences going forward. This investment in modernization will reduce operational costs and fraud risk, accelerate new feature integration velocity, and unlock new partnership opportunities.""Mr. Donahue continued, ""We believe that the roll out of additional product and service enhancements, along with closer relationships with college and university clients, will increase engagement and positively contribute to the success of our customer-for-life strategy.""Earnings WebcastThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday, April 3, 2024, at 5:00 pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

At WCN, the Company will present subgroup analyses of the Phase 3 PROTECT Study of FILSPARI® (sparsentan) in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) showing the treatment effect across participants with different levels of baseline proteinuria. Encore presentations will include preliminary findings from the SPARTAN Study supportive of FILSPARI as a first-line treatment for patients with IgAN, as well as the early clinical experience from the PROTECT open-label extension regarding the addition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) to ongoing FILSPARI treatment in patients with IgAN. At ANNA, the Company will present additional insights from the HONUS trial, including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data and the humanistic burden experienced by patients with IgAN and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). “The data we are presenting at WCN and ANNA reinforce the wealth of evidence supporting FILSPARI’s profile to become an effective foundational treatment replacing RAAS inhibition, with the potential to reduce the lifetime risk of kidney failure for patients with IgAN,” said Jula Inrig, M.D., chief medical officer of Travere Therapeutics. “We are also looking forward to presenting data that address broader aspects of disease management, building upon Travere’s holistic approach to improving patient outcomes in RKD.” WCN Late Breaking Abstract Sparsentan vs Irbesartan in Patients with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN): Subgroup Analyses of 2-Year Results from the Pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT TrialOral Presentation: MON-296Late Breaking Clinical Trial Session Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer; April 15, 2024, 3:35-3:45 p.m. ART WCN Poster Presentations Sparsentan as First-Line Treatment of Incident Patients with IgA Nephropathy: Preliminary Findings from the SPARTAN TrialPoster: SUN-042Poster Session: Clinical Glomerulonephritis 2Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer; April 14, 2024, 5:45-6:45 p.m. ART Concomitant Sparsentan and Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i) in Patients with IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) in the PROTECT Open-Label Extension (OLE)Poster: SUN-049Poster Session: Clinical Glomerulonephritis 2 Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer; April 14, 2024, 5:45-6:45 p.m. ART Sparsentan Receptor Occupancy Modeling, Clinical Actions, and Safety Poster: SUN-045Poster Session: Clinical Glomerulonephritis 2Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer; April 14, 2024, 5:45-6:45 p.m. ART Preliminary Findings from the Phase 2 EPPIK Study of Sparsentan in Pediatric Patients with Selected Proteinuric Glomerular DiseasesPoster: SUN-048Poster Session: Clinical Glomerulonephritis 2Exhibition Hall and Main Foyer; April 14, 2024, 5:45-6:45 p.m. ART ANNA Poster Presentations Sparsentan (SPAR), a Novel Non-immunosuppressive Therapy for Patients (pts) with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN): Pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Trial DataExhibit Hall; April 15, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. & 2:30-4 p.m.; April 16, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. ET Contextualizing the Humanistic Burdens of Focal Segmental Glomerular Sclerosis (FSGS) in HONUS Compared to External Controls in NHWSExhibit Hall; April 15, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. & 2:30-4 p.m.; April 16, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. ET Indirect Comparisons of Humanistic Burdens Between Patients with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) from HONUS and External Controls from NHWSExhibit Hall; April 15, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. & 2:30-4 p.m.; April 16, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. ET Data in Kidney Failure (KF) Estimated by Treatment Effects on Proteinuria in Patients with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN)Exhibit Hall; April 15, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. & 2:30-4 p.m.; April 16, 2024, 8:45-10:15 a.m. ET About IgA Nephropathy IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also called Berger's disease, is a rare progressive kidney disease characterized by the buildup of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a protein that helps the body fight infections, in the kidneys. The deposits of IgA cause a breakdown of the normal filtering mechanisms in the kidney, leading to blood in the urine (hematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria) and a progressive loss of kidney function. Other symptoms of IgAN may include swelling (edema) and high blood pressure. IgAN is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and a leading cause of kidney failure due to glomerular disease. IgAN is estimated to affect up to 150,000 people in the U.S. and is one of the most common glomerular diseases in Europe and Japan. About Travere Therapeutics At Travere Therapeutics, we are in rare for life. We are a biopharmaceutical company that comes together every day to help patients, families and caregivers of all backgrounds as they navigate life with a rare disease. On this path, we know the need for treatment options is urgent – that is why our global team works with the rare disease community to identify, develop and deliver life-changing therapies. In pursuit of this mission, we continuously seek to understand the diverse perspectives of rare patients and to courageously forge new paths to make a difference in their lives and provide hope – today and tomorrow. For more information, visit travere.com FILSPARI® (sparsentan) U.S. Indication FILSPARI is an endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated to reduce proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression, generally a UPCR ≥1.5 g/g. This indication is granted under accelerated approval based on reduction in proteinuria. It has not been established whether FILSPARI slows kidney function decline in patients with IgAN. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory clinical trial. FILSPARI® (sparsentan) Important Safety Information BOXED WARNING: HEPATOTOXICITY AND EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITYBecause of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, FILSPARI is available only through a restricted program called the FILSPARI REMS. Under the FILSPARI REMS, prescribers, patients and pharmacies must enroll in the program. HepatotoxicitySome Endothelin Receptor Antagonists (ERAs) have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. In clinical studies, elevations in aminotransferases (ALT or AST) of at least 3-times the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) have been observed in up to 2.5% of FILSPARI-treated patients, including cases confirmed with rechallenge. Measure transaminases and bilirubin before initiating treatment and monthly for the first 12 months, and then every 3 months during treatment. Interrupt treatment and closely monitor patients who develop aminotransferase elevations more than 3x ULN. FILSPARI should generally be avoided in patients with elevated aminotransferases (>3x ULN) at baseline because monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be more difficult and these patients may be at increased risk for serious hepatotoxicity. Embryo-Fetal ToxicityFILSPARI can cause major birth defects if used by pregnant patients based on animal data. Therefore, pregnancy testing is required before the initiation of treatment, during treatment and one month after discontinuation of treatment with FILSPARI. Patients who can become pregnant must use effective contraception before the initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with FILSPARI. Contraindications: FILSPARI is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. Do not coadminister FILSPARI with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), ERAs, or aliskiren. Warnings and Precautions Hepatotoxicity: Elevations in ALT or AST of at least 3-fold ULN have been observed. To reduce the risk of potential serious hepatotoxicity, measure serum aminotransferase levels and total bilirubin prior to initiation of treatment, monthly for the first 12 months, then every 3 months during treatment. Advise patients with symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching) to immediately stop treatment with FILSPARI and seek medical attention. If aminotransferase levels are abnormal at any time during treatment, interrupt FILSPARI and monitor as recommended. Consider re-initiation of FILSPARI only when hepatic enzyme levels and bilirubin return to pretreatment values and only in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Avoid initiation of FILSPARI in patients with elevated aminotransferases (>3x ULN) prior to drug initiation. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: FILSPARI can cause fetal harm. Advise patients who can become pregnant of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test and advise patients who can become pregnant to use effective contraception prior to, during, and one month after discontinuation of FILSPARI treatment. FILSPARI REMS: FILSPARI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the FILSPARI REMS. Important requirements include: Prescribers must be certified with the FILSPARI REMS by enrolling and completing training.All patients must enroll in the FILSPARI REMS prior to initiating treatment and comply with monitoring requirements.Pharmacies that dispense FILSPARI must be certified with the FILSPARI REMS and must dispense only to patients who are authorized to receive FILSPARI. Further information is available at www.filsparirems.com or 1-833-513-1325. Hypotension: There was a greater incidence of hypotension-associated adverse events, some serious, including dizziness, in patients treated with FILSPARI compared to irbesartan. In patients at risk for hypotension, consider eliminating or adjusting other antihypertensive medications and maintaining appropriate volume status. If hypotension develops, consider a dose reduction or dose interruption of FILSPARI. Acute Kidney Injury: Monitor kidney function periodically. Patients whose kidney function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute kidney injury on FILSPARI. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in kidney function while on FILSPARI. Hyperkalemia: Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately. Patients with advanced kidney disease, taking concomitant potassium-increasing drugs (e.g., potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics), or using potassium-containing salt substitutes are at increased risk for developing hyperkalemia. Dosage reduction or discontinuation of FILSPARI may be required. Fluid Retention: Fluid retention may occur with ERAs, and has been observed with FILSPARI. If clinically significant fluid retention develops, after evaluation, consider modifying the dose of FILSPARI. Most common adverse reactions (5%) with FILSPARI are peripheral edema, hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension), dizziness, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Drug interactions Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Inhibitors and ERAs: Do not coadminister FILSPARI with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), ERAs, or aliskiren.Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of FILSPARI with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor blood pressure, serum potassium, edema, and kidney function regularly when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer.Antacids and Acid Reducing Agents: Administer FILSPARI 2 hours before or after administration of antacids. Avoid concomitant use of acid reducing agents (histamine H2 receptor antagonist and PPI proton pump inhibitor) with FILSPARI.Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs), Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitors: Monitor for signs of worsening renal function.CYP2B6, 2C9, and 2C19 Substrates: Monitor for efficacy of the concurrently administered CYP2B6, 2C9, and 2C19 substrates and consider dosage adjustment in accordance with the Prescribing Information.P-gp and BCRP Substrates: Avoid concomitant use of sensitive substrates of P-gp and BCRP with FILSPARI.Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Monitor serum potassium frequently. Concomitant use of FILSPARI with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Use in specific populations Pregnancy / Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: FILSPARI can cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant patient and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancy Testing / Contraception: Verify the pregnancy status and effective method of contraception prior to, during, and one month after discontinuation of FILSPARI treatment. The patient should contact their physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. Lactation: Advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with FILSPARI.Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use of FILSPARI in patients with any hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A-C). Please see Full Prescribing Information for FILSPARI here.

The split will convert 8 current shares into 1 share, reducing outstanding shares to approximately 9.6 million. All warrants and equity awards will be adjusted proportionally. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The decision by Smith Micro Software, Inc. to implement a 1-for-8 reverse stock split is a strategic move often seen in the market. This action usually aims to boost the stock's price per share, often to meet the minimum bid price requirements for exchanges like Nasdaq. It's a signal that the company is taking necessary steps to maintain its listing, which can be interpreted as a commitment to corporate governance and investor relations. However, the reverse split does not change the fundamental value of the company; it merely adjusts the number of shares outstanding and the stock price. Investors should be aware that while the optics of a higher share price might seem positive, the underlying issues that led to the price decline may still persist. It's essential to examine the company's financial health, market position and growth prospects to determine if the reverse split is part of a broader turnaround strategy or a short-term fix. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares outstanding from approximately 76.8 million to 9.6 million, which could lead to increased volatility due to a lower float. While this might not directly affect the market capitalization, it can have implications for liquidity and the stock's marketability. Investors should monitor the stock's performance closely following the reverse split to gauge market reaction and liquidity implications. Furthermore, the proportional adjustment of warrants and equity awards is a necessary measure to preserve the incentives and value for stakeholders. These adjustments ensure that the economic terms of these instruments remain intact, which is important for maintaining shareholder confidence and retaining talent within the company. Legal Expert Legally, a reverse stock split is a permissible corporate action when approved by shareholders, as seen with Smith Micro Software, Inc. It is important to note that the company has taken steps to ensure that no fractional shares will be issued, offering rounding up to the nearest whole share instead. This is a shareholder-friendly practice that avoids the need to cash out fractional shares, which can sometimes result in nominal losses for the shareholders. The company's adherence to providing clear instructions for stockholders holding physical stock certificates through its transfer agent, Computershare, reflects a commitment to transparency and proper handling of the reverse split process. This is an important aspect as it minimizes confusion and potential legal challenges that could arise from mishandled corporate actions. 04/03/2024 - 04:15 PM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smith Micro Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMSI) (“Smith Micro” or the “Company”), announced today that the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-8 reverse split of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) (the “Reverse Split”). The Reverse Split was approved by the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting held on April 3, 2024. The Reverse Split will legally take effect at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on April 10, 2024. The Company’s Common Stock will open for trading under a new CUSIP number 832154405 on The Nasdaq Capital Market on April 11, 2024, on a split-adjusted basis under the current ticker symbol “SMSI.” The Reverse Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Company’s common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Reverse Split will automatically convert every eight current shares of the Company’s common stock, whether issued and outstanding or held by the Company as treasury stock, into one share of fully paid and nonassessable common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of the Company’s common stock following the Reverse Split will be entitled to rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split will reduce the aggregate number of shares of outstanding Common Stock from approximately 76,805,280 shares to approximately 9,600,660 shares (based on outstanding shares as of April 2, 2024). The total authorized number of shares will remain unchanged. The terms of all outstanding warrants currently exercisable for shares of Common Stock, and all equity awards granted under the Company’s equity plans, including the per share exercise price of options and the number of shares issuable under such options, will be proportionally adjusted to maintain their economic value, subject to adjustments for any fractional shares as described above. In addition, the total number of shares of common stock that may be the subject of future grants under the Company’s equity plans, as well as any plan limits on the size of such grants will be adjusted and proportionally decreased as a result of the Reverse Split. Stockholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-Reverse Split shares. Stockholders owning shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split, subject to brokers’ particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Split. For those stockholders holding physical stock certificates, the Company’s transfer agent, Computershare, will send instructions for exchanging those certificates for shares held electronically in book-entry form or for new certificates, in either case representing the post-Reverse Split number of shares, including the impact of any rounding to the nearest whole number of shares in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable.

Kinetik Executes New Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility,2024-04-03T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Kinetik Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KNTK) announced a $150 million accounts receivable securitization facility agreement with PNC Bank, extending the maturity of its Term Loan Credit Facility to December 2026.","Kinetik Executes New Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kinetik Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KNTK) announced a $150 million accounts receivable securitization facility agreement with PNC Bank, extending the maturity of its Term Loan Credit Facility to December 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The establishment of a $150 million accounts receivable securitization facility by a subsidiary of Kinetik Holdings Inc. represents a strategic financial maneuver to optimize the company's capital structure. By electing to use the proceeds to repay existing debt, specifically a portion of the Term Loan, Kinetik is effectively reducing its interest expense and improving its liquidity position. The interest rate tied to the one-month term SOFR plus 90 basis points indicates a competitive cost of capital, likely reflecting the company's creditworthiness and the current interest rate environment.From a financial perspective, this move could signal to investors Kinetik's proactive approach to debt management. By extending the maturity of the Term Loan to December 2026, the company is alleviating short-term liquidity pressure, which may enhance its financial flexibility and potentially improve its credit ratings. However, stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to manage the fluctuating borrowing base, which is contingent on the value of the company's accounts receivable balance. Credit Risk Analyst The introduction of the A/R Facility by Kinetik Holdings Inc. is indicative of the company's approach to leveraging its accounts receivable as a financial asset. This strategy can be advantageous in freeing up capital that is otherwise tied up in the business cycle. However, it introduces a dependency on the company's operational performance, specifically its ability to efficiently manage its receivables.As receivables serve as collateral, their valuation and the company's capacity to collect them in a timely manner will be important in maintaining the borrowing base. Investors should consider the credit quality of Kinetik's customers and the industry's economic outlook, as these factors could impact the company's future cash flows and, consequently, its ability to service its debt obligations. The facility's maturity in April 2025 with a renewal mechanism offers some cushion, but also necessitates ongoing scrutiny of the company's credit management practices. Debt Market Analyst Kinetik Holdings Inc.'s decision to secure an accounts receivable securitization facility is a notable event in the debt markets. It reflects a trend where companies are seeking alternative liquidity solutions beyond traditional loans or credit lines. This facility's structure, tied to the one-month term SOFR rate, reflects a shift in the lending market towards using SOFR as a benchmark following the phase-out of LIBOR.The relatively low spread of 90 basis points above the benchmark rate suggests that the debt market perceives Kinetik as a lower-risk borrower. However, investors should be aware that the SOFR rate is subject to changes based on Federal Reserve policies and economic conditions. Any significant fluctuations in interest rates could affect the cost of borrowing for Kinetik, which in turn could influence the company's net interest margins and overall profitability. 04/03/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON & MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kinetik Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KNTK) (“Kinetik” or the “Company”) today announced that one of its subsidiaries has entered into an agreement with PNC Bank, National Association for a $150 million accounts receivable securitization facility (“A/R Facility”) which matures April 2025 with an ongoing renewal mechanism. The initial borrowing base of $150 million will vary with the value of the Company's accounts receivable balance. Borrowings under the A/R Facility bear interest at the one-month term SOFR rate plus 90 basis points. Kinetik intends to use the net proceeds from the A/R Facility to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its existing Term Loan Credit Facility (“Term Loan”), lowering the remaining balance to $1.0 billion. As a result, the maturity of the Term Loan will extend to December 8, 2026. About Kinetik Holdings Inc.

The investment is expected to generate $884,000 of revenue in 2024. LTC aims to support its long-term partner, Ignite, by offering flexible financing options for growth. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst From a real estate investment perspective, the loan originated by LTC Properties Inc. to Ignite Medical Resorts for the acquisition of a healthcare property is a strategic move. The interest rate of 9.15% is notably higher than the current average for commercial real estate loans, reflecting a potentially higher risk associated with healthcare properties or a premium for the specialized nature of the asset. The inclusion of a capital expenditure investment signals LTC's commitment to maintaining and improving the property, which could enhance its value and appeal to residents.The revenue projection of approximately $884,000 in 2024 suggests that LTC is confident in the property's earning potential. Given that the property was built recently in 2017, it likely meets modern standards and expectations for skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. However, investors should consider the broader market trends in senior housing and healthcare real estate, including occupancy rates, the competitive landscape in the Houston metro area and the potential impact of regulatory changes on profitability. Healthcare Industry Analyst Examining the loan from a healthcare industry standpoint, the skilled nursing and assisted living sectors are experiencing demographic tailwinds due to an aging population. This trend is expected to drive demand for such facilities. Nevertheless, the success of this investment will hinge on Ignite Medical Resorts' operational efficiency and ability to provide high-quality care, which can influence occupancy rates and, consequently, the revenue generated for LTC.It is also important to consider the impact of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates on the property's financial performance, as these are significant sources of revenue for skilled nursing facilities. Any changes in healthcare policy that affect reimbursement rates could alter the projected revenue and returns on this investment. Investors should monitor Ignite's compliance with healthcare regulations and its reputation for patient care, as these factors can materially affect the asset's performance. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis angle, the structure of the deal as an unconsolidated joint venture implies that LTC may have limited control over the operations of the property, which could introduce additional risk. The interest-only nature of the loan for its five-year term provides cash flow predictability for LTC but pushes the principal repayment to the end of the term, a factor that should be weighed against the potential for property appreciation and the stability of the healthcare market.Investors should note the projected revenue in relation to LTC's overall portfolio size and income streams. While $884,000 is a significant figure, its impact on LTC's bottom line will depend on the company's total revenue and the performance of its other investments. Given the current economic climate, with concerns over inflation and potential interest rate hikes, the fixed interest rate of 9.15% could be advantageous if market rates rise, but it could also become a liability if rates fall significantly. 04/03/2024 - 04:15 PM -- Senior Loan to Assist Ignite Medical Resorts in Purchase of Houston Metro-area Property -- WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LTC Properties Inc. (NYSE: LTC) (“LTC” or the “Company”), a real estate investment trust that primarily invests in seniors housing and health care properties, today announced that it has originated a $12.7 million senior loan to Ignite Medical Resorts (“Ignite”), a current LTC operator, for the purchase of a skilled nursing and assisted living campus in Katy, Texas. The investment will be accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture. The five-year loan is interest only at a current rate of 9.15% and includes a CapEx investment of approximately $800,000 for campus improvements. LTC expects this investment to generate approximately $884,000 of revenue in 2024. The campus was built in 2017, and includes 78 units (48 skilled nursing and 30 assisted living) and 104 licensed beds (70 skilled nursing and 34 assisted living). “We are very pleased to assist our long-term partner, Ignite, with the purchase of this property, building on the strong relationship we have had with them since 2019. We look forward to continued growth with them,” said Wendy Simpson, LTC’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are focused on providing flexible financing, including through shorter-term vehicles, that provides growth capital for our operators, while also generating meaningful returns for LTC and our shareholders.” About LTC LTC is a real estate investment trust (REIT) investing in seniors housing and health care properties primarily through sale-leasebacks, mortgage financing, joint-ventures and structured finance solutions including preferred equity and mezzanine lending.

Early interim safety data was compared to Phase 1 data, with plans for updated data by May 31 and additional clinical data in Fall 2024. Positive Positive: MacroGenics provided an update on the Phase 2 TAMARACK study of vobramitamab duocarmazine in mCRPC patients. Positive: The company plans to share updated interim data, including safety and preliminary efficacy, by the end of May. Positive: Additional clinical data, including radiographic progression-free survival, is expected to be presented in Fall 2024. Positive: Preliminary safety data from TAMARACK suggests that reducing the dose and frequency of vobramitamab duocarmazine improves its safety and tolerability in men with mCRPC. Positive: The study continues as planned without modification based on the interim analysis results. Positive: The abstract authors were acknowledged for their contributions to the study. Negative: The abstract containing the early interim data was not accepted for presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting. Negative: Adverse events resulted in high rates of dose modifications and early treatment discontinuation in the Phase 1 study. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The update on the Phase 2 TAMARACK study for vobramitamab duocarmazine (vobra duo) represents a pivotal moment in the clinical development of new cancer therapies, particularly for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The shift from a 3.0 mg/kg dose in Phase 1 to lower doses in Phase 2 suggests a strategic response to manage adverse events while attempting to maintain efficacy. Notably, the interim safety data indicates a reduction in treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events when compared to the Phase 1 study, which could imply a more favorable risk-benefit profile for patients.From an investment perspective, the ability of MacroGenics to iterate and potentially improve the safety profile of their drug candidate could be a positive signal to investors. However, the true test lies in the balance between safety and efficacy. The preliminary data suggests improvement, but the market will be keenly awaiting the updated interim data, including safety and preliminary efficacy, due by the end of May. Moreover, the primary endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) data expected in the Fall of 2024 will be critical for determining the drug's future and, by extension, could significantly impact MacroGenics' stock performance. Oncology Doctor As an oncology specialist, the progression of vobra duo through clinical trials is of particular interest due to the unmet medical need in mCRPC. B7-H3, the target of vobra duo, is an immunomodulatory protein that can contribute to tumor evasion of the immune system. The use of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to deliver a cytotoxic payload directly to tumor cells while sparing normal tissue is a promising approach. The reduction in dose from the Phase 1 study addresses the high rates of dose modifications and early treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, which is a common challenge in oncology therapeutics.The early interim safety data from the Phase 2 TAMARACK study is encouraging, as it suggests that dose adjustments may have successfully mitigated some of the treatment-related toxicities. This could potentially lead to better patient adherence and outcomes. However, the oncology community will be looking for the balance between safety and efficacy, particularly the preliminary efficacy data that will be updated by the end of May. The long-term rPFS data will be instrumental in evaluating the true clinical benefit of vobra duo in this patient population. Market Research Analyst In the biopharmaceutical sector, the trajectory of a drug's clinical trial results can have profound implications for a company's market valuation. For MacroGenics, the TAMARACK study represents a significant investment in the development of vobra duo for the treatment of mCRPC. The market will be closely monitoring the upcoming interim data release, as it will provide a clearer picture of the drug's potential commercial viability.The decision by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) not to accept the abstract for presentation at their annual meeting may be seen as a setback, but the company's commitment to providing updated data by the end of May could mitigate any negative market reaction. Investors will be particularly interested in the rPFS data, as it is a strong indicator of a drug's effectiveness in delaying the progression of cancer. Should the data be favorable, it could lead to a surge in investor confidence and an uptick in MacroGenics' stock price. Conversely, any negative results or further safety concerns could lead to volatility or a decline in stock value. The long-term implications will largely depend on the comprehensive data set expected in the Fall of 2024, which will likely be a major catalyst for the company's stock. 04/03/2024 - 04:30 PM Early interim safety data from Phase 2 TAMARACK study, including comparison to retrospective analysis from Phase 1 study, as submitted in ASCO abstractCompany plans to provide updated interim data, including safety and preliminary efficacy, by May 31Company plans to provide additional clinical data – including rPFS – in the Fall of 2024 ROCKVILLE, MD, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MacroGenics, Inc.

Vobra duo targets B7-H3, which is highly expressed in multiple tumor types including prostate cancer and has limited expression in normal tissue.

Lowering the starting dose may improve tolerability, extend treatment duration, and enhance effectiveness. MethodsTAMARACK is an ongoing randomized, open-label, Phase 2 dose selection study assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two dose levels of vobra duo (2.0 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg IV Q4W). The study enrolled patients (pts) with mCRPC previously treated with abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide; prior docetaxel was allowed. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed PFS at 6 months. ResultsAt data cutoff (Jan 4, 2024), 182 pts with mCRPC enrolled on TAMARACK, of which 177 received vobra duo. Enrolled pts were 46 to 89 years of age (median 70.5) with ECOG performance status ≤ 2. Thirty (16.5%) had visceral disease at baseline, 109 (59.9%) had RECIST-evaluable disease, and 98 (53.8%) received prior docetaxel. At this early data cut, pts have received a median of 3 (range 1 to 7) cycles of vobra duo; treatment is ongoing in 156 (85.7%). A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is presented below. Vobra duo 2.0 mg/kg (n=91)Vobra duo 2.7 mg/kg (n=86)Any TEAE85 (93.4%)82 (95.3%)TEAE Grade ≥ 323 (25.3%)27 (31.4%)Serious AE11 (12.1%)17 (19.8%)Drug Interruption due to AE10 (11.0%)16 (18.6%)Drug Discontinuation due to AE4 (4.4%)2 (2.3%)Fatal AE00 The most common (≥10%) TEAEs regardless of dose were asthenia (40.7%), nausea (27.7%), fatigue (20.3%), decreased appetite (19.2%), anemia (17.5%), constipation (16.4%), diarrhea (14.7%), headache (13.0%), neutropenia (12.4%), and peripheral edema (10.7%). In the subset (n = 95) of TAMARACK pts on treatment for ≥ 12 weeks or who discontinued study treatment within 12 weeks, TEAEs led to drug interruption in 12 (12.6%) and discontinuation in 5 (5.3%) pts. This compares favorably to the rate of drug interruption (58.5%) and discontinuation (14.6%) observed at 12 weeks in pts with mCRPC who received vobra duo at 3.0 mg/kg Q3W on the Phase 1 study. Following the pre-specified interim analysis for futility on both arms, the IDMC recommended continuing the study as planned without modification. Conclusions Preliminary safety data from TAMARACK suggest that reducing the dose and frequency of vobra duo improves its safety and tolerability in men with mCRPC. The authors anticipate sharing preliminary efficacy data and updated safety data at the conference.

The Company will submit a proposal to effect the name change at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for May 28, 2024. Subject to shareholder approval, the Company expects to formally change its name to Onity Group Inc. and begin trading on the NYSE under the stock symbol “ONIT” in June 2024. “We are very excited about rebranding to Onity™ as it demonstrates our extensive transformation into a balanced and diversified mortgage company and the confidence we have in our business, our capabilities and our team,” said Glen A.

Our rebranding efforts represent the continued evolution of our Company.” Following a rigorous research and brand strategy development analysis, the Company selected Onity as its primary brand name (pronounced ON-it-ee). The Company believes its new name reflects the capabilities of a hard-working team with a can-do attitude and problem-solving culture. Within the name Onity is the phrase “on it,” which conveys action and the promise of dependability, performance and support. The new brand identity will include a fresh, modern and customer-centric look and a brand voice that supports the Company’s commitment to getting the job done. Messina continued, “Deeply embedded in our culture is the desire to consistently deliver on our commitments to achieve positive outcomes for all of our stakeholders, and this mindset is central to our mission, values and operating principles. We understand what our customers want and the important role we have in delivering on their needs. We believe our new brand genuinely represents how we operate and our focus on delivering results consistent with what our customers expect from us.” Ocwen’s primary brands, PHH Mortgage Corporation and Liberty Reverse Mortgage, will retain their names at this time. The Company expects to begin rebranding PHH Mortgage Corporation and Liberty Reverse Mortgage to Onity Mortgage later this year to align their names with the new name of the Company.

Volaris transported 2.3 million passengers in March.","Volaris Reports March 2024 Traffic Results: 87% Load Factor Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación (VLRS) reports March 2024 traffic results with a 15.8% ASM capacity decrease due to engine inspections. Despite this, load factor rose to 86.8%. Mexican domestic RPMs dropped by 24.2%, while international RPMs increased by 7.1%. Volaris transported 2.3 million passengers in March. Positive None. Negative None. Aviation Industry Analyst From the perspective of an aviation industry analyst, the preliminary traffic results of Volaris for March 2024 are indicative of strategic capacity management in response to external operational challenges. The reduction in ASM capacity is a significant move, typically indicating a forced scaling back of operations, often due to unforeseen circumstances such as the need for Pratt & Whitney engine inspections. It's essential to note that while a decrease in capacity can adversely affect revenue potential, the increase in load factor suggests Volaris has effectively optimized the available space on its flights. This is a positive sign of demand management and could mitigate some of the financial impacts of reduced capacity.The shift in focus towards international routes ahead of the peak summer season is a tactical decision that could be beneficial. By reallocating capacity to potentially more profitable international routes, Volaris may be aiming to capitalize on higher-yielding markets. However, the decreased domestic RPMs raise concerns about the domestic market's performance and the company's ability to maintain its market share within Mexico. Investors should monitor how this reallocation affects the company's revenue mix and whether it can sustain international growth without compromising its domestic base. Market Research Analyst Examining the data from a market research standpoint, the contrasting trends in domestic and international RPMs for Volaris are noteworthy. A 24.2% decrease in domestic RPMs coupled with a 7.1% increase in international RPMs could reflect changing consumer preferences or economic factors influencing travel patterns. The airline's ability to transport 2.3 million passengers despite a significant decrease in capacity showcases a resilient demand for air travel, which is a positive sign for the industry as a whole.Furthermore, the robust load factor indicates that Volaris is maintaining operational efficiency. A load factor of 86.8% is relatively high for the industry, suggesting that Volaris is succeeding in filling a large proportion of its seats despite fewer available seat miles. This could be a result of effective pricing strategies, schedule optimization, or a strong brand presence in its chosen markets. For stakeholders, this performance metric is a double-edged sword; while it indicates efficient use of assets, it may also signal that there is little room for growth without additional capacity, which could be a limiting factor in the future. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis angle, the preliminary traffic results of Volaris have several implications for both short-term and long-term financial performance. In the short term, the decrease in capacity due to engine inspections could lead to a temporary dip in revenue. However, the improved load factor and strategic capacity reallocation may help offset some of the revenue losses. The key will be to analyze the yield, or revenue per passenger mile, to truly understand the financial impact. If Volaris has managed to increase yield through higher fares or ancillary revenue, the financial effects of the decreased capacity might be lessened.In the long run, the company's ability to navigate operational challenges while maintaining a strong load factor is a positive indicator of management's ability to adapt to changing conditions. However, investors should remain cautious and seek further information on the costs associated with the engine inspections and any potential long-term impacts on fleet availability. Additionally, the shift in strategy towards the international market must be monitored to ensure that it does not come at the expense of domestic market share and profitability. 04/03/2024 - 09:13 PM MEXICO CITY, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V.

In March 2024, Volaris' ASM capacity decreased by 15.8% year-over-year due to the accelerated Pratt & Whitney engine inspections and the resulting aircraft groundings. However, load factor increased by 1.3 pp YoY to 86.8%, as RPMs decreased by less than capacity. Mexican domestic RPMs decreased by 24.2%, while international RPMs increased by 7.1%. Volaris transported 2.3 million passengers during the month. Enrique Beltranena, Volaris’ President and CEO, said: “In March, we decreased ASMs in the Mexican domestic market while reallocating capacity to the international market in preparation for the peak summer season.

(CSE: ACOG) (OTCQB: ACOGF) (“Alpha Cognition,” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies with the potential to transform the lives of people with debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended 2023 and provided a corporate update. “We recently achieved a significant milestone with the acceptance of our New Drug Application by the FDA in December with a product approval date in July of this year. Our team has worked in the last quarter to manage the regulatory process and engage with regulatory reviewers in a timely manner. We believe that ALPHA-1062 will offer a meaningful differentiated therapy for patients with Alzheimer’s dementia,” said Michael McFadden, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Recent Corporate Updates New Patent Filing The Company recently announced that it filed a new composition-of-matter patent that secures broad protection for its lead asset, ALPHA-1062, currently under review by the FDA for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s Disease. The present composition-of-matter patent application is filed for approval with the USPTO and may be extended to pursue protection throughout the world. If approved, the patent will secure composition-of-matter protection for an oral formulation of ALPHA-1062 into 2044, adding to other patent protection that currently protects ALPHA-1062 through 2042 in US and 2041 in other territories around the world. The filing was based on novel and unexpected findings in the clinical trial work the company completed and further demonstrates the uniqueness of ALPHA-1062. PPM Financing The Company announced in January 2024 that it had completed a final closing pursuant to its previously announced private placement of units of the Company. The gross proceeds of the private placement offerings received through closing were US$8.45 million, which included shares of the fully subscribed 30% overallotment. NDA Acceptance The Company announced in December 2023 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has completed its filing review and has accepted the Company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for ALPHA-1062, a proprietary, patented, delayed release oral tablet formulation in development for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s Disease. The NDA has been granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of July 27th, 2024. Commercial Strategy Upon FDA approval, the company plans to launch commercially in the Long Term Care (LTC) market segment. The LTC market covers more than 35% of the overall Alzheimer’s disease market representing a highly concentrated patient population with the lowest barriers to access. Alpha Cognition’s commercialization strategy includes our initial commercial launch in LTC, followed by expansion to the Neurology segment once payer reimbursement has been established. Pipeline The Company announced an additional product for Alzheimer’s disease, a sublingual formulation of ALPHA-1062 that will be utilized for patients with dysphagia or who have difficulties with oral formulations. A significant minority of Alzheimer’s patients could benefit from a non-oral formulation, representing a significant supplemental opportunity for the company. The new formulation has demonstrated active drug release in <30 seconds, 90% bioavailability, and a safe and well tolerated compound. Financial Highlights for Fourth Quarter and Full year ended December 31, 2023 (Expressed in United States Dollars) Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $5.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.4 million and $8.8 million in the same periods in 2022, respectively. R&D expenses decreased from the prior year primarily due to the completion during 2022 of the main clinical trials for ALPHA-1062; expenses in 2023 were focused on R&D for the ALPHA-1062 NDA filing related costs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses, excluding non-cash expenses relating to accretion, amortization, depreciation, and share-based compensation, were $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $3.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to from $0.8 million and $3.5 million in the same periods of 2022 respectively. The G&A expense increased full year ended December 31, 2023; expenses were lower primarily related to lower professional fees and financing costs, offset some by higher consulting fees. The overall G&A decrease year over year was due to the Company’s cost cutting efforts and focus on the advancement of its main asset, ALPHA-1062 in Alzheimer’s Disease. The Company recorded a loss on revaluation derivative liability for the three months ended December 31, 2023, of $3.6 million and $4.1 million for full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $0.2 million and $1.8 million in the same periods of 2022 respectively. On August 31, 2023, the Company’s functional currency changed to the USD from the CAD; as such, the Company recorded a derivative liability on the warrants outstanding with previously issued CAD exercise prices. This derivative liability is being revalued at each reporting period. On August 31, 2023, the Company charged $4,541,545 to equity to reclassify the derivative liability for warrants with exercise prices denominated in CAD using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The initial reclassification resulted in a decrease in share capital of $4,541,545. Furthermore, in December 2023, 11,777,336 warrants were re-priced from CAD to USD denominated exercise price which resulted in $4,025,102 of the derivative liability being reclassified to equity. The derivative liability at December 31, 2023, was $4.5 million which related to the outstanding warrants priced in CAD. Share-based compensation was $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $1.8 million for full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.2 million and $1.2 million in the same periods of 2022, respectively. The 2023 increases were primarily related to new stock option grants issued in 2023, the repricing of previously issued stock options during the first quarter of 2023, and related fluctuations in the Company’s stock price over the periods. The Company incurred foreign exchange gains of $13k during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and less than $10k for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of $0.9 million and $0.3 million in the same periods of 2022, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2023 comprehensive net loss was $5.8 million, or a net loss of $0.05 per share, and for the full year ended December 31, 2023, the comprehensive net loss was $13.8 million, or a net loss of $0.15 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 comprehensive net loss of $3.2 million, or a net loss of $0.05 per share, and for the full year ended December 31, 2022, comprehensive net loss of $12.1 million, or a net loss of $0.18 per share. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were $1.5 million, including $0.1 million in restricted cash. Effective April 1, 2024, the Company and NLS agreed to an amendment to the promissory note pursuant to which the interest rate was increased from 5.5% to 7% and the maturity date was extended from July 2024 to July 2025. Additionally, $300,000 is now due on December 31, 2024, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity. Shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2023 were 118,208,989. About Alpha Cognition Inc. Alpha Cognition Inc. is a pre-commercial, biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing treatments for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, for which there are limited or no treatment options. The Company is focused on the development of ALPHA-1062 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease following the recent New Drug Application (the “NDA”) submission and acceptance by FDA. ALPHA-1062, is a patented new innovative product being developed as a next generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, with expected minimal gastrointestinal side effects. ALPHA-1062’s active metabolite is differentiated from donepezil and rivastigmine in that it binds neuronal nicotinic receptors, most notably the alpha-7 subtype, which is known to have a positive effect on cognition. ALPHA-1062 is in development in combination with memantine to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, in development with sublingual formulation for patients suffering from dysphagia and is being out-licensed to study an intranasal formulation for cognitive impairment with mTBI (otherwise known as concussion).

The offering is made under an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. The final terms are subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Flora Growth Corp.'s decision to commence a public offering of Common Shares is a strategic move to bolster its working capital and support general corporate needs. This is indicative of the company's proactive approach to capital management, potentially providing it with the financial flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities or cushion against operational uncertainties.The granting of an over-allotment option to Aegis Capital Corp. is a standard practice known as a 'greenshoe' option, which can help stabilize the stock price post-offering by allowing the underwriter to manage excess demand. However, the market's reception of this offering will be critical, as it will reflect investor confidence in the company's growth prospects and current valuation.Investors should closely monitor the final terms of the offering, as these will provide insights into market demand and the company's perceived worth. The fact that the offering is made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement suggests preparedness and regulatory foresight, but the market's prevailing conditions at the time of pricing will ultimately dictate the success of this capital raise. Legal Expert The involvement of legal counsel from both Dorsey & Whitney LLP for Flora Growth Corp. and Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. for Aegis Capital Corp. underscores the complexity and regulatory compliance required in public securities offerings. The legal framework, including adherence to the SEC's regulations and ensuring the offering's legality across various jurisdictions, is paramount to the offering's success and the protection of investor interests.Prospective and current investors should be aware that the offering is subject to market conditions and legal stipulations, which means there is no guarantee of completion. The significance of the final prospectus supplement lies in its detailed disclosure of the offering's terms, risks and company's financial position, which are essential for making informed investment decisions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Flora Growth Corp.'s extensive distribution network and international presence suggest a robust business model with diverse revenue streams. The public offering's timing and reception can signal market sentiment not only towards the company but also towards the cannabis industry as a whole.One must consider the competitive landscape, regulatory shifts and consumer trends within the cannabis sector to fully assess the potential impact of this capital raise. While the offering could provide Flora Growth with the means to expand or innovate, it also dilutes current shareholders' stakes, which might be a concern for investors focused on ownership concentration and control. 04/03/2024 - 08:37 PM Fort Lauderdale, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - April 3, 2024) - Flora Growth Corp.

Announces a New Share Repurchase Program Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Murano Global Investments Plc. (MRNO) announces a new share repurchase program of up to US$2 million, aiming to enhance shareholder value and comply with SEC regulations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The authorization of a share repurchase program by Murano Global Investments Plc. indicates a strategic move to manage capital allocation and potentially enhance shareholder value. Repurchasing shares can be a signal to the market that the company believes its stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, earnings per share (EPS) may increase, which could lead to a higher stock price. However, the size of the buyback program, at US$2 million, relative to the company's market capitalization, is a critical factor in assessing the potential impact on the stock price.Investors should consider the company's current financial health, including its cash reserves and debt levels. A buyback could be seen as a positive use of excess cash, but if it leads to increased leverage, it may raise concerns about financial stability. Additionally, the timing of the buyback, in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b-5, is designed to prevent market manipulation and insider trading, ensuring that the repurchases are conducted fairly and transparently. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a share repurchase program by Murano Global Investments may be interpreted as a positive development, as it often reflects management's confidence in the company's prospects. However, the broader market conditions and investor sentiment towards the industry should also be considered. If the sector is facing headwinds, the repurchase program may not have the desired effect on the stock's performance.It's also important to analyze how similar buyback announcements have affected stock prices in this sector historically. If the market views such programs as routine for companies like Murano, the impact may be muted. Conversely, if repurchase programs are less common or if the announcement comes at a time of undervaluation, the market reaction could be more significant. Stakeholders should monitor the implementation of the program and any subsequent adjustments to gauge the ongoing commitment of the board to this initiative. 04/03/2024 - 05:18 PM LONDON, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Murano Global Investments Plc. (“Murano” or “Company”, Nasdaq: MRNO) announced today that its board of directors has authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to US$2 million of its ordinary shares until the end of the last business day of the third quarter in 2024, U.S. Eastern Time. The Company plans to adopt and implement this share repurchase program in accordance with applicable rules and requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company’s insider trading policies. The Company’s proposed repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The timing and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b-5 requirements. The Company’s board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size. About Murano Global Investments Plc.

He received an M.B.A. from the Carnegie Mellon University Tepper School of Business and M.S. and B.S. degrees in Biomedical Engineering from Northwestern University. About Sozinibercept Sozinibercept (OPT-302) is a soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) expressed as an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc-fusion protein. It binds and neutralizes the activity of VEGF-C and VEGF-D on their endogenous receptors, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Research indicates that targeted inhibition of VEGF-C and VEGF-D can prevent blood vessel growth and vascular leakage, which contribute to the pathophysiology of retinal diseases including wet AMD. Sozinibercept has received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of wet AMD. Positive results from the Phase 2b study of sozinibercept, administered in combination with standard of care, LUCENTIS® (ranibizumab), for the treatment of wet AMD, published in Ophthalmology, met the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically superior gain in visual acuity at 24 weeks, compared to ranibizumab alone. In addition, secondary outcomes were positive for the combination therapy with sozinibercept, including more participants with gains in vision of 10 or more letters and improved anatomy, with a reduction in swelling and vascular leakage, with a favorable safety profile. About Opthea Opthea (ASX/NASDAQ:OPT) is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies to address the unmet need in the treatment of highly prevalent and progressive retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Opthea’s lead product candidate, sozinibercept, is being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (COAST, NCT04757636, and ShORe, NCT04757610,) for use in combination with standard-of-care anti-VEGF-A monotherapies to improve overall efficacy and deliver superior vision gains compared to the standard-of-care anti-VEGF-A agents.

Inherent risks of Investment in Biotechnology Companies There are a number of inherent risks associated with the development of pharmaceutical products to a marketable stage. The lengthy clinical trial process is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug prior to commercialization and a significant proportion of drugs fail one or both of these criteria. Other risks include uncertainty of patent protection and proprietary rights, whether patent applications and issued patents will offer adequate protection to enable product development, the obtaining of necessary drug regulatory authority approvals and difficulties caused by the rapid advancements in technology. Companies such as Opthea are dependent on the success of their research and development projects and on the ability to attract funding to support these activities. Investment in research and development projects cannot be assessed on the same fundamentals as trading and manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, investment in companies specializing in drug development must be regarded as highly speculative. Opthea strongly recommends that professional investment advice be sought prior to such investments.

Enhanced Capital focuses on providing financing solutions to lower middle market borrowers. The IA 50 includes 155 firms selected from 343 applicants, highlighting the growing interest in impact investments. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The inclusion of Enhanced Capital Group LLC in the ImpactAssets 50 (IA 50) list reflects broader market trends towards impact investing, which prioritizes social and environmental considerations alongside financial returns. The growing interest, as evidenced by the record number of applicants, indicates a shift in investor preferences and a potential increase in capital flows towards firms that are perceived to be socially responsible. From a market perspective, this could signal a competitive edge for P10, Inc., potentially attracting investors who are looking to align their portfolios with their values.Furthermore, the focus on lower middle market borrowers by Enhanced Capital suggests a strategic niche that may benefit from less competition and potentially higher yields, albeit with a different risk profile compared to traditional lending. This could diversify P10's revenue streams and enhance its risk-adjusted returns. The long-term impact on the stock market will likely depend on the actual performance of these impact investments and their ability to deliver market-rate returns alongside the targeted social outcomes. Sustainable Investment Advisor Enhanced Capital's commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aligns with a growing segment of the investment community focused on sustainable and responsible investment strategies. The firm's investment in themes such as economic growth, underserved communities, underrepresented populations and environmental sustainability addresses several SDGs directly, which could resonate with institutional investors and funds dedicated to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria.This recognition might also serve as a third-party endorsement of Enhanced Capital's impact investment approach, potentially leading to increased trust and credibility among investors. It's important to note that while the IA 50 listing is a significant acknowledgement, the actual impact on business performance requires a deeper look into the firm's investment outcomes, the scalability of their impact strategies and the operational efficiencies they bring to P10, Inc. Financial Analyst The announcement of Enhanced Capital's inclusion in the IA 50 list is a positive development for P10, Inc., but it is essential to evaluate the financial implications of this news. Enhanced Capital's $3.7 billion investment in impact assets is a substantial figure and it is important to assess the quality of these assets, their return profiles and default rates, especially given the focus on sectors that traditional capital markets may deem riskier.Investors should consider the potential for Enhanced Capital to leverage this recognition to secure additional capital, expand its operations and improve its deal origination capabilities. However, the long-term success of P10's stock will hinge on Enhanced Capital's ability to maintain strong underwriting standards, manage risks effectively and ultimately provide competitive financial returns to its investors. 04/03/2024 - 05:57 PM DALLAS, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- P10, Inc.

Operating cash usage improves, aiming for cashflow and adjusted EBITDA positive for FY25. Non-GAAP earnings per share surpass expectations. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results by BlackBerry Limited indicate a notable year-over-year revenue growth, particularly within its IoT and Cybersecurity divisions. The IoT division's record revenue and substantial QNX royalty backlog represent a strategic pivot towards high-growth areas in automotive and IoT systems. The Cybersecurity division's stabilization and sequential growth in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) suggest a positive trend in customer retention and possibly an expansion in its service offerings.From a market perspective, the improvement in operating cash usage and the expectation to be cash flow and adjusted EBITDA positive in FY25 could signal a stronger financial position and operational efficiency, potentially increasing investor confidence. The non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding expectations might reflect operational resilience and a successful cost management strategy, which could be attractive to shareholders focused on profitability and earnings quality. Financial Analyst BlackBerry's strategic announcements, such as the launch of QNX Software Development Platform 8.0 and partnerships with Stellantis and AWS, underscore its commitment to innovation and collaboration within the software space. The appointment of Philip Brace to the Board of Directors could bring fresh insights and drive further growth in the IoT sector. However, the company's guidance for Q1 FY25 indicates a potential revenue contraction compared to the previous quarter, which may raise concerns about the sustainability of growth in the short term.The use of non-GAAP financial measures, while providing a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding certain expenses, requires careful consideration as it may not fully represent the company's financial health. Investors should monitor how these figures reconcile with GAAP measures to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial position. Legal Expert BlackBerry's inability to provide a reconciliation of expected Adjusted EBITDA and expected Non-GAAP basic EPS for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 to GAAP measures due to uncertainty in predicting restructuring and impairment charges is not uncommon in financial reporting. This lack of guidance may introduce an element of risk for investors, as it obscures the potential impact of these charges on the company's future financial results. Stakeholders should be aware of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding non-GAAP financial measures, ensuring that their investment decisions are informed by both the non-GAAP metrics presented and the potential implications of the excluded GAAP items. 04/03/2024 - 05:05 PM Delivers year-over-year revenue growth for both IoT and Cybersecurity divisionsIoT division reports record revenue quarter and QNX royalty backlog of $815 millionCybersecurity division stabilizes ARR, with sequential growth and DBNRR improvementSignificantly improves operating cash usage sequentially and expects to be cashflow and adjusted EBITDA positive for FY25Non-GAAP earnings per share beats expectationsWATERLOO, Ontario, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 (all figures in U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP, except where otherwise indicated). ""BlackBerry delivered a solid finish to the fiscal year, setting a number of new records in the process.

The Company does not provide a reconciliation of expected Adjusted EBITDA and expected Non-GAAP basic EPS for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 to the most directly comparable expected GAAP measures because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty, among other things, restructuring charges and impairment charges and, accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the tables at the end of this press release.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures with the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures In the Company's internal reports, management evaluates the performance of the Company's business on a non-GAAP basis by excluding the impact of certain items from the Company's U.S. GAAP financial results. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide management, as well as readers of the Company's financial statements, with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and are useful in helping management and readers understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. For purposes of comparability, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended and years ended February 28, 2023 have been updated to conform to the current year's presentation. Readers are cautioned that adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expense, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, adjusted amortization expense, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss) margin percentage, adjusted EBITDA margin percentage and free cash flow (usage) and similar measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Commencing with this fiscal quarter and consistent with the presentation of the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, the Company is presenting adjusted sales and marketing expense and adjusted general and administrative expense separately, whereas they were previously aggregated. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in the context of the U.S. GAAP results, which are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 and presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements contained therein.

Provides Update on 2023 Annual Filings Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kolibri Global Energy Inc. announces acceptance of its MCTO application by the BCSC due to filing delay. The Company aims to file its Annual Filings by May 31, 2024, and will issue updates accordingly. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acceptance of Kolibri Global Energy Inc.'s MCTO by the BCSC due to the delay in filing necessary annual documents suggests potential operational or internal control issues. Investors often view such delays as red flags, possibly indicating underlying problems that could affect the company's financial health. The delay in filing can lead to increased volatility in the company's stock as investors reassess the risk associated with the investment.While the company has until May 31, 2024, to comply, the interim period will likely be marked by investor caution. The requirement to issue bi-weekly default status reports will provide some transparency, but the lack of full disclosure until the Annual Filings are submitted may deter investment. In the long-term, the company's ability to restore investor confidence will hinge on the nature of the contents of the Annual Filings and any potential revelations of financial discrepancies or operational weaknesses. Legal Expert An MCTO is a regulatory instrument that reflects the authorities' response to a company's inability to meet its filing requirements on time. It restricts certain company insiders from trading the company's securities until the required documents are filed. This measure is less severe than a full cease trade order, which would halt all trading of the company's securities and indicates that the regulatory body has not yet found the company's situation to be irredeemable.Compliance with NP 12-203's alternative information guidelines is important to maintain some degree of market trust. However, the legal implications of not meeting the new deadline could include more severe sanctions, which might affect the company's ability to raise capital or engage in certain business activities. Investors should be aware of these potential legal repercussions and their impact on the company's future operations. Market Research Analyst The issuance of an MCTO often leads to a perception of increased risk among investors, which can impact the company's market position relative to its competitors. In a sector where timely and transparent disclosure is key to investor confidence, Kolibri Global Energy Inc.'s delay may lead to a competitive disadvantage. Stakeholders may shift their focus to competitors who demonstrate stronger governance and reliability in meeting regulatory requirements.It's also important to monitor the industry's response to this news. If competitors capitalize on this by reinforcing their own adherence to regulatory standards, it could lead to a shift in market shares. The company's recovery post-filing will depend on the industry landscape, the response of competitors and the broader market's reception of the delayed financials. 04/03/2024 - 09:30 PM THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kolibri Global Energy Inc.

The size of the Board will be reduced back to nine directors, effective as of Mr. Deeter’s retirement. “On behalf of the Twilio Board, I’d like to thank Byron for his invaluable contributions over the past fourteen years,” said Khozema Shipchandler, CEO of Twilio. “Byron was one of Twilio’s first investors, and our Board and shareholders have greatly benefited from his financial expertise and his extensive knowledge of the SaaS and cloud technology industry. He helped guide the company from our earliest stages of growth to become the leading customer engagement platform. We are extremely grateful to Byron for his dedication to Twilio.” The company also announced that it will be seeking shareholder approval at the upcoming Annual Meeting for the declassification of the Board. If shareholder approval is obtained, directors elected at the 2025 Annual Meeting and thereafter will be elected to one-year terms. “The Twilio Board is committed to upholding strong corporate governance practices,” said Jeff Epstein, Chair of the Twilio Board. “The decision to seek shareholder approval to declassify the Board is one that we’ve been considering for some time and is reflective of the meaningful engagement we’ve had with our investors. This change builds on the sunsetting of the company’s dual class share structure last year, and the separation of the Chair and CEO roles earlier this year. Our Board will continue to act in the best interests of Twilio and all shareholders.” ""Working with Jeff, Khozema, and the entire Twilio team and Board has been an absolute thrill,” said Byron Deeter. “After fourteen wonderful years I look forward to focusing my time on finding the next great software and AI companies on behalf of my partners at Bessemer Venture Partners, and my upcoming Chairmanship at the National Venture Capital Association. I will remain a close friend and enthusiastic supporter of Twilio as they continue to lead in this revolution in communications and AI ahead.” Additional information about these changes can be found in a Form 8-K that the company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

MDJM Launches Cultural Business to Promote Integration Between Global East and West,2024-04-04T01:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"MDJM  (Nasdaq: MDJH) launches a new business to promote cultural exchanges between East and West, focusing on renovating Fernie Castle to create a unique art platform. The project aims to deepen understanding between cultures, revive traditional skills, and boost local economic development.","MDJM Launches Cultural Business to Promote Integration Between Global East and West Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary MDJM (Nasdaq: MDJH) launches a new business to promote cultural exchanges between East and West, focusing on renovating Fernie Castle to create a unique art platform. The project aims to deepen understanding between cultures, revive traditional skills, and boost local economic development. Positive None. Negative None. Cultural Economist The initiative by MDJM to blend Eastern and Western cultures through the renovation of the Fernie Castle and the creation of an oriental garden represents a strategic investment in cultural capital. This endeavor is likely to stimulate local economies by attracting tourism and promoting cultural awareness. The project's emphasis on job creation and economic development is particularly notable as it aligns with broader economic objectives such as diversification and sustainable growth.While the direct financial impact on MDJM's bottom line may not be immediately clear, the long-term benefits could be substantial. The creation of a unique art platform and the potential for in-depth cooperation with international celebrities could position MDJM as a pioneer in cultural exchange, potentially leading to increased brand value and shareholder interest. Moreover, the project's potential to become a research hub for classical oriental gardens and architecture could open up additional revenue streams through educational and training programs.However, the success of such a project will largely depend on its execution and the company's ability to effectively market the concept to a global audience. The cultural sector can be unpredictable and investments in this area often carry a higher risk compared to more traditional business ventures. Nonetheless, if MDJM manages to capture the public's imagination, this could lead to significant economic and social returns for the local community and the company. Tourism and Hospitality Expert The fusion of Eastern and Western cultural elements in a single landmark, such as the proposed oriental garden within the Fernie Castle estate, is an innovative approach to tourism that could redefine the local and international appeal of the region. This project has the potential to become a destination for cultural tourism, a niche yet growing segment of the global travel industry.For the hospitality sector, the implications are significant. The establishment of high-end service facilities alongside the cultural platform could lead to increased demand for luxury accommodations, dining and other services catering to affluent tourists. The project's focus on art and cultural exchanges could also attract a diverse demographic, ranging from art enthusiasts to academics, thereby broadening the scope of visitors beyond traditional tourism.It's important to consider the operational challenges that may arise, such as the need for specialized staff and the maintenance of high standards in both the cultural and hospitality offerings. Additionally, the project's success will hinge on effective partnerships with local businesses and international cultural institutions. If managed well, the economic ripple effect could extend far beyond the immediate locale, benefiting the wider regional economy. Art and Cultural Heritage Consultant The MDJM project prioritizes the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage, which is commendable from a historical and educational perspective. The restoration of Fernie Castle and the integration of an oriental garden are not just architectural endeavors but also acts of cultural conservation. By facilitating the exchange of traditional cultural skills and art forms, MDJM is contributing to the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.The project's potential to serve as an art platform for salons, forums and exhibitions could also play a pivotal role in fostering dialogue and understanding between cultures. This is particularly relevant in an era where globalization is often criticized for diluting cultural identities. The emphasis on digital exhibitions and online dialogue salons expands the reach of the project, enabling global participation and enhancing cultural inclusivity.However, the challenge lies in maintaining authenticity and respecting the nuances of both Eastern and Western traditions. The project must navigate the fine line between cultural appreciation and appropriation, ensuring that all cultural elements are represented with sensitivity and accuracy. If successful, the project could set a precedent for similar cross-cultural initiatives and become a model for cultural exchange and education. 04/03/2024 - 09:00 PM The project, which officially marks MDJM's entry into the cultural and economic sphere, aims to promote in-depth cultural exchanges and understanding between Eastern and Western cultures, protect and pass on traditional skills, and create job opportunities that will enhance local economic development. LETHAM, Scotland, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MDJM LTD (Nasdaq: MDJH) (the ""Company"" or ""MDJM""), an integrated global culture-driven asset management company, has announced the launch of a new business that aims to promote cultural exchanges between the global East and West. By employing distinctively innovative approaches, the Company is set to free people from the drudgery of their mechanical daily lives, thereby awakening their vitality and sensitivity to global cultures. It unveils plans to revive medieval aristocratic life aesthetics and restore its recently acquired Fernie Castle property to its previous glory with renovation plans that include a castle extension, interior and ancillary building renovation, including the overall landscaped garden of the manor, the manor entrance gate, and surrounding roads, among others. The large-scale upgrade plan, complete with an oriental-style garden, aims to create a unique art platform that will deepen understanding between Eastern and Western cultures, promote the passing-on of traditional cultural skills, and bring significant social and economic benefits to the local community. The project has passed preliminary review by Fife Council and is entering the detailed planning stage for approval. They have expressed their pleasure and high expectations for the future of the project, thanks in large part to the creation of numerous jobs that will have a positive effect on the development of the local tourism industry. MDJM's project focuses on cultural and artistic operations and is positioned as a carrier of unique high-end service facilities that will greatly enhance the cultural appeal of the entire region and high-end service brands. The Company's main strategic objective is to select buildings with high historical and cultural value around the world, and to blend traditional local and traditional Eastern cultures with high-quality cultural and artistic content as the cornerstone of its operations. To enhance the project's cultural and commercial value, MDJM is currently gathering a professional consulting team. This team will include oriental historians, landscape architects, architects, and experts in art and aesthetics from around the world. Their wisdom and insights are poised to transform the oriental garden into a prominent research hub for classical oriental gardens and architecture, leveraging their expertise to shape the project's future success. The fusion of an oriental style garden with a centuries-old castle is a unique combination almost unheard of on a global scale and one that will almost certainly attract the attention of people from all walks of life. The platform's unprecedented integration of Eastern and Western classical arts and culture with its accessibility to people in the United Kingdom, Europe, and even tourists from as far as Asia, will create massive commercial value by sparking the imaginations of people who have never seen or heard of a spectacle similar to this in the traditional cultural tourism space. Within five years, MDJM aims to increase in-depth cooperation between top influential celebrities from many fields such as literature, music and drama, visual arts, sculpture art, traditional craftsmen, among others from around the world to launch a range of products with unique aesthetic value. Exhibitions, forums, cultural and artistic commodity trading, customized cultural tourism, education and training, and more, will also be launched. The planned oriental garden, with an overall area of approximately 10,000 square meters, will feature objects commonly sought after by the Eastern and Western nobility of the time. Fernie Castle and its oriental garden will be utilized as an art platform for salon forum exchanges, exhibitions, auctions and other activities while digital exhibitions of artworks, dialogue salons, and other exchanges will be held online simultaneously. The art platform will accelerate exchanges between Eastern and Western artists and introduce the ancient cultural heritage of the East to the United Kingdom and Europe while respecting the protection of local culture. Siping Xu, CEO of MDJM, commented, ""Our innovative business and the renovation plan for Fernie Castle not only marks a significant cross-cultural event, but also heralds a new peak in cultural exchanges and the passing-on of traditional arts between East and West. It will strongly promote global cultural diversity and inclusiveness and create new paths for the protection and dissemination of world cultural heritage while creating job opportunities and enhancing local economic development."" This project is poised to emerge as a singular landmark in cultural exchange, embodying an unprecedented approach in the UK and across Europe. It aims to recapture the refined elegance of a vanished Oriental era through an innovative concept in garden creation. This visionary effort fills a void in Western perspectives on oriental garden design, moving beyond mere replication to evoke the essence of historical authenticity and sophistication. About MDJM LTD Founded in 2002, MDJM is an integrated global culture-driven asset management company that, through its subsidiaries, is undergoing business transformation and globalization transitioning, especially in the development of real estate-related hospitality, butler services and more.

Nasdaq Hearings Panel Grants Mitek’s Request for Continued Listing Pending Compliance with Filing Requirement,2024-04-03T22:10:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Mitek Systems, Inc. (MITK) received a decision from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granting continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to filing the Q1 Form 10-Q by April 15, 2024, to comply with the Listing Rule. The company faced delisting due to not filing the Form 10-K on time.","Nasdaq Hearings Panel Grants Mitek’s Request for Continued Listing Pending Compliance with Filing Requirement Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Mitek Systems, Inc. (MITK) received a decision from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granting continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to filing the Q1 Form 10-Q by April 15, 2024, to comply with the Listing Rule. The company faced delisting due to not filing the Form 10-K on time. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst Mitek Systems, Inc.'s recent encounter with potential delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market underscores the importance of adherence to regulatory requirements for listed companies. The firm's ability to maintain its listing, contingent on meeting the Nasdaq's conditions, primarily the timely filing of its overdue financial reports, is critical for investor confidence. The market often reacts negatively to delisting news, as it can affect a stock's liquidity and visibility, potentially leading to a decrease in share price. However, Mitek's proactive measures to address the filing issues and the Panel's decision to allow continued listing may mitigate some of the negative market sentiment. Investors should monitor the company's adherence to the new deadline closely, as it will be indicative of Mitek's commitment to regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. Financial Reporting Specialist The Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) is a regulatory framework designed to ensure transparency and accountability by requiring the timely filing of financial reports. Mitek Systems, Inc.'s delay in filing its Form 10-K and subsequent Q1 Form 10-Q has put the company at risk of non-compliance. For stakeholders, the ability of a company to file reports promptly is not just a matter of regulatory compliance, but also a reflection of the company's internal financial controls and management's efficacy. The Panel's conditional approval for continued listing provides a short-term relief for the company, but it also places significant pressure on Mitek to enhance its financial reporting processes. Failure to meet the new deadline could result in severe consequences, including potential delisting, which would likely have a detrimental effect on the company's market value and shareholder trust. Compliance Officer Compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) is essential for maintaining the integrity of the capital markets. Mitek Systems, Inc.'s situation highlights the repercussions of non-compliance, which can extend beyond immediate financial implications to include reputational damage. The Panel's decision to allow Mitek a grace period to rectify its filing deficiencies is an opportunity for the company to demonstrate its commitment to compliance and governance standards. From a compliance perspective, it is imperative that Mitek not only meets the imposed deadline but also takes corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. This may involve reviewing and strengthening internal controls and governance practices to reassure stakeholders that the company prioritizes compliance and is taking steps to uphold the standards expected by the Nasdaq and its investors. 04/03/2024 - 06:10 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mitek Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: MITK, www.miteksystems.com, “Mitek” or the “Company”), a global leader in digital identity and digital fraud prevention, today reported that on April 1, 2024, the Company received a decision from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) granting the Company’s request for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to the Company filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (“Q1 Form 10-Q”), on or before April 15, 2024, which will bring the Company into compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”), and certain other conditions. As previously disclosed, the Company received a delisting determination (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the Staff initiated a process to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq as a result of the Company not being in compliance with the Listing Rule, which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), due to the Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). The Company subsequently did not timely file the Q1 Form 10-Q because the Q1 Form 10-Q could not be prepared until the Form 10-K was filed. The Company attended the previously announced and scheduled March 19, 2024 hearing before the Panel and requested the continued listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market pending its return to compliance with the Listing Rule. The Company filed its Form 10-K on March 19, 2024, and intends to file the Q1 Form 10-Q as promptly as possible in order to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet this deadline or ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing.

Positive Positive: Cboe Global Markets reported trading volume statistics for March 2024, showing increases in index options and Canadian equities trading volumes. Positive: The company achieved a record-setting block trade in Cboe iBoxx iShares $ High Yield Corporate Bond Index Futures, representing $75 million. Positive: Cboe Japan achieved a new monthly lit market share record of 5.3% in March 2024. Positive: The PR provided guidance on RPC/net capture metrics for the first quarter of 2024, giving insights into projected revenues.

Negative: Cboe Clear Europe Cleared Trades saw a significant decrease of 27.4% in March 2024 compared to the previous year.

Negative: The projected RPC/net capture metrics for the first quarter of 2024 are preliminary and subject to change, with no assurance of final results matching the projections. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported trading volume statistics and revenue per contract/net revenue capture guidance from Cboe Global Markets offer valuable insights into the exchange's performance and the broader financial market's health. A Market Research Analyst would highlight that the decrease in multiply-listed options and futures contracts suggests a potential cooling in derivatives trading activity. However, the increase in index options trading volume year-over-year indicates a growing interest in this segment, potentially reflecting investors' appetite for risk management tools amid market volatility.Moreover, the mixed performance in global equities trading volumes—with Japanese equities showing strong growth and European equities experiencing a decline—may indicate regional economic trends and investor sentiment shifts. The analyst would also note the record-setting block trade in IBHY Futures as a sign of institutional engagement and the new record in Japanese equities market share as a testament to Cboe Japan's growing presence in the region. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the Financial Analyst would focus on the revenue capture and RPC guidance provided by Cboe. The slight variations in RPC for different products reflect changes in transaction mix, volume-based discounts and fee rate adjustments. For instance, the increase in RPC for index options compared to multiply-listed options could indicate a more profitable mix or better pricing power in the index options market. The analyst would consider the impact of these figures on Cboe's revenue and margins, as well as on investor costs.Additionally, the analyst would assess the implications of the off-exchange equities' net capture trends, which might influence the strategic decisions of market participants regarding where to execute trades. The analyst would also evaluate the long-term sustainability of these revenue trends, considering competitive pressures and potential regulatory changes affecting market structure and fees. Economist An Economist would interpret the data within the context of the broader economy, noting that trading volumes can serve as an economic indicator. The significant increase in Japanese equities volume, for example, could be seen as a sign of economic optimism or increased foreign investment in Japan. Conversely, the decline in European equities volume might reflect economic headwinds in the region or investor caution.The economist would also consider the implications of the overall decrease in trading volumes on liquidity and market efficiency. They might analyze the potential economic consequences of shifts in trading activity, such as the impact on capital allocation, market stability and the cost of capital for companies. Furthermore, the economist would likely explore the relationship between Cboe's performance and global economic trends, including interest rates, currency fluctuations and international trade dynamics. 04/03/2024 - 04:30 PM CHICAGO, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc.

(ACOR) faces delisting from Nasdaq following Chapter 11 proceedings and asset acquisition agreement with Merz Therapeutics. The company's common stock will be suspended from trading on April 12, 2024, with a shift to the Pink Open Market expected. Delisting stems from noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules due to the Chapter 11 filing and insufficient stockholders' equity. Positive None. Negative Delisting from Nasdaq due to noncompliance with listing rules and Chapter 11 filing Shift to Pink Open Market may impact stock liquidity and investor confidence Acorda's financial stability questioned with stockholders' equity below $10 million Financial Analyst The suspension of trading and subsequent delisting of Acorda Therapeutics from the Nasdaq represents a significant shift in the company's financial landscape. The move to the Pink Open Market is typically associated with a higher risk profile due to less stringent regulatory requirements and lower liquidity. Investors may perceive this as a negative signal, potentially leading to a decline in stock value. Moreover, the Chapter 11 filing indicates a restructuring process aimed at addressing financial distress, which can result in various outcomes including asset sales, debt reorganization, or in some cases, liquidation.For stakeholders, the short-term implications are likely to include increased volatility and uncertainty. In the long-term, the success of the restructuring efforts will be key. If Acorda manages to streamline operations and reduce debt effectively, there could be a path to recovery. However, if the restructuring fails to address the underlying issues, the company may face further financial deterioration. Legal Expert The commencement of Chapter 11 proceedings is a legal mechanism that allows companies like Acorda to reorganize while being protected from creditors. This process is complex and can impact the company's operations and financial agreements. The violation of Nasdaq Listing Rules due to the Chapter 11 filing and the lack of compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement is a critical legal development. It's important for investors to closely monitor the proceedings for potential changes in creditor priorities, debt covenants and any legal outcomes that could influence the company's future. Market Research Analyst Acorda's shift from Nasdaq to the Pink Open Market may alter its investor base, as some institutional investors have policies against holding stocks outside major exchanges. This transition could also affect the company's visibility and analyst coverage, potentially leading to less market awareness and investor interest. Additionally, the stigma associated with bankruptcy proceedings and delisting can impact brand reputation and stakeholder confidence. It is essential to evaluate how these factors might influence the company's ability to attract investment and partnerships in the future. 04/03/2024 - 05:30 PM PEARL RIVER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACOR) announced that Nasdaq Stock Market (""Nasdaq"") today notified the Company that it will suspend trading in and delist the Company's common stock, effective with the opening of business on April 12, 2024. The notice follows the Company's April 1, 2024 announcement that it has reached an agreement with Merz Therapeutics to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Company. In connection with that announcement, Acorda and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions to commence Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Nasdaq commenced proceedings to delist the Company’s common stock, based on the Company’s noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b), and IM-5101-1 as a result of the Company’s commencement of Chapter 11 proceedings and also because the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A), which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $10 million. Once the delisting takes effect, Acorda expects its common stock to begin trading on the Pink Open Market (commonly referred to as the “pink sheets”).

(Nasdaq: PALI) announces a 1-for-15 reverse stock split to increase per share trading price and comply with Nasdaq listing requirements. The split will be effective on April 5, 2024, with trading under the symbol 'PALI' and new CUSIP number 696389402. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company like Palisade Bio implements a 1-for-15 reverse stock split, it's often a strategic move to boost the stock's market price and comply with exchange listing standards. In this case, the aim is to meet Nasdaq's minimum share price requirement. This maneuver can have mixed implications. On the one hand, it may stave off delisting, which can erode investor confidence and liquidity. On the other, it can be perceived as a sign of distress, potentially signaling underlying financial or operational weaknesses.Investors should note that the reverse split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization but does reduce the number of shares outstanding. The adjustment of warrants and equity awards ensures that the value of these instruments remains consistent post-split. However, the issuance of cash in lieu of fractional shares could lead to minor dilution. It's essential for stockholders to monitor the stock's performance post-split to gauge market sentiment and reassess the investment's long-term viability. Market Research Analyst Reverse stock splits can influence investor perception and the company's stock market narrative. For Palisade Bio, operating in the biopharmaceutical sector which is highly sensitive to regulatory compliance and investor confidence, maintaining Nasdaq listing is important for continued access to capital markets. The split could potentially attract institutional investors who might have previously been deterred by a lower stock price.However, it's important to analyze the broader industry context. If peers are not resorting to similar measures, it could suggest that Palisade Bio's move is out of step with market norms. Moreover, the company's focus on autoimmune, inflammatory and fibrotic diseases places it in a competitive and research-intensive field. Investors should consider how the reverse split fits into Palisade Bio's overall strategy and whether it aligns with the company's pipeline progress and market positioning. 04/03/2024 - 05:30 PM Carlsbad, CA, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Palisade Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: PALI), (“Palisade”, “Palisade Bio” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and advancing novel therapeutics for patients living with autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases, today announced a 1-for-15 reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.01 (“Common Stock”), effective at 5:00 PM ET on Friday April 5, 2024. Beginning on Monday, April 8, 2024, the Company’s Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) on a split adjusted basis under the trading symbol “PALI,” but will trade under the following new CUSIP number starting April 8, 2024: 696389402. The reverse stock split was approved by Palisade Bio’s stockholders at the virtual special meeting of stockholders held on March 25, 2024. The reverse stock split is primarily intended to increase the Company’s per share trading price and bring the Company into compliance with the Nasdaq’s listing requirement regarding minimum share price. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 15 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the effective date will be automatically combined into one share of Common Stock. Outstanding warrants, equity-based awards and other outstanding equity rights will be proportionately adjusted by dividing the shares of Common Stock underlying the securities by 15 and multiplying the exercise/conversion price, as the case may be, by 15. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares. The par value of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.01 per share after the reverse split. The reverse split affects all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s equity, except to the extent that the reverse split results in some stockholders owning a fractional share as described above. Additional information concerning the reverse stock split can be found in Palisade Bio’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 6, 2024. About Palisade Bio Palisade Bio is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and advancing novel therapeutics for patients living with autoimmune, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases. The Company believes that by using a targeted approach with its novel therapeutics it will transform the treatment landscape. For more information, please go to www.palisadebio.com.

About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders: • Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC™): Our lead cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure. The BRTX-100 production process utilizes proprietary technology and involves collecting a patient’s bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, BRTX-100 is to be injected by a physician into the patient’s damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease. • Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing a cell-based therapy candidate to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in animals may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

Nexa Resources Prices Offering of US$600 Million 6.750% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2034,2024-04-03T22:30:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Nexa Resources S.A. announces the pricing of US$600 million 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2034 to fund a cash tender offer for existing notes due 2027 and 2028. The offering is aimed at qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, closing on April 9, 2024.","Nexa Resources Prices Offering of US$600 Million 6.750% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2034 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nexa Resources S.A. announces the pricing of US$600 million 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2034 to fund a cash tender offer for existing notes due 2027 and 2028. The offering is aimed at qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, closing on April 9, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Nexa Resources of a $600 million senior unsecured notes offering with a 6.750% interest rate, maturing in 2034, is a strategic financial move with implications for the company's capital structure and debt management. The utilization of proceeds to fund a cash tender offer for existing notes due in 2027 and 2028 indicates an active approach to liability management. By refinancing older debt with higher interest rates or nearing maturity, Nexa Resources could potentially reduce interest expenses and extend its debt maturity profile, which can be favorable for its credit standing.However, the interest rate of 6.750% should be compared to the current market rates for similar debt instruments. If the rate is significantly higher, it may reflect a risk premium associated with Nexa's creditworthiness. Investors should assess the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics post-issuance to understand the impact on financial health. Additionally, the 'senior unsecured' nature of the notes suggests they rank above other unsecured debt in case of liquidation, but without collateral backing, which could influence the recovery rate for investors in default scenarios. Legal Expert The offer's structure, limited to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, highlights compliance with the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. This targeted approach allows Nexa Resources to bypass the more extensive registration requirements and reach a specific investor base more quickly. However, the limited pool of investors may affect the liquidity of the notes in the secondary market. Moreover, the lack of registration with the SEC means less public disclosure, which could impact the level of information available to investors for making informed decisions.It is also important for investors to understand that the notes, being senior and unsecured, carry certain risks. In the event of a default, while they have priority over other unsecured debt, there is no collateral to cushion the blow. This press release also serves as a legal disclaimer, making it clear that the securities cannot be sold in jurisdictions where they are not registered unless exemptions apply, which is a standard practice to avoid legal complications with securities laws. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the demand for high-yield corporate bonds, such as the ones issued by Nexa Resources, is influenced by the overall economic climate and investor risk appetite. The offering's timing and the interest rate offered can be indicative of market conditions. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, a 6.750% yield might attract investors seeking better returns than what is available from government or investment-grade corporate bonds.The guarantee by Nexa Resources' subsidiaries adds a layer of assurance, potentially making the notes more attractive to investors who are familiar with the company's operations and financials. However, the broader market sentiment towards the mining sector, influenced by commodity prices, regulatory changes and economic cycles, will also play a critical role in the offering's success and the subsequent performance of the notes in the secondary market. 04/03/2024 - 06:30 PM LUXEMBOURG / ACCESSWIRE / April 3, 2024 / Nexa Resources S.A.

Financial Analyst Simulations Plus, Inc.'s recent financial report demonstrates a robust growth trajectory, with a 16% increase in total revenue and an 11% increase in software revenue. The company's ability to maintain a high gross margin of 72% is particularly impressive, indicating strong pricing power and cost management. The 27% increase in services revenue suggests a successful expansion in areas like Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) and Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics (PBPK), which are increasingly important in the pharmaceutical industry.From a valuation perspective, the company's guidance for a 35-39% increase in diluted EPS is a positive signal for investors, reflecting confidence in the company's profitability. However, the net income's slight decrease compared to the previous year warrants attention to ensure it is not indicative of a trend. The dividend declaration further reinforces the company's financial stability and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The pharmaceutical sector is highly reliant on innovative technologies like those provided by Simulations Plus. The company's focus on modeling and simulation software is critical for drug development and their sustained growth in this area is indicative of the increasing importance of such tools. The addition of a new AI biotech customer and the adoption of their ADMET Predictor® platform suggest a strong competitive position in the market.Furthermore, the company's strategic initiative to invest in early-stage technology companies could be a catalyst for future growth. By positioning itself at the forefront of innovation, Simulations Plus may benefit from early access to cutting-edge technologies, potentially driving long-term growth. However, this strategy also introduces risks associated with early-stage investments, which typically have higher failure rates. Market Research Analyst The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader biotech funding environment, which has shown signs of improvement since the beginning of 2024. This is likely contributing to the increased demand for Simulations Plus's services. The company's guidance suggests a cautious yet optimistic outlook, likely factoring in the volatile nature of pharmaceutical funding.The focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) efforts is also a strategic move, as investors increasingly value corporate responsibility. By aligning its operations with these principles, Simulations Plus may enhance its corporate image and appeal to a broader investor base, which could have positive implications for stock performance. 04/03/2024 - 04:34 PM Total revenue of $18.3 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.20 Maintains full-year revenue guidance of $66 to $69 million (+10-15%) and EPS guidance of $0.66 to $0.68 LANCASTER, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Simulations Plus, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLP) (“Simulations Plus”), a leading provider of modeling and simulation software and services for pharmaceutical safety and efficacy, today reported financial results for its second quarter fiscal 2024, ended February 29, 2024. Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (compared to second quarter 2023) Total revenue increased 16% to $18.3 million Software revenue increased 11% to $11.6 million, representing 63% of total revenue Services revenue increased 27% to $6.7 million, representing 37% of total revenue Gross profit increased to $13.2 million; gross margin was 72% Adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 million, representing 39% of total revenue Net income of $4.0 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.20 versus net income of $4.2 million and diluted EPS of $0.20 Six Months 2024 Financial Highlights (compared to six months 2023) Total revenue increased 18% to $32.8 million Software revenue increased 16% to $19.2 million Services revenue increased 22% to $13.6 million Gross profit increased 3% to $23.1 million; gross margin was 70% Adjusted EBITDA of $10.5 million, representing 32% of total revenue Net income of $6.0 million and diluted EPS of $0.29 versus net income of $5.4 million and diluted EPS of $0.26 Management Commentary “Our second quarter results reflected strong performance in both our software and services segments,” said Shawn O’Connor, Chief Executive Officer of Simulations Plus. “Total revenue increased 16%, driven by higher software revenues in our Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics (CPP) business unit and the Cheminformatics business unit, whose ADMET Predictor® platform continued to gain adoption and added another new Artificial Intelligence (AI) biotech customer in the second quarter. Services revenue growth was primarily driven by higher revenues in our Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) and Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics (PBPK) business units. “Since the beginning of calendar 2024, we have seen encouraging signs in biotech funding with notable strength from biotech companies that have candidates undergoing clinical trials. Regarding large pharmaceutical companies, funding continues to vary depending on their near-term direction and business outlook, but the overall market is healthier compared to a year ago. For the balance of 2024, we remain cautiously optimistic that demand for our comprehensive suite of modeling and simulation software products and services will continue to gain momentum as the funding environment improves. “During the quarter, we also launched our corporate development initiative to intensify our focus on strategic investments and partnerships in early-state technology companies. While strategic acquisitions to complement organic growth remain a priority, we believe there are hidden gems among early-stage companies developing high-potential technologies. We believe that our ability to identify and evaluate commercial applications for emerging technologies will complement our own R&D efforts and position Simulations Plus at the forefront of innovation. “Our strong performance in the first half of the year, combined with market improvement, puts us on track to achieve our guidance for fiscal 2024. We entered the third quarter with a healthy pipeline and a solid balance sheet, and we are confident that Simulations Plus is firmly positioned to advance its critical role in drug development workflow. Our unwavering focus remains on delivering disciplined growth and achieving long-term returns for our shareholders.” Fiscal 2024 Guidance Fiscal 2024 Guidance Annual Increase Revenue $66M - $69M 10 - 15% Software mix 55 - 60% — Services mix 40 - 45% — Diluted earnings per share $0.66 - $0.68 35 - 39% Quarterly Dividend The Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 6, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 29, 2024.

Non-GAAP Definitions Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, (gain) loss on currency exchange, any acquisition- or financial-transaction-related expenses, and any asset impairment charges. Currency exchange excluded represents the exchange rate fluctuations on the foreign currency denominated transactions. The impact of transactions in foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The Company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA represents a measure that we believe is customarily used by investors and analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in addition to the GAAP measures that we present. Our management also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our core operating results. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to nonrecurring, unusual items. Adjusted Diluted EPS Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated based on net income excluding the impact of any acquisition- or financial-transaction-related expenses, any asset impairment charges, and tax provisions / benefits related to the previous items. The Company excludes the above items because they are outside of the Company’s normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of the Company’s core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.

Announces the Signing, Closing and Funding of Amended and Restated Definitive Purchase Agreements for $150 Million in a Private Placement of Common and Preferred Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Blue Ridge Bankshares, Inc. has closed a $150 million Private Placement to reposition business lines, support organic growth, and enhance capital levels. The capital will be used for strategic initiatives and to comply with regulatory requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The capital infusion of $150 million into Blue Ridge Bankshares is a significant financial maneuver that can have substantial implications for the company's strategic positioning and financial stability. From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds to enhance capital levels is a proactive step towards satisfying regulatory requirements, notably the capital ratios mandated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This move is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it suggests a commitment to maintaining a robust balance sheet.Moreover, the decision to reposition business lines indicates an adaptive strategy, potentially aiming to optimize the bank's operations in response to market demands or regulatory changes. Supporting organic growth is an indicator of a long-term investment in the bank's core capabilities, which may lead to increased revenue and market share over time. However, investors should monitor the effectiveness of these strategic initiatives in contributing to the bank's performance, as well as the potential dilution of existing shares due to the issuance of new stock. Market Research Analyst Blue Ridge's strategic initiatives, as funded by this capital raise, reflect an intent to strengthen its position within the community banking sector. The repositioning of business lines could be an effort to capture niche markets or to diversify services to reduce risk. For stakeholders, the success of these initiatives is contingent upon the bank's ability to identify and effectively serve emerging customer needs, which could differentiate it from competitors.It's important to note that the private placement supersedes a previous transaction, indicating a pivot in fundraising strategy. This could suggest that Blue Ridge is actively managing its capital structure to navigate unforeseen challenges, such as the shareholder inquiry mentioned. Stakeholders should consider the implications of such inquiries on governance and investor relations, as they may influence market perception and confidence in the bank's management. Banking Industry Analyst The banking industry is heavily regulated and Blue Ridge's actions demonstrate an awareness of the importance of compliance with regulatory standards. Enhancing capital levels not only satisfies regulatory requirements but also serves as a buffer against potential financial downturns. This is particularly relevant in the context of community banks, where capital adequacy is critical to maintain trust and local market presence.Stakeholders should be aware that while the capital raise may address the immediate needs outlined by the Consent Order, it is also indicative of previous regulatory concerns. The ability of Blue Ridge to effectively navigate these concerns and improve its regulatory standing will be a key factor in its long-term success and could impact investor sentiment. Continuous monitoring of the bank's regulatory compliance and the performance of its repositioned business lines will be essential for assessing future financial health and stability. 04/03/2024 - 04:30 PM Capital expected to allow the bank to reposition business lines, support organic growth and further enhance capital levels of the core community bank CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blue Ridge Bankshares, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Blue Ridge"") (NYSE American: BRBS), the holding company of Blue Ridge Bank, National Association (""Blue Ridge Bank"") and BRB Financial Group, Inc. (""BRB Financial Group""), has closed on definitive securities purchase agreements for gross proceeds of $150 ,000,000 in a private placement of Blue Ridge's common and preferred stock (the ""Private Placement""). This Private Placement supersedes and replaces the $150 million purchase, offering and sale of Blue Ridge common stock that was announced on December 22, 2023 (the ""Previous Transaction""), for which all closing conditions were not satisfied. Blue Ridge intends to use the capital to propel its near-term strategic initiatives, which include repositioning business lines, supporting organic growth, and further enhancing the core community bank's capital levels, including complying with the capital ratios set forth in the previously disclosed Consent Order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to Blue Ridge Bank. ""Although we believe we had nearly satisfied the appropriate closing conditions of the Previous Transaction, we received a shareholder inquiry that has raised questions about how votes were tabulated by an outside party on the articles amendment proposal at the shareholders meeting that made it difficult to move forward in a timely fashion, so we felt the best path was to adjust the offering structure,"" said President and CEO, G. William ""Billy"" Beale. ""We appreciate the commitment of the investors from the Previous Transaction to Blue Ridge as this continues to represent a significant step for our Virginia-based community bank to build a stronger platform for growth and shareholder value."" The Private Placement Pursuant to the securities purchase agreements, the Company has issued 3.4 million new common shares at a price of $2.50 per share, 14,150 shares of convertible Series B or Series C preferred stock, and 7,383 warrants to purchase convertible Series B or Series C preferred stock of Blue Ridge. Each share of convertible Series B and Series C preferred stock represents the equivalent of 4,000 shares of Blue Ridge common stock. Upon receipt of requisite shareholder approvals for both the (i) issuance of common shares in the Private Placement in excess of 20% of the Company's outstanding common shares, including upon conversion of the preferred stock, and (ii) increase in authorized common shares from 50,000,000 to 150,000,000, all shares of the Series B preferred stock will convert into common shares and the Series B preferred stock warrants will convert into warrants to acquire common shares. Assuming the conversion of all shares of Series B preferred stock into common shares and accounting for the common-equivalent value of the Series C preferred stock, the Company would have issued 60 million shares of common and common equivalent shares at a $2.50 price and would have approximately 29.5 million common stock warrants outstanding with a strike price of $2.50. The transaction terms represent the same infusion of common equity capital as contemplated by the Previous Transaction. The Private Placement was led by Kenneth R. Lehman, a private investor, with many years of experience investing in banks, with participation from Castle Creek Capital Partners VIII L.P. (""Castle Creek""), other new and existing institutional investors, and certain Blue Ridge directors and officers. With the closing of the Private Placement, Blue Ridge expects to add up to three new investor-appointed representatives to the Board of Directors of Blue Ridge and Blue Ridge Bank, subject to regulatory approval, with the total Blue Ridge Board downsizing to 13 members at the conclusion of Blue Ridge's 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Advisors on the Offering Piper Sandler & Co. acted as sole placement agent for the Private Placement. Williams Mullen served as legal counsel to the Company and Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders, LLP served as legal counsel to the placement agent. Fenimore Kay Harrison LLP served as legal counsel to Mr. Lehman and Sidley Austin LLP served as legal counsel to Castle Creek.

Negative None. 04/03/2024 - 05:03 PM NEW YORK, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK) (“Genco” or the “Company”), the largest U.S. headquartered drybulk shipowner focused on the global transportation of commodities, today announced that it has filed its preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with its upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In its preliminary proxy statement, the Genco Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote for the re-election of the seven nominees currently serving on the Board – James G. Dolphin, Paramita Das, Kathleen C. Haines, Basil G. Mavroleon, Karin Y. Orsel, Arthur L. Regan and John C. Wobensmith – at the 2024 Annual Meeting. With the re-election of all seven directors, Genco’s Board will comprise seven highly qualified individuals, all of whom bring a well-balanced skillset and significant experience in areas relevant to our business, including shipping, fleet management, commercial and technical management, as well as capital allocation management, financial reporting and M&A. In regards to the Board’s recommendation, Genco issued the following statement: The Genco Board and management team are committed to maintaining strong corporate governance while creating long-term value for all shareholders. Our focus on enhancing our industry-leading governance practices is showcased by the recent addition of Paramita Das, a respected global business leader with vast experience in commodities markets, to Genco’s Board. Furthermore, due to prudent and well-executed initiatives overseen by our Board in recent years, Genco is attractively positioned to advance its differentiated approach to capital allocation to drive value through drybulk shipping market cycles. We remain focused on delivering on the three pillars of our Comprehensive Value Strategy, including continuing to pay compelling quarterly dividends, reducing the Company’s financial risks through deleveraging and maximizing the Company’s ability to pursue accretive growth opportunities. As previously disclosed, George Economou, through his entity GK Investor, LLC, has nominated two directors for election to the Board. He also submitted a proposal to repeal certain provisions of, or amendments to, Genco’s By-Laws adopted after March 28, 2023. Genco has not adopted any By-Laws provisions or amendments after March 28, 2023 and currently has no intentions to do so. Following engagement with Mr. Economou and a thorough evaluation of his nominees, the Board unanimously rejected the proposed nominations and determined that including them would neither be additive to our already strong, focused and experienced Board nor in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. In its preliminary proxy materials, the Board also recommends that shareholders vote against Mr. Economou’s proposal because it could repeal a future amendment that the Board determines to be in Genco’s and its shareholders’ best interests, which may be in response to future events not yet known. Genco’s preliminary proxy materials can be found here as well as on the Company’s website at https://www.gencoshipping.com/. The Company’s definitive proxy materials will be mailed to all shareholders eligible to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting.

The Genco Board recommends that shareholders discard any proxy materials from GK Investor and vote using the WHITE proxy card they will receive as part of the definitive proxy materials that will be delivered by the Company.

(ALTI) completes the acquisition of East End Advisors, adding $5.6 billion in assets under management. The company now manages over $70 billion in combined assets, catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of AlTi Global's acquisition of East End Advisors represents a strategic move to enhance their offerings in the ultra-high-net-worth segment. This acquisition is significant as it not only increases AlTi's assets under management by approximately $5.6 billion but also potentially expands its client base and service capabilities. From a financial perspective, the key factors to assess include the acquisition cost, how it was financed and its expected impact on AlTi's earnings per share (EPS).Moreover, the integration of East End Advisors should be closely monitored. Effective integration can lead to cost synergies and increased revenue potential through cross-selling opportunities. However, any integration challenges could lead to unforeseen costs or disruptions in service. The market often reacts favorably to acquisitions that are expected to be accretive to earnings and provide strategic advantages, yet it remains critical to evaluate how this acquisition aligns with AlTi's long-term growth strategy and whether it enhances shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The wealth management industry is highly competitive, with firms continuously seeking to differentiate themselves through specialized services and expanded offerings. AlTi's acquisition of East End Advisors could be seen as a move to strengthen its position in the market, particularly within the niche of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families. Understanding the demographics and unique needs of this client segment is essential.Analyzing the competitive landscape, the acquisition might provide AlTi with a competitive edge in attracting and retaining clients who require bespoke investment solutions. However, it's also important to consider the potential risks, such as market saturation and the pressure to maintain high service standards. The success of this acquisition will largely depend on AlTi's ability to leverage East End Advisors' expertise and reputation to enhance its overall service offering and client satisfaction. Economist The consolidation within the wealth management sector often reflects underlying economic trends. For example, the growing concentration of wealth among the ultra-high-net-worth population can drive demand for specialized financial services. This acquisition may indicate AlTi's anticipation of continued growth in this demographic and a strategic decision to allocate resources accordingly.Additionally, from an economic standpoint, the scale achieved through this acquisition could lead to operational efficiencies and a stronger bargaining position when negotiating with service providers. It's important to consider the broader economic implications, such as how this acquisition might influence market competition and the distribution of wealth management services across different client segments. 04/03/2024 - 05:28 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AlTi Global, Inc.

KWESST Micro Systems Inc.

The company plans to use the proceeds for working capital and business objectives.","KWESST Micro Systems Inc. Announces Proposed United States Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary KWESST Micro Systems Inc. announces a public offering to sell common shares or pre-funded warrants, with ThinkEquity as the book-running manager. The company plans to use the proceeds for working capital and business objectives. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of KWESST Micro Systems Inc.'s intention to conduct a public offering in the United States is a strategic move that could have a significant impact on the company's financial health and stock performance. The decision to offer common shares or pre-funded warrants provides the company with a mechanism to raise capital, which is essential for funding working capital requirements and advancing business objectives.From a financial standpoint, the offering's success will hinge on market conditions, investor sentiment and the perceived value of KWESST's business model and growth potential. The grant of a 45-day option for the underwriter to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments is a common practice that can stabilize the stock price post-offering but may lead to dilution of existing shareholders' equity if exercised.Investors will be closely monitoring the size and terms of the offering, as these details will directly affect the company's market capitalization and the stock's future price movements. The use of a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 indicates that KWESST has planned this offering in advance, allowing for a more expedited process. However, the market's reaction will ultimately determine the offering's attractiveness and its impact on the company's capital structure. Market Research Analyst The timing and market conditions are critical factors for KWESST's public offering. The defense sector, where KWESST operates, is subject to both cyclical and geopolitical influences that can affect investor appetite. The company's choice of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager suggests confidence in their ability to manage the offering and potentially attract institutional investors.Analysing the broader market trends, investors may compare this offering to similar events in the industry, looking for patterns in terms of the success rate and post-offering performance. It's also important to note the potential impact on KWESST's stock liquidity, as a successful offering could increase the public float, enhancing trading volume but also possibly leading to greater stock price volatility.The strategic use of the proceeds for working capital and corporate purposes suggests an investment in the company's operational capabilities, which could be a positive sign for long-term growth. However, the lack of specificity in the use of proceeds might raise questions among investors seeking a more detailed roadmap for the company's future investments. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering's compliance with SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of a shelf registration statement on Form F-3, is essential for the legitimacy and smooth execution of the public offering. The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are key documents that will provide investors with the necessary information to make an informed decision.It is important for potential investors to review the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, along with the company's other SEC filings, to understand the risks and opportunities associated with the offering. Any discrepancies or omissions in these documents could lead to legal complications and impact investor confidence.The legal framework governing public offerings includes provisions for investor protection, such as the requirement for full disclosure. The effectiveness of the registration statement and the role of ThinkEquity as the book-runner are indicative of a structured approach to the offering, which may provide a level of reassurance to potential investors about the company's regulatory compliance. 04/03/2024 - 05:31 PM Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 3, 2024) - KWESST Micro Systems Inc.

Riley Permian Announces Commencement of Public Offering of Common Stock,2024-04-03T21:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Riley Exploration Permian, Inc.

(REPX) has initiated a public offering of 2,100,000 shares of common stock, with 700,000 shares from the company and 1,400,000 shares from certain stockholders. The underwriters may have an option to purchase an additional 315,000 shares. The proceeds will be used for various corporate purposes, including acquisitions and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The decision by Riley Exploration Permian, Inc. to initiate a public offering of 2.1 million shares is a strategic move that could potentially influence the company's liquidity and capital structure. The offering includes shares from both the company itself and certain stockholders, which indicates a mixed motive for capital raising and individual shareholder exit strategies. The market's response to this offering will be telling, as it will reflect investor confidence in Riley Permian's growth prospects, especially considering the planned use of proceeds for a significant acquisition.From a market perspective, the timing of the offering and the market conditions at the time will be critical in determining the success of the offering. Investors will likely scrutinize the terms of the pending acquisition in Eddy County, New Mexico and evaluate whether the investment aligns with the company's strategic objectives and the potential for return on investment. The fact that the company has a revolving credit facility option for funding indicates a level of financial flexibility, which is generally viewed positively by the market. Financial Analyst Looking at the financial implications of this offering, it is important to note that the company will not benefit from the proceeds of the shares sold by the selling stockholders. This means that the net proceeds for the company will be limited to the shares they are directly offering. The cost-bearing aspect for the company, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, could be significant, depending on the total expenses associated with the offering.Investors will be paying close attention to the pricing of the offering, as it will impact the earnings per share (EPS) and potentially dilute the ownership for current shareholders. The additional option for underwriters to purchase up to an additional 315,000 shares adds another layer of potential dilution but also provides a buffer for the company in case of over-subscription, which could be a sign of strong investor interest. Energy Sector Analyst The acquisition targeted by Riley Permian represents a significant expansion of their operational footprint, particularly in the Permian Basin, one of the most prolific oil-producing regions in the United States. This move could signal the company's confidence in the long-term viability of the oil and gas sector despite the global push towards renewable energy sources. The acquisition's 100% cash consideration suggests a strong capital allocation strategy and a potentially aggressive growth stance.Investors will also evaluate the impact of this acquisition on the company's debt profile and its ability to service that debt, especially since part of the acquisition may be funded through borrowings. The company's ability to manage its capital expenditures and operational efficiencies post-acquisition will be important in maintaining profitability and shareholder value. 04/03/2024 - 05:01 PM OKLAHOMA CITY, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Riley Exploration Permian, Inc.

The hospital will provide comprehensive therapies and advanced technologies to aid in recovery, aiming to enhance patients' quality of life and independence. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Industry Analyst The announcement of Encompass Health Corp.'s plan to build a new inpatient rehabilitation hospital in San Antonio represents a strategic expansion within the healthcare industry. The addition of a 50-bed facility is a moderate scale development that aligns with the company's growth trajectory, particularly in the Texas market where it already has a significant presence. This move indicates a calculated effort to capture more market share in the rehabilitation sector.By focusing on specialized care for patients with serious conditions such as strokes and spinal cord injuries, Encompass Health is tapping into a niche yet essential healthcare segment. The demand for such services is relatively inelastic, as these conditions require specialized and intensive rehabilitation programs. The investment in advanced rehabilitation technologies and a comprehensive suite of services may enhance the hospital's competitive edge and patient outcomes, potentially leading to a stronger reputation and higher patient throughput in the long term.For investors, the capital expenditure for the new hospital could be substantial, but given the company's existing footprint, economies of scale might be realized in construction and operation. The project's success will likely hinge on efficient execution and the ability to attract top-tier medical personnel, which could impact the company's operational costs and profitability margins. Financial Analyst The expansion of Encompass Health's operations into San Antonio with a new rehabilitation hospital is a financial move that merits attention. As a publicly traded company, Encompass Health's investments are closely watched for their potential to affect earnings and stock performance. With this development, the company is likely to incur initial capital outlays and operating costs before realizing revenue from the new facility.From a financial perspective, the key factors to monitor will be the project's timeline, cost efficiency and the speed at which the new hospital reaches occupancy targets. The ability to integrate the new hospital into the existing network efficiently can also provide cost synergies and support margins. Additionally, the hospital's location in Westover Hills, an area possibly underserved by inpatient rehabilitation services, could lead to a rapid ramp-up in patient admissions, positively impacting the company's top-line growth.Long-term investors will likely assess the potential return on investment, considering the growing demand for specialized rehabilitation services and the aging population. However, short-term impacts on the stock might reflect the market's assessment of the project's risks versus its growth potential. 04/03/2024 - 04:30 PM BIRMINGHAM, Ala., April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Encompass Health Corp. (NYSE: EHC) today announced preliminary plans to build a freestanding, 50-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in San Antonio. The hospital, located in Westover Hills, will serve patients recovering from debilitating illnesses and injuries, including strokes and other neurological disorders, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, amputations and complex orthopedic conditions.

Care will be provided by highly specialized nurses, therapists and physicians.

Billable hours dropped by 12.3% due to reduced client spending. Average bill rates declined, impacting gross margin. SG&A expenses improved by 16.5% due to cost reduction measures. Net income decreased to $2.6 million, with a net income margin of 1.7%. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Resources Connection, Inc. reflect a significant revenue contraction of 19.6% on a same-day constant currency basis, which is a substantial decline indicating a challenging macroeconomic environment. The drop in revenue, coupled with a decrease in net income from $7.0 million to $2.6 million, suggests a pressured profitability that could raise concerns among investors about the company's ability to navigate economic headwinds and maintain its earnings power.Furthermore, the company's gross margin contraction from 38.3% to 37.0% points to a less favorable cost structure, potentially due to a higher pay/bill ratio. This could indicate pricing pressures or an increase in labor costs relative to revenue, which are critical factors for a consulting firm's profitability. The reduction in SG&A expenses reflects cost-control measures, which are essential for managing profitability during revenue downturns. However, investors should monitor whether these savings are sustainable or if they will impact the company's operational capabilities.Lastly, the Adjusted EBITDA margin decline from 8.9% to 7.1% year over year is noteworthy as it is a key indicator of operational efficiency and profitability. The company's ability to maintain dividends despite the downturn could be seen as a positive signal of management's confidence in the company's cash flow generation and financial stability. Market Research Analyst The disclosed financials highlight the impact of the macroeconomic climate on client spending behaviors, particularly in the consulting sector. The extended time to close opportunities and the shift in revenue mix to the Asia Pacific region, where lower average bill rates are prevalent, suggest a possible strategic pivot or market-driven necessity. This could reflect a broader trend in the consulting industry where firms are diversifying geographically to mitigate risks and tap into emerging markets despite the lower billing rates.Moreover, the company's mention of a technology transformation and the acquisition of Reference Point could signal a strategic move towards enhancing digital and advisory capabilities in the financial services sector. The emphasis on ERP cloud migration, automation and AI initiatives aligns with the industry's push towards digital transformation, which could be a long-term growth driver if successfully executed. Investors should consider these developments as potential indicators of the company's future direction and competitive positioning. Tax Analyst The increase in the effective tax rate to 43.2% from virtually zero in the prior year is a significant shift. The previous year's tax benefit, attributed to a one-time release of a valuation allowance in the Europe region, contrasts sharply with this year's higher tax expenses. This change could have a material impact on net income and warrants attention as it reduces the company's net earnings. Investors should assess the sustainability of the company's tax strategies and the potential for future tax benefits or liabilities that could affect profitability.It's also important to note that while the tax rate has increased, the overall tax expense is based on a lower pre-tax income base, which indicates that the higher tax rate is exacerbating the impact of reduced operational earnings. This factor, combined with the current economic climate, may influence investor sentiment regarding the company's fiscal management and future earnings potential. 04/03/2024 - 04:30 PM IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Resources Connection, Inc.

Gross pipeline remained relatively resilient, however, the time to close opportunities in the pipeline continued to be protracted. Compared to the prior year quarter, billable hours decreased by 12.3% due to reduced client spending and the average bill rate declined by 7.8% (also 7.8% on a constant currency basis) due to a shift in revenue mix to the Asia Pacific region which carries lower average bill rate. The United States (U.S.) average bill rates increased by 0.9%, compared to the prior year as a result of pricing actions taken to implement our value-based pricing model, while average bill rates in the Asia Pacific region declined by 10.1% (or 6.3% on a constant currency basis), also largely attributable to a shift in revenue mix across the countries within this region. Gross margin was 37.0% compared to 38.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to a higher pay/bill ratio and reduced leverage of indirect cost of service on lower revenue. While the pay/bill ratio in the U.S. remained relatively consistent with the prior year, the enterprise wide pay/bill ratio was negatively impacted by an increased proportion of revenue in regions with a higher pay/bill ratio. SG&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $49.6 million, or 32.8% of revenue, compared to $59.4 million, or 31.8% of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The improvement in SG&A year over year was primarily due to the reduction in bonuses and commissions by $7.3 million as a result of lower revenue and profitability achievement compared to incentive compensation targets in the current fiscal year, lower management compensation expense of $2.6 million partially attributable to the cost reduction plan (the “U.S. Restructuring Plan”) initiated in October 2023, and a decrease of $1.4 million in stock compensation expense as a result of forfeitures and remeasurement of achievement associated with performance based equity awards, partially offset by one-time costs of $1.6 million of employee termination benefits in connection with further actions taken under the U.S. Restructuring Plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Income tax expense was $1.9 million (an effective tax rate of 43.2%), compared to an income tax benefit of nearly zero (an effective tax benefit rate of less than 0.1%) in the prior year quarter. The income tax benefit in the three months ended February 25, 2023 resulted largely from a one-time tax benefit recognized on the release of valuation allowance in our Europe region. The higher effective tax rate in the three months ended February 24, 2024 resulted largely from a lower pretax income base increasing the tax expense ratio. Net income was $2.6 million (net income margin of 1.7%), compared to $7.0 million (net income margin of 3.8%) in the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower revenue and gross profit, partially offset by lower SG&A for the current year quarter. The Company delivered an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 8.9% in the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to lower gross margin and expense deleveraging on the lower revenue base.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess our financial and operating performance that are not defined by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable GAAP measure so calculated and presented. The following non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release: Same-day constant currency revenue is adjusted for the following items: Currency impact. In order to remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company calculates same-day constant currency revenue, which represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior period. Business days impact. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having a different number of business days, the Company calculates same-day revenue as current period revenue (adjusted for currency impact) divided by the number of business days in the current period, multiplied by the number of business days in the comparable prior period. The number of business days in each respective period is provided in the “Number of Business Days” section of the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table below. EBITDA is calculated as net income before amortization expense, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus stock-based compensation expense, technology transformation costs, goodwill impairment, one-time acquisition costs and restructuring costs. Adjusted EBITDA at the segment level excludes certain shared corporate administrative costs that are not practical to allocate. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue. Cash tax rate excludes the non-cash tax impact of stock option expirations, non-cash tax impact of valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets, and other non-cash tax items. Adjusted income tax expense is calculated based on the Company’s cash tax rates (as defined above). Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is calculated as diluted earnings per common share, plus or minus the per share impact of stock-based compensation expense, technology transformation costs, goodwill impairment, one-time acquisition costs, restructuring costs and adjusted for the related tax effects of these adjustments. We believe the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures, which are used by management to assess the core performance of our Company, provide useful information and additional clarity of our operating results to our investors in their own evaluation of the core performance of our Company and facilitate a comparison of such performance from period to period. These are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for revenue, net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our revenue, profitability or liquidity. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, net income, earnings per share, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently.

Segment Results On May 31, 2022, the Company divested taskforce – Management on Demand GmbH, and its wholly owned subsidiary skillforce – Executive Search GmbH, a German professional services firm operating under the taskforce brand (“taskforce”). Since the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the business operated by taskforce, along with its parent company, Resources Global Professionals (Germany) GmbH, an affiliate of the Company, represented an operating segment of the Company and was reported as a part of Other Segments. Effective May 31, 2022, the Company’s operating segments consist of RGP and Sitrick. Prior-period comparative segment information was not restated as a result of the divestiture of taskforce as the Company did not have a change in internal organization or the financial information that the Chief Operating Decision Maker uses to assess performance and allocate resources. RGP is the Company’s only operating segment that meets the quantitative threshold of a reportable segment. Sitrick does not individually meet the quantitative threshold to qualify as a reportable segment. Therefore, Sitrick is disclosed in Other Segments. On November 15, 2023, the Company acquired CloudGo, which is reported as part of the RGP operating segment. The following table discloses the Company’s revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by segment for each of the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended February 24, February 25, February 24, February 25, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenue: RGP $ 148,995 $ 184,270 $ 477,374 $ 582,849 Other Segments 2,312 2,507 7,229 8,345 Total revenue $ 151,307 $ 186,777 $ 484,603 $ 591,194 Adjusted EBITDA: RGP $ 19,376 $ 25,320 $ 63,697 $ 101,331 Other Segments (246 ) 113 (708 ) 761 Reconciling items (1) (8,344 ) (8,817 ) (24,596 ) (25,135 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 10,786 $ 16,616 $ 38,393 $ 76,957 (1) Reconciling items are generally comprised of unallocated corporate administrative costs, including management and board compensation, corporate support function costs and other general corporate costs that are not allocated to segments.

The company also highlighted its Proof-of-Stake achievements and revenue generation from the Bit Digital AI contract.","Bit Digital, Inc. Announces Monthly Production Update for March 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bit Digital, Inc. (BTBT) reported positive financial results for March 2024, with increased BTC production, high hash rate, significant treasury holdings in BTC and ETH, and strong cash reserves. The company also highlighted its Proof-of-Stake achievements and revenue generation from the Bit Digital AI contract. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Bit Digital's BTC production by 6% is a positive indicator of operational efficiency, which can be attractive to investors looking at the productivity of their mining operations. The active hash rate of 2.76 EH/s signifies robust mining capacity, which is critical given the competitive nature of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Additionally, the company's treasury holdings reveal a substantial investment in digital assets, which is a double-edged sword given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. While the current fair market value of these holdings is significant, investors must be aware of the potential for rapid fluctuations in value.Moreover, the company's liquidity, as indicated by $34.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, provides a cushion against operational risks and offers flexibility for future investments or to weather downturns in the crypto market. However, it's important to consider the company's cash position relative to its burn rate and the broader market conditions, which could impact its sustainability. Cryptocurrency Market Analyst Bit Digital's engagement in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols and the earned APY of 2.8% on staked ETH suggests a strategic diversification of revenue streams beyond mining. This is particularly relevant as the cryptocurrency industry evolves, with a shift towards PoS consensus mechanisms that are perceived as more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work (PoW). The reduction in actively staked ETH due to changing providers could be a strategic move to optimize staking returns, but it also suggests a period of transition that stakeholders should monitor for stability and performance implications.The company's foray into AI with 251 servers generating revenue demonstrates an innovative approach to leveraging its computational resources. The estimated $4.3 million revenue from the AI contract is a notable diversification, potentially mitigating risks associated with cryptocurrency market volatility.

The company reported a strong treasury of $118 million, achieved various milestones at Donlin Gold, and reinforced its social license through partnerships and community engagement. Despite ongoing challenges with permits, NOVAGOLD remains committed to advancing the project for the benefit of all stakeholders. Positive Strong treasury of $118 million in cash and term deposits as of the first quarter of 2024. Various milestones achieved at Donlin Gold, including resource modeling, metallurgical test work, and infrastructure planning. Extensive engagement with local communities and Native Corporations to reinforce the social license of the Donlin Gold project. Commitment to advancing the project development work and fulfilling the strategy of commencing a full bankable Feasibility Study. Partnerships with Calista and TKC to support education, health, safety, cultural preservation, and environmental initiatives in the Y-K region. Focus on maintaining permits in good standing despite ongoing appeals and challenges. Net loss decreased by $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, attributed to lower costs at Donlin Gold and increased interest income. Cash and term deposits decreased by $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. regarding its first quarter financial results and the progress of the Donlin Gold project presents a mixed financial picture for the company and its investors. The reported strong treasury position of $118 million in cash and term deposits indicates a robust financial foundation. This liquidity is critical for the company's ongoing development activities and can reassure investors of the company's ability to fund its operations in the near term without the immediate need for external financing.However, the decrease in net loss by $0.3 million compared to the same period in the previous year suggests a marginal improvement in the company's cost management. This minor decrease is attributed to reduced expenses at Donlin Gold and increased interest income, yet it is somewhat offset by higher interest expenses on promissory notes and increased general and administrative costs. The addition of corporate staff, including a new General Counsel, indicates an investment in the company's governance and legal infrastructure, which could be seen as laying the groundwork for future regulatory and legal challenges the project may face.Investors should note the long-term potential of the Donlin Gold project, which boasts a substantial gold resource with a high-grade quality. This positions NOVAGOLD favorably in the gold mining industry, especially considering the project's location in Alaska, a jurisdiction known for its stability and rule of law. The emphasis on maintaining permits and advancing the project's feasibility study indicates a strategic focus on ensuring the project's viability and compliance with regulatory standards, which is important for the project's long-term success and by extension, shareholder value. Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Analyst The extensive engagement and initiatives reported by NOVAGOLD highlight the company's commitment to Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) principles, which are becoming increasingly important to investors. The collaboration with local communities and native corporations, such as the Shared Values Statement and the Subsistence Communications Advisory Committee, demonstrates NOVAGOLD's proactive approach to maintaining its social license to operate. These efforts are essential for the project's long-term sustainability and can mitigate potential social risks that could arise from community opposition or social unrest.Moreover, the company's involvement in local environmental and social initiatives, such as the support for salmon population health and cultural preservation programs, aligns with broader ESG trends in the mining industry. These actions can enhance the company's reputation and potentially attract ESG-focused investors. However, it is important to monitor the execution and impact of these initiatives, as their effectiveness in securing long-term community support and mitigating environmental impacts will play a critical role in the project's acceptance and success.The company's transparency regarding its permitting process and litigation status is also noteworthy. The detailed update on the ongoing litigation and permitting efforts indicates a clear communication strategy and an understanding of the importance of these issues to stakeholders. The focus on jurisdictional safety and the rule of law in Alaska underscores the company's commitment to operating within a stable and predictable regulatory framework, which is a key consideration for risk-averse investors. Mining and Metals Market Analyst The Donlin Gold project's resource potential is a standout aspect of NOVAGOLD's update. With approximately 39 million ounces of gold at a high grade of 2.24 grams per tonne, the project is positioned as a potentially significant player in the gold market. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop with potential tailwinds for precious metals, such as inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty, a project of this magnitude could have a substantial impact on the gold market dynamics, particularly in terms of supply.However, investors should be aware of the complexities associated with the development of such a large-scale project. The mention of ongoing metallurgical test work and the advancement of the Alaska Dam Safety Certification are indicative of the technical challenges that lie ahead. The successful optimization of the flowsheet and confirmation of the resource model will be pivotal in determining the project's economic feasibility and operational efficiency.Furthermore, the project's exploration upside is emphasized, with only a fraction of the total land package currently explored. This presents both a significant opportunity and a risk, as further exploration could potentially increase the resource base, enhancing the project's value, but also requires additional investment and carries the inherent uncertainty of exploration activities.Given the project's scale and the long-term nature of its development, investors should consider the balance between the potential for substantial future returns against the significant capital expenditures and the time required to realize production. The project's progress and the company's ability to navigate the permitting process and manage environmental and social challenges will be critical factors influencing its stock performance and its role in the broader mining and metals market. 04/03/2024 - 05:16 PM Committed to Advancing Donlin Gold to Full Feasibility Study Extensive Engagement Reinforcing and Deepening Donlin Gold’s Social License Strong Treasury of $118 Million in Cash and Term Deposits in the First Quarter of 2024 VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. (“NOVAGOLD” or “the Company” (NYSE American, TSX: NG) today released its 2024 first quarter financial results and an update on its Tier One1 gold development project, Donlin Gold, which NOVAGOLD owns equally with Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”). Details of the financial results for the quarter ended February 29, 2024, are presented in the consolidated financial statements and quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q on April 3, 2024, that is available on the Company’s website at www.novagold.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. In the first quarter of 2024, the following milestones were achieved: The ongoing activities at Donlin Gold included: Completion of the scope of work for resource modelling by a third-party consultant for an updated resource model;Advancement of metallurgical test work with a pilot plant in Ontario, Canada, to confirm proposed optimizations to the flowsheet;Continued planning for regional infrastructure support to narrow the scope of work and identify the best path forward;Incorporation of recent field data in geoscience hydrology to update the groundwater model and surface water model; In partnership with Calista Corporation (“Calista”) and The Kuskokwim Corporation (TKC), Donlin Gold reached significant milestones in education, health and safety, cultural preservation, and environmental initiatives: Finalization of another Shared Values Statement in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region near the project, bringing the total count to 16;Holding the first informational meeting for the Subsistence Communications Advisory Committee in Anchorage;Expanding our efforts to identify specific project opportunities aimed at monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing the health of salmon populations in the Y-K region;Sponsorship of, and active participation in, key winter events: Donlin Gold’s Pete Kaiser won the 2024 K300 sled dog race in January and Kristina Woolston competed in the Iron Dog in February, the world’s longest and toughest snowmobile race that covers 2,500 miles of Alaskan backcountry;Support to various search and rescue teams, including the Chevak and Kipnuk Traditional Councils. As a federally permitted project on private Alaska Native Corporation land designated by law for mining, with key State permits secured, Donlin Gold’s activities center on maintaining existing permits and advancing outstanding requirements, including: Ongoing work to advance the Alaska Dam Safety Certification preliminary design packages, which are expected to be submitted to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) later this year after review by the Independent Technical Review Board;Continuing to support Federal and State agencies to uphold the comprehensive Donlin Gold permits under appeal. President’s Message Dedicated Efforts to Fund and Advance Donlin Gold’s Project Development Work During the first quarter of 2024, with the support from the owners and the Donlin Gold LLC Board, numerous important activities were conducted. These included, among others, completing the scope of work for resource modelling by a third-party consultant to update the resource model; advancing the metallurgical test work with a pilot plant in Ontario, Canada, to confirm proposed optimizations to the flowsheet, which are expected to conclude later in the year; continuing to plan the regional infrastructure support to streamline the scope of work and identify the optimal path forward; and integrating recent field data in geoscience hydrology to update the groundwater and surface water models, alongside continuous data collection to update source characteristics for closure planning. In addition, an extensive amount of outreach efforts took place in Alaska, in the Y-K region, and in Washington D.C. to support community engagement and permitting efforts that help reinforce our social license. The diligent and highly effective work by the Donlin Gold team, our partners and broader stakeholders are greatly appreciated. NOVAGOLD remains committed to employing a concerted and inclusive approach to advancing the Donlin Gold project, consistent with our pledges to — and for the benefit of — all shareholders and stakeholders, and especially to fulfilling the strategy that has been pledged time and again by NOVAGOLD: namely, to commence a full bankable Feasibility Study to optimally position the project, setting up a potential positive construction decision when the time is right. Nurturing Partnerships to Reinforce Donlin Gold’s Social License — Engaging Local Communities, Governments, and Native Corporations Our dedication to the Company’s partnerships with Calista and TKC throughout Donlin Gold’s project development and permitting processes has been strengthened by decades of steadfast and reliable engagement with the 62 stakeholder communities. The Donlin Gold project is located on private land that is designated by law for mining activities, under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. The Native Corporations have thus been instrumental in facilitating comprehensive local stakeholder outreach across the Y-K region, as well as government engagement efforts in the broader reaches of Alaska and Washington, D.C. In the first quarter of 2024, Donlin Gold finalized another Shared Values Statement, bringing the total count to 16. This remarkable accomplishment underscores our commitment to continuous engagement with local communities, strengthening existing long-term relationships, and addressing specific community needs. Furthermore, in partnership with Calista and TKC, Donlin Gold held the first informational meeting for the Subsistence Communications Advisory Committee (“SCAC”) in Anchorage this past quarter. All attendees, who hold varying perspectives on the Donlin Gold project, completed an application to join the SCAC. Central to the partnership between Donlin Gold, Calista and TKC, the SCAC was established to maintain a well-defined process for communications, dialogue, problem-solving, and seeking the views of the broader community regarding subsistence matters. Persistent Support for Y-K Region’s Environmental and Social Initiatives NOVAGOLD prioritizes community and social responsibility, ensuring shared values are upheld at both the Donlin Gold project site and within the communities of the Y-K region. Through initiatives focused on education, community wellness, cultural preservation, and environmental stewardship, Donlin Gold supports fisheries studies, environmental activities, subsistence and cultural preservation initiatives, and various grants. In collaboration with Calista and TKC, a broad range of activities and projects were undertaken in the last quarter. Since mid-2023, NOVAGOLD, Donlin Gold and its Alaska Native Corporation partners have closely monitored and assessed the conditions and management of salmon fisheries in the Kuskokwim and Yukon River watersheds. In the first quarter of 2024, efforts with local tribes were focused on identifying specific potential project opportunities to monitor, evaluate, and enhance the health of salmon populations. The projects to be supported will be finalized in early 2024, with plans for implementation beginning in the spring/summer of that year. All such initiatives will be pursued in collaboration and partnership with the people of the Y-K region. Both NOVAGOLD and Donlin Gold are committed to advancing educational opportunities in Alaska and actively promote learning through collaborative efforts, including by sponsoring the Lower Kuskokwim School District’s annual college and career fair. Donlin Gold also maintains its dedication to local community sports initiatives and youth groups, as exemplified by its support of events such as the Donlin Gold Basketball Tournament held at Bethel Regional High School in Bethel, Alaska. Donlin Gold also provided an annual contribution to the Rural Alaska Honors Institute, a program running through the University of Alaska Fairbanks which prepares Alaska Native high-school students for college life. Donlin Gold proudly continues to fund and support The Kuskokwim 300, a premier mid-distance dog sled race covering a challenging 300-mile trail from Bethel to Aniak and back. Additionally, Donlin Gold sponsors Y-K mushers Isaac Underwood, Mike Williams Jr., and 2019 Iditarod champion and Donlin Gold employee Pete Kaiser, winner of his eighth title in the Kuskokwim 300 — who hails from Bethel and is the first Yupik musher ever and the fifth Alaska Native to win an Iditarod championship. Mr. Kaiser actively engages with youth in the community, focusing on suicide prevention in alignment with Donlin Gold’s commitment to strengthening vital community well-being initiatives. Furthermore, last February, Donlin Gold was a sponsor of the Iron Dog, the world’s longest and toughest snowmobile race that covers 2,500 miles of Alaskan backcountry, in which Kristina Woolston, Donlin Gold’s External Affairs Manager, participated. Other cultural preservation initiatives include supporting the Native Village of Kalskag’s annual Cauneq Camp as well as partnering with Carry the Cure to bring suicide prevention programs to Toksook Bay, Nightmute, Tununak, and Kasigluk. Donlin Gold extended support to several search and rescue teams in the region, including the Chevak and Kipnuk Traditional Councils and Bethel Search and Rescue. Financial assistance was also provided to Camp Fire Alaska, an organization dedicated to offering summer camps and programs to rural communities across Alaska with various activities, including music, sports, science, field trips, and ample outdoor recreation opportunities. In February 2024, Donlin Gold continued its sponsorship of local radio stations in Alaska, which play a crucial role in delivering weather updates and safety messages to rural communities where internet connectivity is limited. Furthermore, Donlin Gold pursued its support of and active involvement in the Alaska Safe Riders initiative, which focuses on promoting safety for snowmachines, all-terrain vehicles, and recreational off-road vehicles. Meaningful collaboration was also fostered with the Native Village of Napaimute, with Donlin Gold extending financial assistance to bolster cultural wellness programs and to maintain the Kuskokwim River Ice Road – a critical winter infrastructure that provides for the safe transport of residents to sport and cultural events, as well as a crucial conduit of economic activity for the Kuskokwim River communities. Maintaining Permits in Good Standing Despite multiple challenges, all appeals against Donlin Gold permits have been unsuccessful to date. We recognize the importance of preparedness and organization in these matters. Permitting in the United States and Alaska constitutes a significant and rigorous endeavor, where success relies on years of dedicated efforts to ensure a diligent, thorough, transparent, and inclusive process engaging all stakeholders, including those from the Y-K region. Donlin Gold, along with its owners and partners Calista and TKC, possesses an intimate understanding of the project’s permitting and regulatory procedures. We remain committed to supporting Federal and State agencies in defending the rigorous permitting process and focused on securing the remaining state-level permits and certificates required for the project. We recognize that there is a price to be paid for jurisdictional safety. There are an increasing number of places in the world where permitting is becoming less burdened by the rule of law. The flipside of that relative ease is that these locales are also much less reliable politically or socially than Alaska, the second largest gold producing state in one of the world’s safest countries for free enterprise. We treasure the conviction that, if the mine is built, our investors would be able to enjoy the luxury of knowing that Alaska is a place where they can sleep well at night — confident that when they awaken in the morning, they would still own what they owned the night before. In an ever more complex and fraught world, this sober reasoning makes it well worth the effort. During the first quarter of 2024, Donlin Gold continued to advance the Dam Safety Certification preliminary design packages, which are expected to be submitted to the ADNR in 2024 after review by the Independent Technical Review Board. Earthjustice filed their opening brief with the Alaska Supreme Court on January 4, 2024, appealing the Alaska Superior Court’s decision on Donlin Gold’s water rights permits, following an unsuccessful appeal to the ADNR Commissioner. The State of Alaska, Calista, and Donlin Gold are scheduled to submit their reply briefs with the Supreme Court in April 2024. Earthjustice filed their opening brief with the Alaska Superior Court on January 5, 2024, appealing the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner’s decision upholding the 401 Water Quality Certification. The State of Alaska and Donlin Gold will file their reply briefs to the Alaska Superior Court in the second quarter 2024. Briefing on Earthjustice’s appeal of the Alaska Superior Court affirmation of ADNR’s issuance of the State Right-of-Way lease to the Alaska Supreme Court was completed in February 2024. Earthjustice has requested oral argument, which has not been scheduled. In the Federal litigation challenging the Donlin Gold Joint Record of Decision, including the 404 permit, Earthjustice filed their opening brief on February 16, 2024. The State of Alaska, Calista, and Donlin Gold are scheduled to file their reply briefing in April 2024. Committed to Advancing the Donlin Gold Project for All Shareholders and Stakeholders NOVAGOLD’s unwavering commitment to advancing Donlin Gold is reflected in our stance regarding next steps for the project, as well as in the increased investments and expanded partnerships with communities in the Y-K region that deliver significant value for all stakeholders, including Alaska residents and Company shareholders. Donlin Gold is indeed the rarest of the rare: an exceptional gold development project, boasting approximately 39 million ounces of gold with a grade of 2.24 grams per tonne in Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (100% basis), inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. With a grade that is twice the gold industry average, Donlin Gold thus has the potential to be a low-cost, open-pit, million-ounce producer for decades. Superimposed onto this is the blue sky of the excellent exploration opportunities that extend well beyond the current resource area — 3km of an 8km belt that in itself represents but five percent of our total land package. With the multiple tailwinds of the macro backdrop, as well as the project’s sheer size, quality, low-cost structure, and that simply outstanding exploration upside, we aim to solidify Donlin’s status as what we believe to be the best gold development story in the world today. As a characteristic “Tier 1 Asset” in a world-leading, Tier 1 jurisdiction2, we believe that Donlin truly epitomizes a great asset that gives one great leverage in a great place that will allow one to keep the fruits of that leverage. Of signal importance, NOVAGOLD has been blessed with long-term and supportive shareholders whose presence and counsel have been invaluable. We are grateful for the decision of our shareholders to invest in our Company and for their continued solidarity and engagement. We reaffirm to each and every one of them that, as stewards of the Company, we continue to be focused on delivering on our strategy and enhancing the value of the Donlin Gold project, increasing both shareholder and stakeholder wealth in a safe and socially responsible manner. Last but certainly not least, I wish to express heartfelt gratitude to our colleagues and partners at Donlin Gold, Calista, TKC, and NOVAGOLD for their enduring collaboration. I also extend deep appreciation to our esteemed Board of Directors for their steadfast determination and guidance. Sincerely, Gregory A.

During the first quarter of 2024, net loss decreased by $0.3 million from in 2023, primarily due to lower costs at Donlin Gold and increased interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on the promissory note and higher general and administrative costs. In the prior first quarter of 2023, Donlin Gold costs included geotechnical drilling for the Alaska Dam Safety Certificates. General and administrative costs increased primarily due to corporate staff additions, including the hiring of a new General Counsel. Liquidity and Capital Resources In the first quarter of 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $8.2 million, primarily to fund our share of Donlin Gold and for corporate administrative expenses. The decrease in cash used in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 was due to lower funding requirements for Donlin Gold, partially offset by the timing of term deposit interest income receipt and higher general and administrative costs. 2024 Outlook Our anticipated expenditures in fiscal year 2024 are approximately $31.2 million, including $14.3 million to fund the Donlin Gold project, and $16.9 million for corporate general and administrative costs. NOVAGOLD’s primary goals in 2024 include continuing to advance the Donlin Gold project toward a construction decision; maintaining support for Donlin Gold among the project’s stakeholders; promoting a strong safety, sustainability, and environmental culture; maintaining a favorable reputation of NOVAGOLD; and preserving a healthy balance sheet. Our operations primarily relate to the delivery of project milestones, including the achievement of various technical, environmental, sustainable development, economic and legal objectives, obtaining necessary permits and maintaining those received in good standing, completion of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, preparation of engineering designs and the financing to fund these objectives.

About NOVAGOLD NOVAGOLD is a well-financed precious metals company focused on the development of its 50%-owned Donlin Gold project in Alaska, one of the safest mining jurisdictions in the world. With approximately 39 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource categories, inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (541 million tonnes at an average grade of approximately 2.24 grams per tonne, in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories on a 100% basis) 3 , the Donlin Gold project is regarded to be one of the largest, highest-grade, and most prospective known open-pit gold deposits in the world. According to the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report (both as defined below), once in production, the Donlin Gold project is expected to produce an average of more than one million ounces per year over a 27-year mine life on a 100% basis. The Donlin Gold project has substantial exploration potential beyond the designed footprint of the open pit which currently covers three kilometers of an approximately eight-kilometer-long gold-bearing trend. Current activities at the Donlin Gold project are focused on state permitting, engineering studies, community outreach, and workforce development in preparation for the eventual construction and operation of this project. With a strong balance sheet, NOVAGOLD is well-positioned to fund its share of permitting and advancement efforts at the Donlin Gold project.

"UMH PROPERTIES, INC. EXPANDS ITS EXISTING UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT",2024-04-03T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"UMH Properties, Inc. expands its unsecured revolving credit facility from $180 million to $260 million, syndicated with three banks. The move aims to boost liquidity and strengthen financial flexibility.","UMH PROPERTIES, INC. EXPANDS ITS EXISTING UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary UMH Properties, Inc. expands its unsecured revolving credit facility from $180 million to $260 million, syndicated with three banks. The move aims to boost liquidity and strengthen financial flexibility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The expansion of UMH Properties' unsecured revolving credit facility represents a strategic move to bolster liquidity and support ongoing growth initiatives. This increase from $180 million to $260 million in available borrowings suggests a robust confidence from the syndicate of banks in UMH's financial health and business model. The involvement of reputable financial institutions such as BMO, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, especially with the latter joining the facility, implies a positive credit outlook for the company.From a financial perspective, the enhanced credit line may lead to an improved debt-to-equity ratio, assuming the funds are utilized effectively for accretive projects or acquisitions. Such financial leverage can be beneficial if it translates into higher returns on equity for shareholders. However, stakeholders should monitor the company's interest coverage ratio to ensure that the increased debt level does not lead to excessive financial risk.For investors, liquidity is a key indicator of a company's ability to meet short-term obligations and invest in growth opportunities. This move could signal to the market that UMH is positioning itself for strategic expansions or acquisitions, potentially driving future revenue growth. On the flip side, investors should be aware of the potential for dilution if the credit is used to fund operations rather than growth, which could impact shareholder value negatively. Market Research Analyst The expansion of UMH Properties' credit facility comes at a time when the manufactured home community sector is experiencing a shift in demand dynamics. The increase in borrowing capacity may provide UMH with the agility to capitalize on market opportunities such as purchasing new properties or upgrading existing ones to meet the evolving needs of consumers.As a Market Research Analyst, observing the geographic distribution of UMH's assets across multiple states, the company is well-positioned to leverage regional market trends. The housing affordability crisis has led to increased interest in manufactured homes as an alternative to traditional housing and UMH's expansion of its credit line may be a strategic response to this trend.Additionally, the involvement of a new banking partner in Wells Fargo could indicate a broadening of UMH's financial relationships, potentially leading to more favorable terms and access to a larger network of financial services. It's essential for stakeholders to consider how UMH plans to use the increased financial flexibility to stay competitive and whether they can maintain a balance between growth and financial stability in the long term. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst UMH Properties' decision to expand its credit facility is a move that is closely watched by REIT analysts. This expansion reflects the company's proactive approach to capital management, which is critical for a REIT given its requirement to distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.Access to a larger credit facility could enhance UMH's ability to maintain and potentially increase its dividend payouts, a key metric for REIT investors. Moreover, the credit expansion could be indicative of upcoming acquisitions or developments, which could drive long-term asset value growth for the company. It is important, however, to assess the terms of the credit facility, such as interest rates and covenants, as they can have significant implications for UMH's cost of capital and operational flexibility.Furthermore, the diversification of UMH's portfolio across various states and the joint venture in Florida with Nuveen Real Estate suggest a strategic approach to risk management and growth. Investors should evaluate how the increased borrowing capacity might affect UMH's market position within the REIT sector and its ability to generate sustainable income streams from its property portfolio. 04/03/2024 - 04:15 PM FREEHOLD, NJ, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE: UMH) (TASE:UMH), announced today that it has expanded its existing unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) from $180 million in available borrowings to $260 million in available borrowings. The Facility is syndicated with three banks, BMO Capital MarketsCorp. (“BMO”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) as joint arrangers and joint book runners, with Bank of Montreal as administrative agent. Samuel A.

(Nasdaq: LUNR, LUNRW) (“Intuitive Machines”) (“Company”) $30 million as a prime contractor to complete a Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services Feasibility Assessment. The contract tasks the Company’s global team with creating a feasibility roadmap to develop and deploy a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (“LTV”) on the Moon using Intuitive Machines’ Nova-D cargo-class lunar lander. The first phase award marks the Company’s entrance into human spaceflight operations within NASA’s $4.6 billion LTV Services project. “This procurement strategically aligns with the Company’s flight-proven capability to deliver payloads to the surface of the Moon under the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative, further solidifying our position as a proven commercial contractor in lunar exploration,” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus. “Our global team is on a path to provide essential lunar infrastructure services to NASA in a project that would allow the Company to retain ownership of the vehicle for commercial utilization during periods of non-NASA activity over approximately ten years of lunar surface activity.” Intuitive Machines’ Moon Reusable Autonomous Crewed Exploration Rover (RACER) global team partners, including AVL, Boeing, Michelin, and Northrop Grumman, intend to provide a robust LTV design architecture with advanced power management, autonomous driving, communications, and navigation systems for lunar exploration. The Company believes the Moon RACER team is the most comprehensively equipped choice for delivering and deploying a lunar terrain vehicle that meets NASA requirements.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Q1 earnings of Levi Strauss & Co. show a mixed financial picture, with a gross margin increase to 58.2% indicating improved profitability per item sold, attributed to lower product costs and a favorable mix shift. This is an important metric for investors as gross margin improvements can lead to higher operating leverage. However, the 8% decrease in net revenues and the diluted loss per share of $(0.03) due to restructuring charges reflect challenges in the company's operations. The direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment's growth of 7%, including a 10% increase in the U.S., signals a strategic shift towards more profitable sales channels and may contribute to a more stable revenue base in the long term.The affirmation of 1-3% FY revenue growth and the raised EPS range to $1.17-$1.27 demonstrate management's confidence in the company's strategic initiatives, like Project Fuel, aimed at improving productivity. The 14% decrease in inventories suggests efficient inventory management, which is critical in the retail sector to minimize holding costs and reduce the risk of markdowns. The company's shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases, indicate a commitment to delivering shareholder value, even in a challenging quarter. Market Research Analyst Levi Strauss & Co.'s focus on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, which grew by 7% and now represents 48% of total net revenues, aligns with broader retail trends of prioritizing customer experience and brand engagement over traditional wholesale models. This strategic pivot is particularly relevant as e-commerce revenue showed a robust increase, reflecting consumer shopping preferences and the potential for higher margins compared to wholesale.The company's performance in different geographies, with net revenues in the Americas and Europe being down but Asia remaining steady, suggests a varied impact of regional market conditions and consumer behavior. The decline in Europe and the Americas could be due to macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and supply chain issues, which investors should monitor as they can affect future performance. Retail Sector Analyst The restructuring charges that led to a net loss this quarter highlight the costs associated with transitioning to a more efficient business model. While these charges have impacted short-term earnings, the long-term benefits of Project Fuel could result in a leaner cost structure and better margins. Investors should weigh these short-term losses against the potential for improved operational efficiency.Levi Strauss & Co.'s decision to exit the Denizen business and the Russian market are strategic moves to focus on core brands and avoid geopolitical risks. While these exits have affected net revenues, such decisions can lead to a more focused brand portfolio and reduced exposure to volatile markets. The raised EPS guidance suggests that the company expects these changes to have a positive impact on profitability. 04/03/2024 - 04:10 PM Q1 Earnings Results Above Expectations Gross Margin of 58.2% Up 240 BPS Over Prior Year Driven by Lower Product Costs & Favorable Mix Shift Global DTC Up 7% Including 10% Growth in the U.S. Diluted Loss Per Share of $(0.03) Due to Restructuring Charges, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.26 Company Affirms 1-3% FY Revenue Growth & Raises EPS Range to $1.17-$1.27 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended February 25, 2024. “We started the year strong delivering results above expectations, underscoring the power of the Levi’s brand and the progress we are making on our strategic priorities. Both newness and strength in our core offerings are fueling consumer demand and driving meaningful market share gains,” said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. “The momentum in our global DTC business continues, with DTC up in all segments. Our efforts to stabilize our wholesale business are delivering results. We are on our way to transforming this company into a best-in-class DTC-first apparel retailer, setting the stage for our next phase of sustainable profitable growth.” “The structural economics of our business improved in Q1 driven by significant gross margin expansion, disciplined expense controls and efficient working capital management,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co. “Our global productivity initiative, Project Fuel, is progressing well and improving the profitability of the company. Looking forward, we are encouraged by trends in our business, around the world, including in Europe. As a result, we are confident in our ability to return the topline to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of this year and are increasing our full year EPS expectations.” Financial Highlights Net Revenues of $1.6 billion were 8% lower on both a reported and constant-currency basis versus Q1 2023 primarily due to the shift in wholesale shipments from Q2 to Q1 2023 from the U.S. ERP implementation. This shift negatively impacted Q1 2024 over 2023 by approximately $100 million or 6% of net revenues. In addition, excluding the impact of the exit of the Denizen business and Russia, net revenues would have been flat to prior year. In the Americas, net revenues decreased 11% on a reported and constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the shift in wholesale shipments and the exit of the Denizen business, both the Americas and the U.S. were up 2%. In Europe, net revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant-currency basis; factoring out the impact of the Russia business, net revenues decreased 5% on a constant-currency basis. Asia net revenues were in line with prior year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant-currency basis, on top of 22% growth in the prior year, reflecting growth across most markets. Other Brands net revenues decreased 10% on both a reported and constant-currency basis. DTC (Direct to Consumer) net revenues increased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant-currency basis. DTC growth exceeded total net revenues growth in all segments, including a 10% increase in the U.S. and a 4% increase in Europe, excluding Russia. Revenues from e-commerce grew 13% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant-currency basis reflecting double-digit growth across the Levi’s and Beyond Yoga brands. As a percentage of first quarter net revenues, DTC comprised a record 48% of total net revenues. Wholesale net revenues declined 18% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant-currency basis driven primarily by the $100 million negative shift in wholesale shipments from the U.S. ERP implementation from Q2 to Q1 2023. Global wholesale net revenues were down 9% to prior year when normalizing for the shift in wholesale shipments in Q1 2023.

Share repurchases of $25 million, reflecting 1.5 million shares retired. As of February 25, 2024, the company had $656 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date. The company has declared a dividend of $0.12 per share, totaling approximately $48 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 23, 2024 to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on May 9, 2024. Updated Fiscal 2024 Guidance Company reaffirms reported net revenues are expected to be up 1% to 3% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be between $1.17 to $1.27 vs. $1.15 to $1.25 previously. More details will be provided during the earnings conference call. This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, or currency impacts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

The company has based these forward-looking statements on its current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. Words such as, but not limited to, “believe,” “will,” “so we can,” “when,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project” and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 25, 2024, especially in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” sections. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this press release and related conference call. The company is not under any obligation and does not intend to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this press release and related conference call to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this press release and related conference call or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even if such circumstances or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted net income margin, Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis) and constant-currency net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted net income margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis) and constant-currency net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital, and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges. Constant-currency The company reports certain operating results on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company believes disclosure of constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered as an alternative or substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily include the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency. Additionally, gross margin is impacted by gains and losses related to the procurement of inventory, primarily products sourced in EUR and USD, by the company's global sourcing organization on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries.

(6) Tax impact calculated using the annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete costs and benefits. Adjusted Free Cash Flow: We define Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented. Three Months Ended February 25, 2024 February 26, 2023 (Dollars in millions) (Unaudited) Most comparable GAAP measure: Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 286.0 $ (160.8 ) Net cash used for investing activities (71.7 ) (19.1 ) Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities (94.5 ) 77.8 Non-GAAP measure: Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 286.0 $ (160.8 ) Purchases of property, plant and equipment (71.6 ) (110.9 ) Adjusted free cash flow $ 214.4 $ (271.7 ) Return on Invested Capital: We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies.

(BNL) provided a business update for Q1 2024, including investments of $40.1 million, sale of healthcare properties for $251.7 million, and participation in Morgan Stanley Triple Net REIT Day. The company has $282.7 million of committed investments, with acquisitions under control and developments funded. BNL's portfolio consists of industrial, restaurant, retail, and office properties, with strong lease performance and minimal vacancies. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The strategic maneuvers by Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. (BNL) reflect a notable shift in their investment portfolio, with a considerable divestiture of healthcare properties and a substantial reinvestment into industrial and retail assets. This activity suggests a targeted approach to optimizing the company's asset mix to potentially enhance returns and reduce exposure to market-specific risks associated with the healthcare sector.The reported 99.0% collection of base rents and 99.2% occupancy rates are strong indicators of BNL's operational efficiency and tenant stability, which are critical metrics for investors assessing REIT performance. The high occupancy rate, in particular, demonstrates effective property management and suggests a robust demand for BNL's properties.Furthermore, the anticipated capitalization rates for both the new development and the acquisitions signal the expected return on investment for these properties. A capitalization rate of 8.3% for the new distribution facility is competitive within the industry, implying a healthy yield in a low-interest-rate environment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, BNL's sale of healthcare properties at a weighted average capitalization rate of 7.9% and the reinvestment into new acquisitions with a stabilized yield of approximately 7.2% on the Sarasota facility and a weighted average initial cash capitalization rate of 8.0% on other capital expenditures, indicate a strategic reallocation of capital towards higher-yielding assets.The off-market nature of the majority of acquisitions is also noteworthy, as these deals can often be secured at more favorable terms than those available on the open market, potentially leading to enhanced shareholder value. The company's ability to source such deals demonstrates a strong network and industry presence.BNL's balance sheet fundamentals and the CEO's emphasis on building momentum for long-term growth suggest a focus on sustainable financial practices and shareholder returns. Investors might view these strategic decisions as positive indicators of the company's forward-looking approach to capital management and growth. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market trends, BNL's pivot towards industrial properties aligns with the current demand surge in the logistics and distribution sectors, driven by the growth of e-commerce and the need for sophisticated distribution facilities. The investment in a tri-climate distribution facility indicates an anticipation of future market needs and a strategic positioning to capitalize on emerging trends.The shift in portfolio composition, with 54.2% industrial and 11.9% retail, is reflective of a broader industry shift towards these asset types. The reduction in healthcare exposure, now at 13.4% of ABR, may also be a strategic hedge against potential volatility in the healthcare sector, possibly due to regulatory changes or shifting market dynamics.With the retail and restaurant properties making up a significant portion of the new acquisitions, BNL appears to be making a calculated bet on the resilience and recovery of these sectors post-pandemic, which could be a point of interest for market watchers. 04/03/2024 - 04:10 PM VICTOR, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. (NYSE: BNL) (“Broadstone,” “BNL,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), today provided a business update for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company announced that it will be participating in the Morgan Stanley Triple Net REIT Day on April 9, 2024. Q1 2024 BUSINESS UPDATE During the first quarter, we invested $40.1 million, including $37.1 million in development fundings and $3.0 million in revenue generating capital expenditures. The development fundings primarily relate to our previously disclosed state-of-the-art one million square foot tri-climate distribution facility in Sarasota, Florida, which is expected to open in the third quarter of 2024. The facility will be leased to UNFI pursuant to a 15-year net lease with multiple renewal options and 2.50% annual rent escalations. The stabilized yield upon completion is estimated to be approximately 7.2%, and together with rent escalations will translate into a GAAP capitalization rate of approximately 8.3%. The revenue generating capital expenditures had a weighted average initial cash capitalization rate of 8.0%, lease term of 8.0 years, and annual rent increase of 2.5%. Through the date of this release, we have $282.7 million of committed investments, including $202.8 million in acquisitions under control, $74.1 million of commitments to fund developments, and $5.8 million of commitments to fund revenue generating capital expenditures with existing tenants. The $202.8 million in acquisitions under control, which we define as under contract or executed letter of intent, include $105.7 million in industrial properties and $97.1 million in retail and restaurant properties. $149.5 million of the acquisitions are off-market deals sourced directly through developer and other relationships. We anticipate these acquisitions will close during April and May of 2024. During the first quarter, we sold 37 clinically-oriented healthcare properties for gross proceeds of $251.7 million at a weighted average capitalization rate of 7.9%. The properties represented approximately 48% of our clinically-oriented healthcare portfolio and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.4 years. As a result of the sale, our healthcare portfolio decreased to 13.4% of ABR at March 31, 2024. Our industrial, restaurant, retail, and office portfolio represented 54.2%, 14.2%, 11.9%, and 6.3%, respectively, of ABR at March 31, 2024. During the first quarter, we collected 99.0% of base rents due for all properties under lease, and our portfolio was 99.2% leased based on rentable square footage, with only three of our 759 total properties vacant and not subject to a lease as of quarter end. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY “I am excited to announce that we have closed on the sale of $251.7 million of our clinically-oriented properties as part of our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy, with the entirety of the net proceeds slated for redeployment into our $282.7 million of investments under control,” said John Moragne, BNL's Chief Executive Officer. “With continued strong portfolio operating performance during the first quarter and continued solid balance sheet fundamentals, this is a significant milestone in building the momentum needed for multiple expansion, long-term growth, and increased shareholder value. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the year, and confident in our ability to execute on our strategic vision and drive sustained growth across our diversified real estate assets.” About Broadstone Net Lease, Inc.

The offering includes 2,978,808 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, property acquisitions, commercial loan opportunities, and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst CTO Realty Growth, Inc.'s announcement of a public offering of additional Series A Preferred Stock is a strategic financial move aimed at raising capital. The issuance of preferred stock is a common method for companies to secure funding without increasing their debt levels. The 6.375% dividend rate indicates a potentially attractive yield for investors, especially in a low-interest-rate environment. However, the attractiveness of this yield would depend on the current market conditions and the risk profile of the company.From an investment perspective, the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes such as property acquisitions and debt repayment suggests a proactive approach to balance sheet management. Repayment of debt can improve financial ratios and potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating. Property acquisitions could signify growth ambitions, which may be viewed positively if the acquisitions are accretive to earnings. However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of issuing additional shares, which could impact the value of existing shares. Market Research Analyst The real estate market is cyclical and CTO Realty Growth's decision to issue additional preferred stock may reflect its assessment of the current market phase and capital needs. The timing of such an offering can be critical, as it should ideally occur when investor sentiment towards real estate is positive, ensuring sufficient demand for the new shares. The fact that the Series A Preferred Stock will be listed on the NYSE under 'CTO PrA' provides liquidity for investors, which is a significant factor in the attractiveness of such securities.Market conditions, such as interest rates and real estate trends, will also play a role in the success of the offering. A low-interest-rate environment can make the fixed income from preferred stocks more appealing, while a rising rate environment could have the opposite effect. Additionally, the role of Raymond James & Associates as the book-running manager indicates a level of confidence in the offering, given their expertise in equity offerings. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which allows for a more streamlined process and quicker access to the market. This suggests that CTO has planned for financial flexibility and is executing on that strategy. The legal framework for such offerings requires a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, which provide detailed information about the offering and the company's financials, allowing investors to make informed decisions.It is also important to note that the press release disclaims the offering as constituting an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. This standard legal language is important to comply with the securities laws and avoid regulatory issues. Prospective investors should pay close attention to the terms of the offering and any potential risks outlined in the prospectus supplement. 04/03/2024 - 04:10 PM WINTER PARK, Fla., April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CTO Realty Growth, Inc.

We have encountered similar grades and widths to the Horseshoe orebody, and the Horseshoe Extension target is close to planned future underground development."" ""Results at Didipio continue to extend mineralization at depth and we have now drilled a second hole below the existing resource as a follow-up to last year's drilling. This result extends known mineralization a further ~150 metres at depth into Panel 4, and a total of ~200 metres below the current inferred resource.

Extensional drilling has focused on (a) depth extension of Balut Dyke mineralization on the northern side of the Syenite Porphyry (Figure 3, section A – A'), and (b) depth extension of mineralization within the Monzonite in Panel 4 (Figure 3, section B – B'). Extensional hole RDUG522 was completed to follow up on the previous success of hole RDUG611 (72 m @ 3.40 g/t AuEq) reported in August 2023 (Figure 3, B-B') which has opened up a lower zone of mineralization to the north and at a depth of ~1,900 mRL and below. An intercept returning 87 m @ 1.43 g/t AuEq (RDUG522) has confirmed mineralization extends for over 150 metres further below RDUG611 down to 1,710mRL (Figure 3), opening up a zone of 200 metres vertical extent below the reported Inferred resource. Further drilling will be undertaken in 2024 to define the extent of this new mineralization zone. Hole RDUG523 returned a result of 35 m @ 1.06 g/t AuEq and confirmed a 70 m vertical continuation of the recently identified Balut Dyke on the northern side of the Syenite with similar thickness below previously reported RDUG500 with 45.4 m @ 2.51 g/t AuEq (Figure 3). Mineralization of the Balut on the north remains open along strike and at depth while its analogue defined at a higher elevation on the south also remains open at depth and to be tested to a similar elevation (i.e. 1,900mRL). In addition, hole RDUG627 has identified an additional zone of mineralization further east (Figure 4, F-F') intersecting 15 m @ 3.32 g/t AuEq associated with another Feldspar Porphyry. The recent discovery of three new mineralized intrusives in the east highlights the prospectivity that remains for further mineralized areas. Resource Conversion Drilling Resource Conversion drilling has focused on (i) conversion of the inferred resource within the Monzonite Porphyry directly east of the Syenite Porphyry within Panel 3 (< 2,100 mRL, Figure 4, C-C', D-D'), and (ii) infill drilling of the mineralized Eastern Breccia and Feldspar Porphyry in the east (Figure 4, section E-E' and F-F'). These drill programs broadly confirm and provide improved confidence in the inferred grade estimates as calculated in the end of year 2023 annual resource and reserve model. Follow-up drilling on two mineralized intrusives discovered in 2022 (Eastern Breccia and Feldspar Porphyry) demonstrates continuity of mineralization with both zones remaining open at depth and potentially expanding the mineralized Feldspar Porphyry (Figures 4, E-E', F-F'). Hole RDUG625A has confirmed the continuity of mineralization within the Feldspar Porphyry while holes RDUG626 and RDUG623 appear to have closed off this mineralization to the east. Napartan Exploration Update Regional exploration in 2024 includes advancing the Napartan initial drill target, 9 km north-west of the Didipio mine. Surface mapping and sampling has identified a Cu-Au mineralised pegmatite similar in nature to the Balut Dyke and an important ores source at Didipio. Drilling at Napartan began on March 15, 2024, with one drill rig mobilized. Two holes have now been completed of a 2,500 m program budgeted for 2024, with assay results pending.

About OceanaGoldOceanaGold is a growing intermediate gold and copper producer committed to safely and responsibly maximizing the generation of Free Cash Flow from our operations and delivering strong returns for our shareholders. We have a portfolio of four operating mines: the Haile Gold Mine in the United States of America; Didipio Mine in the Philippines; and the Macraes and Waihi operations in New Zealand. Qualified Person StatementThe exploration results in this press release were prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (""NI 43-101""). Information relating to the Haile and Didipio exploration results in this document have been verified and are based on and fairly represent information compiled by or prepared under the supervision of Craig Feebrey, a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and an employee of OceanaGold. Mr Feebrey has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity being undertaken to qualify as Qualified Persons for the purposes of the NI 43-101. Mr Feebrey consents to the inclusion in this public report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears. QA/QC at Haile Gold MineSince July 2017 all Haile exploration core samples have been prepared at the ALS lab in Tucson, Arizona, and analysed at the ALS lab in Reno, NV. Samples are pulverized from a 450g sample to 85% passing 75 mesh. Approximately 225g of pulp sample is used for fire assay. Assays are based on a 30g fire assay aliquot for gold with Atomic Absorption finish 3g/t Au. Some holes are composited and analysed for carbon, sulphur and multi-elements using LECO and ICP-OES methods. ALS labs used for Haile OceanaGold samples are ISO 17025 certified. Blanks and standards are inserted every 20th sample. Check assays are submitted to the SGS lab in Kershaw, SC for 5% of the intervals each quarter. Assays are duplicated for >95% of the samples within 5% of their original assay. ALS samples show no evidence of contamination or instrument drift. Precision and accuracy of CRMs compared to expected values have been consistently with 5% RSD and often within 3%. Graphs showing expected values and two standards of deviation have been produced and evaluated. Barren marble and sand are inserted as blanks every 20th sample. Certified reference materials from RockLabs are inserted every 20th sample. All blanks and CRMs are handled by the Geotech Supervisor and are stored in the locked OceanaGold office. All drill hole samples are handled and transported from the drill rigs to the secured Haile Exploration warehouse by OceanaGold personnel. Access to the property is controlled by locked doors and cameras monitored by OceanaGold security. The main gate requires an electronic employee badge to enter. Samples are packaged at the Haile Exploration warehouse by the Geotech Supervisor and geotechnicians. Samples are trucked in sealed plastic barrels by certified couriers with submittal forms that are verified during sample pick-up and delivery to ALS. No sample shipments have been recorded as missing or tampered with. QA/QC at Didipio MineExploration diamond core samples at the Didipio Mine are typically drilled with HQ core barrel equipment. The HQ samples are then cut, with half of the core retained at the secure core shed facility on site to which access is controlled. In cases where OceanaGold has collected metallurgical samples, a further quarter of the core has been taken with only one-quarter core retained. Following core cutting, the half-core sample is submitted for analysis. Since 2013, all OceanaGold samples have been processed on-site at a laboratory facility operated by SGS Philippines Inc (""SGS""). SGS is independent from OceanaGold. After dispatching to SGS, samples are dried at 105 degrees C for 8 to 12 hours, allowed to cool, and then weighed. Within the sample assay workflow, the SGS lab randomly inserts laboratory duplicate and replicate samples as well as certified reference materials (""CRM"") for quality control (""QC"") monitoring. Samples are crushed to produce 500g to 1000g of material for the primary analysis and any lab duplicates. The remaining coarse reject material is retained during the assay process. The sample (and any lab duplicates) are then pulverized to 75% passing 2mm, followed by a subsequent pulverizing to 85% passing 75um. The primary sample is then split down to 200g (with an additional 200g for replicate sampling when applicable). A scoop of 30g is then taken from the 200g sample with the remaining pulp retained. Gold analysis is by Fire Assay with AAS finish. Copper analysis is either by AAS on a 3-acid digest or XRF. These methods are considered appropriate for the type of mineralisation and expected grade tenor. The quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, and geochemical data collected in the exploration, surface resource delineation, underground resource delineation, and grade control drill programs are considered sufficient to support the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves estimation. In addition to the internal SGS QC controls, OceanaGold also monitors laboratory performance with the following processes: inserting duplicate samples; inserting CRM blanks and coarse blanks; inserting CRM standards for Au, Cu, Ag; and monthly monitoring of SGS duplicate, replicate, and CRM performance. SGS is currently certified to ISO 9001, 14001, and 45001. The ISO 17025:2017 accreditation preparation of SGS - Didipio Laboratory is ongoing as SGS works through the reaccreditation process with the Philippines Accreditation Bureau. Whilst this process is being undertaken, SGS – Didipio Laboratory has ensured its operation is aligned with the ISO 17025:2017 standards as supported by the satisfactory results of the 2023 audit conducted by the SGS internal auditors. All the results included in this summary were validated through the independent QC monitoring by both the SGS - Didipio Laboratory and OceanaGold with the insertion of duplicate, replicate, and blank samples, as well as CRM with no issues noted.

The petitions address unfairly traded imports and significant subsidies provided to foreign producers. The U.S. producers, including Olin, emphasize the importance of domestic epoxy production for critical U.S. industries and supply chain resiliency. Positive None. Negative None. Trade Policy Analyst The filing of antidumping and countervailing duty petitions by Olin Corporation against imports from five countries is a strategic move to protect its domestic market share and pricing power. Antidumping duties serve to counteract the sale of goods below market value, a practice that can distort market prices and harm domestic industries. The alleged dumping margins, particularly the 264.87% to 351.97% range for China, indicate a significant disparity between the prices of imported and domestically produced epoxy resins. If these petitions result in the imposition of duties, we could see a shift in the competitive landscape, with Ulin Corporation and other U.S. producers potentially regaining pricing control and market share.From a trade policy perspective, this action underscores the ongoing global trade tensions and the use of trade defense instruments as a means to protect local industries. The impact on the stock market could be multifaceted. On the one hand, investors might view the potential imposition of duties as a positive development for Olin's profitability and thus for its stock price. On the other hand, there could be concerns about retaliatory measures from the affected countries, which might affect not only Olin but also other sectors involved in international trade. Chemical Industry Analyst Epoxy resins are critical components in several industries and their availability directly affects the supply chain of sectors such as aerospace and automotive. The petitions highlight the importance of domestic production for U.S. industry resilience and compliance with domestic preference requirements. For stakeholders, the long-term benefit could be a more stable and predictable supply chain, less dependent on imports that can be subject to trade disputes and tariffs.However, imposing duties could also lead to increased costs for downstream industries that rely on these inputs, potentially leading to higher prices for end consumers. It's important to monitor how these industries would adapt, whether through sourcing from alternative suppliers or passing costs onto consumers. For investors, the focus should be on evaluating Olin's ability to capitalize on these protective measures and the potential for increased market share and margins, balanced against the risk of increased production costs and the possibility of international retaliation affecting broader market conditions. Financial Analyst The announcement by Olin Corporation is likely to have a direct impact on its financial performance. By seeking relief under U.S. law, Olin aims to mitigate the negative effects of what it perceives as unfairly traded imports on its production, sales and earnings. The imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties could lead to increased revenue and profitability for Olin and other domestic producers by reducing competition from low-priced imports.Investors should closely watch the Commerce Department and USITC's decisions, as favorable rulings could mean a significant upside for Olin's stock. Nonetheless, they should also consider the broader economic implications, such as potential inflationary pressures from higher input costs for industries reliant on epoxy resins. The long-term outlook will depend on the final determinations of the petitions and the ability of domestic producers to meet demand without significant price increases. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM CLAYTON, Mo., April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Olin Corporation (NYSE: OLN) today announced the filing of antidumping and countervailing duty petitions against five countries related to certain epoxy resins, as part of the U.S. Epoxy Resin Producers Ad Hoc Coalition. The petitions charge that unfairly traded imports of certain epoxy resins from China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand are causing material injury to the domestic epoxy resin industry. The petitions further charge that significant subsidies have been provided to the foreign producers by the governments of China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. The U.S. producers in the Coalition, including Olin, produce epoxy resins, an essential component for which there are no practical substitutes, for various customer applications, including critical U.S. industries such as Aerospace, Automotive, Defense, Electrical Transmission, Semiconductors, and Wind Energy. Having domestically produced epoxy resins is vital to ensuring that the U.S. manufacturing industry is capable of meeting domestic preference requirements contained in important U.S. legislation like The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act. The availability of domestic epoxy production is also important to ensure U.S. industry has supply chain resiliency. ""We have been facing a significant volume of what we believe are unfairly dumped and subsidized imports of epoxy resin into this country,"" said Florian Kohl, President, Olin Epoxy. ""These unfairly traded imports have seriously impacted pricing in the U.S. market, which has resulted in a significant negative effect on our production, sales, and earnings. Without relief under U.S. law, unfairly traded imports will undermine the sustainability of U.S. producers and the welfare of their workers and local communities."" The petitions were filed today with the U.S. Department of Commerce (""Commerce Department"") and the U.S. International Trade Commission (""USITC""). The five countries covered by the antidumping petitions and the dumping margins alleged by the domestic industry are as follows: COUNTRY DUMPING MARGINS ALLEGED China 264.87% - 351.97% India 11.43% - 17.50% South Korea 30.01% - 69.42% Taiwan 87.19% - 136.02% Thailand 163.94% - 205.63% The petitions also allege that the foreign producers benefit from numerous countervailable subsidies. The petitions were filed in response to large volumes of low-priced imports of epoxy resins from the subject countries over the past three years that have injured the domestic epoxy resin producers. The petitions allege that producers in the subject countries have injured the U.S. epoxy resin producers by selling their products at unfairly low prices that significantly undercut the prices of U.S. producers. As a result, imports of epoxy resins have captured an increasing share of the U.S. market at the direct expense of the U.S. industry. The price declines that U.S. producers have suffered are likely to continue if duties are not imposed to level the playing field. Antidumping duties are intended to offset the amount by which a product is sold at less than fair value, or ""dumped,"" in the United States. The margin of dumping is calculated by the Commerce Department. Estimated duties in the amount of the dumping are collected from importers at the time of importation. Countervailing duties are intended to offset unfair subsidies that are provided by foreign governments and benefit the production of a particular good. The USITC, an independent agency, will determine whether the domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the unfairly traded imports.

Merk Investments waives a portion of its advisory fee in response to a proxy contest initiated by Saba Capital Management, L.P. Positive The Company declared a distribution of $0.02 per common share payable on May 16, 2024, representing a $0.01 increase from the previous rate. Merk Investments voluntarily waived a portion of its advisory fee in recognition of the expenses incurred due to a proxy contest initiated by Saba Capital Management, L.P. The Company has paid uninterrupted distributions since 1959 and employs bottom-up fundamental analysis for investment decisions. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in distribution from $0.01 to $0.02 per common share by ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited is a notable change for shareholders, effectively doubling the previous rate. This adjustment suggests that the company is experiencing positive cash flow or a strategic shift to enhance shareholder value. It also signifies a consistent commitment to returning value to shareholders, as evidenced by the uninterrupted distribution since 1959. The implications for investors are twofold: there is the immediate benefit of increased income from the distribution and there is also the potential for this to be a positive signal about the company's financial health and future prospects.Furthermore, the voluntary fee waiver by Merk Investments LLC points to a strategic partnership between the investment adviser and ASA, aimed at mitigating the financial impact of extraordinary expenses due to the ongoing proxy contest with Saba Capital. This move may be perceived favorably by investors, as it demonstrates Merk's alignment with shareholder interests and its commitment to the fund's performance despite external challenges. Market Research Analyst ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited's focus on precious metals and minerals is of particular interest given the current economic climate. Precious metals often serve as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, which could be driving increased investor interest in such funds. The company's bottom-up fundamental analysis and primary research approach indicate a thorough and potentially more reliable investment strategy, which could be attractive to investors seeking exposure to the commodities market.The announcement of the distribution increase and fee waiver might also reflect broader industry trends where funds are seeking to differentiate themselves and attract investors through both performance and cost-efficiency. This could lead to competitive responses from other funds in the sector, potentially benefiting investors through improved terms and returns across the industry. Tax Advisor The classification of ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited as a 'passive foreign investment company' (PFIC) has significant implications for U.S. shareholders. The PFIC status affects the taxation of distributions and gains from the sale of shares. Investors in PFICs may be subject to different tax rates or additional reporting requirements. The company's encouragement for shareholders to consult with tax advisors suggests that these tax consequences could be complex and materially impact the net benefit of the investment. Shareholders should consider the tax implications of the increased distribution in the context of the PFIC rules to understand the actual after-tax return on their investment. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM PORTLAND, Maine--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited (the “Company”) (NYSE: ASA) announced today that it has declared a distribution of $0.02 per common share of the Company payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record of the Company’s common shares as of the close of business on May 6, 2024. This distribution represents a $0.01 per common share increase in the Company’s distribution, doubling the rate per share that has been paid on a semi-annual basis since November 2018. The Company has paid periodic distributions on an uninterrupted basis since 1959. In addition, the Company announced that Merk Investments LLC (“Merk”), the investment adviser for the Company, has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its advisory fee, equal to an annual rate of 0.05% of the Company’s managed net assets exceeding $100 million and less than $300 million, effective for the period April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025. Merk is making this voluntary waiver in recognition of the extraordinary expenses being borne by the Company as a result of a proxy contest initiated by Saba Capital Management, L.P. (“Saba Capital”) to replace the Company’s Board of Directors, as initially disclosed by Saba Capital in its 13D filing of December 5, 2023, and subsequent public filings. This voluntary waiver is separate from, and in addition to, Merk’s ongoing waiver arrangement. Since December 1, 2020, Merk has continued to waive a portion of its advisory fee equal to an annual rate of 0.05% of the Company’s managed net assets exceeding $300 million, and an additional 0.10% of the Company’s managed net assets exceeding $500 million.

This investment builds on their previous partnership and aims to enhance technology solutions for agricultural producers worldwide.","Lindsay Announces Agreement to Acquire a Minority Interest in Pessl Instruments Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Lindsay (NYSE: LNN) has agreed to acquire a 49.9% minority interest in Pessl Instruments GmbH, a global provider of advanced agricultural technology solutions. This investment builds on their previous partnership and aims to enhance technology solutions for agricultural producers worldwide. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Lindsay Corporation's investment in Pessl Instruments represents a strategic maneuver to solidify its position in the agricultural technology sector. This move is indicative of a trend where traditional equipment manufacturers are increasingly integrating digital solutions to enhance their product offerings. By acquiring a significant minority stake, Lindsay not only secures a foothold in advanced IoT and AI-driven farming solutions but also lays the groundwork for future full ownership.The potential benefits for Lindsay include diversification of revenue streams, access to a broader customer base and enhanced product differentiation through technology. The synergy between Lindsay's irrigation expertise and Pessl's data-driven agronomic tools could lead to innovative solutions that cater to the growing demand for precision agriculture, optimizing resource use and crop yields. However, the success of this investment will depend on effective integration and the ability to realize the complementary capabilities of both companies. Agricultural Technology Expert The collaboration between Lindsay and Pessl Instruments is a significant development in precision agriculture, an industry that's rapidly adopting IoT and AI technologies. The integration of METOS® hardware with Lindsay's FieldNET® platform could lead to more sophisticated, data-driven farming practices. Real-time agronomic data is vital for making informed decisions that can improve crop health, yield and resource efficiency.The investment could accelerate the adoption of smart irrigation systems, which is critical for sustainability in agriculture. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that these advanced tools are user-friendly and accessible to farmers globally, including those in developing regions. The long-term impact on Lindsay's business will hinge on the scalability of these solutions and their adoption rate among growers. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the minority stake acquisition by Lindsay Corporation in Pessl Instruments is a strategic investment aimed at growth and market expansion. Given the increasing importance of sustainable agriculture and efficient resource management, this partnership could position Lindsay to capitalize on these megatrends. The investment is likely to be viewed positively by shareholders due to the potential for product innovation and market share gain.However, it's important to monitor how the capital outlay for the acquisition impacts Lindsay's balance sheet and whether the expected synergies translate into tangible financial performance improvements. Investors should look for increased revenue contributions from technology solutions and potential cost savings from operational efficiencies as indicators of the investment's success. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM Strategic investment builds on previously announced partnership and will enhance Lindsay’s and Pessl’s leading technology solutions for agricultural producers around the globe OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lindsay Corporation (NYSE: LNN), a leading global manufacturer and distributor of irrigation and infrastructure equipment and technology, today announced it has agreed to acquire a 49.9 percent minority interest in Austria-based Pessl Instruments GmbH, with an option to acquire the remainder of the company at a later date. Pessl is a leading global provider of advanced agricultural technology solutions under the METOS® brand and offers IoT hardware and software tools for informed decision-making, including field monitoring systems with a wide array of agronomic data points that inform Lindsay’s award-winning FieldNET® remote irrigation management platform. This investment by Lindsay comes less than a year after the two companies had initially entered into a strategic partnership, announced in May of 2023, to leverage the combined expertise of both companies and expand value enhancement to growers. Pessl boasts more than 80,000 connected in-field data collection devices globally, with 50,000 active customers using its FieldClimate online interface. These connected devices include weather stations, soil moisture probes, insect monitoring traps, crop monitoring cameras, soil and nutrient sampling, machine and asset trackers, and other sensors providing real-time data on key agronomic health indicators. Coupled with Lindsay’s FieldNET Advisor™ platform, which synthesizes millions of data points to make custom recommendations to growers for precise, efficient water application, METOS® and FieldNET® provide a leading-edge solution that opens the door for ground-breaking future innovations in the utilization of artificial intelligence in agriculture, grounded in measurable, precise, and instantaneous data validation. “Lindsay remains committed to providing world-class solutions to growers around the globe while also delivering incredible value for our shareholders,” said Randy Wood, President and CEO of Lindsay. “This investment broadens and strengthens our existing partnership with Pessl, accelerating innovations in water management, increasing our global reach, and providing new solutions needed to conserve natural resources and expand our world’s potential. I’m excited to see how our teams work together to revolutionize the way data is used to inform smart decisions and to maximize our world’s precious resources.” The investment will strengthen both Lindsay’s and Pessl’s leadership positions in key global markets, enabling Pessl to benefit from Lindsay’s leading position in row crop applications and Lindsay to benefit from Pessl’s leading position in specialty crop applications. Last year, the two organizations announced a strategic partnership that has already revealed synergistic potential to unlock incremental value and problem-solving solutions for agricultural producers worldwide. This formal investment will make Lindsay and Pessl, together, the clear global in-field connected irrigation device leader. Gottfried Pessl, CEO & Founder of Pessl, shared “Over the last year, we have had the opportunity to connect with farmers worldwide and demonstrate how they can leverage the combined potential of METOS hardware and software solutions and Lindsay’s suite of agtech products. The feedback has been fantastic, and the results speak for themselves.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. reported financial results for the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2024, showing a decrease in net sales and gross profit. The Company aims to focus on returning to profitability in 2024, with expectations for net sales and adjusted EBITDA. Despite challenges, efforts to control costs and reduce excess inventory have been successful. Positive Successful reduction of excess inventory and improved inventory position. Efforts to control costs and reduce excess inventory led to free cash flow generation. Decrease in net sales due to lower sales demand from consumer inflationary pressures and recession concerns. Lower overall product margins attributed to aggressive promotional activity to reduce distressed inventory. Increased SG&A expenses primarily due to higher depreciation and rent expenses from new store openings. Net loss reported for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023, compared to net income in the previous year periods. Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share also decreased compared to the prior year. Expectations for net sales and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, with focus on returning to profitability. No new store openings anticipated for 2024, with capital expenditures primarily for technology investments. Company's net debt, inventory, and total liquidity figures highlighted as of February 3, 2024. Negative Decrease in net sales and gross profit for the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2024. Significant decline in same store sales for both periods. Increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net loss reported for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share also decreased compared to the prior year. Challenging macroeconomic environment affecting financial results. Uncertainty in reconciling expected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024 to GAAP net income. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Sportsman's Warehouse indicate a challenging period for the company, marked by a decline in net sales and profitability. The reduced consumer demand, influenced by inflation and recession concerns, has led to a notable 2.3% decrease in net sales for the fourth quarter and an 8.0% decrease for the fiscal year. This is a significant trend as net sales are a primary revenue driver for retail companies. The strategic decision to open 15 new stores, while contributing to a marginal increase in SG&A expenses, did not offset the sales decline, reflecting a tough retail environment.The gross profit margin reduction, particularly in the ammunition, apparel and footwear categories, underscores the competitive pressures and the need for promotional activities to manage inventory levels. This strategy, while necessary, impacts margins and profitability. Investors should be aware of the long-term sustainability of such practices. The company’s focus on cost control and inventory management, leading to free cash flow generation and debt reduction, is a positive step. However, the net loss for both the quarter and fiscal year compared to net income in the previous year raises questions about the company's ability to navigate the current economic headwinds. Market Research Analyst The report provides insight into the consumer behavior shift in the face of economic pressures. The significant decrease in same store sales, by 12.8% on a 13-week comparable basis, indicates a substantial drop in store traffic and purchasing frequency. This reflects a broader trend where consumers are prioritizing essential purchases over discretionary spending in outdoor and recreational activities. The company's strategic pivot to improve the in-store experience and merchandising could be a move to differentiate and capture customer loyalty in a competitive landscape.Looking ahead, the company's decision to halt new store openings and focus on technology investments for merchandising and store productivity suggests a shift towards operational efficiency and enhanced customer experience. This could potentially improve inventory turnover and sales per square foot, important metrics for retail success. However, the forecasted net sales for fiscal year 2024 indicate a conservative outlook, potentially factoring in continued economic challenges. Retail Industry Expert The retail sector, particularly for specialty stores like Sportsman's Warehouse, is highly sensitive to economic cycles. The company's efforts in resetting organizational focus to enhance customer experience aligns with industry best practices. However, the reported financials emphasize the need for a robust strategy to combat the declining trend in same store sales and overall profitability. The company's inventory position at the end of the year, although healthier, will require continued optimization to align with consumer demand and avoid overstocking, which can lead to additional markdowns and margin erosion.The capital allocation towards technology investments rather than new store openings is indicative of a strategic shift within the retail industry towards digital transformation and omni-channel retailing. The absence of new store openings may also suggest a cautious approach to expansion in an uncertain economic climate. The emphasis on generating EBITDA and excess free cash flow will be important for the company's ability to reduce debt and finance its growth initiatives without over-leveraging. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM WEST JORDAN, Utah, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. (“Sportsman's Warehouse” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPWH) today announced financial results for the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2024, which includes an extra week compared with the prior year period. “Despite lower than expected fourth quarter sales, we were successful in reducing our excess inventory and ended the fiscal year in a significantly healthier inventory position,” said Paul Stone, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. “Our efforts to control costs and reduce excess inventory allowed us to generate free cash flow and exceed our internal debt reduction targets. These efforts, combined with more efficient inventory purchasing, will allow us to deliver the merchandise our customers need and expect for their outdoor adventures.” Mr. Stone continued, “Our initial efforts in 2024 have been focused on resetting the organization to provide our passionate customers a positive in-store experience. This fundamental strategy includes great merchandising, exceptional service, and investing in the necessary tools, people and processes to regain our edge as the local outdoor retailer of choice. Our team is energized around these key initiatives and the direction we are headed. We are confident that centering our efforts on providing our passionate customers with great gear and exceptional service in our stores is the foundation that will ultimately allow us to achieve our primary goal: returning the business to profitability and growth.” For the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2024: Net sales were $370.4 million, a decrease of 2.3%, compared to $379.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. The net sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales demand from consumer inflationary pressures and recession concerns, partially offset by the opening of 15 new stores over the last year and $15.4 million from the additional week of sales. Same store sales decreased 12.8% on a 13-week comparable basis, compared with the prior year fourth quarter.Gross profit was $99.4 million or 26.8% of net sales, compared to $122.8 million or 32.4% of net sales in the comparable prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to lower overall product margins due to aggressive promotional activity to reduce distressed inventory, primarily in our clothing and footwear categories.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $107.3 million or 29.0% of net sales, compared to $106.7 million or 28.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to higher depreciation and rent expenses from the opening of 15 new stores in 2023, mainly offset by a decrease in overall payroll expenses and reduced marketing spend.Net loss was $(8.7) million, compared to net income of $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Adjusted net loss was $(7.5) million compared to adjusted net income of $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”).Adjusted EBITDA was $5.3 million, compared to $28.2 million in the comparable prior year period (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”).Diluted loss per share was $(0.23) compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.29 in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $(0.20) compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the comparable prior year period (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”). For the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2024: Net sales were $1,288.0 million, compared with $1,399.5 million or a decrease of 8.0% compared to fiscal year 2022. Excluding the extra week, net sales in fiscal 2023 were $1,272.6 million. The Company’s net sales decreased primarily from the continued impact of consumer inflationary pressures and recessionary concerns on discretionary spending, resulting in a decline in store traffic and lower sales demand across all product categories. These headwinds were partially offset by the Company’s opening of 15 new stores during fiscal year 2023.Same store sales decreased 14.4% during fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, excluding the extra week of sales in fiscal 2023. This decrease was due to lower sales in all product categories.Gross profit was $383.4 million or 29.8% of net sales, as compared to $460.2 million or 32.9% of net sales for fiscal year 2022. These decreases were primarily driven by reduced product margins in our ammunition category within our Hunting and Shooting department, lower margins in our Apparel and Footwear departments, resulting from our increased promotional efforts to reduce inventory and decreases in net and same store sales.SG&A expenses increased to $408.8 million or 31.7% of net sales, compared with $402.2 million or 28.7% of net sales for fiscal year 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and rent expenses due to the addition of 15 new stores, partially offset by lower total payroll and other operating expenses.Net loss was $(29.0) million compared to net income of $40.5 million in fiscal year 2022. Adjusted net loss was $(24.1) million compared to adjusted net income of $43.0 million in fiscal year 2022 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”).Adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million compared to $97.9 million in fiscal year 2022 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”).Diluted loss per share was $(0.77) for fiscal year 2023, compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.00 in fiscal year 2022. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $(0.64) for fiscal year 2023 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.06 in fiscal year 2022 (see “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures”). Balance sheet and capital allocation highlights as of February 3, 2024: The Company ended the year with net debt of $122.9 million, comprised of $3.1 million of cash on hand and $126.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of the year was $354.7 million.Total liquidity was $91.4 million as of the end of fiscal year 2023, comprised of $88.3 million of availability on the revolving credit facility and $3.1 million of cash on hand. 2024 Outlook: During 2024, the Company will be providing guidance on an annual basis, versus its past cadence of quarterly guidance, as it focuses its efforts on returning to profitability. For fiscal year 2024, the Company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.23 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million. The Company also expects capital expenditures for 2024 to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million, primarily consisting of technology investments relating to merchandising and store productivity. No new store openings are currently anticipated. The Company has not reconciled expected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024 to GAAP net income because the Company does not provide guidance for net (loss) income and is not able to provide a reconciliation to net (loss) income without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to estimate net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Jeff White, Chief Financial Officer of Sportsman’s Warehouse said, “Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to generate significant EBITDA and excess free cash flow in 2024 while at the same time investing in our business. During the fourth quarter we used our excess cash flow to reduce our line of credit by $59.4 million. Our continued focus on tightly managing our inventory, as well as costs throughout the organization, will allow us to further reduce our bank borrowings, and in doing so, reduce our interest expense.” Conference Call Information: A conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results is scheduled for April 3, 2024, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The conference call will be webcast and may be accessed via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sportsmans.com. Non-GAAP Information This press release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”): adjusted net (loss) income, adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines adjusted net (loss) income as net (loss) income plus expenses incurred relating to executive transition costs, costs related to the implementation of our cost reduction plan and a one-time legal settlement and related fees and expenses. The Company defines adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, a one-time legal settlement and related fees and expenses, costs related to the implementation of our cost reduction plan and executive transition costs. Beginning with the three months ended October 28, 2023, the Company no longer adds back new store pre-opening expenses to net (loss) income to determine Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of past periods has been conformed to the current presentation. Net (loss) income is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA. The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures under “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures” in this release. As noted above, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of fiscal year 2024 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts, exception provided under Item 10I(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors and are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of the Company’s business and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of its diluted (loss) earnings per share and actual results on a period-over-period basis. The Company has provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of its ongoing operations and uses these additional measurement tools for purposes of business decision-making, including evaluating store performance, developing budgets and managing expenditures. Other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these items differently than the Company does. Each of these measures is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results, cash flows or leverage will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements in this release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our ability to deliver merchandise our customers need and expect for their outdoor adventures; our ability to achieve our goal to return the business to profitability and growth; our ability to reduce our bank borrowing; and our guidance for adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditure for fiscal year 2024. Investors can identify these statements by the fact that they use words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “can have,” “could,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “positioned,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar terms and phrases. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and our management’s beliefs and assumptions. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that predicting the impact of known factors is very difficult, and we cannot anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. The Company cannot assure investors that future developments affecting the Company will be those that it has anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to many factors including, but not limited to: current and future government regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition, which may impact the supply and demand for the Company’s products and ability to conduct its business; the Company’s retail-based business model which is impacted by general economic and market conditions and economic, market and financial uncertainties that may cause a decline in consumer spending; the Company’s concentration of stores in the Western United States which makes the Company susceptible to adverse conditions in this region, and could affect the Company’s sales and cause the Company’s operating results to suffer; the highly fragmented and competitive industry in which the Company operates and the potential for increased competition; changes in consumer demands, including regional preferences, which we may not be able to identify and respond to in a timely manner; the Company’s entrance into new markets or operations in existing markets, including the Company’s plans to open additional stores in future periods, which may not be successful; the Company’s implementation of a plan to reduce expenses in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions; impact of general macroeconomic conditions, such as labor shortages, inflation, rising interest rates, economic slowdowns, and recessions or market corrections ; and other factors that are set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 13, 2023, and the Company’s other public filings made with the SEC and available at www.sec.gov. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, the Company’s actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this release speaks only as of the date on which the Company makes it. Factors or events that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws.

(the “Company” or “Starco Brands”) (OTCQB: STCB), developer and acquirer of behavior-changing technologies and brands that spark excitement in the everyday, is providing a business update in conjunction with the filing of its form 10-K for the full year ended December 31, 2023. *Company completed the acquisition of Soylent in February 2023 Management Comments Starco Brands Chairman & CEO Ross Sklar said: “I’m very proud of our team’s success over the past year as we focused on integrating our three acquired brands, continued to grow our in-house Whipshots and Winona brands, and focused on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives across our platform. During the year, we advanced our growth initiatives, adding new points of distribution, launching new products and continuing to execute very successful innovative and experiential marketing campaigns. Our full year results demonstrate the success of this growth strategy with impressive top-and bottom-line growth and margins over 40%. We successfully tested our brand-building playbook this past year growing our three acquired brands and feel confident heading into 2024 that we will be able to deliver another year of profitable operating growth as we advance our goal to be a 21st-century consumer packaged goods powerhouse.” Business Highlights Starco Brands In June 2023, the Company increased prices throughout the portfolio, which generated $2 million in annual revenue growth from its existing distribution base, and reduced headcount due to synergies realized from integrating acquisitions, resulting in $1.2 million of annualized savings. Skylar In December 2022, the Company acquired Skylar, a pioneer in prestige hypoallergenic fragrances distributed online and through Sephora, Nordstrom and others. Skylar is a tremendous brand among Millennials and has historically achieved very high gross margins, exceeding 70% in 2023. Unprecedented Growth – Over the past year, Starco Brands has successfully transformed Skylar into a profitable entity, substantially enhancing Skylar’s revenue and contributing positively to its synergized adjusted EBITDA. The year-over-year growth was driven by innovative marketing strategies, optimized marketing spend, strategic headcount adjustments, and robust sales growth. Strategic Retail Partnerships – Skylar’s enhanced collaborations with retail giants Amazon and Sephora played a pivotal role in driving sales in 2023. These partnerships were strengthened through exclusive product launches, which created a buzz and attracted many customers to these platforms. Skylar worked closely with these retailers to develop targeted marketing campaigns tailored to each platform’s unique customer base. These targeted campaigns were supported by in-store promotions and online marketing efforts, creating a cohesive and compelling shopping experience for customers. The result was a significant increase in sales, demonstrating the power of strategic retail partnerships in expanding market reach and driving revenue growth. Innovation and Product Expansion – In June 2023, Skylar’s Boardwalk Delight eau de parfum launched and sold out at Sephora in 10 days, becoming the brand’s most popular introduction to date. This fragrance marked Skylar’s third new fragrance in 2023, and the brand’s tenth scent offered across more than 500 Sephora retail locations and online. In September 2023, the Company expanded Skylar’s most popular scents into a new category: Hair & Body Mists. The new product line launched on Sephora.com in September and rolled out to Sephora stores in October 2023. In February 2024, the Company rolled out the Hair & Body Mist format of its popular Boardwalk Delight to skylar.com and sephora.com, as well as Sephora brick-and-mortar retail locations. Soylent In February 2023, the Company acquired complete nutrition pioneer Soylent, maker of meal replacement drinks, high protein beverages, powders and bars. Soylent’s largest shareholders at the time of acquisition included Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and The Production Board. This high-tech food play positions the Company to capitalize on the projected growth of the “better for you” supplements and the plant-based nutrition space. Impressive Distribution Milestones – In March 2023, the Company expanded Soylent’s distribution at Meijer to offer plant-based nutrition shakes in 260 stores. In July 2023, Starco Brands expanded Soylent’s retail distribution throughout Canada through a partnership with grocery wholesaler United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI). This expansion included Soylent’s first entry into brick-and-mortar retail at Longos, Thrifty’s and select Sobeys. Innovation and Flavor Expansion – In July 2023, Soylent added a new flavor – Complete Protein Vanilla – to its best-selling High Protein Shake product lineup. The new flavor launched on Soylent.com and Amazon.com in July and rolled out to Walmart and Meijer in August 2023. Whipshots® Impressive Sales and Distribution Milestones – Since the Whipshots introduction to retail stores in February 2022, the product has consistently exceeded sales expectations, selling, on average, over a quarter of a million cans monthly and has surpassed five million cans sold in two years of retail availability, a testament to its nationwide appeal. Whipshots has continued to grow distribution and velocity and the product is now available online and across the nation in 41 states, plus the District of Columbia. Key retailers include ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, Albertsons, BevMo, Fry’s, Jewel-Osco, Meijer, Ralphs, Safeway, Total Wine & More, and select Kroger and Walmart locations. In 2023, Whipshots achieved more than 58,000 points of distribution, marking a 125% increase compared to 2022. Record-Breaking Shipments – Shipments in 2023 surged past 230,000 cases, marking a 73% increase over the prior year. Innovation and Flavor Expansion – Initially three flavors of Whipshots were introduced to the market – Vanilla, Mocha and Caramel. In November 2022, May 2023, August 2023 and January 2024, the Company introduced new Limited Time seasonal flavors – Peppermint, Lime, Pumpkin Spice and Strawberry. Each new release boosted sales of the Limited Time seasonal flavor as well as the core Whipshots flavors. The Company plans to continue to expand Whipshots Limited Time flavors with its R&D capabilities and is also looking to expand its core flavors. Strategic Partnerships and Marketing Campaigns – In June 2023, Whipshots announced a partnership with AMC, the nation’s largest move theatre chain, that includes distribution of its Whipshots at bars within AMC and brand awareness marketing support on the big screen during previews. In November 2023, Whipshots announced a holiday marketing campaign with Patti’s Good Life, Patti Labelle’s food and lifestyle brand, that garnered over 2 billion earned media impressions within the first four days. In January 2024, Whipshots announced a nationwide partnership at Museum of Ice Cream’s three US locations in Austin, Chicago and New York to celebrate the launch of its limited-edition Strawberry flavor. Winona Pure® Popcorn Spray Continued Revenue Growth – In 2023, Winona Pure more than doubled its revenue compared to the prior year. This sustained, significant growth underscores the brand’s escalating popularity and solid position in the market as a must-have product for popcorn enthusiasts. Impressive Distribution Expansion – In 2023, Winona Pure significantly expanded distribution nationally at Walmart by approximately 1,700 stores, growing from 2,500 to 4,200 doors. Winona is available at walmart.com and in approximately 99% of U.S. Walmart stores, indicating consistent sales velocity across all regions. Also in 2023, Winona Pure launched it distribution with Meijer and H-E-B grocery stores This partnership introduced Winona Pure to nearly 200 Meijer and more than 300 H-E-B store locations. The product has grown through consistent and sustained repeat purchases despite minimal marketing expenditure, evidencing its ability to successfully change consumer behavior. Fourth Quarter of 2023 Financial Results Reported net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $18.9 million, compared to $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in reported net revenue was primarily driven by sales from the Company’s recent strategic acquisitions: Soylent, acquired in February of 2023; Skylar, acquired in December of 2022; and AOS, acquired in September of 2022. The year-over-year increase was also driven by growth in royalty revenues from the Whipshots business. Whipshots royalty revenue increased by 12% to $3.6 million versus the prior year fourth quarter. In addition, the Company recognized revenue for Winona Pure on a royalty-basis in the prior year period before making an accounting change in March of 2023 to move away from royalty-based income to standard revenue and cost of goods recognition. Gross profit improved to $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the Company’s acquisition activity compared to prior year as well as increased revenue from Whipshots. Marketing, General and Administrative expenses were $7.4 million, or 39% of reported net revenue in the fourth of 2023, compared to $1.1 million, or 27% of reported net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by the addition of the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Compensation expense was $10.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation increasing by $9.1 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year due to recognition of equity issued for Whipshots for non-controlling interest party. Professional fees were $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven primarily by the addition of the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $41.1 million, as compared to net income of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The change from net income to net loss is due to a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $29.6 million, primarily related to the Soylent segment; and an increase in stock compensation expenses related to Whipshots non controlling interest as well as additional expenses from the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Reported net revenue for the full year of 2023 was $65.2 million, compared to $7.8 million for the full year of 2022. Net revenue for the full year of 2023 would have been $70.8 million had the company owned Soylent as of January 1, 2023. The Company acquired the brand in February of 2023. The increase in reported net revenue was primarily driven by sales from the company’s recent three strategic acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was also driven by growth in royalty revenues from the Whipshots business. Whipshots royalty revenue increased by 81% to $11.7 million versus the prior year. In addition, the Company recognized revenue for Winona Pure on a royalty-basis in the prior year period before making an accounting change in March of 2023 to move away from royalty-based income to standard revenue and cost of goods recognition. Gross profit improved to $27.8 million for the full year of 2023, as compared to $7.0 million for the full year of 2022 due to the Company’s acquisition activity during that time frame. Marketing, General and Administrative expenses for the full year of 2023 increased to $21.6 million, or 33% of reported net revenue, compared to $2.8 million, or 35% of reported net revenue for the full year of 2022. The increase was driven by the addition of the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Compensation expense was $15.9 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $1.2 million for the full year of 2022. The increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation increasing by $9.8 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year due to recognition of equity issued for Whipshots for non-controlling interest party. Professional fees were $5.9 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $1.8 million for the full year of 2022. The increase was driven by the addition of the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Reported net loss for the full year of 2023 was $46.4 million, as compared to net income of $1.0 million for the full year of 2022. The change from net income to net loss is due to a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $29.6 million, primarily related to the Soylent segment; a non cash stock compensation related to Whipshots from a non controlling interest; and an increase in expenses from the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, which is net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, gain on disposal of property and equipment, gain on settlements, interest and other expense, net, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, (recovery) provision for doubtful accounts, and provision for income taxes and certain other items that impact the periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same financial data that management uses to assess the Company’s operating results with the belief that it will assist the investment community in properly assessing the ongoing performance of the Company for the periods being reported and future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and is defined differently by different companies, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see our reports we file from time-to-time with the SEC, which are available to read at www.sec.gov. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $6.2 million for the full year of 2023, compared to approximately $1.7 million for the full year of 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to improving profitability of Skylar and AOS, as well as gross profit growth due to volume gains on Whipshots. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the supplementary schedules in this press release for a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Segment gross profit of $12.4 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $0.8 million for the full year of 2022. Starco Brands’ segment includes AOS, Whipshots Holdings and Whipshots LLC and Winona Pure. The Company recognized revenue for Winona Pure on a royalty-basis in the prior year before making an accounting change in March of 2023 to move away from royalty-based income to standard revenue and cost of goods recognition. Skylar: Segment reported net revenues of $10.7 million and gross profit of $7.9 million for the full year of 2023. Soylent: Segment reported net revenues of $38.2 million and gross profit of $7.5 million for 2023. The Company does not report results for Soylent for the full year of 2023 as Soylent was not a subsidiary of the Company until the acquisition of Soylent on February 15, 2023. 2024 Outlook The Company continues to project between $78 million to $82 million in reported net revenue for fiscal year 2024, representing 19% to 26% growth compared to fiscal year 2023. The Company continues to project between $8 million to $10 million (approximately 10% to 12% of reported net revenue) in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, representing 29% to 61% growth compared to fiscal year 2023.

Expansion of digital PCR technology for IVD testing with the QIAcuity system. Positive feedback from researchers and potential applications in cancer detection and treatment monitoring. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of QIAcuity dPCR PanCancer Kits by QIAGEN represents a significant advancement in the field of oncology research. The ability to detect rare mutations in EGFR and BRAF genes concurrently is a leap forward in precision medicine. Mutations in these genes are pivotal in the development of certain types of cancer and the enhanced sensitivity and specificity offered by these kits could vastly improve early detection and patient stratification for targeted therapies. This technology could also streamline the pre-screening process for NGS, which is a more comprehensive but also more resource-intensive method of analysis. By saving time and sample material and reducing costs, QIAGEN's new kits may increase the efficiency of research and potentially lead to quicker therapeutic interventions.Furthermore, the potential clinical applications of this technology could be vast. If these assays can be adapted for other cancer-associated genes, the scope of their impact widens. This could eventually lead to more personalized treatment plans and better monitoring of treatment efficacy, which are critical factors in improving patient outcomes. As a result, stakeholders in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries should closely monitor the adoption and integration of these tools into clinical practice, as they could influence drug development strategies and partnerships in the oncology space. Genomics Specialist The QIAseq Targeted RNA-seq Panel for T-cell Receptors is an innovative tool that addresses a growing interest in the immune system's role in cancer. By enabling a targeted next-generation sequencing approach to T-cell receptor profiling, researchers can gain insights into the adaptive immune response to cancer with high accuracy and sensitivity. This is particularly relevant for understanding tumor microenvironments and could lead to breakthroughs in immunotherapy treatments. The use of unique molecular indices (UMIs) and QIAseq Enrichment Technology ensures that even low-abundance T-cell receptors can be detected, which is important for characterizing the immune repertoire against cancer. This development has implications for personalized medicine, as it could aid in the identification of new therapeutic targets and improve the monitoring of treatment response in cancer patients.As research in this area progresses, we may see a shift in how immune-based biomarkers are used in clinical trials and treatment planning. This could affect the strategies of companies in the immunotherapy space and potentially lead to collaborations with diagnostic firms like QIAGEN to leverage these advanced analytical capabilities. Clinical Laboratory Scientist The PAXgene Urine Liquid Biopsy Set, developed by PreAnalytiX, a QIAGEN and BD joint venture, is poised to fill a gap in the preanalytical workflow for cell-free DNA in urine (ucfDNA). This non-invasive sampling approach is a critical step forward in the liquid biopsy field. The preservation of ucfDNA from degradation post-collection is crucial, as it ensures the reliability of subsequent analyses. The stabilization of urine samples could lead to more widespread use of urine as a matrix for liquid biopsy, which has been less common compared to blood plasma. This development could facilitate new applications in cancer diagnostics, such as the detection of minimal residual disease and the monitoring of treatment response, which are essential for the management of cancer patients.The impact on clinical laboratories could be significant, as it may lead to the adoption of new standardized protocols for ucfDNA analysis. This, in turn, could result in the expansion of service offerings and potentially improve the competitiveness of laboratories in the precision diagnostics market. It is also worth noting that the integration of such technologies into routine workflows could pose logistical and technical challenges that will need to be addressed to realize the full potential of urine liquid biopsies. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM Novel QIAcuity dPCR PanCancer Kits can detect rare mutations of EGFR and BRAF genes at the same time, while saving sample material, reducing time and cost // New QIAseq Targeted RNA-seq Panel for T-cell Receptor allows targeted next-generation sequencing of T-cell receptors, increasing accuracy and sensitivity PAXgene® Urine Liquid Biopsy Set to enable non-invasive sample collection and cell-free DNA stabilization, thereby allowing researchers to make advances in urine liquid biopsyVenlo, the Netherlands, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QIAGEN N.V. (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced a series of new products to further enhance cancer research as well as to enable urine collection and stabilization as a new approach for liquid biopsy. These three new products, along with the IVD version of QIAGEN’s digital PCR platform QIAcuity set for launch in mid-2024, are to be featured at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego, California, from April 5-10. Two Exhibitor Spotlight Theater sessions and several poster presentations will highlight additional advances from QIAGEN in this field. “We are excited to share our latest innovation in digital PCR, NGS, and non-invasive sample collection and DNA stabilization with the research community that will help them gain valuable insights into cancer. Our new QIAcuity PanCancer kits will enhance the understanding of EGFR- and BRAF-driven cancers while our QIAcuity IVD system, ready for launch this summer, will translate cancer research into clinical applications and precision diagnostics,” said Nitin Sood, Senior Vice President and Head of QIAGEN’s Life Sciences Business Area. “And with our new solutions for urine liquid biopsy and targeted RNA-sequencing, researchers receive new efficient tools that potentially enable them to better detect minimal residual disease, monitor treatment response, and identify new therapeutic targets. The new products involve the following: The newly launched QIAcuity dPCR PanCancer Kits will allow researchers using QIAGEN’s QIAcuity dPCR system to detect multiple EGFR and BRAF hallmark mutations at the same time and with high sensitivity. EGFR and BRAF are genes essential for normal cell growth and function, but mutations in these genes can result in cancer development. The assays clearly discriminate between wild-type and mutant sequences, enhancing specificity and reducing false positives. Researchers can use the kits for pre-screening samples before, for example, analyzing them with NGS, or monitoring cancer cells. Simultaneously assessing the mutations, they reduce time and cost and save on sample material. The technology has the potential to be adapted to identify other genes associated with cancer risks. “I am testing the novel PanCancer Assays on the QIAcuity instrument using FFPE tissue samples and liquid biopsies to concurrently detect multiple hallmark mutations in BRAF and EGFR – and initial findings have convinced me that this product has the potential to accelerate prognostic and predictive biomarker analysis, early mutation detection and screenings,” said Vijayalakshmi Ramshankar, Professor and Head of the Department of Preventive Oncology Research, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India. To advance research on how the immune system interacts with cancer, QIAGEN has introduced the QIAseq Targeted RNA-seq Panel for T-cell receptors. T-cell receptors play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system, which is responsible for recognizing and eliminating abnormal cells, such as cancer cells. The panel uses unique molecular indices (UMI) with QIAseq Enrichment Technology to facilitate ultrasensitive and accurate characterization of the immune repertoire in human and mouse from low input and FFPE samples. It enables targeted NGS detection of the human or mouse expressed T cell receptors (TCR): TCR-alpha, TCR-beta, TCR-gamma and TCR-delta. This library prep kit will accelerate research into several areas with high accuracy and sensitivity, among them how the T-cell receptor repertoire in cancer can be used as a biomarker and how the repertoire of tumor-infiltrating T-cells can improve the understanding of tumor behavior. The PAXgene Urine Liquid Biopsy Set currently being developed by PreAnalytiX, a QIAGEN and BD joint venture, will launch later this year. It will provide an easy-to-use, non-invasive sampling approach to liquid biopsy and address current preanalytical workflow gaps for cell-free DNA in urine (ucfDNA). By introducing preservatives into urine samples, it will prevent the rapid, post-collection degradation of ucfDNA and minimize the release of potentially misleading genomic DNA, both of which can make ucfDNA analysis unreliable or even impossible. Urine liquid biopsy research holds significant potential for applications such as detecting minimal residual disease, monitoring treatment response and identifying therapeutic targets, complementing the results of blood plasma analysis and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor. Professor Ellen Heitzer of the Diagnostic and Research Institute of Human Genetics at the Medical University of Graz in Austria will present the results of her study with the PAXgene technology in an Exhibitor Spotlight Theater session: “Cell-free DNA isolated from urine offers a truly non-invasive sampling method for liquid biopsy, but ucfDNA requires careful sample handling. The urine collection and stabilization solution enables optimized standardized workflows. This makes several downstream analyses feasible with ucfDNA and can provide important complementary information.” QIAGEN will also highlight at the AACR meeting the upcoming launch of the QIAcuity system for IVD testing – the expansion of its digital PCR technology from research to the clinical setting. The QIAcuityDx system offers a custom assay development environment alongside IVD functionality, providing labs with a simplified yet regulatory-compliant route to run IVD assays or lab-developed tests (LDTs) and generate results within the same working day.

Negative None. 04/03/2024 - 02:16 PM Debuting a new bottle design, Tanqueray No. TEN shows off its place as the ultimate architect in cocktail artistry through new experiences beginning at The Connaught Bar LONDON, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tanqueray No. TEN announces a season of bartender residencies across the globe to present a window into exceptional cocktails. The launch of Tanqueray No. TEN residencies kicks off with a hospitality experience sketched by Tanqueray No. TEN global brand partner Stanley Tucci and Director of Mixology Ago Perrone at The Connaught Bar in London. Serving as an invitation to be immersed in the craftsmanship of cocktail makers worldwide, Tanqueray No. TEN's residencies are where lovers of cocktail culture can witness their artistry unfold to 'Make it a TEN'. The residencies feature top bartending talent, known as the Tastemakers of Tanqueray No. TEN, which include Ago Perrone from The Connaught Bar, Giulia Cuccurullo from The Artesian, Keila Urzaiz de Calignon and Yoann Tarditi from Satan's Whiskers, Matteo Di Ienno, leading cocktail and botanical expert from Italy, Oisin Kelly from The Sidecar at The Westbury Hotel, Andy Ferreria from Cask in Cork, Emily Doherty from The Merchant Hotel Cocktail Bar in Northern Ireland, award-winning independent bartender Tiffanie Barriere from the USA, and more. These leading bartenders put Tanqueray No. TEN at the pinnacle of cocktail culture around the world. As Tanqueray No. TEN's season of cocktail celebration spreads worldwide, cocktail hubs across cities will ignite with activity. Become immersed in the creative artistry behind the bar as Tanqueray No. TEN draws aficionados into the living notebooks of these tastemakers, and shines a light on their creative processes, while honouring the craft of bartending with partnerships born from a shared love of cocktail artistry. The inaugural residency will delve into the friendship and dialogue between two of Tanqueray's esteemed tastemakers, Ago Perrone and Stanley Tucci, who collaborated to create a bespoke experience at The Connaught Bar. The two first met when Stanley attended a ""guest shift"" at The Connaught Bar where he learned expert techniques from the 'master of the martini', and took his at-home cocktail ventures to the next level. Stanley shared his inspiration for the experience, expressed in the form of thoughtful sketches, celebrating the botanical artisanship of Tanqueray No. TEN, which was then developed into a bespoke cocktail creation by Ago. Stanley says: ""Cocktail making is a unique craft, that welcomes curious and inventive minds to push the boundaries of flavour and hospitality. I'm delighted to partner with Tanqueray No. TEN to celebrate bartenders as the true artists that they are, with cocktail residencies across the world. The new bottle is a beautiful homage to the brand's heritage, craft and longstanding place in the world of bartending."" Ago and Stanley crafted a Tanqueray No. TEN cocktail that can be tailored to preferred taste profiles. It draws from the cocktail Stanley is known best for - a negroni - and a martini, and guests of The Connaught Bar can expect a Tanqueray No. TEN experience like no other. Named 'The TENacious,' this cocktail highlights the essence of an Italian summer using a special 'StaAgo Mix' of dry vermouth, sweet vermouth and bitters. The bespoke illustrations by Stanley tell the story of the artistry behind the drink, which will be feature on a limited-edition menu at The Connaught. The residency at The Connaught Bar kicks off a series of creative collaborations and pop-ups globally. In Italy, Tanqueray No. TEN will bring signature serves to events in partnership with Alessi and Wallpaper* at Milan Design Week. In Ireland, Tanqueray No. TEN is partnering with top Irish bartenders and Tanqueray No. TEN Tastemakers to host cocktail residencies and exclusive events. The newly designed Tanqueray No. TEN bottle serves as the backdrop for the series of celebratory residencies, which was created to honour the artistry of the liquid and the cocktails made using it. Tanqueray No. TEN's new bottle features a copper cap with a citrus grater texture as a homage to the miniature Tiny Ten still. The light translucent green bottle holds a citrus press shaped glass structure at the base of the bottle, a tribute to the whole citrus fruit used in the Tanqueray No. TEN distillation process. The bottle's new ten faceted design and red wax seal aptly celebrates this liquid artisanship from Charles Tanqueray & Co. ""Tanqueray No. TEN has always pioneered bringing gin to new levels, and this stunning new bottle is a testament to our craft. Using whole citrus fruits to capture the 'citrus heart' in our historic Tiny Ten still sets us apart from other gin distillations, making this the perfect element for the zenith of cocktail making excellence. The gin's unique balance and refreshing taste are key to creating balanced drinks. It's a delight to see how it's used in the best drinks in the world,"" says Master Distiller, Terry Fraser. Additional cocktail residencies will unfurl across the UK at Bistrotheque, The Artesian, and Satan's Whiskers, and in Ireland at The Sidecar at the Westbury Hotel, Cask in Cork and The Merchant Hotel, Belfast. More will be announced in Italy as the season of celebration continues.

Positive None. Negative None. Defense Technology Analyst Parsons Corporation's recent award on a contract by the NNSA represents a strategic expansion in the company's portfolio of national security solutions. This contract is not just a revenue-generating vehicle; it is a testament to Parsons' expertise in the counter-nuclear smuggling arena. The company's ability to secure two task orders swiftly indicates a robust operational capability and a strong relationship with the NNSA. For stakeholders, this could mean enhanced confidence in Parsons' market position and potentially increased stock valuation due to the long-term nature of the contract and options for extension.From a defense technology perspective, the focus on design, integration and implementation of advanced systems is critical. These systems are essential not only for detecting nuclear smuggling but also for maintaining global security. The contract's emphasis on logistics and training also highlights the comprehensive approach Parsons is taking to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of these countermeasures. For investors, such contracts can be seen as a harbinger of steady revenue streams, given the ongoing global need for nuclear security and the potential for additional task orders. Global Security Analyst The global implications of Parsons' contract with the NNSA are significant. By equipping partner nations with the capabilities to detect and disrupt illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear materials, Parsons is contributing to a broader international security framework. The geopolitical stability provided by such measures can have far-reaching effects on international trade and relations, potentially reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation and terrorism.Investors should note that the company's commitment to advancing the U.S. government's nonproliferation goals aligns with a growing trend in global security investments. The diversification into nonproliferation and security systems integration could open up new markets and opportunities for Parsons, potentially leading to further expansion and partnerships with governments and international agencies. Financial Analyst The announcement of a $1 billion ceiling contract for Parsons Corporation marks a significant financial milestone. The inclusion of a three-year base period with additional option periods suggests a stable long-term income source, which is favorable for financial forecasting and investor confidence. The immediate awarding of two task orders also indicates that the revenue impact may be realized sooner rather than later, providing a positive outlook for the company's short-term financial health.However, investors should consider the operational costs associated with fulfilling such large-scale contracts. The need for design, integration and procurement of equipment may require substantial upfront investments. While these costs are likely accounted for within the contract's budget, they could affect profit margins. Careful monitoring of Parsons' quarterly financials will be important to assess how the contract is influencing the company's overall financial performance. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM CHANTILLY, Va., April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parsons Corporation (NYSE: PSN) announced today that the company was awarded a position on an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity multiple award task order contract by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA’s) Office of Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence (NSDD). The $1 billion ceiling value contract to deploy advanced counter-nuclear smuggling systems globally includes a three-year base period of performance and two, two-year option periods and is new work for the company. Parsons has already been awarded two task orders under this contract, enabling NSDD to build international partner capabilities that prevent radioactive and nuclear material acquisition by malign actors. The contract scope includes tasks associated with design, integration, implementation, communications, logistics, training, and equipment procurement to support the systems’ deployment. “Parsons is a leader in providing innovative national security solutions to the federal government, and this award continues our growth as a Department of Energy and NNSA critical technology solutions provider,” said Jon Moretta, president, Engineered Systems for Parsons. “Our experience and collaboration with NNSA enhance global nuclear security and advance the U.S. government’s nonproliferation goals by equipping partner nations with capabilities to detect, disrupt, and investigate the illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear materials.” Parsons has provided infrastructure and environmental solutions to the Department of Energy for 80 years, and supported NNSA since 2012, through the Enterprise Construction Management Services contract. This work for NNSA NSDD expands the company’s nonproliferation and security systems integration and delivery support to the federal government. As threats continue to evolve, Parsons is well-positioned to design, integrate, deploy, and sustain the most advanced security technology systems at a global scale and across all domains.

Important Notice to JP Morgan Chase Customers Who Were Victims of Fraudulent Wire Transfers,2024-04-03T19:30:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"The Law Firm of KlaymanToskes has filed a $16 million lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) for negligence and failure to investigate suspicious wire transfers. The lawsuit alleges that JP Morgan Chase failed to review and investigate 35 international wire transfers, leading to a customer losing $16 million in a fraudulent scheme. Customers who suffered similar conduct are urged to contact the law firm for further investigation.","Important Notice to JP Morgan Chase Customers Who Were Victims of Fraudulent Wire Transfers Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The Law Firm of KlaymanToskes has filed a $16 million lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) for negligence and failure to investigate suspicious wire transfers. The lawsuit alleges that JP Morgan Chase failed to review and investigate 35 international wire transfers, leading to a customer losing $16 million in a fraudulent scheme. Customers who suffered similar conduct are urged to contact the law firm for further investigation. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The filing of a $16 million lawsuit against a major financial institution like JP Morgan Chase for negligence and failure to investigate suspicious wire transfers is a significant legal event. From a legal perspective, this case hinges on the bank's duty to monitor and report unusual activity, a requirement under anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations. If the allegations prove true, it could indicate a lapse in JP Morgan Chase's internal controls and risk management protocols. Such a lapse could lead to regulatory scrutiny, potential fines and a loss of investor confidence, which can impact the bank's stock performance and market valuation. Financial institutions are typically required to have sophisticated monitoring systems in place to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. A failure to do so, especially on the scale alleged, can be seen as a breach of fiduciary duty to their customers. Financial Analyst When a major lawsuit is announced, particularly involving substantial sums like $16 million, it can have a notable effect on the financial institution's stock due to the potential for significant legal costs and reputational damage. Investors will closely monitor this situation as it unfolds, considering the possible financial implications for JP Morgan Chase. The allegations, if substantiated, could lead to increased operational costs associated with strengthening anti-fraud measures and compensating affected customers. Additionally, this could trigger a review of the bank's risk management systems by regulators, possibly resulting in fines or increased capital requirements. All these factors can influence investor sentiment and the bank's future earnings projections. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, the lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase is indicative of a broader industry challenge. Financial fraud, particularly 'Sha Zhu Pan' or 'Pig Butchering' scams, has become increasingly sophisticated and financial institutions are expected to keep pace with evolving threats. This case will likely prompt other banks to reassess their own fraud prevention systems. The outcome of this lawsuit could set a precedent affecting industry-wide practices. If JP Morgan Chase is found liable, it could lead to a sector-wide regulatory clampdown, increased compliance costs and potentially stricter industry standards for monitoring and reporting suspicious activities. These industry-wide changes can have a substantial impact on operational costs and profitability for financial service providers. 04/03/2024 - 03:30 PM The Law Firm of KlaymanToskes Has Filed a $16 Million Lawsuit Against JP Morgan Chase for Negligence and Failure to Investigate Suspicious Wire TransfersNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 3, 2024 / National investment loss and securities lawyers KlaymanToskes has filed a $16 million lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) following its failure to detect or suspend fraudulent wire transfers in a customer's account which caused their client to lose $16 million. The law firm urges all current and former JP Morgan Chase customers who suffered similar conduct to contact the firm immediately at 888-997-9956.According to the lawsuit (AAA# 01-23-0005-9530), JP Morgan Chase failed to review and/or investigate 35 international wire transfers made over a period of 56 days in their client's account. Further, JP Morgan Chase failed to protect the customer's funds by timely terminating or suspending the wire transfers, and/or freezing the account or taking any other reasonable steps to halt the transmission of $16,567,917, when the account did not have any history of sending wires in excess of $100,000.It is alleged that the customer was the victim of a fraudulent scheme commonly referred to as a ""Sha Zhu Pan"" (杀猪盘) or a ""Pig Butchering"" scam, as it involves cultivating a friendly or romantic relationship with a potential investor and ""fattening"" them up with false narratives, in order to gain their trust and eventually solicit them to invest in a fraudulent financial opportunity. In April 2023, the Department of Justice reported that it seized over $112 million in funds linked to investment scams known as ""Sha Zhu Pan"".KlaymanToskes' investigation found that the cumulative effect of these transactions should have prompted supervisory intervention, however, JP Morgan Chase failed to initiate any contact with the client, beyond a single phone call after the second of 35 wire transfers. Upon information and belief, the wire transfer limit at JP Morgan Chase was $500,000, therefore the repetitive and unusual nature of the transfers, which consistently hovered just at or below the $500,000 threshold, should have triggered immediate scrutiny and intervention from JP Morgan Chase's compliance and risk management teams.Current and former customers of JP Morgan Chase, as well as customers of any other financial institution who suffered losses due to the company's failure to detect and/or terminate wire fraud transfers are encouraged to contact attorney Steven Toskes, Esq.at (888) 997-9956 or by email at investigations@klaymantoskes.com in furtherance of our investigation.About KlaymanToskesKlaymanToskes is a leading national securities law firm which practices exclusively in the field of securities arbitration and litigation on behalf of retail and institutional investors throughout the world in large and complex securities matters.

(BIOR) successfully closed a registered direct offering of 5,454,548 shares of common stock at $1.10 per share, along with a private placement of warrants. The total gross proceeds amounted to approximately $6,000,000. H.C. Wainwright & Co. served as the exclusive placement agent. The net proceeds will be utilized for operational support, ongoing clinical trials, further development of oral biotherapeutics platforms, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Biora Therapeutics regarding the closing of its registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of warrants is a significant financial event for the company. The decision to price shares and warrants at $1.10, which has yielded approximately $6 million in gross proceeds, reflects a strategic move to bolster the company's financial position. This capital infusion is earmarked for the completion of the BT-600 clinical trial and further development of Biora's oral biotherapeutics platforms, indicating a direct investment into the company's core research and development activities.The involvement of H.C. Wainwright & Co. as the exclusive placement agent provides an additional layer of credibility to the transaction, potentially attracting investor interest. The use of a shelf registration statement, which was declared effective in August 2021, suggests a planned and timely execution of capital-raising activities, adhering to SEC regulations. However, the pricing of the shares at $1.10 may indicate a discount to the current trading price, which is a common practice to incentivize immediate investment but can also dilute existing shareholders' equity.Investors should monitor the stock's performance following this announcement, as the market's reaction can provide insights into investor confidence in Biora's strategic direction and the perceived value of its clinical trials and technology platforms. The allocation of the raised funds towards the BT-600 trial and other R&D efforts should be closely scrutinized for potential impacts on the company's future revenue streams and market positioning within the biotech industry. Biotech Market Analyst Biora Therapeutics' focus on advancing its oral biotherapeutics platforms through the capital raised is indicative of the company's commitment to innovation within the biotech sector. The BT-600 clinical trial represents a critical milestone for Biora, as successful outcomes can significantly enhance the company's product pipeline and marketability. The field of oral biotherapeutics is rapidly evolving and Biora's progress in this area could position it as a leader in a niche market, potentially creating long-term value for stakeholders.The biotech industry is known for its high burn rate due to extensive research and development costs, making the timing and amount of capital raises important for sustaining operations. In this context, the $6 million raised, while a relatively modest amount for the industry, must be managed efficiently to achieve the stated goals. Investors should consider the competitive landscape and the potential for Biora's technology to meet unmet medical needs when evaluating the company's prospects.Given the speculative nature of biotech investments, the impact of this financial news on the stock market could vary. While immediate dilution of shares is a concern, the long-term success of the BT-600 trial and subsequent product developments could outweigh short-term fluctuations. Stakeholders should be aware of the inherent risks associated with biotech investments, including regulatory hurdles and the binary outcomes of clinical trials. 04/03/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN DIEGO, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biora Therapeutics, Inc.

The company is fulfilling its shareholders' authorization and complying with share repurchase laws. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share repurchase programs are a significant financial strategy that can influence a company's stock price and earnings per share (EPS). By buying back its own shares, TotalEnergies SE is reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can lead to an increase in EPS, assuming net income remains constant. This action typically signals to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued and that it has sufficient cash reserves to invest in itself.From a financial perspective, the repurchase of 139,072 shares at an average price of 63.045461 EUR per share implies a confident cash position and a strategic move to consolidate share value. It's essential to consider the opportunity cost of this capital allocation, as the funds used for share repurchases are not being invested in business expansion or debt reduction. Investors should weigh the potential EPS boost against the company's long-term growth prospects and current debt levels. Market Research Analyst The market's response to share repurchases can vary depending on the broader economic context and the sector's performance. In the energy sector, where TotalEnergies operates, factors such as oil prices, geopolitical stability and shifts towards renewable energy sources can significantly impact company valuations and investor confidence.Investors should monitor these external factors when interpreting the repurchase activity. For instance, if the sector is expected to face headwinds due to policy changes or market dynamics, a share repurchase could be seen as a defensive move rather than a sign of underlying strength. Conversely, in a stable or growing market, the same action might reinforce investor optimism about the company's valuation and future performance. 04/03/2024 - 12:55 PM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: In accordance with the authorization given by the ordinary shareholders’ general meeting on May 26, 2023, to trade on its shares and pursuant to applicable law on share repurchase, TotalEnergies SE (LEI: 529900S21EQ1BO4ESM68) (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) declares the following purchases of its own shares (FR0000120271) on March 25, 2024: Transaction Date Total daily volume (number of shares) Daily weighted average purchase price of shares (EUR/share) Amount of transactions (EUR) Market (MIC Code) 25/03/2024 111,072 63.027979 7,000,643.68 XPAR 25/03/2024 20,000 63.107114 1,262,142.28 CEUX 25/03/2024 4,000 63.133258 252,533.03 TQEX 25/03/2024 4,000 63.134850 252,539.40 AQEU Total 139,072 63.045461 8,767,858.40 Transaction details In accordance with Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Market Abuse Regulation) a full breakdown of the individual trades are disclosed on the TotalEnergies website: https://totalenergies.com/investors/shares-and-dividends/total-shares/info/company-share-transactions About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Energy Sector Analyst The announcement by Ameren Corporation's subsidiary, ATXI, regarding the development of a significant transmission project, underlines the company's strategic expansion in energy infrastructure. The project, valued at $273 million, is poised to enhance the energy grid's resilience in northern Missouri, which is likely to have a positive effect on the region's economic stability and growth.From an investment perspective, the company's ability to secure such a project reflects its competitive edge in design and cost management, which are critical factors in the energy sector. This win could signal to investors Ameren's potential for increased market share in transmission projects, possibly leading to long-term revenue growth.However, the capital expenditure required for this project could impact Ameren's cash flow in the short term. Investors should monitor the company's financials closely, particularly its debt levels and return on invested capital, to assess the project's financial viability and its impact on the company's overall financial health. Environmental Policy Expert Infrastructure projects of this magnitude often come under scrutiny for their environmental impact. Ameren's commitment to incorporating input from local communities and respecting impacted landowners is a significant aspect that aligns with contemporary environmental and social governance (ESG) standards.This approach could potentially mitigate regulatory and legal risks, fostering a more favorable environment for project execution. Furthermore, the project's role in boosting energy reliability can contribute to the state's sustainability goals by facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid.Investors with an interest in ESG factors should consider the project's alignment with sustainability trends and regulatory compliance, which can influence the company's reputation and long-term value creation. Local Economic Analyst The selection of a Missouri-based utility for a project of this scale has implications for the local economy. The emphasis on utilizing local suppliers and maintaining jobs within the state suggests a multiplier effect, where investment in infrastructure could stimulate further economic activity.For local businesses and the workforce, the project represents an opportunity for growth and stability. Additionally, the construction of new transmission pathways can attract further investment into the region, potentially leading to increased economic diversification and resilience.Stakeholders, including local businesses and investors, should consider the broader economic benefits that the project could bring to northern Missouri, such as job creation and support for local industries. 04/03/2024 - 03:08 PM Project awarded based on sound design plans and lower cost ST. LOUIS, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A subsidiary of St. Louis-based Ameren Corporation has been selected by the regional transmission operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), to develop a $273 million transmission project across northern Missouri. ""We are proud to have won this vital project that will give Missourians a more resilient energy grid and boost reliability for millions of people,"" said Shawn Schukar, chairman and president of Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (ATXI), a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE). ""We plan to continue our track record of delivering cost-effective, high-value projects while incorporating robust input from our neighbors and doing everything we can to be respectful to impacted landowners."" The project will originate from a new 345-kV substation that ATXI will construct in northwest Missouri and span from DeKalb County to Marion County, opening new pathways for energy transmission to the region. The project is part of a $10 billion portfolio of projects included in Tranche 1 of MISO's Long Range Transmission Plan (LRTP). ""Ameren has been doing business in our state for more than 100 years, and having this project led by a Missouri-based utility with strong, longstanding local partners will ensure the job is done cost-effectively and collaboratively,"" Schukar said. ""When Missouri companies build these large infrastructure projects, more dollars invested stay in our state, maintaining local jobs and boosting local suppliers and our communities."" ATXI is currently working on additional projects from MISO's Tranche 1 portfolio. The Northern Missouri Grid Transformation Program includes two projects expected to be in-service in 2028. MISO selected ATXI to develop one of these projects in October 2023, noting the sound route design and cost containment plan as key factors.

(or ""the company"", www.skhynix.com), the world's leading producer of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, announced today that it will invest an estimated $3.87 billion in West Lafayette, Indiana to build an advanced packaging fabrication and R&D facility for AI products. The project, the first of its kind in the United States, is expected to drive innovation in the nation's AI supply chain, while bringing more than a thousand new jobs to the region. The company held an investment agreement ceremony with officials from Indiana State, Purdue University, and the U.S. government at Purdue University in West Lafayette on the 3rd and officially announced the plan. At the event, officials from each party including Governor of Indiana Eric Holcomb, Senator Todd Young, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Arun Venkataraman, Secretary of Commerce State of Indiana David Rosenberg, Purdue University President Mung Chiang, Chairman of Purdue Research Foundation Mitch Daniels, Mayor of city of West Lafayette Erin Easter, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States Hyundong Cho, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Chicago Junghan Kim, SK vice chairman Jeong Joon Yu, SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and SK hynix Head of Package & Test Choi Woojin, participated. Leveraging its dominant position in the HBM market, SK hynix's new facility will be home to an advanced semiconductor production line that will mass-produce next-generation HBM, the highest-performing Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, which are the critical components of graphic processing units that train AI systems such as ChatGPT. * HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): A high-value, high-performance memory that vertically interconnects multiple DRAM chips and dramatically increases data processing speed in comparison with conventional DRAM products. HBM4 is the sixth generation of its kind, following HBM, HBM2, HBM2E, HBM3 and HBM3E. The company plans to begin mass production in the second half of 2028, while the new facility will also develop future generations of chips and house an advanced packaging R&D line. The site was selected due to Indiana's resilient manufacturing infrastructure and R&D ecosystem, expert intellectuals in the semiconductor field and the talent pipeline at Purdue University, and the strong support provided by the state and local government. Innovation in memory chips continues to drive lower-power operations and performance enhancements in computing. As tech shrinkage and other hardware improvements have hit limits, SK hynix's new chiplet packaging technology has emerged as a promising way to continue enhancing density and performance. As this heterogeneous integration technology becomes more and more important to the future of the semiconductor industry, the company's new initiative in Indiana will help establish the region as a Silicon Heartland: a new semiconductor cluster centered in the Midwest Triangle that will become a magnet for next-generation computing in the AI era. ""Indiana is a global leader in innovating and producing the products that will power our future economy, and today's news is proof positive to that fact,"" said Governor Eric Holcomb. ""I'm so proud to officially welcome SK hynix to Indiana, and we're confident this new partnership will enhance the Lafayette-West Lafayette region, Purdue University and the state of Indiana for the long term. This new semiconductor innovation and packaging plant not only reaffirms the state's role in the hard tech sector, but is also another tremendous step forward in advancing U.S. innovation and national security, putting Hoosiers at the forefront of national and global advancements."" U.S. Senator Todd Young, a key advocate for the project, said, ""SK hynix will soon be a household name in Indiana. This incredible investment demonstrates their confidence in Hoosier workers, and I'm excited to welcome them to our state."" Adding, ""The CHIPS and Science Act opened a door that Indiana has been able to sprint through, and companies like SK hynix are helping to build our high-tech future."" ""SK hynix is the global pioneer and dominant market leader in memory chips for AI,"" Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. ""This transformational investment reflects our state and university's tremendous strength in semiconductors, hardware AI, and hard tech corridor. It is also a monumental moment for completing the supply chain of digital economy in our country through chips advanced packaging. Located at Purdue Research Park, the largest facility of its kind at a U.S. university will grow and succeed through innovation."" ""We are excited to become the first in the industry to build a state-of-the-art advanced packaging facility for AI products in the United States that will help strengthen supply-chain resilience and develop a local semiconductor ecosystem,"" said SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung. ""With this new facility, we hope to advance our goal of providing AI memory chips with unmatched capabilities, serving the needs of our customers."" ""We are grateful for the support from the Government of Indiana, Purdue University, and the broader community involved, and we look forward to expanding our partnership in the long run.""

These projects include work on advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration with Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center and other research institutes and industry partners. They also hope to collaborate on a project related to memory-centric solutions and architecture for the generative AI era, specifically system-level memory design and in/near-memory computing. The company also plans to collaborate with Purdue University and Ivy Tech Community College to develop training programs and interdisciplinary degree curricula that will cultivate a high-tech workforce and build a reliable pipeline of new talent. Meanwhile, SK hynix plans to support the work of Purdue Research Foundation and other local non-profits and charities by building partnerships that provide community development, growth opportunities, and leadership training. Separately, SK hynix will also proceed with Korean domestic investments as planned. The company has been working to prepare the site for the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster where it will invest 120 trillion won to build production facilities. The company plans to break ground on the first fab in March of 2025, with plans for completion in early 2027. It will also build a mini fab, a facility with equipment for 300mm wafer processing, to test semiconductor materials, components and equipment. About SK hynix Inc.

Report excerpt: ""The Company plans to continue its rigorous exploration programs on the Albert Lake Project and the Gochager Lake Property in 2024. The first drilling this year was conducted on the Albert Lake Project, testing high-priority targets where multiple geophysical, geochemical, and geological indicators point to the presence of a potential deposit. In addition, further geophysical test work was conducted. According to Couloir Capital's estimates, the assays from the drilling campaign should be published by the end of April. Following the completion of this work and the activities planned for the Gochager Lake Property outlined below, some follow-up surveys (mapping, prospecting, geochemistry, EM, LiDAR) and more diamond drilling are planned in the year's second half.The Gochager Lake Property will be drilled after the Albert Lake Project, targeting deep BHEM in-hole and off-hole conductors to test for the presence of the 'feeder' zone and associated mineralization, as outlined in the Gochager Lake Project (GLP) section. Follow-up EM and gravity surveys are planned. In the second half of the year, after results from the initial work are known and can be used to plan further exploration, the property will see more drilling and other exploration work before the year ends. The Company has also applied for an additional exploration permit for the Gochager Lake Property, which will enable the establishment of a 20-25-person exploration camp and extensive drilling (10,000 m - 15,000 m), amongst other things.The Company is well-funded to carry out its exploration programs in 2024, and we can expect ample news flow throughout the year. The visual inspection of the drill core coming out of the ground should indicate the presence of sulphides, with assays to follow a few weeks later. We expect this cycle of visual inspection and assays to be repeated twice this year on each property, which will be exciting to follow.""About Couloir Capital Ltd.Couloir Capital Ltd. is an investment research firm with a team of experienced investment professionals dedicated to providing opportunities in the natural resource exploration and development sectors.

Shareholders voted for the recommended Disney Board nominees, expressing trust in the company's future amidst industry changes. Both the Chairman and CEO expressed gratitude and commitment to focusing on growth, value creation, and creative excellence. Positive None. Negative None. Corporate Governance Expert The election of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors is a significant event, as it reflects shareholder confidence in the company's strategic direction and governance practices. The overwhelming support for the incumbent board suggests that investors are aligned with the current management's vision, which could indicate stability and continuity in Disney's strategic initiatives. This is particularly relevant given the 'great change in the broader entertainment industry' mentioned by Chairman Mark Parker, implying that the company is navigating through a transformative period marked by shifts in consumer preferences and digital disruption.From a corporate governance standpoint, the presence of experienced individuals in areas such as technology, finance and international business is critical. For instance, having directors like Safra A. Catz, CEO of a major technology company and James P. Gorman, CEO of a global financial services firm, could provide Disney with valuable insights into digital innovation and financial acumen necessary for driving growth in the entertainment sector. The board's composition could also be a signal to the market about Disney's commitment to diverse expertise, which may be essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges and opportunities the company faces. Financial Analyst The conclusion of the proxy battle and the re-election of Disney's board members may have a positive effect on the company's stock performance in the short term, as it removes uncertainty and potential disruptions that can be associated with such contests. Investors typically favor environments with less volatility and clear leadership and the market may respond well to the continuity in Disney's leadership.Long-term implications include the board's ability to execute on growth strategies and value creation for shareholders. CEO Bob Iger's statement about focusing '100% of our attention on our most important priorities: growth and value creation for our shareholders' highlights this commitment. The statement also implies that the management team has been proactive during the proxy contest, which could reassure investors about management's ability to handle corporate governance issues without detracting from operational performance.However, it's important to monitor how the board addresses the ongoing challenges in the entertainment industry, such as increasing competition from streaming services and the need for continual content innovation. The board's effectiveness in steering the company through these industry headwinds will be a critical factor in Disney's long-term financial health and stock valuation. 04/03/2024 - 01:24 PM BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) announced that, based on the tabulation of its proxy solicitor, it appears that Disney’s full slate of 12 directors has been elected by a substantial margin over the nominees of Trian and Blackwells at Disney’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders today. Final voting tallies are subject to certification by the Company’s independent inspector of elections, and preliminary and final results will be included in the Company’s reports to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming days.

The state is the second launch after California, aiming to address the increasing liability injury claims for home and auto owners. Positive None. Negative None. 04/03/2024 - 12:00 PM Mercury's new umbrella insurance better protects Texans' personal wealth against bodily injury claims LOS ANGELES, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Multi-vehicle crashes, dog bites or a delivery person being injured on your property are some of the unexpected events that are putting Texans' personal financial health at risk. In fact, bodily injury payouts continue to climb year over year since the pandemic started, with the average amount for a liability claim increasing by 35%, according to Mercury Insurance (NYSE: MCY). The recent trend of rising liability injury claims for home and auto owners that exceed traditional policy limits has moved Mercury to unveil an all-new personal umbrella insurance policy for Texans that offers extra protection with bolstered coverages beginning at less than $1.00 a day. Per Forbes Magazine, an umbrella insurance policy can be an excellent addition to your insurance portfolio if you need liability coverage that goes beyond what your base car insurance or home insurance policies provide. Umbrella insurance is a good way to cover your net worth if you were to get hit with a lawsuit. The state of Texas is the second launch of this expanded insurance product for Mercury Insurance, after California. You can learn more about this unique coverage at Mercury Umbrella Insurance. ""Unexpected accidents are becoming more costly for Texans, which puts them at risk of having to pay out of pocket,"" said Brandt Minnich, vice president and chief sales development officer at Mercury Insurance. ""Mercury has redesigned its umbrella insurance to give Texans an extra layer of protection beyond a traditional auto or home policy. It's an affordable safety net that protects you from these expensive accidents and litigious lawyers looking for a big payday."" A cautionary tale for all is that of a Mercury policyholder who had kept the same limits and coverages since college, even though his personal wealth had increased significantly. The policyholder, who later became a doctor, never thought about umbrella coverage until he hit a moped with his automobile, severely injuring the rider. The rider subsequently engaged a lawyer and the Mercury insured ended up having to pay out of pocket for damages that were well beyond his auto policy limit of $25,000. ""He had payments deducted from his salary for a number of years until the settlement was paid off,"" Minnich said. Key features of Mercury's significantly updated umbrella product include: Multi-policy Discounts: Mercury policyholders can save big with multi-policy discounts across their auto, homeowners and umbrella policies. 3-year Accident and Violation Free Discount: A 5% discount is given to all drivers on the Mercury policy with no losses or accidents during the last three years. Uninsured Motorist Coverage: Uninsured motorist coverage up to $1 million in the event of an accident caused by a driver who does not have insurance. Increased Liability: Policyholders can increase their liability coverage from $1 million to $5 million, depending upon policyholders' coverage needs.""We consider Mercury's umbrella policy the 'Goldilocks' of coverage because it offers a very specific amount of extra protection that fits customers' needs, which is really important for anyone who wants to safeguard their future against unexpected expenses and legal liabilities,"" Minnich stated. Mercury offers Personal Auto, Mechanical Protection, Ride-Hailing, Condo, Homeowners, Home Cyber Protection, Home Systems Protection, Identity Management Services, Renters, Service Line Protection, Business Auto and Personal Umbrella insurance in California and Texas. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Mercury Insurance provides auto, homeowners and business insurance through more than 4,700 employees and a network of more than 8,000 independent agents in 11 states. About Mercury Insurance Mercury Insurance (NYSE: MCY) is a multiple-line insurance carrier offering personal auto, homeowners, and renters insurance directly to consumers and through a network of independent agents in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, as well as auto insurance in Florida. Mercury also writes business owners, business auto, landlord, commercial multi-peril and mechanical protection insurance in various states. Since 1962, Mercury has provided customers with tremendous value for their insurance dollar by pairing ultra-competitive rates with excellent customer service.

The platform will focus on retail opportunities with necessity-based tenants, led by CEO Brian Harper. The partnership aims to capitalize on the strong retail sector fundamentals and changing consumer behavior, leveraging Bain Capital's expertise in the retail space. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining the strategic partnership between Bain Capital Real Estate and 11North Partners, we observe a significant move in the real estate investment sector. This collaboration aims to capitalize on the current trends favoring open-air retail centers. Factors such as the persistence of work-from-home arrangements and the growth of omnichannel shopping have bolstered the demand for these types of properties. The partnership's broad investment mandate across the risk-return spectrum indicates a flexible strategy that may appeal to investors looking for diversified exposure within the retail real estate market.Furthermore, the historical performance of Bain Capital in the consumer and retail sector adds a layer of confidence in their ability to identify and leverage emerging market trends. The emphasis on necessity-based tenants is particularly noteworthy, as these tenants tend to provide more stable cash flows and may be less susceptible to economic downturns. The strategic transformation and merger led by Brian Harper at RPT Realty suggest a forward-thinking approach that could be beneficial in navigating the evolving retail landscape. Financial Analyst The formation of this partnership is indicative of a market opportunity that Bain Capital and 11North Partners believe is undervalued. The mention of 'historically low supply growth' coupled with 'increased demand' suggests a favorable supply-demand dynamic that could lead to capital appreciation and potentially above-average yields for investors in the medium to long term. The strategy to focus on necessity-based tenants within open-air retail centers is a defensive play, hedging against the volatility of the broader retail sector which continues to be disrupted by e-commerce.Investors should note the potential for this partnership to create a high-quality portfolio that could deliver strong returns. However, it is also important to recognize that the retail sector is subject to rapid change and the success of this venture will depend on the partners' ability to adapt to consumer behavior and the competitive landscape. The reference to 'bifurcation of the retail sector' hints at a selective approach to investment, targeting sub-sectors within retail that are positioned for resilience or growth. Real Estate Investment Expert The strategic partnership between Bain Capital and 11North Partners is set against a backdrop of evolving consumer habits and the shifting dynamics of the retail real estate market. The focus on open-air retail centers reflects a nuanced understanding of how the retail experience is changing, with an emphasis on convenience and safety, which have become more prominent due to the pandemic.Real estate investors should be aware of the long-term implications of this trend, as the preference for open-air centers over traditional enclosed malls could reshape the landscape of retail real estate investment. The expertise brought by Brian Harper and his team, given their experience with RPT Realty and its merger with Kimco Realty, suggests a strategic vision that could identify and execute on value-creating opportunities within this specific niche of the market.It's also important to consider the operational aspects of managing these assets, where the team's experience can be a decisive factor in driving occupancy rates and rental income. The partnership's ability to leverage Bain Capital's consumer insights and retail connections may provide a competitive edge in tenant selection and asset management. 04/03/2024 - 12:23 PM BOSTON & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bain Capital Real Estate (“Bain Capital”) and 11North Partners (“11North”), a retail focused investment platform, today announced the formation of a strategic partnership to acquire and operate open-air retail centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. The platform will employ a broad investment mandate, targeting retail opportunities across the risk-return spectrum, and will predominantly focus on open-air retail assets with a high concentration of necessity-based tenants. 11North was founded by CEO Brian Harper, a 25-year real estate industry veteran with significant retail experience. Most recently, Mr. Harper served as President and CEO of RPT Realty (NYSE: RPT), where he successfully led a strategic transformation of the company and oversaw its merger with Kimco Realty (NYSE: KIM) in January 2024. At 11North, Mr. Harper is joined by several senior executives from RPT Realty, who have a long track record of working as a team to create value. “Today, open-air retail centers benefit from a confluence of tailwinds and strong real estate fundamentals that create an attractive risk-return opportunity,” said Mr. Harper. “We believe historically low supply growth and increased demand for open-air shopping centers, driven by strong retail sales, persistent work-from-home trends, and the increased prevalence for omnichannel shopping, provide a favorable backdrop for the sector. Throughout my career, I have admired Bain Capital for their deep knowledge across multiple sectors throughout the world and their strong investment track record. We share a strong conviction in the open-air retail space, and we are excited to leverage their deep retail connectivity and differentiated consumer insights. With a demonstrated history of generating strong returns and a lack of challenged legacy assets, our focus will remain on offense in what we believe will be a compelling investment environment.” “Through Bain Capital’s 40 years of investing in the consumer and retail sector, in partnership with such brands as Staples, Domino’s Pizza, Burger King, Dunkin’ Donuts, Canada Goose, and Fogo de Chão, our platform has a unique perspective on the changing retail landscape,” said Ryan Cotton, Head of Bain Capital Real Estate. “Through significant transformation over the last 15 years, including the Great Financial Crisis, an ongoing ecommerce transition, the D2C insurgence, and a global pandemic, the way we shop continues to evolve. We believe there are clear, emerging thematics that support the winning brands, retailers, and commercial real estate of tomorrow. In convenience-oriented, necessity-based retail, we see a format that is well aligned with these themes, will continue to enjoy strong operating performance, and delivers strong results to tenants. But, the market has yet to fully appreciate the bifurcation of the retail sector, which we believe leads to the opportunity for highly attractive risk-adjusted buying. There are few proven private platforms to capitalize on this opportunity set, and we feel fortunate to partner with Brian and his team as we build a high-quality portfolio of scale.” About Bain Capital Real Estate Bain Capital Real Estate was formed in 2018 and pursues investments in often hard-to-access sectors underpinned by enduring secular trends that drive long-term demand growth for real estate assets and services. The Bain Capital Real Estate team has been executing its strategy since 2010 (formerly as a part of Harvard Management Company), having invested and committed over $7.7 billion of equity across multiple sectors. Bain Capital Real Estate focuses on assets where the team applies its deep industry expertise to accelerate impact and drive operational improvements. Bain Capital Real Estate’s strategy aligns with the value-added investment approach that Bain Capital pioneered and leverage’s the firm’s global platform and significant experience across asset classes to further bolster its insights and sourcing capabilities. Bain Capital is one of the world’s leading private investment firms with approximately $180 billion of assets under management. For more information, visit https://www.baincapitalrealestate.com/.

The campaign aims to revive the cultural significance of barf bags through a documentary, upcycled bag collection, and a wearable art piece. Dramamine® celebrates its success in motion sickness relief while acknowledging the fading use of barf bags. Positive None. Negative None. 04/03/2024 - 11:57 AM The nausea-fighting brand is highlighting the cultural impact of barf bags and ushering them into a new era with a documentary, a limited-edition collection of upcycled bags and a custom wearable art piece made from vintage bagsTARRYTOWN, N.Y., April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1949 was a big year for barf, welcoming the invention of the barf bag and Dramamine®. Seventy-five years later, Dramamine, a Prestige Consumer Healthcare brand, thrives as the number one brand for motion sickness relief, but as Dramamine has risen in popularity, the use of barf bags has sadly diminished. To commemorate the joint anniversary, Dramamine® is breathing new life – not barf – into the paper product with a mission to save its fellow partner in puke. “The Last Barf Bag” campaign announced today by Dramamine®, alongside agency partners FCB Chicago, 360PR+ and The Shipyard, explores the cultural impact of a humble yet crucial American invention made all but defunct due to Dramamine’s effectiveness in preventing unexpected upchucks. Through a new documentary, a collection of upcycled, repurposed bags and a pop-up museum exhibition, Dramamine is paying tribute to a once iconic part of our culture and history, nodding to the manufacturers, collectors, and nausea sufferers as they fill barf bags with new purpose and save their industry from irrelevance. “We’re not saying that Dramamine has caused the demise of the barf bag, but we are saying that Dramamine is effective in minimizing their use, and we feel bad about that,” said Erica Nesbitt, Senior Brand Manager of Dramamine at Prestige Consumer Health. “The 75th anniversary of both inventions felt like the right time to commemorate barf bags’ contributions to culture and even rewrite what the future holds for them after Dramamine’s impact has made their intended purpose all but obsolete.” ‘The Last Barf Bag’ Documentary The documentary short film, The Last Barf Bag: A Tribute to a Cultural Icon, explores the cultural impact of a humble but crucially useful American invention. In it, the barf bag collectors and manufacturers whose passion can be credited to saving it from extinction, meet their unlikely ally: the makers of the anti-nausea medication that threatens its existence. Directed by the filmmaking collective Sunny Sixteen (Niles Jeran, Joshua Martin, Taylor Pendleton, and Caleb Babcock), The Last Barf Bag film introduces us to doctors, pilots, historians, collectors, brand managers, suppliers, flight attendants, and even regular people discussing their barf-worthy experiences. ‘This is Not A Barf Bag’ Limited Edition CollectionDramamine and barf bags have been fighting the good fight against nausea together, but the barf bag can make way for a purpose that goes way beyond catching upchucks. Consumers can get in on the crusade to save culture’s cherished paper puke sacks by purchasing upcycled barf bags that can be used as puppets, chef’s hats, popcorn bags, coloring canvases, vases and more. Each bag in its repurposed form will be available for purchase for $5, and bundles including a barf bag and Dramamine product will be $10 while supplies last. View the full collection here. Dramamine commissioned artist and creative director known for her appearance on NBC’s Making It, Jessie Bearden, to display her craft on a new type of novel canvas…vintage barf bags. Bearden created a custom-made puffer coat using the colorful, patterned barf bags from around the world as material for a unique, only-of-its-kind item and exhibition piece. The puffer can be previewed at TheLastBarfBag.com today through April 17 at 12pm EST, when it will open up for one lucky consumer to secure the ultra-limited edition drop for just $7.50, a nod to the 75th anniversary milestone. “The unique look of vintage barf bags and their various colors and designs actually make a great template for a totally one-of-a-kind textile, and that’s what inspired me to create a jacket,” said Bearden. “I use a lot of unorthodox materials in my work, but a barf bag is a first! It makes me so happy knowing the piece will give a new life to these barf bags and I hope it serves as a conversation starter for the one lucky person who gets to wear it and spread the news of Dramamine’s The Last Barf Bag project.” Barf Bag Collection ExhibitionToday in New York City for one day only, consumers and passersby can see The Last Barf Bag Exhibition in-person and watch an exclusive screening of the documentary on the day of its world premiere. The extensive collections of four of America’s preeminent barf bag collectors will be on full display, including collections consisting of hundreds of bags collected over 5+ decades from around the world and even space. The exhibit will be open to the general public on April 3 from 12pm – 7pm at 437 N. Broadway. Following the exhibition, its collections and contents will be available to be viewed online.

This announcement complies with NYSE American  requirements.","Ampio Pharmaceuticals Received Audit Opinion with Going Concern Explanation Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the receipt of an unqualified audit opinion with a going concern explanation in its Annual Report for 2023. The audit opinion does not alter the financial statements or the Form 10-K. This announcement complies with NYSE American requirements. Positive None. Negative The explanatory paragraph regarding the going concern in the audit opinion might raise concerns about Ampio's financial stability and ability to continue operations. The need for a going concern paragraph in the audit opinion could indicate potential financial challenges for Ampio Pharmaceuticals. Financial Analyst The inclusion of a 'going concern' paragraph in Ampio Pharmaceuticals' audited financial statements signals a noteworthy caution for investors and stakeholders. This term typically indicates that there are substantial doubts about the company's ability to continue operations for the foreseeable future, usually the next twelve months. It is a red flag in financial reporting that can affect investor confidence and has implications for the company's stock price and creditworthiness.From a financial analysis perspective, the 'going concern' note may lead to a reevaluation of the company's long-term viability, impacting its ability to raise capital and possibly triggering covenants in existing debt agreements. Stakeholders should be attentive to the company's forthcoming strategies to address these concerns, such as securing new funding, restructuring operations, or exploring strategic partnerships.It is also important to consider the industry context. Pharmaceutical companies often face high R&D costs with uncertain returns, which can lead to financial strain. Investors should compare the company's financial health with industry peers to get a clearer picture of its position. Market Research Analyst Receiving a 'going concern' opinion can impact not only Ampio Pharmaceuticals but also the broader market's perception of the pharmaceutical sector, especially for small-cap companies on the NYSE American exchange. This type of news can lead to increased market volatility for similar stocks, as investors may become more cautious and risk-averse, seeking safer investment havens.Analysing market trends, it's evident that companies with similar warnings often face decreased liquidity and heightened scrutiny from analysts and regulators. Market sentiment can shift, potentially affecting not only Ampio's stock but also peer companies as investors reassess the risk profiles of their portfolios. It's important for market participants to monitor Ampio's subsequent actions, such as strategic pivots or fundraising efforts, which could serve as indicators for the company's future market performance. Legal Expert The disclosure made by Ampio Pharmaceuticals adheres to NYSE American LLC Company Guide Section 610(b) requirements, which stipulate the necessity for public companies to announce the receipt of an audit opinion with a 'going concern' notice. This transparency is critical for maintaining legal compliance and ensuring that shareholders and the investing public are fully informed of material financial conditions that may affect their investment decisions.Legally, the company's proactive communication helps mitigate the risk of potential shareholder litigation, as it demonstrates that Ampio is taking the necessary steps to disclose its financial challenges. Investors and analysts should be aware of the company's legal obligations and the steps they are taking to maintain compliance, as these actions can influence the company's reputation and investor relations. 04/03/2024 - 02:33 PM ENGLEWOOD, Colo., April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: AMPE) (the ""Company"" or ""Ampio"") today announced that, as previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on March 27, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the audited financial statements contained an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

(AGI) successfully completes the acquisition of Orford Mining , gaining access to the promising Qiqavik Gold Project in Northern Quebec.

(AGI) successfully completes the acquisition of Orford Mining , gaining access to the promising Qiqavik Gold Project in Northern Quebec. The transaction aligns with Alamos' strategy of expanding its project portfolio in favorable locations for long-term growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Orford Mining by Alamos Gold Inc. represents a strategic consolidation within the mining sector, particularly in the gold domain. By acquiring Orford and its Qiqavik Gold Project, Alamos is effectively increasing its asset portfolio and potential reserves. This move is likely to be seen positively by investors, as it suggests a proactive approach to growth, especially in a market where gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during volatile economic times. From a financial perspective, the key factors to consider would be the acquisition cost, how it was financed and the expected increase in Alamos's production output and reserves. Additionally, the integration process will be critical to monitor as it can impact the cost synergies and the speed at which the new assets contribute to the company's bottom line. Market Research Analyst Alamos Gold's acquisition of Orford Mining is a significant event in the context of the Canadian mining industry. It reflects a trend of consolidation that can lead to increased operational efficiencies and a stronger competitive position. The focus on 'good jurisdictions' highlights the importance of geopolitical stability and regulatory environments in mining investments. Projects in politically stable regions like Northern Quebec are often preferred due to lower risks associated with legal and regulatory changes. Long-term projects such as the Qiqavik Gold Project are essential for sustaining production levels and ensuring the longevity of mining companies. This strategic move could potentially open new opportunities for Alamos in terms of exploration and resource development, which might be a point of interest for stakeholders looking at the future trajectory of the company. Mining Sector Legal Expert The Final Order granted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice is an essential step in the acquisition process, indicating that the transaction has met all required legal criteria. This not only includes due diligence on the part of Alamos Gold but also ensures that Orford Mining's shareholders are treated equitably. For industry observers, the mention of a 'Plan of Arrangement' is significant. It implies a structured approach to the acquisition, typically involving the exchange of shares and consolidation of assets, which can be more tax-efficient than other methods of acquisition. Understanding the legal framework of such transactions is vital for stakeholders, as it can affect the timing and success of the integration of the acquired assets. Moreover, it underscores the importance of legal due diligence in mitigating risks associated with acquisitions, such as potential liabilities or disputes that could arise post-transaction. 04/03/2024 - 12:05 PM TORONTO, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alamos Gold Inc. (TSX:AGI; NYSE:AGI) (“Alamos” or the “Company”) today reported the completion of the previously announced acquisition (the “Transaction”) of all the issued and outstanding common shares of Orford Mining Corporation (TSXV:ORM) (“Orford Mining”).

Financial Analyst The introduction of AccelerateTM Pay by Synovus represents a strategic move to enhance its treasury and payment solutions. This innovation is a response to the growing demand for digital payment options in the commercial banking sector. By offering a range of payment types and the flexibility for payees to choose their preferred method, Synovus is positioning itself to capitalize on the shift away from traditional check payments, which can be seen as a step towards operational efficiency and cost reduction.From a financial perspective, the adoption of such technologies can lead to a decrease in transaction processing costs and an improvement in cash flow management. For investors, this could translate into improved profitability and potentially a more favorable position in the market for Synovus. However, the upfront costs associated with the development and implementation of such a system, as well as the competitive landscape of payment solutions, should be considered when evaluating the potential financial impact. Market Research Analyst Accelerate Pay's market impact hinges on its ability to differentiate Synovus in a crowded field of financial institutions offering payment solutions. The partnership with Echo Health Inc. and DPX Payments LLC could be a strategic move to leverage external expertise and technology, potentially speeding up market penetration and adoption rates. The hands-free payment origination and account reconciliation features, coupled with easy integration, are designed to attract commercial clients who seek to streamline their payment processes.Long-term, the success of Accelerate Pay will depend on user experience, reliability and the solution's ability to evolve with the payments industry. If Synovus can ensure a seamless transition for clients and maintain robust fraud mitigation, it could see an uptick in client retention and attraction of new business. This could have a positive impact on Synovus' market share within the business-to-business payment solutions space.

As businesses increasingly move away from checks, which are susceptible to fraud, the demand for secure electronic payment solutions is rising. A robust cybersecurity framework is essential, not only to protect client transactions but also to maintain trust and the company's reputation.Investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with cyber threats and the implications they have on the financial health of a company.
