If approved, sparsentan will be the first non-immunosuppressive, single-molecule, dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist for IgAN patients. The decision is expected in Q2 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recommendation by the CHMP for the approval of sparsentan represents a significant milestone for both Travere Therapeutics and the medical community involved in treating IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The potential market authorization in Europe could open a new revenue stream for Travere Therapeutics, considering the current lack of non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN in the region. The dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist mechanism of sparsentan offers a novel approach that, as suggested by the PROTECT study, may reduce proteinuria more effectively than the standard care, potentially slowing the progression to kidney failure.From a medical research perspective, the approval could encourage further studies into dual-action drugs and validate the efficacy of this treatment approach. The long-term benefits, such as delaying kidney failure, could translate into reduced healthcare costs associated with kidney disease management. However, it's crucial to monitor post-marketing data to ensure the efficacy and safety profile remains consistent with the study findings. Market Research Analyst As sparsentan is poised to become the first of its kind in the European market, it is important to evaluate the market potential and competitive landscape. The Orphan Medicinal Product Designation previously granted by the European Commission underlines the unmet medical need and could provide certain incentives, such as market exclusivity, which may positively influence the stock performance of Travere Therapeutics. The partnership with CSL Vifor could also leverage their established European presence for effective commercialization.Investors should note that the European Commission's final decision in Q2 2024 will be a critical factor in determining the drug's impact on the market. Moreover, the existing commercialization rights granted to CSL Vifor for other regions like Australia and New Zealand hint at a strategic approach to global market penetration, which could further bolster the company's financial outlook. Healthcare Economist The introduction of sparsentan into the European market could have significant economic implications for the healthcare system, particularly in the treatment of rare diseases like IgAN. The cost-effectiveness of sparsentan will be an important consideration, as rare disease treatments often come with high price tags. A reduction in the progression to kidney failure could mean considerable savings in terms of dialysis and transplantation costs. However, it's also necessary to weigh these potential savings against the drug's pricing strategy and reimbursement policies across different European health systems.Furthermore, the conditional marketing authorization suggests that additional data may be required to confirm the drug's benefit-risk profile, which could entail further investment in clinical research. This conditional status and any subsequent data requirements could influence investor sentiment and the long-term financial sustainability of the drug's market presence. 02/23/2024 - 02:00 AM Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommends approval of the conditional marketing authorization (CMA) for sparsentan for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Europe Positive CHMP opinion is based on pivotal phase-III PROTECT study results European Commission decision is expected in Q2 2024 ST. GALLEN, Switzerland, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CSL Vifor and Travere Therapeutics, Inc., (NASDAQ: TVTX) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) CHMP has recommended approval of sparsentan for the treatment of adults with primary IgAN with a urine protein excretion >1.0 g/day (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.75 g/g). IgAN is a rare kidney disorder and a leading cause of kidney failure. The CHMP opinion provides the basis for the European Commission's final decision regarding CMA for sparsentan. If approved in Europe, sparsentan will be the first non-immunosuppressive, single-molecule, dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist for the treatment of IgAN. ""The positive CHMP opinion for sparsentan is one step closer to bringing this treatment option to patients in Europe with IgAN, a rare and serious condition that can cause kidney disease,"" said Emmanuelle Lecomte Brisset, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Regulatory Affairs at CSL. ""We look forward to the European Commission decision and to continuing to advance CSL's promise to provide innovative treatments for patients with kidney disease."" ""The positive recommendation from the CHMP represents a significant advancement towards the delivery of new treatment options for people living with IgAN, who face the risk of progression to kidney failure and who currently have no approved non-immunosuppressive treatment options. The PROTECT Study is the only head-to-head study in IgAN against a maximally labeled dose of irbesartan, a current standard of care. The study demonstrated treatment with sparsentan resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in proteinuria and has the potential to preserve kidney function and significantly delay time to kidney failure compared to an active comparator, suggesting long-term benefits in IgAN,"" said Eric Dube, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Travere Therapeutics. ""Together with CSL Vifor, we look forward to the European Commission's decision in the second quarter of 2024."" The positive CHMP opinion is based on results from the pivotal phase-III PROTECT study of sparsentan in IgAN, In August 2022, CSL Vifor and Travere Therapeutics announced they had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for CMA to the EMA. The European Commission previously granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN. If approved, sparsentan would receive a CMA in all member states of the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Sparsentan is currently marketed in the U.S. and granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the brand name FILSPARI® based on reduction in proteinuria. In 2021, Travere Therapeutics granted CSL Vifor exclusive commercialization rights for sparsentan in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

About IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) IgAN, also called Berger's disease, is a rare progressive kidney disease characterized by the buildup of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a protein that helps the body fight infections, in the kidneys. The deposits of IgA cause a breakdown of the normal filtering mechanisms in the kidney, leading to blood in the urine (hematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria) and a progressive loss of kidney function. Other symptoms of IgAN may include swelling (edema) and high blood pressure. IgAN is the most common type of primary glomerular disease worldwide and a leading cause of kidney failure. IgAN is estimated to affect up to 250,000 people in the licensed territories. About the PROTECT study The PROTECT Study is one of the largest interventional studies to date in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and the only head-to-head trial in this rare kidney disease. It is a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 400 mg of sparsentan, compared to 300 mg of irbesartan, in 404 patients ages 18 years and up with IgAN and persistent proteinuria despite receiving maximum tolerated dose and at least ­50% of maximum labelled dose of ACE or ARB therapy. About sparsentan Sparsentan is a novel, non-immunosuppressive, single-molecule, dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist with high selectivity for the endothelin A receptor (ETAR) and the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R). Pre-clinical data have shown that blockade of both endothelin type A and angiotensin II type 1 pathways in forms of rare chronic kidney disease, protects podocytes, prevents glomerulosclerosis and mesangial cell proliferation, and reduces proteinuria. Sparsentan is currently available in the US and was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in February 2023 under the brand name FILSPARI® based on reduction in proteinuria. In September 2023, Travere Therapeutics reported two-year confirmatory results from the Phase 3 PROTECT Study of FILSPARI in IgAN.

The charterer has the option to extend the period until 2029, providing firm charter coverage for the company. CEO Øystein Kalleklev expresses satisfaction with the decision. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The extension of the Time Charter for Flex Courageous until the first quarter of 2027 by a super major represents a significant vote of confidence in Flex LNG Ltd. from a key customer. This development is indicative of stable and predictable revenue streams for Flex LNG over the medium term. The company's high charter coverage of approximately 94% for the remainder of 2024 demonstrates robust demand for its services and provides a cushion against market volatility. Furthermore, the timing of the Flex Constellation coming open aligns with the seasonal tightening of the freight market, potentially allowing Flex LNG to capitalize on higher rates.From a market perspective, this extension could be interpreted as a bullish signal for the LNG shipping sector, suggesting that super majors are expecting continued demand for LNG transport over the next several years. This may also reflect broader trends in the energy market, such as the growing reliance on LNG as a transition fuel amidst global decarbonization efforts. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the charter extension for Flex Courageous are multifaceted. On one hand, the extension provides revenue visibility and financial stability, which is favorable for the company's cash flow projections and debt servicing capabilities. On the other hand, the fixed nature of a Time Charter can limit upside potential should market rates increase significantly beyond the agreed charter rate. Investors should consider the balance between stability and potential opportunity cost associated with such long-term contracts.Additionally, the final option for a further extension until 2029 introduces an element of contractual flexibility that may be advantageous for Flex LNG in terms of long-term planning and fleet utilization. It is important for investors to monitor the utilization rates and day rates for the company's fleet, as these are critical indicators of financial health in the shipping industry. Energy Sector Analyst The decision by a super major to extend the Time Charter for an LNG carrier like Flex Courageous reflects broader trends in the energy sector, particularly the increasing global demand for liquefied natural gas as countries seek to diversify their energy mix. The extension suggests that LNG will continue to play a pivotal role in the energy transition and shipping companies that can provide reliable transport will benefit. It is also indicative of the strategic importance of securing LNG shipping capacity in advance, given the long lead times and capital-intensive nature of the industry.The LNG shipping market is sensitive to fluctuations in LNG supply and demand, geopolitical developments and changes in trade patterns. As such, the charter extension is a positive sign for the stability of the sector, but stakeholders must remain vigilant to the dynamic factors that could impact the industry in the long term. 02/23/2024 - 12:59 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Flex LNG Ltd. («Flex LNG» or «Company») (NYSE: FLNG) (OSE: FLNG) has received notice that the charterer of Flex Courageous, a super major, has exercised its first extension option. Flex Courageous was fixed on a three-year Time Charter on November 1, 2021, together with Flex Resolute which was also recently extended by two years until 2027. The commencement of the Time Charter for Flex Courageous was February 2022. Under the Time Charter, the charterer has the option to extend the period by two consecutive two year periods.

The notes will bear interest at 4.00% per year, mature on March 1, 2030, and be convertible into cash, shares of Sunrun's common stock, or a combination of both. Positive Sunrun Inc. successfully priced $475 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private placement. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year and mature on March 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The initial conversion rate will be 61.3704 shares of Sunrun's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, with an initial conversion price of approximately $16.29 per share. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Sunrun's common stock, or a combination of both at Sunrun's election. Sunrun estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $462.8 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses. Sunrun intends to use the net proceeds for various purposes, including repurchasing its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, paying the cost of capped call transactions, and repaying outstanding debt for general corporate purposes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Sunrun entered into capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution to its common stock upon conversion of notes. The notes and shares of Sunrun's common stock issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $475 million in convertible senior notes by Sunrun Inc. presents a strategic financial move aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. The interest rate of 4.00% per annum is relatively modest, reflecting a favorable credit view from investors and potentially signifying a stable interest rate environment or a strong company credit profile.Convertible notes offer a dual advantage to investors: fixed income through interest payments and the potential upside through conversion to equity. The conversion premium of 27.5% over the current stock price indicates confidence in the company's future growth. However, it also dilutes existing shareholders' equity if a significant number of notes are converted into stock. The capped call transactions are a prudent hedge by the company to limit dilution and cash payout upon conversion, reflecting sophisticated financial management.The use of proceeds to repurchase existing debt, particularly the 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, suggests an active liability management strategy. This could be viewed positively by the market as it indicates a proactive approach to managing debt maturities and reducing future refinancing risk. Market Research Analyst Sunrun's move to issue convertible notes and repurchase existing debt indicates a broader industry trend where companies in the renewable energy sector are seeking to strengthen their balance sheets amidst a competitive market. The renewable energy market is capital intensive and such financial maneuvers are critical for funding ongoing operations and expansion projects.The terms of the convertible notes, including the interest rate and conversion premium, will likely be scrutinized by investors as benchmarks for the sector's cost of capital. The market's reaction to the pricing and terms of the notes could influence the stock price in the short term, as well as set a precedent for similar future offerings by other companies within the industry. Legal Expert The private placement of convertible notes to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A highlights the regulatory framework that companies must navigate when raising capital. The exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act allows for a more expedited and less public offering process, which can be advantageous for companies seeking to raise capital quickly and with less disclosure than a public offering.However, the legal stipulations also limit the secondary market for the notes, as they cannot be readily sold to the general public without registration or an applicable exemption. This could affect liquidity and pricing of the notes in the secondary market. The inclusion of a 'fundamental change' repurchase provision is a standard protective measure for investors, allowing them to exit their investment under certain predefined corporate events that could significantly affect the value of their investment. 02/23/2024 - 12:36 AM SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrun Inc. (Nasdaq: RUN) (“Sunrun”) today announced the pricing of $475 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Sunrun also granted the initial purchasers of the notes the option to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The notes will be issued at an offering price of 99.75%. The sale of the notes is expected to close on February 27, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Sunrun. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The initial conversion rate will be 61.3704 shares of Sunrun’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $16.29 per share of Sunrun’s common stock). The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 27.5% over the $12.78 per share last reported sale price of Sunrun’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 22, 2024. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Sunrun’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Sunrun’s common stock, at Sunrun’s election. Sunrun will not be able to redeem the notes prior to March 5, 2027. On or after March 5, 2027, Sunrun may redeem the notes at its option if the last reported sale price of Sunrun’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading-day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Sunrun provides notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occurs at any time prior to the maturity date, holders of the notes may require Sunrun to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events or if Sunrun issues a notice of redemption, Sunrun will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption. Sunrun estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $462.8 million (or $536.0 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by Sunrun. Sunrun intends to use (i) approximately $83.3 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase approximately $97.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”), which Sunrun offered to purchase at 85.5% and which is equal to approximately $855 per each of the 2026 notes, in privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the offering effected with or through one of the initial purchasers of the notes or its affiliate, (ii) approximately $37.7 million of the net proceeds of the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions, and (iii) the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding debt and for other general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions and future transactions. However, it has not designated any specific uses and has no definitive agreements with respect to any material acquisition or strategic transaction. Holders of the 2026 notes that are repurchased in the concurrent repurchases described above may purchase shares of the common stock in the open market to unwind any hedge positions they may have with respect to the 2026 notes. These activities may increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the trading price of the common stock and the initial conversion price of the notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Sunrun entered into capped call transactions (the “capped call transactions”) with certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Sunrun’s common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Sunrun is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap initially equal to approximately $22.37 per share (which represents a premium of approximately 75% over the last reported sale price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 22, 2024), subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Sunrun expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Sunrun’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Sunrun’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Sunrun’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Sunrun’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling Sunrun’s common stock or other securities of Sunrun in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the observation period for conversions of notes following December 1, 2029 and, to the extent that Sunrun unwinds a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions, following an early conversion of notes or repurchase or redemption of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Sunrun’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of its notes. Neither the notes, nor any shares of Sunrun’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, have been, nor will be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

This is a strategic move to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, as the new notes have a lower interest rate of 0.625% per year.The decision to enter into capped call transactions is a proactive measure to minimize dilution from the conversion of the new notes, which is beneficial for existing shareholders. The initial conversion rate, combined with the capped call transactions, suggests that Lyft is confident about its future stock performance, as it sets a higher threshold for conversion that could potentially limit dilution.The use of the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, indicates an aggressive growth strategy, which could be appealing to investors looking for companies with a clear roadmap for expansion. Market Research Analyst Lyft's entry into the convertible debt market can be interpreted as a signal of its long-term strategic planning. The repurchase of shares of Class A common stock from institutional investors, concurrent with the note offering, suggests an effort to consolidate ownership and possibly stabilize the stock's market performance. The repurchase also reflects management's belief that the stock is undervalued, which could be an indicator of confidence to investors.However, the market's reaction to such financial instruments can be unpredictable. While the capped call transactions aim to reduce potential dilution and stabilize the stock price, these transactions are complex and may be misunderstood by the average investor. The impact on Lyft's stock price will depend on how the market perceives the company's future growth prospects and its ability to meet debt obligations while funding its strategic initiatives. Legal Expert Lyft's choice to offer the notes through a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A is a common practice that allows for faster and more efficient capital raising without the need for a public registration statement. However, this limits the pool of potential investors to a more sophisticated audience that understands the risks associated with such securities.The legal structure of the notes, including provisions regarding redemption and repurchase upon a fundamental change, offers protections for both Lyft and the noteholders. The detailed terms of conversion, redemption and the capped call transactions demonstrate Lyft's efforts to maintain legal and financial flexibility while managing potential risks associated with equity price fluctuations. 02/23/2024 - 01:08 AM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”) (NASDAQ: LYFT) today announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Lyft also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date Lyft first issues the notes, up to an additional $60 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on February 27, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $389.6 million in net proceeds to Lyft after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by Lyft (assuming no exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional notes). The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Lyft. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.625% per year. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. Lyft may not redeem the notes prior to March 5, 2027. Lyft may redeem for cash all or any portion (subject to certain limitations) of the notes, at its option, on or after March 5, 2027 and prior to the 31st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of Lyft’s Class A common stock (“Class A common stock”) has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Lyft provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day preceding the date on which Lyft provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes, which means that Lyft is not required to redeem or retire the notes periodically. Holders of the notes will have the right to require Lyft to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with certain corporate events or if Lyft calls any notes for redemption, Lyft will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for noteholders who elect to convert their notes in connection with any of such corporate events or convert their notes called for redemption. The notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 47.4366 shares of Class A common stock, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.08 per share, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 32.5% to the last reported sale price of $15.91 per share of the Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 22, 2024). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2028, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after December 1, 2028 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions. Upon conversion, Lyft will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at Lyft’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Lyft entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the notes sold in the offering. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Lyft elects to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $31.82 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock of $15.91 per share on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 22, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. Lyft intends to use (1) approximately $350 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase approximately $356.8 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (“2025 notes”) in separate and privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the offering with certain holders of its 2025 notes (the “concurrent note repurchases”) effected through one of the initial purchasers of the notes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent, (2) the remaining net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to pay the $41.6 million cost of the capped call transactions described above, and (3) approximately $50 million of cash on hand to purchase approximately 3.14 million shares of the Class A common stock from institutional investors at the closing price on February 22, 2024 through one of the initial purchasers of the notes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Lyft expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Lyft intends to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of additional 2025 notes, working capital, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. From time to time Lyft evaluates potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. However, Lyft has not designated any specific uses and has no current agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or strategic transactions. Certain holders of any 2025 notes that Lyft agreed to repurchase may have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such 2025 notes and may, concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying Lyft’s Class A common stock and/or entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Lyft’s Class A common stock. Any repurchase of the 2025 notes, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2025 notes participating in the concurrent note repurchases, together with the repurchase by Lyft of Class A common stock concurrently with the pricing of the notes, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Lyft’s Class A common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes at that time and may have increased the initial conversion price of the notes. Lyft cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes or our Class A common stock. Lyft has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Class A common stock or other securities of Lyft in secondary market transactions from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion, repurchase or redemption of the notes, to the extent Lyft exercises the relevant election under the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following a conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The notes were and will only be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.

The company maintains a positive outlook for FY24 and beyond, focusing on strategic acquisitions and market activations. Positive CCEP demonstrates a 5.5% revenue growth in FY 2023 compared to the previous year, reaching €18,302 million. Operating profit increased by 12.0% to €2,339 million, with a 9.5% growth in diluted EPS to €3.71. The company's free cash flow stands at €1,734 million, supporting a dividend per share of €1.84. CCEP highlights successful in-market execution and brand partnerships contributing to revenue and margin growth. The acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines strengthens the company's position and diversifies its portfolio. The CEO, Damian Gammell, expresses confidence in the company's future, emphasizing long-term investments and shareholder value. CCEP's inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index reflects the company's strong performance and growth prospects. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial metrics suggest a robust fiscal performance for the company, with a noted 5.5% increase in revenue and a 12.0% rise in operating profit on a reported basis. Notably, the operating margin has improved, indicating enhanced efficiency in operations and cost management. The free cash flow of €1,734M is particularly impressive, reflecting the company's ability to generate liquidity which can be pivotal for future investments or dividend payments. The dividend per share of €1.84, maintaining a payout ratio of approximately 50%, demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders while retaining sufficient capital for reinvestment. This balance is crucial in fostering investor confidence and supporting the stock price. The company's performance in Europe, with a 20.5% increase in operating profit, signifies strong regional growth, potentially making it an attractive area for investors focusing on geographic performance. Market Research Analyst The company's strategy of focusing on leading brands and solid in-market execution has yielded a positive outcome, as evidenced by the growth in revenue per unit case. This metric's rise suggests effective pricing and promotion strategies, which are critical in the consumer goods sector for maintaining competitive edge and market share. The acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines aligns with the company's expansion strategy, potentially opening up new market segments and contributing to long-term growth. Despite a slight decline in total volume, the increase in transactions over volume in developed markets indicates a shift towards higher-value products or more efficient sales strategies. This is a significant trend that can impact the company's revenue mix and profitability. The emphasis on premiumisation and affordability suggests a nuanced approach to consumer demand, which can be a differentiating factor in the highly competitive beverage industry. Economist The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, characterized by macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. The resilience shown in their financial results is commendable and indicates strong underlying fundamentals. However, investors should be cognizant of the potential risks posed by inflationary pressures on cost of sales and operating expenses. The company's proactive management of pricing and promotional spend in anticipation of such challenges is a prudent strategy. The focus on productivity to drive free cash flow is also a sustainable approach in the face of economic uncertainty. The recent inclusion into the Nasdaq 100 is a testament to the company's financial stability and growth prospects, potentially influencing investor sentiment and the stock's liquidity in the market. 02/23/2024 - 02:00 AM Preliminary unaudited results for the full year ended 31 December 2023Solid end to a great year, well placed for FY24 and beyondUXBRIDGE, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / (NASDAQ:CCEP)(LSE:CCEP) FY 2023 Metric[1]As Reported Comparable [1]Change vs 2022As ReportedComparable[1]Comparable Fx-Neutral [1]Total CCEPVolume (M UC)[2]3,279 3,279(0.5) %(0.5) % Revenue (€M)18,302 18,3025.5 %5.5 %8.0 %Cost of sales (€M)11,582 11,5764.5 %4.5 %6.5 %Operating expenses (€M)4,488 4,3536.0 %6.5 %8.5 %Operating profit (€M)2,339 2,37312.0 %11.0 %13.5 %Profit after taxes (€M)1,669 1,7019.5 %9.0 %11.5 %Diluted EPS (€)3.63 3.7110.5 %9.5 %12.0 %Revenue per UC[2] (€) 5.70 8.5 %Cost of sales per UC[2] (€) 3.61 7.5 %Comparable Free cash Flow (€M) 1,734 Dividend per share[3] (€) 1.84Maintained dividend payout ratio of c.50% EuropeVolume (M UC)[2]2,644 2,6440.5 %0.5 % Revenue (€M)14,553 14,5537.5 %7.5 %8.5 %Operating profit (€M)1,842 1,88820.5 %13.0 %14.0 %Revenue per UC[2] (€) 5.56 8.0 % APIVolume (M UC) [2]635 635(5.0) %(5.0) % Revenue (€M)3,749 3,749(1.0) %(1.0) %5.5 %Operating profit (€M)497 485(11.0) %3.5 %10.5 %Revenue per UC[2] (€) 6.30 11.0 %DAMIAN GAMMELL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SAID:""2023 was a great year for CCEP.

Positive Positive results from two Phase 3 trials led to Priority Review by the FDA for Dupixent in a potential sixth indication for COPD. Dupixent could become the sole biologic therapy for COPD and introduce a new treatment approach after more than ten years. Regulatory submissions for Dupixent are also being reviewed in China and Europe. Dupixent is currently the leading biologic treatment for all five of its FDA-approved indications in new-to-brand prescriptions in the U.S. The Phase 3 COPD clinical research program showed Dupixent reduced annualized COPD exacerbations by 30% and 34% in the BOREAS and NOTUS trials, respectively, compared to placebo. Dupixent demonstrated rapid and sustained improvements in lung function compared to placebo over 52 weeks. Safety results for Dupixent in COPD trials were consistent with its known safety profile in approved indications. Priority Review signifies the potential for significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Dupixent's use in COPD is still under clinical development, with safety and efficacy yet to be fully evaluated by regulatory authorities. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) by the FDA for a new indication of Dupixent is a pivotal development for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi. In particular, the data indicating a 30% to 34% reduction in annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations is significant. This surpasses many existing treatments, which generally offer more modest improvements. The sustained lung function improvements observed at 52 weeks also suggest a potential for long-term patient benefits, which is crucial for chronic conditions like COPD.However, it is important to note that the safety profile, while generally consistent with existing approvals, did include adverse events such as back pain and headaches. These will need to be considered by physicians and patients when weighing treatment options, especially given the chronic nature of the therapy. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the approval of Dupixent for COPD could significantly expand its addressable market. COPD is a prevalent condition with a high unmet medical need and the introduction of a biologic therapy would represent a substantial advancement. Dupixent's performance in the market to date, leading in new-to-brand prescriptions for its current indications, positions it well for rapid uptake in the COPD segment.The fact that regulatory submissions are also under review in China and Europe indicates a strategic move to capture global market share. This could lead to increased revenue streams for both Regeneron and Sanofi, potentially impacting their stock valuations positively if the approvals go through. Financial Analyst The Priority Review status not only highlights the potential clinical benefits of Dupixent for COPD but also suggests a faster-than-normal review process, which could lead to an earlier market entry and revenue generation. The target action date set for June 27, 2024, provides a clear timeline for investors to monitor. If approved, Dupixent would be the first new treatment approach for COPD in over a decade, potentially giving Regeneron and Sanofi a competitive edge in this therapeutic area.Investors should monitor the progress of the sBLA in other regions such as China and Europe, as approvals in these markets could further influence the financial outlook for the companies involved. It is also critical to track post-marketing safety data and real-world efficacy, as these will influence long-term sales and the potential for label expansion. 02/23/2024 - 01:00 AM Priority Review granted based on positive results from two Phase 3 trials; if approved, Dupixent would be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade Regulatory submissions are also under review in China and Europe Dupixent is the leading biologic treatment for all five of its FDA-approved indications in new-to-brand prescriptions in the U.S. TARRYTOWN, N.Y. and PARIS, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in a sixth potential indication as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The target action date for the FDA decision is June 27, 2024. Regulatory submissions are under review in China and Europe. The sBLA, as well as other submissions around the world, is supported by data from the Phase 3 COPD clinical research program evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e., blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both trials (BOREAS, NOTUS), showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by 30% and 34%, respectively, compared to placebo. In both trials, Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo, with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were back pain, COVID-19, diarrhea, headache and nasopharyngitis. Priority Review is granted to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy for this indication have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough, breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, but can also lead to anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S., approximately 300,000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab. Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation, with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, prurigo nodularis or CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. Approximately 800,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally. About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn). Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Market Research Analyst The completion of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, Inc. represents a strategic move to expand its market presence in Southeast Asia. The 60:40 ownership structure between CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. suggests a collaborative approach to governance, which could foster localized decision-making and potentially enhance market responsiveness.The acquisition's valuation at $1.8 billion on a debt-free, cash-free basis indicates a significant investment, which is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share (EPS). This suggests a positive outlook for CCEP's profitability. The transaction will also diversify CCEP's portfolio within the newly named APS (Australia, Pacific & South East Asia) business segment, which could mitigate risks associated with market concentration and enhance the company's ability to capture growth in emerging markets. Financial Analyst Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' financial strategy in funding the acquisition through existing liquidity and incremental borrowing is noteworthy. The modest impact on CCEP's leverage, which closed FY23 at the top end of its mid-term guided range of 3.0 times Net Debt to Comparable EBITDA, suggests prudent financial management. Investors should monitor the integration process and the company's ability to maintain or improve its leverage ratios post-acquisition.The provided FY23 adjusted financial information, which includes selected metrics such as Revenue and Operating Profit, offers investors a clearer picture of the financial implications of the acquisition. The reported increase in revenue to approximately $1.91 billion and operating profit to approximately $115 million for CCBPI in FY23, when consolidated with CCEP, demonstrates the subsidiary's strong performance and the potential for positive financial synergies. Economist The acquisition underlines CCEP's long-term growth strategy, which is focused on driving shareholder value through geographical and product diversification. The APS region's economic growth prospects and the beverage industry's dynamics in Southeast Asia could provide a conducive environment for CCEP's expansion. The partnership with AEV, a leading local conglomerate, could facilitate market penetration and operational efficiencies, leveraging local expertise.It is essential to consider the broader economic implications, such as consumer behavior trends, regulatory environments and competitive landscapes, which could influence the success of the acquisition. The ability of CCEP to integrate and align CCBPI's operations with its strategic objectives will be critical in realizing the anticipated growth and profitability enhancements. 02/23/2024 - 02:00 AM UXBRIDGE, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) (NASDAQ:CCEP)(LSE:CCEP) today confirms it has, together with Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

(CCBPI) from The Coca-Cola Company (KO)• Further to the announcements on 2 August 2023, 20 November 2023 and 30 January 2024 (see links below), CCEP today announces it has, together with AEV, completed the acquisition to jointly acquire 100% of CCBPI from KO• The key terms of the Share Purchase Agreement comprise:◦ 60:40 ownership structure between CCEP and AEV with comprehensive governance arrangements in place◦ Valuation of 100% of CCBPI at $1.8 billion on a debt-free, cash-free basis• To aid comparability, FY23 adjusted financial information for selected metrics is provided in this releaseThe acquisition builds on CCEP's successful expansion into Australia, Pacific & Indonesia (API) in 2021, further strengthens its partnership with KO and supports its long-term growth strategy and focus on driving shareholder value.CCEP's acquisition of CCBPI, with AEV, one of the leading conglomerates in the local market, is a great opportunity to co-own an established, well-run business with attractive profitability and growth prospects.The transaction is thus immediately EPS accretive and creates an even more diverse footprint for CCEP within its existing API business segment, from now on renamed APS (Australia, Pacific & South East Asia). It provides the opportunity to leverage best practice and talent, including supporting Indonesia's transformation journey. It is therefore aligned with CCEP's aim of driving sustainable and stronger growth through diversification and scale, and underpins the company's mid-term strategic objectives.As CCEP will control the majority (60%) of CCBPI, it will consolidate CCBPI as of the acquisition date and establish a non-controlling interest representing AEV's minority interest (40%). CCBPI delivered ~$1.91 billion (~€1.7 billion1) of Revenue and ~$1151 million (~€105 million1) of Operating Profit in FY23.The transaction consideration has been funded through existing liquidity and incremental borrowing. It will have a modest impact on CCEP's leverage, having closed FY23 at the top end of its mid-term guided range of 3.0 times Net Debt to Comparable EBITDA2.[1] Amounts represent CCBPI's unaudited results prepared in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) which will be filed with the registrar in due course. These unaudited results have been presented as if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023 and have been adjusted for provisional acquisition accounting adjustments, CCEP IFRS accounting policy reclassifications and the impact of debt financing costs in connection with the acquisition, excluding items impacting comparability. CCBPI translated from Euros to US Dollars using the average exchange rate for the period of 1.09.[2] Adjusted for items impacting comparability.

The company granted an option to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The offering is expected to close on February 27, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s announcement of a $1.5 billion convertible senior notes offering, with an option for an additional $225 million, is a significant capital market transaction that could influence the company's capital structure and financial flexibility. The use of convertible notes, which can be converted into equity at a later date, often reflects a strategic financing decision that balances dilution and capital cost. The initial conversion premium of approximately 37.5% above the current stock price suggests confidence in the company's future stock performance, indicating an expectation of stock price appreciation.From a financial analyst's perspective, the decision to enter into capped call transactions is a hedge against dilution for existing shareholders. The capped call transactions, by potentially offsetting dilution upon conversion, can be seen as a move to protect shareholder value while still raising necessary capital. The cap price, set at a 100% premium to the current stock price, further emphasizes expectations for substantial stock growth. However, this transaction could also signal that the company is seeking to take advantage of favorable market conditions or has significant capital needs that may not be fully apparent to the market.The net proceeds of approximately $1.47 billion to $1.70 billion, after accounting for the cost of the capped call transactions, will bolster the company's liquidity and support its general corporate purposes, including working capital for growth and business expansion. This influx of capital can be a positive signal to investors regarding the company's growth prospects but also warrants monitoring for how effectively the capital is deployed to generate returns. Market Research Analyst The issuance of convertible notes by Super Micro Computer, Inc. is a strategic move within the IT solutions sector, which is characterized by rapid innovation and the need for continuous investment in research and development. The company's focus on AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge technologies positions it within high-growth markets, where access to capital is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and funding expansion efforts.Market research analysts would examine the potential impact of this capital raise on the company's market positioning, particularly how the additional funds could enable Super Micro to accelerate its product development cycles, expand its market reach, or invest in strategic partnerships. The IT solutions industry is experiencing intense competition and consolidation and Super Micro's ability to successfully leverage the raised capital could determine its long-term market share and revenue growth. The timing and size of the offering might also reflect an assessment of market conditions and the company's capital needs in relation to its growth trajectory and investment opportunities. Legal Expert The legal aspects of Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s convertible notes offering are critical to ensuring compliance with securities regulations. The offering is being made to 'qualified institutional buyers' under Rule 144A, which allows for the sale of securities to sophisticated institutional investors without the need for a public offering registration. This approach is often faster and less costly than a public offering, but it limits the potential investor base.Additionally, the legal stipulations surrounding the capped call transactions and the convertible notes' terms, including the conversion rate, conversion price and conditions for redemption and repurchase, are complex contractual elements that require careful structuring to align with the company's strategic financing goals and protect against legal risks. The legal framework governing these transactions must also account for potential adjustments and the rights of noteholders in the event of a fundamental change, ensuring that all actions are within the bounds of the Securities Act and other relevant laws. 02/23/2024 - 12:18 AM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) (“Supermicro” or the “Company”), a Total IT Solution Manufacturer for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are being offered and sold to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also granted a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The Convertible Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 0.7455 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1,341.38 per share of the Company’s common stock, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 37.5% above the closing price of $975.52 per share of the Company’s common stock on February 22, 2024). The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 1, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding the applicable repurchase date. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The Company expects to close the offering on February 27, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions. In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially $1,951.04 per share of the Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 100% above the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq on February 22, 2024, and is subject to customary adjustments. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company's common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of the Convertible Notes by the Company to the extent the Company elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect noteholders’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Company will receive net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.47 billion (or approximately $1.70 billion if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in full). The Company expects to use $123.6 million (or approximately $142.1 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in full) of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund working capital for growth and business expansion. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional Convertible Notes to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offer of these securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Forward-looking Statements: This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding the planned offering. Words such as “anticipates,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “will,” “believes” and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs about future events and are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except as required by law, the Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, subsequent events or otherwise. With respect to the planned offering, such uncertainties and circumstances include whether the Company will offer the notes or consummate the offering; and the anticipated terms of the notes and the use of the net proceeds from the offering. Various factors could also adversely affect the Company’s operations, business or financial results in the future and cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed in detail in the “Risk Factors” sections contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 and the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Renesas Announces Termination of Memorandum of Understanding and Tender Offer for Proposed Acquisition of Sequans,2024-02-23T04:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Renesas Electronics Corporation terminates MOU with Sequans Communications S.A. regarding a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares at $0.7575 per share.,"Renesas Announces Termination of Memorandum of Understanding and Tender Offer for Proposed Acquisition of Sequans Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Renesas Electronics Corporation terminates MOU with Sequans Communications S.A. regarding a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares at $0.7575 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The termination of the MOU between Renesas and Sequans Communications represents a significant shift in the strategic direction of both companies. Renesas, a major player in the semiconductor industry, backing out of a tender offer can reflect changes in market conditions, reassessment of the deal's value, or potential integration challenges. Investors should consider the implications on Renesas's growth strategy, as acquiring Sequans could have provided access to complementary technologies and expanded market share.On the other hand, this decision may impact Sequans's financial stability and future prospects, as the acquisition could have offered a liquidity event for shareholders and additional resources for expansion. The offered price per share and ADS also warrants attention; it may have been a premium over the market price or undervalued, affecting shareholder reception and the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The cancellation of the acquisition deal could signal industry trends, such as a cooling off in merger and acquisition (M&A) activity within the tech sector, particularly in semiconductors. It is essential to analyze the broader market implications, including how the termination might affect investor sentiment toward both companies and the sector at large. Renesas's decision might be interpreted as a cautious move amidst global economic uncertainties or a response to regulatory hurdles, which could have broader implications for cross-border M&A activities.Furthermore, examining the competitive landscape is crucial. If Renesas was seeking to enhance its capabilities in a particular technology area through the acquisition, it is now pertinent to assess their current positioning and whether they will seek alternative paths to achieve their strategic goals. Legal Expert The termination of a Memorandum of Understanding, particularly in the context of a tender offer, often involves complex legal considerations. These could include the terms of the MOU, such as breakup fees, exclusivity periods and any conditions precedent that were not met. Stakeholders should consider whether there are any legal ramifications for either company, including potential financial penalties or obligations to third parties.Additionally, it is important to examine the regulatory environment that may have influenced the decision to terminate the MOU. For instance, changes in antitrust laws, foreign investment regulations, or other legal barriers could have played a role and could inform future deal-making strategies for companies in this sector. 02/22/2024 - 11:00 PM TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE: 6723, “Renesas”) today announced that it has terminated the previously announced Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) between Renesas and Sequans Communications S.A. (NYSE: SQNS, “Sequans”), pursuant to which Renesas had made a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Sequans for $0.7575 per ordinary share and American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) of Sequans for $3.03 per ADS (each ADS representing four ordinary shares) in cash. The previously announced tender offer has also been terminated by Renesas. Under the terms of the MOU, either Renesas or Sequans can terminate the MOU if, among other reasons, Renesas receives a confirmation from the National Tax Agency of Japan that consummation of the reorganization provided in the MOU would require Renesas to recognize taxable gain and pay such tax under Article 66-6 of Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxations of Japan (an “Adverse Japanese Tax Ruling”). On February 15, 2024, Renesas received an Adverse Japanese Tax Ruling. As a result, Renesas exercised its right to terminate the MOU, and as a result of such termination, the tender offer has also been terminated. As a result of the termination of the MOU and termination of the tender offer, no ordinary shares or ADSs of Sequans will be purchased by Renesas in the tender offer and all ordinary shares and ADSs previously tendered but not withdrawn will be promptly returned. The termination will not have material impact on Renesas’ core strategy of driving its technologies into higher growth industries. Renesas continues to see significant opportunities from cellular IoT technology and intends to build on the momentum through its partnership with Sequans. This communication constitutes a formal notification of the expiration of the tender offer and a formal notification that Renesas will not accept for purchase any ordinary shares or ADSs of Sequans tendered in connection with the tender offer. This communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities of Renesas.

The offering is expected to close on February 27, 2024, to finance the acquisition of Axonics, Inc. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of notes by Boston Scientific Corporation's finance subsidiary is a significant event that reflects the company's capital structure strategy. The issuance of €2 billion in notes at interest rates of 3.375% and 3.500% for 5 and 8-year maturities, respectively, indicates a proactive approach to managing long-term debt and financing major acquisitions. This move is likely to be scrutinized for its impact on the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, which are vital indicators of financial health in the medical devices industry.Investors and analysts will be keen to assess the terms of the offering in comparison to the industry's average cost of debt, as well as the potential effects on Boston Scientific's credit rating. The use of proceeds to fund the acquisition of Axonics, Inc. suggests a strategic expansion that could enhance the company's market position in neuromodulation, a field with growing demand. However, the added debt load will require careful monitoring of the company's cash flow generation and profit margins to maintain financial stability. Market Research Analyst The strategic acquisition of Axonics, Inc. by Boston Scientific Corporation, partially funded through this note offering, underscores the competitive dynamics within the medical technology sector. Axonics represents a valuable asset in the neuromodulation space, a market with significant growth prospects due to an aging population and the prevalence of chronic conditions that can benefit from such therapies.Market analysts will be evaluating the potential synergies that the acquisition could yield, such as expanded product portfolios and increased market share. Furthermore, the timing and size of the offering may reflect Boston Scientific's confidence in its ability to integrate Axonics and leverage its technologies effectively. The market's reaction to this offering could serve as an indicator of investor confidence in the company's strategic direction and its execution capabilities. Legal Expert The legal aspects of Boston Scientific's note offering, particularly the guarantees by the parent company and the adherence to SEC regulations, are crucial for ensuring investor protection and compliance with financial legislation. The full and unconditional guarantee by Boston Scientific provides a layer of security for investors, potentially making the notes more attractive and reducing the cost of capital for the company.Legal analysts will consider the implications of the offering's structure, including the registration statement and prospectus requirements. It is essential that all disclosures and terms comply with the securities laws to prevent legal challenges. The absence of an offer or solicitation in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful is a standard precaution to mitigate legal risk. The role of joint book-running managers, such as Barclays, Citigroup and Société Générale, further adds a layer of credibility and legal oversight to the transaction. 02/22/2024 - 09:27 PM MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (the ""Company"") (NYSE: BSX) today announced that American Medical Systems Europe B.V., its wholly owned finance subsidiary, has priced a public offering of €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due 2029 and €1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due 2032 (collectively, the ""Notes"").

(LGI) announces a monthly distribution of $0.10459 per share, payable on March 22, 2024. The distribution comprises 100% return of capital. The fund's 5-year average annual total return is 9.58%, with a current distribution rate of 7.13% of NAV as of January 31, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a monthly distribution by Lazard Global Total Return and Income Fund, Inc. is indicative of the fund's commitment to providing shareholders with regular income. The distribution policy is a critical aspect of the fund's appeal to income-focused investors. A financial analyst would scrutinize the distribution's sustainability by examining the source of the payout. In this case, the entire distribution is sourced from the return of capital rather than net income or capital gains, which could be a red flag. The return of capital indicates that the fund is not generating enough income or capital gains to cover the distributions and is instead returning investors' original investment capital.Furthermore, the fund's average annual total return of 9.58% over five years juxtaposed with an annualized current distribution rate of 7.13% of NAV suggests that the fund has historically provided a robust total return. However, the negative cumulative total return for the fiscal year to date (-1.26%) raises questions about the fund's recent performance and whether the high distribution rate is sustainable without eroding the principal over time. Investors should consider the long-term impact of these distributions on the fund's net asset value (NAV) and whether the fund's investment strategy aligns with their income and growth objectives. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the nature of the distribution is paramount. Since the current and cumulative distributions for the fiscal year have been characterized entirely as a return of capital, it implies that these payments are not immediately taxable as income. Instead, they reduce the cost basis of the investment, potentially resulting in higher capital gains taxes when shares are sold. This could be advantageous for shareholders seeking to defer taxes or manage their taxable income.However, it's crucial for shareholders to understand that a return of capital can alter the tax implications of their investment. Continuous return of capital distributions might lead to a situation where investors recover their entire cost basis, after which further distributions could be taxed as capital gains. Shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to understand the specific tax consequences of these distributions, especially if the return of capital is a significant portion of the total distributions received over time. Investment Strategist An investment strategist would evaluate the implications of the fund's distribution policy in the context of the current economic environment. The annualized distribution rate exceeding the cumulative total return suggests that the fund is distributing more than it earns, which might not be sustainable in the long run. This strategy could be part of a tactical approach to attract income-seeking investors during times of market volatility or low-interest rates. However, it may also signal that the fund's assets are being depleted faster than they are being replenished by investment income and realized gains.Investors should consider the fund's performance in relation to its peers and the broader market. A comprehensive analysis would include an assessment of the fund's underlying investments, the management team's expertise and the overall strategy to determine if the current distribution policy is aligned with the fund's long-term growth prospects. An investment strategist would also examine the potential for capital appreciation within the fund's portfolio, which could offset the distributions sourced from the return of capital and provide a more balanced total return to shareholders. 02/22/2024 - 08:36 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard Global Total Return and Income Fund, Inc. (the ""Fund"") (NYSE:LGI) is confirming today, pursuant to its Managed Distribution Policy, as previously authorized by its Board of Directors, a monthly distribution of $0.10459 per share on the Fund’s outstanding common stock.

The net proceeds will be used for long-term strategy, facility investments, expanding manufacturing capacity, strengthening the balance sheet, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions of an underwritten offering of 16,666,667 shares at $18.00 per share represents a significant capital raise for the company, with expected net proceeds of approximately $288 million. This capital infusion is noteworthy as it signals a strategic move by Kratos to strengthen its balance sheet and invest in long-term growth initiatives, such as expanding manufacturing capacity and funding capital expenditures for existing and potential new programs.An important aspect to consider is the dilutive effect of the new share issuance on existing shareholders. While the capital raised can fuel growth and potentially increase the company's value, the increase in outstanding shares can dilute earnings per share (EPS) in the short term. Investors will need to weigh the potential for enhanced future profitability against the immediate dilution.The granting of a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase an additional 2,500,000 shares could bring in additional capital if exercised but would further dilute current ownership. The use of proceeds for debt repayment is a prudent step, potentially reducing interest expenses and improving financial leverage ratios. Market Research Analyst Kratos operates in the defense and national security sector, which is characterized by long-term contracts and stable revenue streams, but also by high barriers to entry and significant capital requirements. The decision to expand manufacturing capacity and invest in high-probability pipeline opportunities suggests confidence in the company's competitive positioning and its ability to secure additional contracts.Market trends in defense spending, particularly in technology-driven sectors, will likely influence Kratos's performance. By shoring up its balance sheet and investing in growth, Kratos may be positioning itself to capitalize on increased defense budgets and the modernization of defense systems. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to win new contracts and effectively manage the scale-up of operations. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows Kratos to offer and sell securities in a more streamlined process. This method is often used by well-established companies seeking timely access to capital markets, which can be advantageous in seizing market opportunities or optimizing capital structure.It's also important to note the legal compliance aspect of the offering. The securities are being offered only through a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, ensuring transparency and adherence to SEC regulations. Prospective investors should review these documents to understand the risks and specifics of the offering.Finally, the fact that the offering is not open to jurisdictions where it is not permitted underscores the importance of complying with different securities laws, which can vary significantly across regions. 02/22/2024 - 07:45 PM SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (“Kratos”) (NASDAQ: KTOS), a Technology Company in the Defense, National Security and Global Markets, today announced the pricing of an underwritten offering of 16,666,667 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The net proceeds to Kratos from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, are expected to be approximately $288 million.

BorgWarner advises shareholders not to tender their shares due to the offer price being below the market value and subject to various conditions. Positive None. Negative The unsolicited mini-tender offer from TRC Capital Investment Corporation to purchase BorgWarner common stock at a discounted price could potentially undervalue the company's shares and negatively impact shareholder value. Financial Analyst Mini-tender offers such as the one from TRC Capital Investment Corporation represent a strategic attempt to acquire a stake in a company without triggering regulatory scrutiny that comes with larger tender offers. From a financial perspective, the offer price being at a 4.51% discount to the closing price prior to the offer suggests an undervaluation, which could be seen as opportunistic or predatory. It is common for companies to advise shareholders against such offers, as they may not be in the shareholders' best interests.Investors should consider the long-term implications of tendering their shares at a discount. While it may provide immediate liquidity, it could also mean relinquishing potential future gains if the company's stock price increases. Furthermore, the fact that the offer is subject to numerous conditions can introduce additional risks for shareholders who might be considering tendering their shares. Legal Expert Mini-tender offers like the one presented by TRC Capital Investment are subject to less stringent regulatory requirements compared to traditional tender offers. This is significant because it means that the investor protections and disclosures mandated by the SEC for larger offers are not in place. For instance, offers for less than 5 percent of a company's shares are not required to file the same detailed disclosure documents with the SEC. This lack of transparency can leave shareholders with insufficient information to make an informed decision.It is important for shareholders to understand their rights, including their ability to withdraw tendered shares before the expiration of the offer. Legal counsel often plays a critical role in advising both companies and shareholders on the implications of these offers and the best course of action to take in response. Market Research Analyst The practice of issuing mini-tender offers is not uncommon and TRC Capital Investment's history of making similar offers for other companies' shares suggests a pattern. Such offers can impact the stock market by creating temporary fluctuations in a company's share price, particularly if a significant number of shareholders decide to tender their shares. It is also indicative of the broader market dynamics where entities attempt to capitalize on short-term market inefficiencies or perceived undervaluations.Understanding the context of these offers within the market is essential. Analysts would assess the current performance of BorgWarner's stock, its historical trends and industry position to determine the fairness of the offer price. The offer's timing and conditions could also be analyzed in relation to the company's recent financial performance and market conditions. 02/22/2024 - 07:53 PM AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) (""the Company"") today announced that it has received notice of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation of Ontario, Canada, to purchase up to 4 million shares of BorgWarner common stock at a price of $28.80 per share in cash. TRC Capital Investment's offer price of $28.80 per share represents a 4.51% discount below BorgWarner Inc.'s closing price on February 20, 2024, the last trading day before the offer commenced (which represents a 5.94% discount below BorgWarner Inc.'s closing price today, February 22, 2024). The offer is for approximately 1.74% of the shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2023. BorgWarner does not endorse TRC Capital Investment's unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares in response to TRC Capital Investment's offer because the offer is at a price below the current market price for BorgWarner's shares and subject to numerous conditions. BorgWarner is not affiliated or associated in any way with TRC Capital Investment, its mini-tender offer, or its offer documentation. TRC Capital Investment has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided for larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. BorgWarner encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tender offers found here: SEC.gov | Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors. Shareholders should consult with their broker or financial advisor and exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital Investment's mini-tender offer. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer by providing the written notice described in the TRC Capital Investment offer documents. According to the offer documents, the offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on March 21, 2024, unless TRC Capital Investment extends or terminates the offer earlier. BorgWarner requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to TRC Capital Investment's mini-tender offer related to BorgWarner common stock.

These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results; reduction in the size or quantity of customer orders; change in demand for the company's products due to industry conditions; changes in manufacturing operations; volatility in manufacturing costs; delays in shipments of products; disruptions in the supply chain; change in the rate of design wins or the rate of customer acceptance of new products; the company's reliance on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues; potential pricing pressure; a decline in demand for our customers' products or their rate of deployment of their products; general conditions in the internet datacenter, cable television (CATV) broadband, telecom, or fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) markets; changes in the world economy (particularly in the United States and China); changes in the regulation and taxation of international trade, including the imposition of tariffs; changes in currency exchange rates; the negative effects of seasonality; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in the company's documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. More information about these and other risks that may impact the company's business are set forth in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the company's quarterly and annual reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date hereof, and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP earnings per share to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our overall operating performance. To arrive at our non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, expenses associated with discontinued products, and non-recurring (income) expenses, if any, from our GAAP gross margin. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income (loss), we exclude all amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses, unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain), losses from the disposal of idle assets, if any, non-GAAP tax benefit (expenses), and expenses associated with discontinued products, from our GAAP net income (loss). Included in our non-recurring expenses in Q4 2023, Q4 2022 and Q3 2023 are certain non-recurring expenses related to pandemic events (if any), non-recurring tax expenses or benefits (if any), certain non-recurring legal expenses associated with litigation and certain legal and advisory expenses associated with the termination of the purchase agreement with Yuhan Optoelectronic Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd and employee severance expenses (if any). Also included in our non-recurring expenses in Q4 2023, but not in Q4 2022 or Q3 2023 are bank fees associated with early repayment of bank loans and non-cash loss on extinguishment of convertible notes. In computing our non-GAAP income tax benefit (expense), we have applied an estimate of our annual effective income tax rate and applied it to our net income before income taxes. Our adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding depreciation expense, non-GAAP tax benefit (expense), and interest (income) expense from our non-GAAP net income (loss). Our non-GAAP diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing our non-GAAP net loss by the fully diluted share count (for periods in which non-GAAP net income is positive) or basic share count (for periods in which our non-GAAP net income is negative). We believe that our non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of items such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring revenue and expenses, losses from the disposal of idle assets, unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss, and depreciation on certain equipment undergoing reconfiguration is appropriate because treatment of these items may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance;We believe that elimination of expenses associated with discontinued products, including depreciation and inventory obsolescence is appropriate because these expenses are not indicative of our ongoing operations;We believe that estimating non-GAAP income taxes allows comparison with prior periods and provides additional information regarding the generation of potential future deferred tax assets;We believe that non-GAAP measures provide better comparability with our past financial performance, period-to-period results and with our peer companies, many of which also use similar non-GAAP financial measures; andWe anticipate that investors and securities analysts will utilize non-GAAP measures as a supplement to GAAP measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. A reconciliation of our GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings (loss) per share for Q4 2023 and FY 2023 to our non-GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided below, together with corresponding reconciliations for Q4 2022 and FY 2022. A reconciliation of our GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings (loss) per share for Q3 2023 to our non-GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share was provided in our Q3 2023 earnings release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such other non-GAAP measures in the same manner. We have not reconciled the non-GAAP measures included in our guidance to the appropriate GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not readily determinable on a forward-looking basis. GAAP measures that impact our non-GAAP financial measures may include stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses, amortization of intangible assets, unrealized exchange loss (gain), asset impairment charges, and loss (gain) from disposal of idle assets. These GAAP measures cannot be reasonably predicted and may directly impact our non-GAAP gross margin, our non-GAAP net income and our non-GAAP fully-diluted earnings per share, although changes with respect to certain of these measures may offset other changes. In addition, certain of these measures are out of our control. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.

The company set its 2024 Diluted EPS Guidance at $4.52 to $4.72, with a 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate through 2028. The earnings growth was driven by infrastructure investments and operational performance. Positive Strong 2023 earnings growth compared to 2022. 2024 Diluted EPS Guidance of $4.52 to $4.72. Compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2024 to 2028. Increased infrastructure investments across all business segments.

Lower income tax expense due to favorable market returns on investments. Expectation of continued long-term value creation for customers, communities, and shareholders. Negative Decreased Ameren Missouri electric retail sales due to weather conditions. Increased interest expense at Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Parent. Lower energy efficiency performance incentives at Ameren Missouri in 2023. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Ameren Corporation's diluted EPS from $4.14 in 2022 to $4.38 in 2023 indicates a positive earnings growth, which is a favorable sign for investors and analysts monitoring the company's profitability. The projected EPS growth range for 2024 and the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 8% through 2028 suggest a strong and stable outlook, likely reflecting the company's confidence in its strategic investments and operational efficiency. Additionally, the emphasis on infrastructure investments and a transition to cleaner energy sources could be appealing to ESG-focused investors. However, it's crucial to monitor the balance between capital expenditures on infrastructure and the potential for regulatory changes that could impact future earnings. Energy Market Analyst The strategic shift towards a cleaner energy portfolio and the modernization of the energy grid highlighted by Ameren Corporation aligns with broader industry trends, where utility companies are increasingly investing in renewable energy and infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements and consumer demand. The rate base growth projection of approximately 8.2% CAGR from 2023 through 2028 is significant as it implies an expanding asset base that can generate regulated returns, contributing to the company's financial stability. However, the transition to renewable energy sources must be managed carefully to ensure reliability and to avoid potential cost overruns that could affect profitability. Risk Management Expert Ameren's guidance assumes normal temperatures, which introduces weather-related risk to their financial projections, especially given the impact of milder winter temperatures on their Q4 2023 earnings. Additionally, the company's performance is subject to various other risks including regulatory, judicial and legislative actions, as well as market conditions. Investors should consider the company's risk mitigation strategies, such as their disciplined cost management approach and closely watch for any developments that could alter the regulatory landscape or significantly affect energy market dynamics. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM 2023 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $4.38, Compared to $4.14 in 20222024 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $4.52 to $4.722024 through 2028 Diluted EPS Compound Annual Growth Rate Guidance of 6% to 8% using 2024 Guidance Midpoint as a BaseST. LOUIS, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2023 net income attributable to common shareholders of $1,152 million, or $4.38 per diluted share, compared to 2022 net income attributable to common shareholders of $1,074 million, or $4.14 per diluted share. Earnings results for 2023 were driven by solid operating performance and execution of the company's strategy. Higher earnings were the result of increased infrastructure investments across all business segments. Ameren Missouri earnings benefited from new electric service rates effective July 9, 2023. Earnings were also favorably impacted by lower Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings benefited from a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2023 compared to 2022. Ameren Parent earnings benefited from lower income tax expense due, in part, to the effect of favorable market returns on company-owned life insurance (COLI) investments. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower Ameren Missouri electric retail sales, primarily driven by weather, increased interest expense at Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Ameren Parent and lower energy efficiency performance incentives at Ameren Missouri in 2023 as compared to 2022. Finally, the earnings comparison also reflected higher weighted-average basic common shares outstanding. ""We made significant strides in executing our strategy during 2023 for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders,"" said Martin J. Lyons Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. ""This included completing substantial energy infrastructure investments, updating Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan, which calls for a diverse mix of generation investments to most affordably and reliably meet customer needs, and receiving approval to build additional renewable generation and transmission resources. Our continued investments are driving safer, more reliable and resilient service for customers as we transition to a cleaner energy future. We are confident our achievements this year will provide significant long-term value for our customers, communities, shareholders and the environment."" Ameren recorded net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended December 31, 2023, of $158 million, or 60 cents per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $163 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year comparison reflected increased infrastructure investments across all business segments. Ameren Missouri earnings benefited from new electric service rates effective July 9, 2023. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings benefited from a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2023 compared to 2022. These favorable factors were more than offset by lower Ameren Missouri electric retail sales driven primarily by milder-than-normal winter temperatures compared to the colder-than-normal winter temperatures in the year-ago quarter and higher interest expense at Ameren Parent. Earnings and Rate Base Guidance Ameren expects 2024 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.52 to $4.72. Ameren expects diluted earnings per share to grow at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate from 2024 through 2028, using the 2024 guidance range midpoint of $4.62 per share as the base. Ameren's multi-year earnings growth is expected to be driven by projected rate base growth of approximately 8.2% compounded annually from 2023 through 2028. ""We remain focused on strong, sustainable execution of our strategy, which includes investments to modernize the energy grid and transition to a cleaner energy portfolio in a responsible fashion. This, along with our relentless focus on disciplined cost management and reliability, will continue to deliver superior value for our customers, the communities we serve, our shareholders and the environment,"" Lyons said. Ameren's earnings guidance for 2024 and multi-year growth expectations assume normal temperatures and are subject to the effects of, among other things: regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; customer usage; severe storms; market returns on COLI investments; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this release. Ameren Missouri Segment Results Ameren Missouri 2023 earnings were $545 million, compared to 2022 earnings of $562 million. The year-over-year comparison reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments, new electric service rates effective July 9, 2023 and lower operations and maintenance expenses. These favorable factors were more than offset by lower electric retail sales driven primarily by weather, lower energy efficiency performance incentives, and higher interest expense. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution 2023 earnings were $258 million, compared to 2022 earnings of $202 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments and a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher average 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2023 compared to 2022. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 2023 earnings were $134 million, compared to 2022 earnings of $123 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments and lower operations and maintenance expenses due, in part, to the effect of favorable market returns on COLI investments. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher interest expense. Ameren Transmission Segment Results Ameren Transmission 2023 earnings were $296 million, compared to 2022 earnings of $263 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments. Ameren Parent Results (includes items not reported in a business segment) Ameren Parent results for 2023 reflected a loss of $81 million, compared to a 2022 loss of $76 million. The year-over-year comparison reflected lower tax expense due, in part to, COLI investment performance, which was more than offset by higher interest expense primarily due to higher interest rates.

(""Boron One"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV:BONE), a company dedicated to the decarbonization of Planet Earth through the responsible utilization of its boron assets, is pleased to report that it has submitted an application to re-acquire an exploration license for the Jarandol Basin in Serbia, which was previously held by the Company from 2013 to 2018. The Jarandol License application covers 20.97 square kilometers and includes all territory directly adjacent to, and in between, both Boron One's 100% owned Piskanja boron project on the eastern edge of the Jarandol Basin, and the Serbian government owned Pobrdje Boron Mine, some 2.5 km away from Piskanja on the opposite edge of the basin.Previous exploration has shown that Jarandol has the potential to host extensions to both the Piskanja and Pobrdje boron deposits, and/or the potential to host separate, similar boron deposits. In a previous drill program conducted by Boron One (as reported by the Company on December 22, 2015), all 8 drill holes returned occurrences of borates. Additionally, 3 of the drill holes intersected 2 borate beds of potential commercial grade and thickness.About the Jarandol BasinThe Jarandol Basin is a well-known historical mining district in southern Serbia which hosts two known boron deposits, an operating coal mine, and a (now depleted) magnesite mine. The Basin hosts excellent infrastructure for mining including local paved roads, rail, power, experienced miners, and sufficient support industries, located 250 km south of Belgrade by good paved roads. The Jarandol Basin is a Miocene age tertiary deposit located within the Vardar Belt of Neogene lacustrine deposits of evaporates. The Vardar Belt contains the world's richest borate deposits, including those found in Turkey, which are of similar genesis to the Serbia borate deposits.About the Piskanja Boron ProjectPiskanja is Boron One Holdings Inc.'s wholly owned boron deposit with a Measured Mineral Resource of 1.39 million tonnes (averaging 35.59% B2O3), an Indicated Mineral Resource of 5.48 million tonnes (averaging 34.05% B2O3), and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 284.7 thousand tonnes (averaging 39.59% B2O3), calculated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (CIM Standards), as disclosed in the Company's report titled, ""Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment For The Piskanja Borate Project, Serbia, June 24, 2022"".

Full year 2024 guidance forecasts Total Revenue between $2,550 to $2,700 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported full year and fourth quarter results for Noble Corporation demonstrate a solid financial performance, with net income and Adjusted EBITDA reaching toward the upper end of the company's guidance. The increased synergy target from the Maersk Drilling integration is a significant highlight, indicating effective cost management and potential for improved profitability. The strong free cash flow generation is a positive sign for investors, as it suggests that the company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which totaled $283 million for the year.From an investment perspective, the $4.6 billion backlog provides revenue visibility, which is crucial for forecasting future earnings and assessing the company's growth prospects. The guidance for 2024, with projected increases in revenue and EBITDA, reflects management's confidence in the company's operational capabilities and market conditions. The capital expenditures guidance also indicates strategic investments that could further strengthen Noble's market position. Overall, the financial results and outlook suggest a stable financial trajectory for Noble Corporation, which could influence the company's stock performance positively. Market Research Analyst The offshore drilling sector is experiencing a tightening market with limited available industry capacity for 2024, as indicated by Noble's fleet utilization rates and dayrates. The company's ability to secure new contracts at competitive rates, particularly for high-spec rigs, is indicative of a favorable demand environment. Noble's contract wins totaling over $500 million since November reinforce the company's strong market position and ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities.The leading edge dayrates holding firm in the mid-to-high $400,000s range for tier-1 drillships and low-to-mid $400,000s range for sixth generation units are reflective of the sector's recovery post-downturn. Investors should note the potential for a continuing upward trend in dayrates for 2025, signaling a robust market for Noble's services. The company's strategic focus on high-spec rigs and the upcoming contract commencements in mid-2024 could drive stronger financial performance in the latter half of the year, aligning with industry trends. Energy Sector Analyst The integration of Maersk Drilling and the subsequent increase in synergy targets from $125 million to $150 million highlight Noble's operational efficiency and potential for enhanced margins. The integration's success is particularly noteworthy in the energy sector, where mergers and acquisitions can often lead to integration challenges. The operational highlights and backlog information provide insight into the company's strategic positioning within the offshore drilling industry.Notably, the contracted status of Noble's fleet and the improving utilization rates for both floaters and jackups are indicative of the ongoing recovery in the offshore drilling market. The energy sector is cyclical and Noble's forward-looking statements regarding commercial visibility for 2025 and 2026 suggest optimism about the continuation of this upward cycle. Stakeholders should consider the implications of the sector's dynamics on Noble's long-term growth, especially in the context of the global energy transition and the potential for increased demand for offshore drilling services. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Full Year 2023 Net Income of $482 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $810 million, cash provided by operating activities of $574 million, and Free Cash Flow of $184 million.Fourth Quarter Net Income of $150 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $201 million, cash provided by operating activities of $287 million, and Free Cash Flow of $165 million.Maersk Drilling synergy target increased from $125 million to $150 million; integration process nearing a highly successful conclusion.Over $500 million in new contract awards since November, with total backlog at $4.6 billion.Full Year 2024 Guidance provided as follows: Total Revenue $2,550 to $2,700 million, Adjusted EBITDA $925 to $1,025 million, Capital Additions (net of reimbursements) $400 to $440 million.SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (NYSE: NE, CSE: NOBLE, ""Noble"", or the ""Company"") today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Three Months Ended (in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Total Revenue $ 643 $ 697 $ 623 Contract Drilling Services Revenue 609 671 586 Net Income (Loss) 150 158 135 Adjusted EBITDA* 201 283 157 Adjusted Net Income (Loss)* 56 127 61 Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share 1.06 1.14 1.02 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 1.03 1.09 0.92 Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share* 0.39 0.87 0.41 * A Non-GAAP supporting schedule is included with the statements and schedules attached to this press release. Robert W. Eifler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Noble Corporation plc, stated, ""Our fourth quarter results brought full year 2023 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA toward the upper end of our guidance range and capped a year of strong operational performance and Free Cash Flow generation. The Maersk Drilling integration, which is now substantially complete, has been extremely successful, and I would like to congratulate and thank our employees for this exceptional team performance during 2023 which demonstrated the value and the exciting potential of the new Noble."" Fourth Quarter ResultsContract drilling services revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $609 million compared to $671 million in the third quarter, with the sequential decrease driven by lower utilization. Marketed fleet utilization was 68% in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 78% in the previous quarter. Contract drilling services costs for the fourth quarter were $374 million, a slight increase versus $354 million the third quarter. Net income decreased to $150 million in the fourth quarter, down from $158 million in the third quarter, and Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $201 million in the fourth quarter, down from $283 million in the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $287 million, net capital expenditures were $123 million, and free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $165 million. Balance Sheet and Capital AllocationThe Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, reflected total debt principal value of $600 million and cash (and cash equivalents) of $361 million. Share repurchases totaled $15 million during the fourth quarter, bringing 2023 year-to-date share repurchases to $95 million. Total capital returned to shareholders between share repurchases (including the Maersk Drilling squeeze-out) and dividends from the fourth quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2023 equaled $283 million. Today, Noble's Board of Directors declared a quarterly interim dividend of $0.40 per share for the first quarter of 2024. This dividend is expected to be paid on March 21, 2024, to shareholders of record at close of business on March 08, 2024. Future quarterly dividends and other shareholder returns will be subject to, amongst other things, approval by the Board of Directors, and may be modified as market conditions dictate. Operating Highlights and BacklogNoble's marketed fleet of sixteen floaters was 75% contracted through the fourth quarter, compared with 92% in the prior quarter due to downtime between contracts. Recent backlog additions have substantially reduced the percentage of uncommitted days across our marketed floater fleet in 2024 to approximately 20%, with most of Noble's remaining availability for this year attributable to the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II, and Noble Developer. With similarly limited industry capacity available in 2024, leading edge floater dayrates have held firm in the mid-to-high $400,000s range for tier-1 drillships and low-to-mid $400,000s range for sixth generation units. The bidding pipeline for 2025 contract commencements appears supportive of a continuing upward trend in leading edge rates for high spec rigs. Utilization of Noble's thirteen marketed jackups was 61% in the fourth quarter, consistent with 61% utilization during the third quarter – jackup utilization is expected to improve progressively through 2024 with contracts scheduled to commence this summer for the Noble Regina Allen and Noble Resolute following shipyard stays, while the near-term visibility for the warm stacked jackups Noble Interceptor and Noble Highlander remains limited at this time. Subsequent to last quarter's earnings press release, new contracts for Noble's fleet with total contract value of approximately $530 million (including mobilization payments) include the following: Noble Discoverer was awarded a 400-day contract with Petrobras in Colombia, expected to commence in early June 2024. The contract includes an option to extend the duration by 390 days.Noble Voyager was awarded a one well contract (plus one option well) with Petronas in Suriname which commenced in February 2024 with an estimated firm duration of 130 days excluding option.Noble Valiant was awarded a six-month contract extension with LLOG in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, expected to commence in July 2024 in direct continuation of the rig's current contract. The dayrate for this contract is $470,000, excluding additional fees for the use of managed pressure drilling.Noble Gerry de Souza received a 9-month extension with TotalEnergies in Nigeria, continuing the program out to November 2024.Noble Intrepid had an option exercised by Harbour Energy for a well intervention program in the U.K. North Sea which commenced in January 2024 at a dayrate of $120,000.Noble Innovator received a one well extension (estimated 90-day duration) from BP at a dayrate of $140,000 scheduled to commence in September 2024.Noble Resolute received a 60-day extension (from March 2025) with Petrogas in the Dutch North Sea.Noble's backlog as of February 22, 2024, stands at $4.6 billion. OutlookFor the full year 2024, today Noble announces a guidance range for Total Revenue of $2,550 to $2,700 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $925 to $1,025 million, and Capital Additions (net of reimbursements) between $400 to $440 million. Commenting on Noble's outlook, Mr. Eifler stated, ""We expect to realize improving financial results in 2024 compared to 2023, with mid-year contract start-ups for several floaters and jackups expected to drive stronger financial performance in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, commercial visibility for 2025 and 2026 is highly encouraging based on recent months' step-change increase in open demand, which is a positive indicator for future backlog development. Against this favorable backdrop, we look forward to growing our return of capital to shareholders as free cash flow improves over the course of the cycle."" Due to the forward-looking nature of Adjusted EBITDA, management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure. Accordingly, the Company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort. The unavailable information could have a significant effect on Noble's full year 2024 GAAP financial results.

1.03 $ 0.92 $ 3.32 $ 1.73 NOBLE CORPORATION plc AND SUBSIDIARIESNON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION Certain non-GAAP measures and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the Company have been provided for meaningful comparisons between current results and prior operating periods. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company defines ""Adjusted EBITDA"" as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense, net of amounts capitalized; interest income and other, net; income tax benefit (provision); and depreciation and amortization expense, as well as, if applicable, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net; losses on economic impairments; restructuring and similar charges; costs related to mergers and integrations; and certain other infrequent operational events. We believe that the Adjusted EBITDA measure provides greater transparency of our core operating performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (Loss) by eliminating from Net Income (Loss) the impact of a number of non-recurring items we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance. We prepare Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share by eliminating from Diluted Earnings per Share the impact of a number of non-recurring items we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the non-recurring items we exclude in the measure. Additionally, we define net capital expenditures for full year 2023 as capital expenditures net of reimbursements and insurance proceeds, and we define Capital Additions as additions to property and equipment. In order to fully assess the financial operating results, management believes that the results of operations, adjusted to exclude the following items, which are included in the Company's press release issued on February 22, 2024, are appropriate measures of the continuing and normal operations of the Company: (i) In the third and fourth quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, merger and integration costs; hurricane losses and (recoveries), net; intangible contract amortization; and discrete tax items. (ii) The third quarter of 2023 includes a gain on bargain purchase and joint taxation scheme compensation. (iii) In addition, the fourth quarter of 2022 included (gain) loss on sale of operating assets, net, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net, and professional services costs related to corporate initiatives. The Company also discloses free cash flow as a non-GAAP liquidity measure. Free cash flow is calculated as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash paid for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from insurance claims. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management team for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. These non-GAAP adjusted measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, contract drilling revenue, contract drilling cost, contract drilling margin, average daily revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see the following non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations for a complete description of the adjustments.

Financial Analyst The substantial growth in Select Medical's revenue and net income, as reported, indicates a robust financial performance, particularly in the context of the healthcare industry. A 5.2% year-over-year increase in revenue paired with a 51.4% surge in net income suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. The significant leap in income from operations, 37.6%, alongside a 24.8% rise in Adjusted EBITDA, underscores a strong margin improvement. The growth in earnings per share (EPS) by 54.9% is particularly noteworthy for investors, as it directly affects shareholder value.From an investment perspective, the increased EPS and dividend declaration might signal a bullish sentiment to the market, potentially influencing the stock price positively. The financial results exceed industry norms, where single-digit revenue growth is more common. However, it's important to consider the broader economic context, including inflationary pressures and healthcare spending trends, when evaluating the long-term sustainability of this growth. Healthcare Industry Analyst Select Medical's operational expansion, as evidenced by its presence in 46 states and a diverse portfolio of healthcare services, positions it advantageously in the market. The company's growth in critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient clinics and occupational health centers reflects a strategic response to the increasing demand for specialized healthcare services. The year-over-year performance improvement, despite the phase-out of Provider Relief Fund payments, indicates resilience and a successful adaptation to the post-pandemic healthcare environment.It's also crucial to consider the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, as changes in healthcare policies or reimbursement rates can significantly impact profitability. With the healthcare industry being highly regulated, any future legislative changes could either benefit or challenge Select Medical's operational and financial trajectory. Market Research Analyst Understanding the consumer trends and market demand in the healthcare sector can provide additional context to Select Medical's financial results. The increase in outpatient services and the growing need for occupational health suggest a market shift towards more accessible and preventive care models. Select Medical's extensive network of outpatient rehabilitation clinics and occupational health centers aligns with this trend, potentially contributing to its revenue growth. Additionally, the aging population and the prevalence of chronic diseases could be driving the demand for the company's critical illness recovery and rehabilitation services.The company's operational metrics should be monitored in correlation with market trends to anticipate future performance. While current results are strong, the long-term success will depend on Select Medical's ability to innovate and adapt to the evolving healthcare needs and consumer preferences. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM MECHANICSBURG, Pa., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Select Medical Holdings Corporation (""Select Medical,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") (NYSE: SEM) today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and the declaration of a cash dividend.

Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation For the Three Months and Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (In thousands, unaudited) The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of Select Medical's segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying definitions, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for Select Medical. Adjusted EBITDA is used by Select Medical to report its segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, gain (loss) on sale of businesses, and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2022 2023 2022 2023 Net income $ 37,712 $ 61,798 $ 198,026 $ 299,731 Income tax expense 8,570 11,850 62,553 82,625 Interest expense 47,341 50,800 169,111 198,639 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries (6,759) (10,195) (26,407) (40,813) Loss on early retirement of debt — — — 14,692 Income from operations $ 86,864 $ 114,253 $ 403,283 $ 554,874 Stock compensation expense: Included in general and administrative 8,560 9,658 30,555 36,041 Included in cost of services 1,239 2,161 7,200 7,768 Depreciation and amortization 52,246 53,984 205,825 208,742 Adjusted EBITDA $ 148,909 $ 180,056 $ 646,863 $ 807,425 Critical illness recovery hospital $ 44,345 $ 57,384 $ 111,344 $ 246,015 Rehabilitation hospital 56,038 66,344 198,034 221,875 Outpatient rehabilitation 15,948 22,473 101,860 111,868 Concentra 62,236 68,288 334,337 361,334 Other(a) (29,658) (34,433) (98,712) (133,667) Adjusted EBITDA $ 148,909 $ 180,056 $ 646,863 $ 807,425 (a) Other primarily includes general and administrative costs and other operating income, as discussed further above. X. Reconciliation of Earnings per Common Share to Adjusted Earnings per Common Share For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (In thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited) Adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Select Medical believes that the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share are important to investors because they are reflective of the financial performance of Select Medical's ongoing operations and provide better comparability of its results of operations between periods. Adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to, or substitutes for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile net income attributable to common shares and earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis to adjusted net income attributable to common shares and adjusted earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis. There were no adjustments to earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Years Ended December 31, 2022 Per Share(a) 2023 Per Share(a) Net income attributable to common shares(a) $ 153,385 $ 1.23 $ 234,718 $ 1.91 Adjustments:(b) Loss on early retirement of debt, net of tax — — 10,019 0.08 Adjusted net income attributable to common shares $ 153,385 $ 1.23 $ 244,737 $ 1.99 (a) Net income attributable to common shares and earnings per common share are calculated based on the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, as presented in table III. (b) Adjustments to net income attributable to common shares include estimated income tax and non-controlling interest impacts and are calculated based on the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The estimated income tax impact, which is determined using tax rates based on the nature of the adjustment and the jurisdiction in which the adjustment occurred, includes both current and deferred income tax expense or benefit. XI. Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Business Outlook for the Year Ending December 31, 2024 (In millions, unaudited) The following is a reconciliation of full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA expectations as computed at the low and high points of the range to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to table IX for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a discussion of Select Medical's use of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating financial performance.

Positive Strong financial performance for Q4 2023 and FY 2023 with significant growth in net sales, operating income, net earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Merger agreement with Arcline Investment Management, L.P. for an all-cash transaction at $46.00 per share, valued at $1.8 billion. Kaman's diluted earnings per share showed positive growth, reaching $0.07 and $0.28 per share, adjusted to $0.12 and $0.49 per share. The company refrained from conducting a conference call for Q4 due to the pending acquisition by Arcline and did not provide a financial outlook for FY 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Kaman Corp. reveal a year-over-year increase in net sales, from $687.9 million in the previous year to $775.9 million. This growth in revenue is a positive indicator of the company's market performance and could suggest effective sales strategies or increased market demand for Kaman's products. However, the reported net earnings of $7.9 million, compared to a loss of $48.6 million in the prior year, warrant a closer examination of the factors contributing to this turnaround. The improvement in net earnings could be attributed to operational efficiencies, cost optimization, or a combination of both.Adjusted EBITDA, a measure of a company's operational profitability, increased to $106.7 million from $77.2 million, with a corresponding rise in the adjusted EBITDA margin from 11.2% to 13.7%. This margin expansion implies that Kaman has effectively managed its operating expenses and could be achieving economies of scale. Investors should note that the adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.49, down from $1.04 in the previous year, may reflect dilutive events such as equity offerings or the conversion of convertible securities, which could affect shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The merger agreement with Arcline Investment Management, L.P. is a significant event that could reshape Kaman's business structure and strategy. The all-cash acquisition at $46.00 per share represents a substantial premium over the current trading price, which is often the case in takeovers to incentivize shareholders to agree to the deal. This transaction, valued at approximately $1.8 billion, suggests confidence in Kaman's future potential and could signal consolidation trends within the industry. Market participants should monitor the regulatory approval process and shareholder sentiment, as these factors will play a crucial role in the completion of the merger. Legal Expert The financial report includes a note on the revision of prior period information due to errors in accounting for labor costs and inventory valuation. This restatement could raise concerns about the company's internal controls over financial reporting. While the corrections do not appear to have a material impact on the overall financial position, they do highlight the importance of rigorous financial oversight. Stakeholders, including potential investors and regulators, will likely scrutinize these revisions for any implications of systemic issues within the company's accounting practices. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: Net sales: $203.1 million Operating income: $12.0 million Net earnings: $2.0 million Adjusted EBITDA*: $25.6 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin*: 12.6% Diluted earnings per share: $0.07 per share, $0.12 per share adjusted* Full Year 2023 Highlights: Net sales: $775.9 million Operating income: $49.1 million Net earnings: $7.9 million Adjusted EBITDA*: $106.7 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin*: 13.7% Diluted earnings per share: $0.28 per share, $0.49 per share adjusted* BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kaman Corp.

KAMAN BUSINESS RESULTS DISCUSSION BY REPORTING SEGMENT Kaman manages its portfolio through three segments: (1) Engineered Products; (2) Precision Products; and (3) Structures. Engineered Products - Our Engineered Products segment serves the aerospace and defense, industrial and medical markets providing sophisticated, proprietary aircraft bearings and components; super precision, miniature ball bearings; proprietary spring energized seals, springs and contacts; and wheels, brakes and related hydraulic components for helicopters, fixed-wing and UAV aircraft. Table 2. Engineered Products Results Thousands of U.S. dollars Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 September 29, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net sales $ 132,394 $ 123,598 $ 113,972 $ 512,831 $ 377,241 Operating income 28,939 29,026 17,168 107,863 57,833 Adjusted EBITDA 38,308 38,428 30,698 147,514 91,353 Adjusted EBITDA margin 28.9 % 31.1 % 26.9 % 28.8 % 24.2 % Three months ended December 31, 2023 versus three months ended September 29, 2023 - Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat and margin decreased 2.2 percentage points versus the third quarter of 2023. Results remained strong in the fourth quarter driven by higher sales and gross margin on our commercial bearings and aircraft wheels and brakes, partially offset by lower sales volume on our springs, seals and contacts used in medical applications. Three months ended December 31, 2023 versus three months ended December 31, 2022 - Operating income increased $11.8 million, Adjusted EBITDA increased $7.6 million and margin increased 2.0 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Results improved compared to the prior period driven by higher sales and gross margin on our commercial bearings, PMA aftermarket parts and aircraft wheels and brakes and the absence of the inventory step-up of $2.3 million recorded in the prior year associated with the Aircraft Wheel and Brake acquisition. Precision Products - Our Precision Products segment serves the aerospace and defense markets providing precision safe and arming solutions for missile and bomb systems for the U.S. and allied militaries; subcontract helicopter work; restoration, modification and support of our SH-2G Super Seasprite maritime helicopters; support of our heavy lift K-MAX® manned helicopter, and development of the KARGO UAV unmanned aerial system, a purpose built autonomous medium lift logistics vehicle.

Results improved compared to the third quarter, driven by higher JPF direct commercial sales and related margin, partially offset by cost growth on a legacy fuzing program and higher R&D spend on the KARGO UAV unmanned aerial system. Three months ended December 31, 2023 versus three months ended December 31, 2022 - Operating income decreased $6.2 million, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6.1 million and margin decreased 11.8 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Results declined compared to the prior period, driven by cost growth on legacy fuzing and measuring programs and lower sales and related margin of JPF and K-MAX® exchanges. Structures - Our Structures segment serves the aerospace and defense and medical end markets providing sophisticated complex metallic and composite aerostructures for commercial, military and general aviation fixed and rotary wing aircraft, and medical imaging solutions.

NON-GAAP MEASURES DISCLOSURE Management believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures (i.e. financial measures that are not computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) identified by an asterisk (*) used in this release or in other disclosures provide important perspectives into the Company's ongoing business performance. The Company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. We define the Non-GAAP measures used in this release and other disclosures as follows: Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA for the consolidated company results is defined as net earnings before interest, taxes, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company for the periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA for the segments is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Net sales. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide an additional perspective on the operating results of the organization and its earnings capacity and helps improve the comparability of our results between periods because they provide a view of our operations that excludes items that management believes are not reflective of operating performance, such as items traditionally removed from net earnings in the calculation of EBITDA as well as Other expense (income), net and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company for the period presented. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not presented as an alternative measure of operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The following tables illustrate the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA: Table 5.

The company extends its ADAS, User Experience, and EV Design Win Pipeline, positioning itself as an Autotech solutions innovator. Positive Record Q4 revenue of $70.1M, up 112% YoY and 16% sequentially Non-GAAP gross margin of 52.7%, a 50 basis points improvement YoY Full-year 2023 revenue hits $223.2M, up 101% YoY Positive business highlights include partnerships with Ficosa, breakthrough computer vision processors, and wins at BMW, Ford, GM, and Toyota Guidance for Q1 2024 expects revenue to increase by 38% YoY but decrease by 20% sequentially, with a focus on future growth and profitability Recognition by Morgan Stanley as the fastest-growing semiconductor company globally over the past two years Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Q4 revenue growth of 112% year-over-year and 16% sequentially for indie Semiconductor is a strong performance indicator, particularly within the competitive semiconductor industry. This growth rate significantly outpaces the industry average, which often hovers around single-digit percentages. The expansion of non-GAAP gross margin to 52.7% is also noteworthy. Margins are critical for assessing a company's profitability and cost management efficiency. The 50 basis point improvement suggests indie is achieving greater economies of scale or benefiting from higher-value product offerings.However, the GAAP operating loss of $20.6 million, despite a reduction from the previous year's $29.0 million, indicates ongoing investments and expenses that exceed current revenues. This situation is not uncommon for growth-oriented tech companies, but it warrants attention to ensure long-term sustainability. The non-GAAP operating loss improvement to $2.4 million reflects better control over operating expenses and is a positive sign for investors looking for operational efficiency gains.The full year revenue increase of 101% and the improvement in non-GAAP gross margin by 260 basis points are both indicative of a strong demand for indie's products and an ability to translate sales into profitable growth. The company's positioning at the intersection of vehicle safety systems, sensor fusion and AI is strategic, given the industry's shift towards advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and the push for autonomous vehicles. Market Research Analyst indie Semiconductor's recognition by Morgan Stanley as the fastest-growing semiconductor company is a significant accolade, reflecting the company's momentum and market recognition. The strategic partnership with Ficosa and the capture of in-cabin monitoring programs with major OEMs like BMW, Ford, General Motors and Toyota are testaments to indie's technological capabilities and market penetration. These partnerships and wins not only bolster current revenues but also provide a foundation for future growth.The company's focus on AI-based automotive camera solutions, computer vision processors and smart connectivity for electric vehicles aligns well with current industry trends towards greater vehicle automation and connectivity. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, indie's innovative product offerings could position it to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the ADAS and EV markets.The guidance for Q1 2024, with an expected 38% year-over-year increase in revenue but a 20% sequential decrease, reflects typical market seasonality and current industry softness. The anticipated top-line recovery in Q2 and resumption of growth in the second half of the year are promising, but these projections should be monitored closely for signs of whether indie can maintain its growth trajectory and achieve profitability as forecasted. Economist The automotive semiconductor industry is facing a period of fluctuation, with end-market weakness and inventory corrections affecting many companies. indie Semiconductor's performance must be contextualized within this broader economic environment. While indie's revenue growth is impressive, it is also important to consider the potential impact of macroeconomic factors such as supply chain disruptions, global semiconductor shortages and shifts in consumer demand for vehicles.indie's anticipation of a profitability baseline in the second half of the year ahead of significant Radar and Vision ramps in 2025 suggests confidence in the company's strategic direction and market demand. However, investors should remain cognizant of the risks associated with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and potential economic headwinds that could affect indie's performance.It is also essential to consider the capital intensity of the semiconductor industry. High R&D and production costs mean that companies like indie must continuously invest in innovation to stay competitive. The ability to manage these costs while expanding market share and maintaining revenue growth will be crucial for indie's long-term success. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Posts Q4 Revenue of $70.1M, up 112% Year-over-Year and 16% Sequentially Expands Q4 Non-GAAP Gross Margin to 52.7%, up 50 Basis Points Year-over-Year Delivers $223.2M in 2023 revenue, up 101% Year-over-Year Extends ADAS, User Experience and EV Design Win Pipeline ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- indie Semiconductor, Inc.

Fourth quarter revenue was up 112 percent from the same period a year ago and 16 percent sequentially to a record $70.1 million, within the Company’s prior guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 52.7 percent, in-line with indie’s guidance for the period. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2023 operating loss was $20.6 million compared to $29.0 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.4 million, versus $15.1 million during the same period last year, reflecting higher revenue, improving gross margin and operating expense leverage. Q4 GAAP loss per share was $0.09, while Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.01, consistent with indie’s guidance and consensus estimates. Full year 2023 revenue was up 101 percent year-over-year to a record $223.2 million with non-GAAP gross margin expanding to 52.5 percent, a 260 basis point improvement over the prior year. “indie continues to outexecute and outperform our industry peer group,” said Donald McClymont, indie’s co-founder and chief executive officer. “We more than doubled our top line for a third consecutive year in 2023 driven by increasing global demand for indie’s highly innovative semiconductor solutions spanning virtually all leading tier ones and vehicle OEMs. Further, we are at the unique intersection of vehicle safety systems, sensor fusion and Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards realizing our vision of the uncrashable car. While we are not immune from the current automotive end market weakness and the industry-wide inventory correction, we remain well positioned to demonstrate earnings power when the market recovers, to capitalize on the strategic Autotech opportunity, led by these exciting new technologies, and most importantly, to create shareholder value.” Business Highlights Recognized by Morgan Stanley as the fastest growing semiconductor company in the world over the past two years, among 224 global suppliers Entered strategic partnership with Ficosa on AI-based automotive camera solutions Unveiled breakthrough computer vision processors enabling viewing and sensing capability at the vehicle’s edge Captured in-cabin monitoring programs at BMW, Ford, General Motors and Toyota Secured smart connectivity wins at one of the world’s leading Electric Vehicle (EV) OEMs Q1 2024 Outlook We provide guidance on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to reconcile such results and guidance to GAAP is difficult to estimate and dependent on future events outside of our control and, therefore, is not available without unreasonable efforts. Please refer to the attached Discussion Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this press release for a further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures. “For the first quarter of 2024, we expect indie’s revenue to be up 38 percent year-over-year but down 20 percent sequentially, reflecting market seasonality and current industry softness,” said Thomas Schiller, indie’s chief financial officer and executive vice president of strategy. “Looking forward, based on our new product pipeline, we anticipate Q1 to be a trough quarter with top line recovery in Q2 and a resumption of outsized sequential growth in Q3 and Q4, yielding a profitability baseline in the second half of this year, ahead of our significant Radar and Vision ramps in 2025.” indie’s Q4 2023 Conference Call indie Semiconductor will host a conference call with analysts to discuss its fourth quarter and 2023 results and business outlook today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

As set forth in the tables above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management may use these non-GAAP financial measures to, amongst other things, evaluate operating performance and compare it against past periods or against peer companies, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods and to determine payments under compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or improve management’s ability to forecast future periods. We provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We further believe these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of (i) acquisition-related expenses (including acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments, (iv) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (v) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vi) share-based compensation, and (vii) income tax benefit (expenses). We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures. We do not report a GAAP measure of gross profit or gross margin because certain costs related to contract revenues are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses, and not in cost of sales, as it is not practicable for us to bifurcate these expenses. We derive and reconcile non-GAAP gross profit from the most relevant GAAP financial measures by subtracting GAAP cost of sales, adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and share-based compensation, from GAAP revenue. We calculate non-GAAP operating loss by excluding from GAAP operating loss, any (i) acquisition-related expenses (including acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments and (iv) share-based compensation. We calculate non-GAAP net loss by excluding from GAAP net income (loss), any (i) acquisition-related expenses (including acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) inventory cost realignments, (iv) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (v) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vi) share-based compensation, and (vii) income tax benefit (expenses). We calculate non-GAAP share count by adding to GAAP weighted average common share outstanding (i) weighted average Class A common stock, (ii) weighted average Class V common stock, (iii) Escrow Shares and (iv) vested but unexercised options issued as part of the TeraXion acquisition. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated by non-GAAP loss divided by non-GAAP share count. We exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below: Acquisition-related expenses - including such items as, when applicable, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, accounting impact to the cost of goods sold due to one-time inventory costing realignment with a specific supplier and acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred. Amortization expenses - related to the amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and certain license rights. Depreciation expenses - related to the depreciation expenses for all property and equipment on hand. Inventory cost realignments - related to the supplier allocation premiums introduced during COVID that is currently incorporated in our inventory cost but have since been eliminated going forward. The impact of this premium is deemed non-recurring and therefore not considered by management in its evaluation of the ongoing performance of the business. Share-based compensation - related to the non-cash compensation expense associated with equity awards granted to our employees (including those granted in lieu of cash compensation) and employer tax related to employee stock transactions. These expenses are not considered by management in making operating decisions and such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations. Gain (loss) from change in fair values - because these adjustments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are not directly controlled by management, (3) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized and (4) cannot make comparisons between peer company performance less reliable. Non-cash interest expense - related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs because (1) these expenses are not considered by management in making decision with respect to financing decisions, and (2) these generally reflect non-cash costs. Income tax benefit (expense) - related to the estimated income tax benefit (expense) that does not result in a current period tax refunds (payments). The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Beginning in Q4 2023, management added non-GAAP EBITDA, which removes non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may distort EBITDA, to the current non-GAAP financial measures. We will calculate non-GAAP EBITDA by excluding from GAAP net income (loss), any (i) acquisition-related expenses (including acquisition-related professional fees and legal expenses, deemed compensation expense and expenses recognized in relation to changes in contingent consideration obligations), (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain license rights, (iii) depreciation of property, plant and equipment, (iv) inventory cost realignments, (v) gains or losses recognized in relation to changes in the fair value of warrants, contingent considerations issued by indie, acquisition-related holdbacks and unrealized gains or losses from currency hedging contracts, (vi) non-cash interest expenses related to the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs, (vii) share-based compensation, and (viii) income tax benefit (expenses). To the extent our disclosures contain forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures, such as our forward-looking outlook for non-GAAP EBITDA, these measures are provided to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are generally unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking non-GAAP measures because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of such non-GAAP measures are difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control and, therefore, is not available without unreasonable efforts. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses and impairments and other unanticipated items not reflective of ongoing operations. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.

(EXFY) reported a 63% increase in interchange derived from the Expensify Card, reaching $11.1 million. The company's Founder and CEO, David Barrett, highlighted strong sales and low churn rates continuing into 2023. Despite a reduction in paid seats due to macroeconomic challenges, Expensify remains optimistic about its healthy business fundamentals and significant growth opportunities. Cost-cutting measures are expected to yield results in 2024, with a focus on superior unit economics and lead generation in the SMB market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 63% growth in interchange revenue derived from the Expensify Card indicates a robust expansion in the usage of the company's financial products. This metric is significant as interchange fees are a key revenue source for payment processing companies. The growth rate surpasses typical industry benchmarks, suggesting that Expensify is gaining market share and that its payment solutions are resonating with customers. This performance could positively influence investor sentiment and the company's stock valuation in the short term.However, the mention of cost-cutting measures and reduction in paid seats from existing customers reflects the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic environment. While cost optimization can improve margins, it's crucial to assess whether these measures might impact the company's ability to innovate or provide quality service. Investors should monitor the balance between cost efficiency and growth potential when evaluating the company's long-term prospects. Market Research Analyst Expensify's focus on the SMB (Small and Medium-sized Business) market through its New Expensify platform is a strategic move to capture a largely untapped customer base. The SMB sector is often underserved by larger financial institutions, presenting a significant growth opportunity. The company's scalable and low-cost lead generation initiative could be a game-changer in reaching this demographic. The successful global launch of the new platform in 2024 could further solidify Expensify's position in the market and drive long-term revenue growth.The reference to competitors' 'lossy growth' models and Expensify's superior unit economics suggests a strategic differentiation that could be appealing to investors. Companies that can grow profitably while maintaining strong unit economics are typically more resilient to economic downturns and can be more attractive to long-term investors. Economist The broader economic context mentioned in the shareholder letter, characterized by belt-tightening in the tech sector and the broader economy, has implications for Expensify's business model. A reduction in paid seats indicates that customers are becoming more cost-conscious, which could lead to a deceleration in revenue growth if not offset by new customer acquisition or increased usage among existing customers.Expensify's confidence in its fundamental business health and the opportunity landscape, despite the macroeconomic headwinds, suggests resilience. However, the true test will be its ability to maintain growth and profitability in a challenging economic climate. Stakeholders should consider the company's strategic responses to these conditions, such as its cost-cutting measures and focus on scalable growth, when assessing its financial health and investment potential. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Interchange derived from the Expensify Card grew to $11.1 million, an increase of 63% compared to the prior year. PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Expensify, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXFY), a payments superapp that helps individuals and businesses around the world simplify the way they manage money across expenses, corporate cards and bills, today released a letter to shareholders from Founder and CEO David Barrett alongside results for its quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. A Message From Our Founder Here's how I see it: The same brisk sales and low churn we saw in 2022 has continued into 2023, and we have implemented a number of cost-cutting measures that we believe will pay off in 2024. However, the difficult macroeconomic outlook caused the broader economy (and tech sector in particular) to tighten their belts, resulting in a reduction in paid seats from existing customers. We remain convinced that our fundamental business is healthy and our significant opportunity is unchanged, and the widespread stalling of many of our competitors' ""lossy growth"" model has reinforced our commitment to competing through superior unit economics. Scalable, low-cost lead generation into the historically unaddressed SMB market remains the core strategy of our New Expensify platform, which saw meaningful progress in 2023, setting up a global launch of the new platform in 2024.

The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the results expressed by this guidance. Free Cash Flow Expensify estimates Free Cash Flow of $10.0 million - $12.0 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Company does not provide a reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash used in (provided by) operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results. Stock Based Compensation An estimate of expected stock-based compensation for the next four fiscal quarters is as follows, which is driven primarily by the pre-IPO grant of RSUs issued to all employees (which vest quarterly over eight years with approximately five years remaining).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net (loss) income, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, measuring our performance, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss from operations excluding provision for income taxes, interest and other expenses, net, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP net income (loss). We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation. Free cash flow. We define Free cash flow as net cash used in (provided by) operating activities excluding changes in settlement assets and settlement liabilities, which represent funds held for customers and customer funds in transit, respectively, reduced by the purchases of property and equipment and software development costs. The tables at the end of the Consolidated Financial Statements provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each of these non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements in this press release, or made during the earnings call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1955. These statements include statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, future cash flow, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth, product developments and their potential impact, the amount and timing of any share repurchases and our stock-based compensation estimates and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict.

(ZEUS) reported strong financial results for Q4 and full-year 2023, with net income of $7.4 million and $44.5 million, respectively.

The company increased its quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.15 per share, reflecting a successful diversification strategy and operational discipline. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by Olympic Steel, Inc. indicate a notable increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year. This is a significant metric for investors as net income directly affects the earnings per share (EPS), a key determinant of a company's profitability and often a driver of its stock price. The quarterly dividend increase of 20% is a strong signal of confidence from management in the company's financial health and future prospects, potentially making the stock more attractive to income-focused investors.However, the full-year results show a decline in net income and adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year, which could raise concerns about the company's year-over-year growth trajectory. The impact of this decline on investor sentiment could be mitigated by the company's successful diversification strategy and operational discipline, which have led to a strong balance sheet and the ability to pursue higher-return investments, as indicated by the CEO's statement.The LIFO method accounting, which resulted in pre-tax income, is an inventory valuation method that assumes the last items placed in inventory are the first sold during a period of inflation, this method can result in lower cost of goods sold and higher net income. The significant LIFO pre-tax income in 2023 compared to a LIFO pre-tax expense in 2022 suggests that inventory costs have been managed effectively, which is positive for the company's margins. Market Research Analyst Olympic Steel's performance in the Pipe and Tube segment, which delivered its second most profitable year ever, demonstrates the company's ability to capitalize on market segments with robust demand. This performance is particularly noteworthy in the context of a hot-rolled carbon steel index pricing decline of more than 45% during the year, which underscores the company's resilience and strategic positioning within the industry.The company's acquisitions of Metal-Fab and Central Tube and Bar appear to be highly strategic, contributing to immediate strong EBITDA returns. This suggests effective use of capital for growth and could be a positive indicator for future revenue streams. The mention of a disciplined approach to inventory management and cash flow, coupled with a strong balance sheet, positions Olympic Steel favorably for sustainable growth and might attract investors looking for companies with prudent financial management practices.The increase in total debt by only $25 million despite significant investments is an indication of the company's financial prudence and could be reassuring for stakeholders concerned about over-leverage. The availability of approximately $339 million provides the company with a cushion and flexibility for future investments or to weather potential market downturns. Economist The dividend policy of Olympic Steel, which has seen a cumulative increase since 2022, is a reflection of the company's operational success and financial stability. Regular and increasing dividends are often interpreted as a sign of a company's mature stage in its business cycle and its ability to generate consistent cash flow. This policy can have a stabilizing effect on the stock, making it appealing to a certain class of investors, particularly in volatile markets.The company's reference to managing operating expenses and debt while seeking opportunities for expansion indicates a balanced approach to growth and profitability. This is crucial in the metals service industry, where commodity price fluctuations can significantly impact margins. The company's ability to maintain profitability in the face of a significant decline in hot-rolled carbon steel index pricing suggests strong operational efficiency and cost management, which are important factors for long-term sustainability.Olympic Steel's focus on higher-value-add products could be a strategic move to differentiate itself in a commoditized market and enhance profit margins. This strategy may lead to more stable revenue streams and reduce the company's exposure to raw material price volatility, potentially resulting in a more predictable and resilient business model. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM Strong finish to the year led by Pipe and Tube segment delivering its second most profitable year ever Shareholders rewarded with a quarterly dividend increase of 20% from $0.125 to $0.15 per share Company enters 2024 in position of strength due to success of diversification strategy and operational disciplines CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Olympic Steel, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZEUS), a leading national metals service center, today announced results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Fourth-Quarter Results Net income for the fourth quarter totaled $7.4 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with net income of $4.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The results include $5.3 million of LIFO pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $0.9 million of LIFO pre-tax income in the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter 2023 results also include $1.1 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $16.7 million, compared with $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $489 million, compared with $520 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-Year Results Net income for 2023 totaled $44.5 million, or $3.85 per diluted share, compared with net income of $90.9 million, or $7.87 per diluted share, in 2022. The results include $8.3 million of LIFO pre-tax income in 2023, compared with $0.6 million of LIFO pre-tax expense in 2022. The 2023 results also include $5.7 million of acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $97.6 million, compared with $152.0 million in 2022. Sales for 2022 totaled $2.2 billion compared with $2.6 billion in 2022. “Olympic Steel’s strong performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflects the success of our strategy to build a more diversified company that delivers results and creates shareholder value even under challenging market conditions,” said Richard T. Marabito, Chief Executive Officer. “For the second year in a row, we withstood a hot-rolled carbon steel index pricing decline of more than 45% during the year. Despite significant pricing fluctuations, we continue to deliver on our commitment to achieve more consistent, profitable results.” Marabito said, “All three of our business segments positively impacted Olympic Steel’s results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our Pipe and Tube business delivered its second most profitable year ever, and our Carbon business showed its resiliency in navigating the pricing pressures of 2023. While Specialty Metals faced industry-wide stainless steel pricing headwinds, this segment contributed consistent positive EBITDA for both the fourth quarter and the full year.” Marabito continued, “Our inventory management and strong cash flow have fortified our balance sheet. During 2023, we invested $170 million in the highly accretive Metal-Fab and Central Tube and Bar acquisitions, with both investments producing immediate, strong EBITDA returns. However, our total debt increased by only $25 million to $190 million at year-end, with availability of approximately $339 million. Our disciplined approach and financial strength provide the capacity to invest in higher-return opportunities, while simultaneously rewarding our shareholders with an increased quarterly dividend.” The Company’s Board of Directors approved a regular first quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 per share from the Company’s last quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. This marks the third increase since 2022, cumulatively raising the quarterly dividend from $0.02 per share to $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2024 to shareholders on record as of March 4, 2024. The Company expects to maintain the quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on a regular basis, subject to Board approval. The Company has paid a regular quarterly dividend since March 2006. Marabito concluded, “As we head into 2024, Olympic Steel is stronger than ever. We remain committed to our disciplines around working capital, operating expenses, cash flow and debt, while we seek opportunities to further expand our portfolio of higher-return, higher-value-add products. We are confident in our ability to build on our success, drive profitable growth and deliver strong value for shareholders.” The table that follows provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Refer to section ""Non-IFRS Measures"", for further information Frazer Bourchier, President, and CEO commented: ""Mandalay navigated a challenging year with resilience and adaptability. After a poor start in 2023 due to various operational issues mostly at Costerfield, our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter underscored the effectiveness of our various strategic initiatives and the increased operational and financial focus of our team. We maintained our efforts on disciplined capital allocation at our two mines, positioning the Company for improved future cash generation. During this year, Mandalay generated $173.3 million in revenue, leading to an adjusted EBITDA of $60.3 million – a solid margin of 35%. ""In 2023, both cash and all-in sustaining costs per ounce increased compared to the previous year, primarily attributed to reduced gold equivalent production and Mandalay's relatively high proportion of fixed costs. That being said, for the full year, our consolidated cash cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent produced was $1,100, while the all-in sustaining cost was $1,497."" Nick Dwyer, CFO commented: ""As at the end of Q4 2023, the Company maintained a healthy financial position, concluding with $26.9 million in available cash on hand and a net cash position of $3.3 million. It's important to highlight that year-end cash and net cash positions were adversely affected by an unusual delay in receipts resulting from concentrate shipment delays, which were eventually received soon after the quarter. As of the end of January 2024, our cash balance has risen to approximately $36.8 million. ""Costerfield delivered a robust financial quarter, achieving $28.5 million in revenue and generating $17.0 million in adjusted EBITDA. This impressive margin was facilitated by processed grades of 13.1 g/t gold and 2.1% antimony. In support of our organic growth initiatives, we spent $8 million in exploration expenditures at this site during the year. ""Björkdal continued with its consistent quarter-over-quarter performance, recording $22.1 million in revenue, marking a significant 42% increase generated during the corresponding period last year. The upswing was largely credited to elevated gold grades, particularly from the Eastern Extension zone. The operation remains committed to prioritizing the mining of higher-grade gold areas of this extensive gold system."" Mr. Bourchier concluded: ""We are pleased to close the year on a positive note and aim to sustain this momentum as we work towards fulfilling our long-term growth and value creation goals. In 2024, our commitment remains steadfast in delivering sustainable growth and value for our shareholders, all while prioritizing safety, environmental responsibility, and community engagement. Concurrently, we continue the focus of strengthening our balance sheet.""

Cash and all-in sustaining costs at Björkdal were $1,299/oz and $1,664/oz, respectively, compared to cash and all-in sustaining costs of $1,362/oz and $1,810/oz, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Björkdal continues to show improvement in production and sales figures. During Q4 2023, Björkdal generated $22.1 million in revenue and $7.5 million in adjusted EBITDA, which resulted in net income of $3.5 million. The production of 11,558 ounces was higher than the 10,256 ounces produced in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher processed grades, mainly coming from the Eastern Extension zone. Lupin, Nunavut, Canada Care and maintenance spending at Lupin was less than $0.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, which was same as in the fourth quarter of 2022. Reclamation spending at Lupin was $0.8 million during 2023 compared to $7.4 million in 2022. While ongoing reclamation activities will ramp back up in 2024 as compared with 2023, the majority of the remaining reclamation work is expected during 2025. Lupin is currently in the process of final closure and reclamation activities, which are partly funded by progressive security reductions held by the Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. La Quebrada, Chile No work was carried out on the La Quebrada development property during Q4 2023.

Mandalay's mission is to create shareholder value through the profitable operation and continuing the regional exploration program, at both its Costerfield and Björkdal mines. Currently, the Company's main objectives are to continue mining the high-grade Youle vein at Costerfield, bring the deeper Shepherd veins into production, both of which are expected to continue to supply high-grade ore to the processing plant, and to extend Youle's Mineral Reserves. At Björkdal, the Company will aim to increase production from the Aurora zone and other higher-grade areas in the coming years in order to maximize profit margins from the mine. Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding the Company's anticipated performance in 2023. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results and developments may differ materially from those contemplated by these statements depending on, among other things, changes in commodity prices and general market and economic conditions. The factors identified above are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Mandalay. A description of additional risks that could result in actual results and developments differing from those contemplated by forward-looking statements in this news release can be found under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Mandalay's annual information form dated March 31, 2023, a copy of which is available under Mandalay's profile at www.sedar.com. In addition, there can be no assurance that any inferred resources that are discovered as a result of additional drilling will ever be upgraded to proven or probable reserves. Although Mandalay has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Non-IFRS Measures This news release may contain references to Income from mine operations before depreciation & depletion, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, free cash flow, cash cost per saleable ounce of gold equivalent produced and all-in sustaining cost all of which are non-IFRS measures and do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management uses adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as measures of operating performance to assist in assessing the Company's ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future working capital needs and to fund future capital expenditures, as well as to assist in comparing financial performance from period to period on a consistent basis. Management uses adjusted net income in order to facilitate an understanding of the Company's financial performance prior to the impact of non-recurring or special items. The Company believes that these measures are used by and are useful to investors and other users of the Company's financial statements in evaluating the Company's operating and cash performance because they allow for analysis of its financial results without regard to special, non-cash and other non-core items, which can vary substantially from company to company and over different periods. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income from mine operations, net of administration costs, and before interest, taxes, non-cash charges/(income), intercompany charges and finance costs. The Company defines adjusted net income as net income before special items. Special items are items of income and expense that are presented separately due to their nature and, in some cases, expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them. A reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, on the one hand, and consolidated net income, on the other hand, is included in the MD&A. The Company defines free cash flow as a measure of the Company's ability to generate and manage liquidity. It is calculated starting with the net cash flows from operating activities (as per IFRS) and then subtracting capital expenditures and lease payments. Refer to Section 1.2 of MD&A for a reconciliation between free cash flow and net cash flows from operating activities. For Costerfield, saleable equivalent gold ounces produced is calculated by adding to saleable gold ounces produced, the saleable antimony tonnes produced times the average antimony price in the period divided by the average gold price in the period. The total cash operating cost associated with the production of these saleable equivalent ounces produced in the period is then divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced to yield the cash cost per saleable equivalent ounce produced. The cash cost excludes royalty expenses. Site all-in sustaining costs include total cash operating costs, sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion of reclamation provision and tailings dam amortization. Sustaining capital reflects the capital required to maintain each site's current level of operations. The site's all-in sustaining cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent in a period equals the all-in sustaining cost divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced in the period. For Björkdal, the total cash operating cost associated with the production of saleable gold ounces produced in the period is then divided by the saleable gold ounces produced to yield the cash cost per saleable gold ounce produced. The cash cost excludes royalty expenses. Site all-in costs include total cash operating costs, royalty expense, accretion, depletion, depreciation and amortization. Site all-in sustaining costs include total cash operating costs, sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion of reclamation provision and tailings dam amortization. Sustaining capital reflects the capital required to maintain each site's current level of operations. The site's all-in sustaining cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent in a period equals the all-in sustaining cost divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced in the period. For the Company as a whole, cash cost per saleable gold equivalent ounce is calculated by summing the gold equivalent ounces produced by each site and dividing the total by the sum of cash operating costs at the sites. Consolidated cash cost excludes royalty and corporate level general and administrative expenses. This definition was updated in the third quarter of 2020 to exclude corporate general and administrative expenses to better align with industry standard. All-in sustaining cost per saleable ounce gold equivalent in the period equals the sum of cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces at all operating sites in the period plus corporate overhead expense in the period plus sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion, depletion, depreciation and amortization, divided by the total saleable gold equivalent ounces produced in the period. A reconciliation between cost of sales and cash costs, and also cash cost to all-in sustaining costs are included in the MD&A.

ALUPCO®'s role in this partnership extends beyond mere production capabilities; it represents a strategic business pivot towards sustainability and may influence other companies in the region to follow suit, potentially accelerating the renewable energy transition in the Middle East. Financial Analyst Investors may view the partnership between Array Technologies and ALUPCO® as a positive signal for Array's future financial performance. The expansion into the Middle East could open up new revenue streams and diversify Array's geographical footprint, potentially mitigating risks associated with market concentration. The involvement in the Private Sector Forum also suggests that Array is actively engaging with key stakeholders, which can be critical for navigating the regulatory environments and securing large-scale projects.It is important to monitor how this partnership will translate into financial metrics for Array Technologies. The market will be looking for indicators such as order backlogs, revenue growth from the region and margin improvements as a result of the partnership.

Positive Double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability in Q4 and fiscal year 2023. Successful Jafra acquisition leading to revenue growth and improved EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Expansion plans into the US and Peru markets in 2024. Focus on cost efficiencies and revenue growth for continued positive EBITDA and cash flow generation. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Betterware de México S.A.P.I. de C.V. reflects a robust fiscal year, with a significant 13.1% increase in net revenue and a 17.5% increase in EBITDA year-over-year. The company's gross margin improvement by 265 basis points (bps) is notable, indicating efficiency in cost management and potentially favorable procurement conditions. The expansion of the EBITDA margin by 556 bps in Q4 and 79 bps for the full year suggests operational leverage and effective cost control measures. Despite a strong cash flow performance, a 34.2% decrease in free cash flow in Q4 compared to the previous year raises questions about the company's capital allocation or potential increases in capital expenditures. Moreover, the reduction in net debt and the Net Debt/TTM EBITDA ratio to 1.8x is a positive sign of financial health, indicating a solid balance sheet. However, the decrease in the interest coverage ratio suggests that rising interest rates are impacting the company's debt servicing ability, which could become a concern if rates continue to escalate. Investors might find the company's growth strategy, including the launch of Betterware in the US and Peru, as well as the performance of Jafra Mexico, to be potential catalysts for future growth. However, the international expansion carries execution risk and requires significant investment, which could affect short-term profitability. Market Research Analyst Betterware de México's performance in the home solutions and beauty markets in Mexico indicates a strong recovery post-pandemic with a 7% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenues. The company's strategic focus on its four key elements (Portfolio, Incentives, Ease of Doing Business and Kinship) appears to be resonating with consumers and driving growth. The beauty market, in particular, holds significant potential, as evidenced by the 50% market share served by direct sales. However, the decline in the number of associates and consultants raises concerns about the sustainability of sales force-driven growth. The company's emphasis on stabilizing this base and its efforts to improve retention and recruitment could be critical in maintaining growth momentum. The anticipated launch in the US market could provide a new revenue stream, but it also presents challenges in terms of brand recognition and competition in a new market. Market penetration in Latin America, particularly through Jafra's operations, suggests a strategic move to capitalize on the region's growth potential. The company's plan to introduce Betterware to the US market and launch in Peru by 2025 points to long-term growth ambitions, but it also suggests a need for careful market analysis and adaptation to local consumer preferences. Economist The financial results of Betterware de México demonstrate a macroeconomic resilience and an ability to navigate the complexities of the Mexican economy. The company's strategic initiatives, such as cost savings across various areas and a focus on EBITDA growth, reflect a strong understanding of operational efficiency in a fluctuating economic environment. The gross margin compression in Q4 for Betterware Mexico, despite a yearly increase, suggests potential pressure from external factors such as exchange rates or commodity prices. The company's hedging strategies and negotiations with suppliers will be crucial to mitigate these risks going forward. Additionally, the improvement in inventory holding periods and supplier conditions indicates an effective supply chain management that can adapt to market changes. With the international expansion, the company will need to adapt to different economic conditions, particularly in the US, where consumer behavior and regulatory environments differ significantly from Mexico. The success of these ventures will depend on the company's ability to leverage its experience in Mexico to navigate these new markets. 02/22/2024 - 06:52 PM GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Betterware de México S.A.P.I. de C.V. (NASDAQ: BWMX), (""Betterware"" or the 'Company""), announced today its consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023. The figures presented in this report are expressed in nominal Mexican Pesos (Ps.) unless otherwise noted, presented and approved by the Board of Directors, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and may include minor differences due to rounding. The Company will host a conference call at 9:00 am (Eastern Time) on February 23, 2024, to discuss its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Message from the Chairman We are immensely proud of our performance throughout the last quarter of the year, which significantly contributed to our strong overall results for 2023. This includes achieving double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability. Moreover, our robust cashflow generation has enabled us to further strengthen our capital structure and bolster the resilience of our balance sheet as we enter 2024. As a group, we have embarked upon a phase of renewed growth, driven in part by the notable stabilization of Mexico's home solutions market following the pandemic's disruptive impact. This, coupled with strong execution on commercial strategies based on our four key elements (Portfolio, Incentives, Ease of Doing Business, and Kinship) have fueled a resurgence in growth at Betterware Mexico, reflected in a 7% year over year increase in Q4 revenues. Further, Jafra Mexico continues to capture the tremendous opportunity in Latin America's second largest beauty market and the tenth largest globally. And we are well-positioned to grow Jafra US and to introduce Betterware to the US market in 2024. Our Jafra acquisition has proven both successful and highly accretive; surpassing our expectations and delivering exceptional results. Prior to the acquisition, Jafra Mexico faced a declining trend in net revenue, which we successfully reversed to secure double-digit growth in 2023. Similarly, EBITDA and EBITDA margin have followed this positive trend. The initial implementation of our proven model's key pillars- product innovation, technology, and business intelligence- has propelled the company back into a growth phase while elevating profitability to new heights. We have also realized meaningful synergies resulting in cost savings across various areas including catalog printouts, cardboard, insurance, market research, software, technology resources, and organizational optimization. Jafra is poised for a strong trajectory within Mexico's large and growing beauty market, approximately 50% of which is served by the direct sales segment. 2023 has been a pivotal year in our pursuit of becoming the number one direct sales beauty company in Mexico, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to implementing all necessary transformations to achieve this goal. We are currently ramping up our international operations. Despite 2023's challenging start at Jafra US, due to unforeseen decisions made by the prior newly installed management, we have successfully stabilized revenue and made important decisions to position the Company for future growth. A key milestone was almost reaching operational breakeven in the fourth quarter. This marks a crucial turning point for the Company, setting the stage for a new phase of financial stability and expansion opportunities. In parallel, Betterware US is ready for launch at the beginning of Q2, showcasing an enhanced direct selling model that we are confident will pave the way for success. Finally, we made continued progress to launch Betterware in Peru during the first half of 2025. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on successfully executing our commercial plans to expand top line growth with an eye towards cost efficiencies, building upon our strong results for continued positive EBITDA and cash flow generation. Without minimizing the challenges we have faced, I am confident in our promising path ahead. Our Company's strong foundation of decades as an industry leader, coupled with our revitalized management, remains a winning formula for success. We are committed to setting ambitious goals and upholding the highest standards, enabling us to fulfill our mission of creating opportunities for more individuals to enhance their lives. Luis G.

Despite softer growth recovery than anticipated, we are now on the right track and committed to executing all our strategies to strengthen this revenue growth.2024 Focus: Adhere to strategic commercial plan.Increased EBITDA margin: 4Q23 and FY23 margins improved by 153-bps and 170-bps when compared to the prior year, mainly explained by a more streamlined operational structure and effective expense control.Notable decrease in direct expenses: 4.2-pps in 4Q23 and 3.2-pps in FY23 versus last year, due to efficient promotions, reduced catalog and packaging material costs, and improved pick and pack processes.­Significant operating expense reduction: 15.8% in 4Q23 and 9.6% in FY23, mainly due to adjustments made during 3Q22 and 4Q22, incurring in extraordinary expenses to align the operational structure with the new sales level.Financial discipline focus in 2024 to preserve gross margin and manage direct and operating expenses effectively.Regained strength in generating operating cash flow. Operating cash flow in FY23 reached Ps. 1,178M, marking a significant 254% increase compared to FY22.Transition in working capital from a negative to a positive change.Marked improvement in the cash conversion cycle for 4Q23 to 14 days, down from 73 days in 4Q22, primarily due to enhancement in days inventory outstanding (DIO).Expecting strong cash flow generation through a combined focus on commercial and operating strategies, including increased inventory management efficiencies.Stabilized Sales Force. Stabilization in Associate and Distributor bases, although figures remain below 2022 levels.Over the past four quarters, the Associate churn rate has mirrored the rate of new incorporations.Improving monthly incorporation in 2023 reaching 15.2% as compared to rate in 2022 was 12.6%, thus allowing us to remain stable.Continued growth of Distributors projected to activate recruitment of new Associates.Churn reduction strategies include:Generating more sales per Associate derived from a better overall portfolio management.Offering segmented incentives for Associates to remain with us.Developing improved training programs.Fostering more kinship with Associates.Gross Margin: Gross margin contracted 730-bps in 4Q23 compared to 4Q22, which can be explained by: 270-bps from prices reductions to be more competitive (benefits from the appreciation of the Mexican Peso passed on to consumers), 170-bps from a higher promotional share within the sales mix due to a very successful Christmas portfolio during the season, 180-bps for air freight incurred to have enough merchandise for a higher demand than expected, and 132-bps contracted due to an increase in import taxes (in some products) made by local authorities in 4Q23. For FY23, the gross margin closed at 57.3%, hitting the lower boundary of the expected range for this business.For 2024, we anticipate our gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59% derived from: (a) sales mix shift towards core products with higher margins, (b) Cost structure fortified through FX hedging and fixed freight costs, and (c) 2024 pricing strategy designed to maintain competitiveness and ensure profitability.Reducing Inventory: 13% reduction in total inventory compared to the previous year, but still have excesses from heightened innovation activities in 2023.During 2023, we achieved a 77% reduction in 2022's excess inventory, exceeding our target of 50% for the year, with the balance intended for 2024. Nevertheless, the year's innovation efforts resulted in additional inventory accumulation, hindering expected reductions. We expect to reduce almost all excess inventories throughout 2024.2024 Priorities Strategic commercial plan: Several initiatives to grow net revenue included in our 2024 commercial plan, which comprise the launching of new Betterware sub-brands, licensing collaborations for specific products, Betterware Design Lab expansion, sponsorships (Mexican Olympic Team), catalog enhancements, branding campaigns, social media presence, tailored incentives for Associates/Distributors, as well as, more training, innovative financing options for product purchases, and technological enhancements to the Betterware+ App. Jafra Mexico Key Operating and Financial Metrics 4Q23 4Q22 2023 2022 Net Revenue $1,668,956 $1,522,363 +9.6 % $6,354,952 $4,198,120 +51.4 % Gross Margin 86.5 % 80.7 % +581 bps 83.7 % 81.9 % +185 bps EBITDA $532,780 $366,790 +45.3 % $1,287,036 $854,250 +50.7 % EBITDA Margin 31.9 % 24.1 % +783 bps 20.3 % 20.3 % (10 bps) *2022 Figures include Jafra´s operations since April 7th, 2022. 4Q23 4Q22 2023 2022 Consultants Avg.

The consultant base reflected a considerable 10.6% sequential quarterly increase by the end of 4Q23. Leaders saw almost a 1.0% increase in the same period.FY23 strategy led to a reduction in Leader base for quality improvement (re-engage leaders in the business to increase their sales and those of their lineage), while Consultants grew by 2.6% year on year.2024 strategy: Focus shift to recruitment from retention (2023), supported by planned monthly initiatives to encourage enrollment.Established program to develop more Consultants into Leaders.Average monthly order increasing. 8.7% and 14.4% growth in average monthly orders for Consultants and Leaders, respectively, in 4Q23 compared to the previous quarter.Consistent optimal monthly activity rates for Consultants and Leaders throughout the year.This productivity created an ideal mix for revenue growth of 9.6% in 4Q23 and 51.4% in FY23, when compared to the previous year.2024 focus on encouraging the involvement of the next generation within our base of top leaders and increasing our conversion rate from the base of young Consultants to Leaders.Enhanced Gross Margin.

This also applies to the 1.9-pps enhancement for FY23.Favorable product mix and exceptional performance from a strategic plan to boost sales of top and medium product sellers, supported by the Fragrance category, resulting in segmented pricing.Anticipating a normalized gross margin in 2024, within the 80% to 82% range.EBITDA and EBITDA margin at historic highs: Achieved a 7.8-pps margin improvement in 4Q23 due to increased net revenue, gross margin, and operational expense efficiencies resulting from the adjustments made in 2022, which were fully reflected in 2023 operating results. These improvements helped balance additional direct expense investments aimed at recovering the Consultants base, with expected short-term benefits aligned with Consultant base growth.Improved cost absorption due to producing more units than initially projected.Contributions from the above factors led to a 45.3% increase in 4Q23 EBITDA and a 50.7% year on year increase for the FY23 (which includes Jafra´s results since the acquisition in April 2022).Anticipated 2024 benefits from 2023 adjustments for increased profitability, including closure of 55 customer service offices, to be offset by call center, chatbot in app, and personalized sales staff service.Cash flow. Strong profitability led to a substantial Ps. 1,028M cash flow from operations, closing the period with a strong balance sheet.Improved cash conversion cycle by extending payment terms to 120 days with most suppliers, from 30 days when acquired.Skin-care category performing below expectations: Skin-care performance marginally surpassed 2022 results but fell short of expectations.2024 strategy to significantly improve category performance:Introducing innovative productsRecalibrate offerings with affordable and competitive optionsTop performing product brand extensions2024 Priorities Revenue enhancement: Implement all strategies within 2024 commercial plan.Expense improvement: identify further expense improvement opportunities.Jafra USA Key Operating and Financial Metrics 4Q23 4Q22 2023 2022 Net Revenue $260,256 $333,472 (22.0 %) $927,947 $966,085 (3.9 %) Gross Margin 74.4 % 76.1 % (165 bps) 75.7 % 74.9 % +82 bps EBITDA $36,361 $19,629 +85.2 % $(638) $(18,997) +96.6 % EBITDA Margin 14.0 % 5.9 % +808 bps -0.1 % -2.0 % +190 bps *2022 Figures include Jafra´s operations since April 7th, 2022. 4Q23 4Q22 2023 2022 Consultants Avg.

These figures should be regarded as understated yet inaccurate due to timing issues in sales recognition, specifically related to the fulfillment of orders placed by our sales force, and in accordance with IFRS 15 we should have not recognized them until delivered. Annual net revenues were presented fairly in all material respects as of December 31st, 2022, and 2023, and for the years then ended. Cut-off adjustments represent a decrease in net revenues and EBITDA in some quarters as follows (Consolidated figures): Same figures 6/30/2022 9/30/2022 12/31/2022 3/31/2023 6/30/2023 9/30/2023 Net Revenues 3,071,360 3,115,894 3,232,460 3,074,500 3,223,935 3,049,230 Cost of sales 941,688 968,678 955,398 839,161 862,241 912,001 Gross Margin 2,129,672 2,147,216 2,277,062 2,235,339 2,361,695 2,137,229 SG&A expenses 1,644,064 1,714,400 1,677,720 1,749,584 1,737,655 1,689,972 EBITDA 485,608 432,816 599,342 485,755 624,040 447,257 This is due to timely issues because a higher portion of Jafra's monthly sales is made in the last week of the month, and orders to consultants take a few days to deliver. Annual cut off for the year ended December 31st, 2023, represented just Ps. 15M, which is not significant and is properly presented. A mere 0.2% of the value of orders placed at the end of each quarter does not materialize as sales, due to damages incurred by the products during their delivery process or returns made by our consultants for receiving a product different from what they ordered.

Ecolab Declares Cash Dividend,2024-02-23T00:06:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Ecolab Inc. declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per common share, continuing its streak of 87 years of paying dividends.","Ecolab Declares Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Ecolab Inc. declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per common share, continuing its streak of 87 years of paying dividends. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Ecolab Inc.'s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per common share is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to shareholders. Given the company's history of paying dividends for 87 consecutive years, this move is likely to be perceived positively by the market, reinforcing investor confidence in Ecolab's consistent performance and long-term strategic planning. Dividends are often a sign of a company's financial health and ability to generate cash flow, which is a critical factor in assessing a stock's attractiveness.From a financial perspective, the declaration of a dividend can have multiple implications. For current investors, it provides a direct income stream and could potentially support the stock price due to the dividend yield's appeal. For prospective investors, it might signal a stable investment opportunity. However, it is also essential to consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. An exceedingly high payout ratio could indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough into its growth prospects, which might be a concern for future valuation. Market Research Analyst In the broader context of the market, Ecolab's announcement aligns with industry practices where established companies with stable cash flows provide regular dividends. This can be particularly attractive in volatile market conditions, where investors may look for safe havens that offer tangible returns. The consistency of Ecolab's dividend payments could also be reflective of its market position and the relative demand stability for its products and services, which are centered around water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that have essential use across various industries.It's also noteworthy that dividend declarations can influence investor sentiment and stock market dynamics. A regular and predictable dividend policy can make a company's stock more attractive to income-focused investors, such as retirees or those seeking low-risk investments. On the other hand, growth-oriented investors might prefer companies that reinvest profits back into the business to fuel expansion and drive capital gains. Therefore, the impact of such news can vary among different investor classes. 02/22/2024 - 07:06 PM ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Ecolab Inc. today declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per common share, to be paid April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2024.

Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund Enters Into $135 Million Revolving Credit Facility,2024-02-22T23:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (KYN) announced a $135 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing a $175 million facility. The interest rate is SOFR plus 1.40%.

(KYN) announced a $135 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing a $175 million facility. The interest rate is SOFR plus 1.40%. The Company had $1 million borrowed as of February 22, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (KYN) regarding the new $135 million unsecured revolving credit facility is a strategic financial move that bears analysis. The reduction in the facility size from $175 million to $135 million suggests a recalibration of the fund's debt strategy. This could be interpreted as a positive signal indicating that the fund is optimizing its capital structure, potentially reducing the cost of capital. The interest rate being tied to SOFR plus a variable percentage based on asset coverage ratios is noteworthy. With the current rate at SOFR plus 1.40%, it reflects a favorable borrowing cost in the current economic climate, assuming that SOFR remains within expected ranges.For investors and stakeholders, the implications of this credit facility are multifaceted. On the one hand, it provides the fund with liquidity that can be used for investment opportunities or to manage cash flows more effectively. On the other hand, the commitment fee on unused amounts could be a drag on earnings if the facility is underutilized. The short-term maturity of the facility also suggests that KYN may need to renegotiate or refinance this line of credit in a year, which could be subject to the prevailing interest rates and market conditions at that time. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the terms of the credit facility could reflect the lender's view of the energy infrastructure sector's risk profile. The narrower range of interest rates (SOFR plus 1.40% to SOFR plus 2.25%) compared to broader market variations indicates confidence in the fund's asset management and sector stability. This confidence could stem from the essential nature of energy infrastructure, which tends to provide steady cash flows and can be less sensitive to economic downturns.Further analysis of the fund's distribution policy reveals a flexible approach to shareholder returns, with the rate potentially being adjusted based on market conditions and portfolio performance. This flexibility could be appealing to income-focused investors, particularly in a volatile market environment. However, the lack of guaranteed distribution amounts means that investors must be cognizant of the underlying risks associated with the variability of returns. Legal Expert Legally, the press release's cautionary note emphasizes regulatory compliance and the non-binding nature of the communication, which is standard for such announcements. It is crucial for investors to understand that the press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy securities. This distinction is important to mitigate potential legal misunderstandings and to underscore that investment decisions should not be based solely on this announcement. Additionally, the availability of the credit agreement on the company's website provides transparency and allows for further due diligence by interested parties. 02/22/2024 - 06:05 PM HOUSTON, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Pembina Pipeline Corporation, including the record full-year earnings and adjusted EBITDA, are significant indicators of the company's performance and financial health. The reduction in estimated project costs for the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline Expansion and the strong balance sheet, as evidenced by the proportionately consolidated debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, are particularly noteworthy. These factors suggest a disciplined approach to cost management and a robust financial structure, which can be appealing to investors and may influence the stock's attractiveness.Moreover, the declaration of a common share cash dividend aligns with shareholder return strategies, which is often a key consideration for both current and potential investors. The financial and operational data provided, including year-over-year comparisons, offer a comprehensive view of the company's operational efficiency and market position. However, it is important to consider the broader industry context, including commodity price fluctuations and regulatory changes, which can affect future performance. Energy Sector Analyst The long-term agreements with Dow Chemical Canada for ethane supply and transportation, as well as the contracting on the Nipisi Pipeline, underscore Pembina's strategic positioning within the energy infrastructure space. These developments not only secure future revenue streams but also demonstrate the company's ability to capitalize on industry trends, such as the growing demand for ethane as a feedstock in petrochemical production.The expansion of the Wapiti Plant is another strategic investment that could enhance Pembina's competitive edge by increasing natural gas processing capacity. However, the success of such expansions hinges on the continued demand for natural gas and the company's ability to execute projects on time and within budget. Investors should also assess the potential risks associated with regulatory approvals and environmental concerns that could impact project timelines and costs. Market Research Analyst Pembina's performance, as reflected in the record adjusted EBITDA and earnings, is a positive signal for the company's market position. The incremental contract on the Nipisi Pipeline and the Wapiti Plant expansion are likely to strengthen Pembina's service offerings and could potentially lead to increased market share. However, the decrease in full-year earnings compared to the previous year, despite higher adjusted EBITDA, warrants a closer examination of the underlying factors, such as non-operational items that may have influenced the earnings figures.It's critical to analyze the impact of these financial results in the context of investor expectations and industry benchmarks. While the dividend increase may be seen as a positive development, it is essential to evaluate whether this is sustainable in the long term, given the capital expenditure commitments and potential volatility in energy markets. 02/22/2024 - 06:11 PM All financial figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.

Financial & Operational Highlights Adjusted EBITDA Pembina reported record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $1,033 million in the fourth quarter and record full year adjusted EBITDA of $3,824 million. This represents a $108 million or 12 percent increase, and a $78 million or two percent increase, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, reported adjusted EBITDA reflects strong performance in the Pipelines and Facilities divisions as Pembina continues to benefit from growing volumes and higher tolls on certain systems, as well as continued strong results from the marketing business. Pipelines reported adjusted EBITDA of $617 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $69 million or 13 percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, Drayton Valley Pipeline, and on the recently reactivated Nipisi Pipeline; higher tolls primarily on the Cochin Pipeline and Peace Pipeline systems, largely related to contractual inflation adjustments; and lower contribution from the Alliance Pipeline, primarily due to lower interruptible tolls and volumes. Pipelines reported adjusted EBITDA of $2,234 million for the full year, representing a $107 million or five percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: higher contracted volumes and tolls on the Peace Pipeline system; higher tolls and the impact of a higher U.S. dollar exchange rate on the Cochin Pipeline; higher volumes on the Vantage Pipeline due to third party outages in 2022; reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline; lower volumes and higher operating costs due to the Northern Pipeline system outage and the Alberta and British Columbia wildfires (the ""Wildfires""); and lower contribution from the Alliance Pipeline, primarily due to the sale of linepack inventory in 2022, lower interruptible tolls and volumes, and seasonal contracts being replaced by firm contracts at lower regulated rates. Facilities reported adjusted EBITDA of $324 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $36 million or 13 percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: higher contribution from the PGI assets, primarily from the former Energy Transfer Canada plants, the Hythe Plant, and the Dawson Assets due to higher volumes; and higher revenue at Vancouver Wharves. Facilities reported adjusted EBITDA of $1,213 million for the full year, representing a $76 million or seven percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: higher contribution from the PGI assets, due to higher volumes primarily at the former Energy Transfer Canada plants, the Hythe Plant, and the Dawson Assets; a gain on the recognition of a finance lease; and lower volumes at the Redwater Complex and at Younger primarily due to the Northern Pipeline system outage. Marketing & New Ventures reported adjusted EBITDA of $173 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $2 million or one percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: higher contribution from Aux Sable; lower natural gas marketing margins due to the decrease in Chicago natural gas prices, as well as lower crude oil margins resulting from the lower prices across the crude oil complex, largely offset by higher NGL margins, primarily due to lower input natural gas prices and higher marketed NGL volumes; and realized losses on commodity-related derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2022. Marketing & New Ventures reported adjusted EBITDA of $597 million for the full year, representing a $124 million or 17 percent decrease compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: lower crude oil, NGL, and natural gas margins, resulting from a decrease in commodity prices; lower contribution from Aux Sable; and realized gains on commodity-related derivatives in 2023, compared to realized losses in 2022. Corporate reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $81 million for the fourth quarter, which was largely consistent with the same period in the prior year. Results were impacted by higher incentive costs driven by Pembina's share price performance and increased shared service revenue. Corporate reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $220 million for the full year, representing an $19 million or eight percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: lower general and administrative costs, net of increased shared service revenue; and lower long-term incentive costs. Earnings Pembina reported fourth quarter earnings of $698 million and full year earnings of $1,776 million. This represents a $455 million or 187 percent increase, and a $1,195 million or 40 percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. Pipelines had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $677 million, representing a $382 million or 129 percent increase over the prior period. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to the reversal of a previous impairment related to the Nipisi Pipeline, as well as the Ruby settlement provision and associated legal fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. Pipelines had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $1,840 million, representing a $425 million or 30 percent increase over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA and the factors impacting fourth quarter reportable segment earnings before tax, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year was due to higher depreciation. Facilities had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $143 million representing a $2 million or one percent decrease over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to lower project write-offs recognized in the quarter, largely offset by higher depreciation. Facilities had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $610 million representing a $1,194 million or 66 percent decrease over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year was due to the $1.1 billion gain recognized on the PGI Transaction during the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower depreciation and lower project write-offs. Marketing & New Ventures had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $204 million representing a $108 million or 113 percent increase over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to an unrealized gain on commodity-related derivatives compared to a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022, lower net finance costs due to decreased foreign exchange losses, and a change in the insurance contract provision in the period. Marketing & New Ventures had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $435 million representing a $273 million or 39 percent decrease, over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the full year was due to an unrealized loss on commodity-related derivatives compared to a gain in 2022, partially offset by lower net finance costs due to gains recognized on non-commodity related derivatives compared to losses in 2022. In addition to the changes in reportable segment earnings before tax for each division discussed above, the change in fourth quarter earnings compared to the prior period was due to higher income tax expense due to higher earnings compared to the prior period, partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets. The change in the full year earnings compared to the prior year was also primarily due to higher income tax expense due to the tax impact of the PGI Transaction in 2022. Cash Flow From Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities of $880 million for the fourth quarter and $2,635 million for the full year represent a seven percent and ten percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the change in non-cash working capital, higher taxes paid, and a decrease in payments collected through contract liabilities, partially offset by higher operating results. The decrease in the full year was primarily driven by the change in non-cash working capital, lower operating results, a decrease in payments collected through contract liabilities, and higher share-based compensation payments, partially offset by higher distributions from equity accounted investees and lower taxes paid. On a per share (basic) basis, cash flow from operating activities was $1.60 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.79 per share for the full year. This represents decreases of seven percent and ten percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Adjusted Cash Flow From Operating Activities Adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $747 million for the fourth quarter and $2,646 million for the full year, represent an eight percent increase and one percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital and taxes paid, partially offset by higher current income tax expense. The decrease in the full year was primarily driven by the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital, taxes paid, and share-based compensation payments, combined with higher current tax expense, partially offset by lower accrued share-based payment expense. On a per share (basic) basis, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.36 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.81 per share for the full year. This represents an increase of nine percent and no change, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Volumes Total volumes of 3,453 mboe/d for the fourth quarter and 3,306 mboe/d for the full year represent an increase of two percent and a decrease of two percent, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. Pipelines volumes of 2,652 mboe/d in the fourth quarter represent a two percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2023, higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, as well as higher volumes on the Drayton Valley Pipeline. Pipelines volumes of 2,538 mboe/d for the full year represent a one percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2023, and higher volumes on the Vantage Pipeline due to third-party outages in 2022, partially offset by lower volumes related to the Northern Pipeline system outage, and the impacts of the Wildfires. Facilities volumes of 801 mboe/d in the fourth quarter were consistent with the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher volumes from PGI, primarily at the Hythe Gas Plant and at the Dawson Assets, largely offset by lower volumes at the Redwater Complex. Facilities volumes of 768 mboe/d for the full year represent an 11 percent decrease compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors: the disposition of Pembina's interest in the E1 and E6 assets in exchange for a processing agreement that provides Pembina with the right to first priority for gas processing at all Plains Midstream-operated assets at Empress; lower volumes at the Redwater Complex and at Younger resulting from the Northern Pipeline system outage and planned outages in the third quarter of 2023; and higher volumes from PGI, primarily at the former Energy Transfer Canada plants and at the Dawson Assets. Excluding the impact of the disposition of Pembina’s interest in the E1 and E6 assets at Empress, the Northern Pipeline system outage, and the Wildfires, Facilities volumes would have increased by five percent in 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Marketed NGL volumes of 217 mboe/d in the fourth quarter represents a 12 percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher propane, ethane, and butane sales. Marketed NGL volumes of 185 mboe/d in the full year were largely consistent with the same period in the prior year. Quarterly Common Share Dividend Pembina's board of directors has declared a common share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.6675 per share, to be paid, subject to applicable law, on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. The common share dividends are designated as ""eligible dividends"" for Canadian income tax purposes. For non-resident shareholders, Pembina's common share dividends should be considered ""qualified dividends"" and may be subject to Canadian withholding tax. For shareholders receiving their common share dividends in U.S. funds, the cash dividend is expected to be approximately U.S. $0.4940 per share (before deduction of any applicable Canadian withholding tax) based on a currency exchange rate of 0.7401. The actual U.S. dollar dividend will depend on the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate on the payment date and will be subject to applicable withholding taxes. Quarterly dividend payments are expected to be made on the last business day of March, June, September and December to shareholders of record on the 15th day of the corresponding month, if, as and when declared by the board of directors. Should the record date fall on a weekend or on a statutory holiday, the record date will be the next succeeding business day following the weekend or statutory holiday. Executive Overview 2023 results reflect the strength of Pembina's business and are highlighted by record annual adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion that exceeded the high end of our original guidance range. These results reflect growing volumes across many systems and a strong contribution from the marketing business. While operations in the first half of the year were impacted by the Wildfires and the Northern Pipeline system outage, the second half of the year more accurately reflected the underlying positive momentum in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (the ""WCSB""). This is demonstrated most notably by the more than four percent year-over-year increase in second half volumes in the conventional pipelines business. Progressing Pembina's Strategy In early 2023, Pembina outlined a strategy designed to ensure it remains resilient into the future. Guided by this strategy, we are working every day to strengthen our existing business to ensure we help meet the energy needs of today and maximize the value of oil and gas products from Western Canada by getting them to the best markets in the world. We also recognize that the future of energy will require lower emissions and new energy solutions - there is a tremendous opportunity for Pembina to leverage its existing core business to help meet that challenge. Furthermore, our strategy demonstrates the value we place on doing this important work in a way that benefits everyone that has a stake in Pembina’s business – our investors, customers, employees, and communities. A highlight of the fourth quarter was the announcement of a $3.1 billion acquisition of Enbridge’s interests in Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures (the ""Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition""). Pembina's business is built around integrated, difficult-to-replicate assets that provide an enduring competitive advantage and unequaled market access for customers. Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable are world-class energy infrastructure assets and increasing our existing ownership in them will further strengthen our growing franchise. The Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition complements Pembina's strategy of providing access for world-class, long-life resources from the WCSB to premium end markets and increases exposure to lighter hydrocarbons, including natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The 30-day waiting period under U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired without any further queries from the applicable regulators. Pembina continues to expect the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition to close in the first half of 2024. In 2023, Pembina further progressed its strategy by sustaining and enhancing our business through various previously disclosed accomplishments. These include signing new contracts on the Peace Pipeline system; signing new, or extending existing, contracts at the Redwater Complex; reactivating the Nipisi Pipeline; and approving new projects such as the 55,000 bpd RFS IV expansion, the expansion of the NEBC pipeline system, and a cogeneration facility at PGI's Kaybob 3 Plant. In addition, Pembina is pleased to provide the following business updates: PGI has approved an expansion (the ""Wapiti Expansion"") that will increase natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The Wapiti Plant is fully integrated into Pembina’s value chain and the liquids processed at the plant are transported on the Peace Pipeline system. The Wapiti Expansion is being driven by strong customer demand supported by growing Montney production and will be fully underpinned by long-term, take-or-pay contracts. The Wapiti Expansion, which includes a new sales gas pipeline and other related infrastructure, is expected to cost $140 million (net to Pembina) with an estimated in-service date in the first half of 2026, subject to regulatory and environmental approval. In November, Dow announced it is proceeding with construction of a new integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Fort Saskatchewan (the ""Path2Zero Project""), which is scheduled be completed in two phases with in-service dates in 2027 and 2029, respectively. This is an important development for the WCSB, representing a significant increase to the current ethane market in Alberta. Given Pembina's existing leading ethane supply and transportation business and extensive and integrated value chain, there are multiple opportunities for the Company to benefit from this new development, through both the existing asset base and new investment opportunities. First, Pembina is excited to announce that it has entered into long-term agreements with Dow to supply up to 50,000 bpd of ethane and for the associated transportation on the Alberta Ethane Gathering System (""AEGS""). Second, Pembina is a major supplier of ethane to the petrochemical industry. To expand its existing ethane supply portfolio, in support of the agreement with Dow, Pembina is evaluating several possible options to invest in new infrastructure, including incremental deep-cut processing capacity at certain PGI gas plants, de-ethanizer expansions at existing fractionation facilities, potential new straddle facilities, and smaller capital efficient expansion opportunities. Finally, the Path2Zero Project will directly drive incremental ethane demand, the extraction of which should also increase the supply of other associated NGL - propane, butane and condensate. The resulting volume growth across the WCSB will benefit Pembina over a period of many years and support higher utilization and potential expansions of its assets, including gas processing facilities, the Redwater fractionation complex, the Peace and Northern pipeline systems, the AEGS, and storage facilities. Pembina recently closed open seasons on the Cochin Pipeline for a total of 90,000 bpd with contracts expiring between 2027 and 2030, in respect of contracts previously expiring in July 2024. The open seasons were more than three times oversubscribed, highlighting strong customer interest and the value of Cochin Pipeline service. Cochin Pipeline, which spans from Illinois to Alberta, supplies light condensate to fill a structural diluent shortfall in the WCSB. The desire of shippers to secure long-term capacity highlights the important role that Cochin Pipeline plays in supporting the Canadian oil industry's operations, development, and growth. While contracted tolls are lower than historic levels, Pembina has successfully increased daily volume throughput over the past two years by up to 25,000 bpd, or approximately 25 percent, through operational optimization and equipment upgrades. Given rising production from the Clearwater oil play, Pembina continues to experience strong demand for service on the Nipisi Pipeline, with current volumes of approximately 33,000 bpd. Including an incremental contract signed with an anchor customer in the fourth quarter, more than half of the capacity on the Nipisi Pipeline is now contracted, on a long-term basis, with line of sight to the asset being fully contracted by the end of 2024. Looking Ahead to 2024 and Beyond Momentum within our business is expected to continue and Pembina is well positioned to benefit from what it expects to be a transformational period in the Canadian energy industry. In 2024, Pembina will focus on progressing its current growth projects – the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion, RFS IV, the K3 Cogeneration Facility, the Wapiti Expansion and the NEBC MPS Expansion - and delivering them on time and on budget. We also look forward to progressing our other development opportunities, such as Cedar LNG, the Alberta Carbon Grid, and further expansions of assets in our core business. As well, upon closing of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, we will prioritize integrating those businesses and pursuing the near-term synergies we have identified to extract greater value from these exceptional assets. In December, Pembina announced a 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.725 billion to $4.025 billion, driven by continued volume growth across the WCSB, new assets placed into service, re-contracting of certain assets, and the prevailing commodity price outlook at the time. This guidance range excludes the impact of the recently announced Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition. Pembina will provide further updates to the guidance range as timing of the closing of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition becomes more certain. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Pembina has generated substantial free cash flow, which has been allocated to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. During this time, Pembina has paid down debt, reducing leverage below the low end of its target range in anticipation of funding future capital projects. Pembina expects to remain firmly within its financial guardrails with ample liquidity and its leverage metrics are expected to remain well within the ranges for a strong 'BBB' credit rating. Looking beyond 2024, over the next several years, Pembina sees the potential for mid-single digit annual volume growth across the WCSB, primarily from the northeast British Columbia (""NEBC"") Montney formation. Near-term catalysts, including new LNG export capacity, the completion of the TransMountain Pipeline expansion, and Dow's Path2Zero Project are expected to contribute to WCSB production growth. Pembina is uniquely positioned to capture new volumes and benefit from the growth in the WCSB given the scope and reach of its assets, highly economic expansion opportunities, existing long-term contracts, and agreements with three premier NEBC producers. Consistent with our strategy, we will continue to invest in infrastructure to serve customers and enhance Pembina's integrated value chain, while also pursuing opportunities to enhance access to global markets and better align the Company's future with the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Our investors have come to expect strong and consistent financial leadership from us, demonstrated by a secure and growing dividend, an unwavering commitment to our financial guardrails, a low-risk and primarily fee-based business with high take-or-pay or cost-of-service contributions, and strong balance sheet metrics. Investors can expect us to live up to our reputation and execute our strategy with the same financial discipline that has made Pembina successful to date. Pembina's 2023 Annual Summary, including our messages to shareholders, is available at www.pembina.com/investors/investor-documents-filings. Projects and New Developments(1) Pipelines The Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion will enable segregated pipeline service for ethane-plus and propane-plus NGL mix from Gordondale, Alberta, which is centrally located within the Montney trend, into the Edmonton area for market delivery. The project includes new 10-inch and 16-inch pipelines, totaling approximately 150 kilometres, in the Gordondale to La Glace corridor of Alberta, as well as new mid-point pump stations and terminal upgrades located throughout the Peace Pipeline system. Phase VIII will add approximately 235,000 bpd of incremental capacity between Gordondale, Alberta and La Glace, Alberta, as well as approximately 65,000 bpd of capacity between La Glace, Alberta and the Namao hub near Edmonton, Alberta. The estimated project cost has been revised lower to $430 million (previously $475 million; original budget of $530 million). The revised cost reflects highly effective project management and execution, favourable weather conditions and productive contractor relationships. The project is trending on time, with three pump stations completed. The construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024, with pipeline and facility commissioning and start-up expected in the second quarter of 2024. The NEBC MPS Expansion includes a new mid-point pump station, terminal upgrades, and additional storage, which will support approximately 40,000 bpd of incremental capacity on the NEBC Pipeline system. This expansion is expected to cost $90 million and will fulfill customer demand in light of growing production volumes from NEBC and previously announced long-term midstream service agreements with three premier NEBC Montney producers. The project is trending on time and on budget and is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Pembina continues to evaluate further expansions to support volume growth in northeastern British Columbia, including new pipelines and terminal upgrades on the NEBC Pipeline and downstream systems between Taylor, British Columbia and Gordondale, Alberta. In 2023, Pembina filed its project notification with the Canada Energy Regulator in respect of the interprovincial portion of these expansions. Facilities Pembina is constructing a new 55,000 bpd propane-plus fractionator (""RFS IV"") at its existing Redwater fractionation and storage complex (the ""Redwater Complex""). RFS IV is expected to cost approximately $460 million and will leverage the design, engineering and operating best practices of its existing facilities. The project includes additional rail loading capacity at the Redwater Complex. Subject to regulatory and environmental approvals, RFS IV is expected to be in-service in the first half of 2026 and is currently trending on time and on budget. With the addition of RFS IV, the fractionation capacity at the Redwater Complex will total 256,000 bpd. Site clearing activities have been completed, engineering and procurement activities continue, and site construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024. PGI's Wapiti Expansion will increase natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The project, which includes a new sales gas pipeline and other related infrastructure, is expected to cost $230 million ($140 million net to Pembina) with an estimated in-service date in the first half of 2026, subject to regulatory and environmental approval. PGI is developing a 28 MW cogeneration facility at its K3 Plant (the ""K3 Cogeneration Facility""), which is expected to cost $115 million ($70 million net to Pembina). The K3 Cogeneration Facility is expected to reduce overall operating costs by providing power and heat to the gas processing facility, while reducing customers’ exposure to power prices. The K3 Cogeneration Facility is expected to fully supply the K3 Plant's power requirements, with excess power sold to the grid at market rates. Further, this project is expected to contribute to a reduction in annual emissions compliance costs at the K3 Plant through the utilization of the cogeneration waste heat and the low-emission power generated and is expected to be in-service in the first half of 2026. Marketing & New Ventures Cedar LNG has substantially completed several key project deliverables, including obtaining material regulatory approvals; advancing inter-project agreements with Coastal GasLink and LNG Canada; signing a heads of agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. and Black & Veatch Corporation; and executing a lump sum engineering, procurement, and construction agreement (the ""EPC Agreement"") to provide Cedar LNG with the necessary services to construct the project. In order to achieve this momentum, as at December 31, 2023, Pembina had invested approximately $200 million in Cedar LNG. Though numerous milestones have been achieved, the Cedar LNG project still faces a number of schedule driven interconnected elements that require resolution prior to making a final investment decision (""FID""), including binding commercial offtake, obtaining certain third-party consents, and project financing. On this basis, a final investment decision is now expected in the middle of 2024. As a result of the revised FID timing, current year net contributions to Cedar LNG through to the middle of 2024 are expected to be approximately $200 to $300 million. Further, in connection with, and following execution of, the EPC Agreement, Pembina was required to provide financial assurances to advance upstream infrastructure projects. In addition, to further progress the project, Pembina expects to take additional steps which will require providing additional financial assurances. Total financial assurances up to $230 million may be required in 2024, prior to an FID. These financial assurances may become payable in the case of a negative FID. In conjunction with a positive FID, these financial assurances will be transferred to Cedar LNG. Pembina and TC Energy Corporation (""TC Energy"") have formed a partnership to develop the Alberta Carbon Grid (""ACG""), a carbon transportation and sequestration platform. ACG is developing the Industrial Heartland project, which will have the potential to transport and store up to ten million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. ACG completed the appraisal well drilling, logging and testing in December 2023. Preliminary data was consistent with ACG’s storage capacity expectations and further work is underway to confirm the initial results. Throughout 2024, ACG will continue to progress commercial conversations, refine the project scope, and advance project engineering, including facility design and work on the pipeline routing.

The exclusion of unrealized gains or losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments eliminates the non-cash impact of such gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments to earnings for losses (gains) on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, dispositions and restructuring, impairment charges or reversals in respect of goodwill, intangible assets, investments in equity accounted investees and property, plant and equipment, certain non-cash provisions and other amounts not reflective of ongoing operations. These additional adjustments are made to exclude various non-cash and other items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. The equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure to 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance is adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA per common share is a non-GAAP ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 3 Months Ended December 31 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures Corporate & Inter-segment Eliminations Total ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Earnings (loss) before income tax 677 295 143 145 204 96 (209) (206) 815 330 Adjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees and other 45 41 135 107 6 — — — 186 148 Net finance cost 6 6 3 (8) (4) 6 111 109 116 113 Depreciation and amortization 109 104 46 34 12 10 11 14 178 162 Unrealized (gain) loss on commodity-related derivative financial instruments — — — (2) (46) 61 — — (46) 59 Impairment reversal (231) — — — — — — — (231) — Gain on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions and non-cash provisions 11 102 (3) 12 1 (2) 6 1 15 113 Adjusted EBITDA 617 548 324 288 173 171 (81) (82) 1,033 925 Adjusted EBITDA per common share – basic (dollars) 1.87 1.68 12 Months Ended December 31 Pipelines Facilities Marketing & New Ventures Corporate & Inter-segment Eliminations Total ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Earnings (loss) before income tax 1,840 1,415 610 1,804 435 708 (696) (708) 2,189 3,219 Adjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees and other 172 172 438 271 84 25 — — 694 468 Net finance costs 28 28 9 13 4 27 425 418 466 486 Depreciation and amortization 414 396 159 196 46 44 44 47 663 683 Unrealized loss (gain) on commodity-related derivative financial instruments — — — (50) 32 (83) — — 32 (133) Gain on PGI Transaction — — — (1,110) — — — — — (1,110) Impairment reversal (231) — — — — — — — (231) — Transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, transformation and restructuring costs, contract dispute settlement, gain on disposal of assets and non-cash provisions 11 116 (3) 13 (4) — 7 4 11 133 Adjusted EBITDA 2,234 2,127 1,213 1,137 597 721 (220) (239) 3,824 3,746 Adjusted EBITDA per common share – basic (dollars) 6.95 6.78 Adjusted EBITDA from Equity Accounted Investees In accordance with IFRS, Pembina's jointly controlled investments are accounted for using equity accounting.

Adjusted cash flow from operating activities deducts preferred share dividends paid because they are not attributable to common shareholders. The calculation has been modified to include current tax and share-based compensation payment as it allows management to better assess the obligations discussed below. Management believes that adjusted cash flow from operating activities provides comparable information to investors for assessing financial performance during each reporting period. Management utilizes adjusted cash flow from operating activities to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's ability to meet interest obligations, dividend payments and other commitments. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share is a non-GAAP ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted cash flow from operating activities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. 3 Months Ended December 31 12 Months Ended December 31 ($ millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cash flow from operating activities 880 947 2,635 2,929 Cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) 1.60 1.72 4.79 5.30 Add (deduct): Change in non-cash operating working capital (54) (220) 210 (177) Current tax expense (54) 18 (325) (227) Taxes paid, net of foreign exchange 49 28 236 334 Accrued share-based payment expense (44) (51) (67) (117) Share-based compensation payment — — 77 45 Preferred share dividends paid (30) (32) (120) (126) Adjusted cash flow from operating activities 747 690 2,646 2,661 Adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share – basic (dollars) 1.36 1.25 4.81 4.82 Proportionately Consolidated Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA Proportionately Consolidated Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP ratio that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Pembina’s financial information in the evaluation of the Company’s debt levels and creditworthiness.

The investment closed on February 2, 2024, with terms undisclosed. Baseline Fitness aims to grow from 100 to over 150 locations in the next few years under Mayfair's ownership. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Baseline Fitness by Mayfair Capital Partners represents a strategic move within the fitness industry, which is characterized by high competition and a focus on scalable business models. The undisclosed terms of the deal suggest a private transaction, typical for private equity investments. The growth trajectory of Baseline Fitness, aiming to increase its locations by 50% in the near future, indicates a bullish outlook on the market and the potential for increased revenue streams.From a financial perspective, the expansion of Baseline's footprint could lead to economies of scale, potentially lowering per-unit costs and increasing margins. However, the fitness industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles and consumer spending on discretionary items like gym memberships can fluctuate. Investors should monitor consumer trends and economic indicators to gauge the potential success of this expansion. Market Research Analyst Planet Fitness's positioning as a high-value, low-cost provider in the fitness sector is a key differentiator that may have influenced Mayfair's investment decision. The Judgement Free Zone® concept caters to a broad demographic, potentially driving membership growth and retention. The fitness industry is experiencing a shift towards convenience and affordability, trends which Planet Fitness and, by extension, Baseline Fitness, are well-positioned to capitalize on.Moreover, the partnership with an established franchisor like Planet Fitness provides Baseline with a recognizable brand and operational support, which can be critical in new market penetration and customer acquisition. The strategic support from Mayfair could enable Baseline to navigate competitive pressures and regulatory challenges that are inherent in the fitness industry. Economist The investment by Mayfair in Baseline Fitness also reflects broader economic trends, such as the increasing importance of health and wellness in consumer spending. The fitness industry has seen growth in recent years, spurred by rising health consciousness among consumers and technological innovations such as fitness apps and wearable devices.However, the industry is not without its risks. The potential for economic downturns could impact discretionary spending on fitness. Additionally, the increasing saturation of the market and the rise of alternative fitness options, such as at-home workouts, may pose challenges to traditional gym models. The long-term success of this investment will depend on Baseline's ability to adapt to these changing market dynamics and maintain a competitive edge. 02/22/2024 - 06:39 PM CARMEL, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mayfair Capital Partners (“Mayfair”), a division of Oxford Financial Group, Ltd.™ (“Oxford”), on behalf of its underlying investors, has acquired Baseline Fitness LLC, (“Baseline” or the “Company”).

Market Research Analyst The announcement that Dril-Quip, Inc. has been selected to supply subsea wellhead systems for the Woodside Trion development is a significant development for the company and its stakeholders. This partnership is a testament to Dril-Quip's competitive edge in providing field-proven sealing technology and its BigBore™ IIe Subsea Wellheads' capability to handle 2 MM lb. lockdown capacity. Such technical specifications are crucial in deepwater drilling operations, which are characterized by high pressures and the need for reliable, robust equipment.From a market perspective, the contract with Woodside could potentially increase Dril-Quip's revenue stream and enhance its market position in the offshore drilling solutions sector. The fact that the company's Villahermosa, Mexico, facility will support the project also highlights Dril-Quip's strategic investment in regional facilities, which may optimize supply chain efficiency and reduce logistical costs, thereby possibly improving profit margins. Financial Analyst Dril-Quip's engagement in Mexico's first deepwater oil production project represents a strategic move that could have positive implications for the company's financial health. The supply contract for 24 wells indicates a substantial volume of business that can lead to a steady income over the project's duration. The market will likely monitor the execution of this project closely, as its success could lead to further opportunities in the region and signal the company's operational excellence.Investors should note the potential for cost savings due to the BBIIe™ system's design, which eliminates the need for lockdown sleeves. This feature can reduce operational time and costs, potentially leading to higher margins. However, investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with large-scale projects, such as cost overruns, delays and technical challenges that could affect the expected financial returns.

The bank, founded in 1979 to promote foreign trade, has 36,539,860.73 shares outstanding and operates in multiple countries. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bladex's announcement of a quarterly cash dividend of US$0.50 per share is a significant indicator of the bank's financial health and its commitment to shareholder returns. Dividends are often a reflection of a company's confidence in its current profitability and future prospects. This decision by the Board of Directors to distribute a portion of earnings back to shareholders may be perceived positively by the market, potentially impacting the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors.Given the outstanding share count of 36,539,860.73, the total dividend payout amounts to approximately US$18.27 million. This substantial cash outflow must be supported by a strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow generation. Investors should assess Bladex's payout ratio in relation to its earnings to gauge sustainability. A payout ratio that aligns with or is lower than industry averages could be a sign of prudent financial management, whereas a significantly higher ratio might raise concerns over long-term dividend sustainability. Market Research Analyst The regional focus of Bladex on Latin America and the Caribbean, along with its shareholder structure that includes central and state-owned banks, suggests a unique market position that could influence its stability and growth trajectory. The bank's role in promoting foreign trade within the region could be a critical factor in its operational success, especially considering potential economic integration and trade agreements that might affect regional banking services.Investors might also consider the geopolitical and economic climate of Latin America and the Caribbean when evaluating Bladex's performance. Factors such as currency fluctuation, regulatory changes and economic cycles in these countries could affect the bank's operations and, consequently, its ability to maintain dividend payouts. Understanding the bank's risk management strategies in these areas could provide deeper insights into its resilience against regional challenges. 02/22/2024 - 06:00 PM PANAMA CITY, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A.

Negative None. 02/22/2024 - 05:58 PM Production in 2024 is expected to be 120,000 to 140,000 ounces gold equivalent (“AuEq”). The second half of the year is expected to be the strongest, as operations progressively ramp up ahead of the new 1.2 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) Stage 3 Process Plant commissioning, scheduled for the end of Q1 2025.Cash costs between $820-$880 per ounce gold and all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) of $1,440-$1,540 per ounce gold forecasted for 2024. The moderate increase from 2023 guidance for cash costs and AISC is driven by increased accelerated operating and capital development for the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions in addition to development and equipment that was planned for 2023 being completed/delivered in 2024. As outlined in the Integrated Development Plan(1) (“IDP”), we expect a very significant reduction in cash costs and AISC in 2025 and beyond upon commissioning of the Stage 3 Expansion.Large exploration program planned, with $17-$20 million projected for 2024. Surface exploration to focus on Arakompa, Kora South, Judd South and the A1 porphyry, with underground drilling focusing on Kora, Kora South, Kora Deeps, Judd, Judd South, Judd Deeps and Northern Deeps targets.Growth capital forecasted to be $145-$160 million in 2024 and $40-$50 million in 2025. Total growth capital for the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions (including the amount spent to date) is now forecasted at $210 million, a 12% increase from the Stage 4 PEA case of $187 million, as outlined in the IDP(1). The moderate increase in capital costs from the IDP is driven by global cost inflation over the past 2 years since the date of the study (IDP effective date is January 1, 2022) and minor scope changes. As at December 31, 2023, 48% of the Stage 3 and 4 Expansion growth capital has been either spent or committed, and importantly the largest package, the Stage 3 Process Plant, has been awarded on a lump-sum fixed price basis to GR Engineering Services Limited, significantly de-risking the project (see July 24, 2023 press release). The remaining major package to award is the Paste Fill Plant, with plans to award long lead contracts in the coming weeks. Note: All amounts in United States Dollars unless otherwise indicated.(1): Refer to Integrated Development Plan (IDP) Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) Case and PEA Case. IDP effective date is January 1, 2022. IDP has not been updated to reflect the updated Kora and Judd resource estimates (effective date September 12, 2023); however, the Company does not expect the design parameters and conclusions to materially change. The Company expects the potential mine life to be extended for both the DFS and PEA cases. John Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, stated, “We are very excited about the outlook for the Company this year and in particular over the next 18 months, as K92 transforms into a Tier 1 Mid-Tier Producer with the delivery of the Stage 3 Expansion while also having the potential to deliver very significant exploration results from multiple targets as we saw earlier this week with the first two holes reported from our maiden drill program at Arakompa. Operationally, in 2024, our focus is on increasing production from last year, while progressing with various infrastructure projects on surface and underground for the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions. The various growth capital packages, led by our Vice President Projects and Engineering, Chris Kinver, have made significant progress with 48% of the total growth capital either spent or committed as at December 31, 2023. Chris Kinver’s team is also well advanced awarding contracts for our second largest package, the Paste Fill Plant, with the tender process underway for long lead time items, which are expected to be awarded in the coming weeks. On the underground mine, we are making significant investments in sustaining capital ahead of the Stage 3 Process Plant commissioning to establish multiple mining fronts while also introducing infrastructure that we expect will deliver a step-change in productivity. In 2023, Kainantu effectively operated with one mining front, and by the end of 2024, we plan to have three fronts producing, with a fourth planned for 2025. Infrastructure, such as the twin incline, ore and waste passes, in addition to ventilation upgrades are expected to significantly improve efficiencies and material movement capacity. This is also expected to realize very significant economies of scale. And lastly, we continue to see significant value creation potential from exploration, maintaining near-record expenditures through 2024 while we progress the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions. We look forward to providing updates in due course.” VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- K92 Mining Inc. (“K92” or the “Company”) (TSX: KNT; OTCQB: KNTNF) is pleased to provide its operational outlook for 2024. The Company forecasts gold equivalent production of 120,000-140,000 ounces, with the second half of the year expected to be the strongest, as operations progressively ramp up ahead of the Stage 3 Expansion, with the new 1.2 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) Stage 3 Process Plant scheduled for commissioning at the end of Q1 2025. Cost guidance for 2024 forecasts cash costs between $820-$880 per ounce gold and AISC of $1,440-$1,540 per ounce gold. Cash costs and AISC are moderately higher than 2023 guidance, driven by increased accelerated operating and capitalized development ahead of the Stage 3 Expansion, in addition to development and equipment that was planned for 2023 being completed/delivered in 2024. In 2025 and beyond, with the Stage 3 Expansion commissioned, as outlined in the Integrated Development Plan(1), we expect a very significant reduction in both cash costs and AISC. On exploration, a large program is planned, with $17-20 million projected for 2024. Surface exploration will focus on Arakompa, Kora South, Judd South and the A1 porphyry, with underground drilling focusing on Kora, Kora South, Kora Deeps, Judd, Judd South, Judd Deeps and Northern Deeps targets. In terms of growth capital, $145-$160 million is forecasted for 2024 and $40-$50 million for 2025. On the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions, total growth capital is now forecasted at $210 million, a 12% increase from the Stage 4 Expansion PEA case, as outlined in the Integrated Development Plan(1), with the moderate increase driven by global cost inflation over the past two years since the date of the study (January 1, 2022 effective date) and minor scope changes.

Estimates of mineral resources are also forward-looking statements because they constitute projections, based on certain estimates and assumptions, regarding the amount of minerals that may be encountered in the future and/or the anticipated economics of production. The estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Following the submission of the Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (""ESIA"") for the Koné Gold Project in December 2023, a public hearing was held which reaffirmed the strong support for the project. The next step in the permitting process is the formal validation hearing to approve the ESIA. The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum recently reiterated their support for the advancement of the Koné Gold Project, and in anticipation of a successful validation hearing to approve the ESIA, has instructed Montage to submit the Mining Permit Application for the project ahead of the ESIA validation to accelerate the permitting process. As such, the Mining Permit Application is expected to be filed in the coming weeks. Financing ActivitiesDiscussions regarding project financing continue to progress and the Company is encouraged at initial indications of size, structure, and pricing of various alternatives. Exploration Underway to Define Next Satellite DepositsAs shown in Figure 2 below, numerous targets were identified in proximity to the Koné deposit. The key priority area is the Diouma-Gbongogo-Korotou shear zone which is a 15km strike length of soil anomalism where nine targets have been drill tested to some degree. The Gbongogo Main pit and planned haul road are located at the south end of this zone. The Diouma North prospect is located 2km south of the Gbongogo Main pit, and less than 500m from the planned haul road. As follow-up to reconnaissance and RC drilling in early 2023, Montage completed three diamond core holes, with highlight intercepts including: 14m at 2.16g/t from 58m (GBDDH062); and 17.45m at 2.74g/t from 79m and 11m at 2.21g/t from 127m (GBDDH064). Diamond drilling at Diouma re-commenced in January with an initial core programme which, if successful, will be followed up with an RC programme. In addition, over the course of 2024, Montage will be conducting exploration at the Petit Yao target which sits 7km east of Koné and just 3km southeast of the planned haul road.

The removal took effect on February 21, 2024, without the need for special rebalancing. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The removal of CropEnergies AG from the Tortoise Recycling Decarbonization Index and its UCITS counterpart due to the acquisition by Suedzucker AG is a strategic move that may influence the index's performance. Index composition plays a crucial role in risk distribution and potential returns for investors. The pro-rata redistribution of the deleted constituent's weight ensures that the index maintains its balance without necessitating a special rebalancing. However, this change might alter the exposure of the index to certain market sectors, potentially affecting the risk profile and the performance against the market benchmarks.Investors and fund managers who track these indices should closely monitor the performance impact of this removal. The change in composition could lead to a temporary increase in volatility as the market adjusts to the new structure. Additionally, the removal of a constituent often prompts a review of the index's diversification strategy and may lead to the inclusion of new companies that align with the index's thematic focus on recycling and decarbonization. Financial Analyst The acquisition of CropEnergies AG by Suedzucker AG and the subsequent removal of CropEnergies from the RCYCL and RECYCLE indices is a transaction that could have financial implications for both the indices and the companies involved. From a financial perspective, the acquisition could be viewed as a consolidation move within the industry, potentially leading to operational synergies and cost savings for Suedzucker AG.For the indices, the removal of a constituent company may affect the overall market capitalization and liquidity. It is also important to consider the impact on investors holding index-linked financial products, such as ETFs or mutual funds, as the change in index composition could affect the value of their investments. The pro-rata distribution of the deleted constituent's weight to the remaining index constituents could result in a minor reshuffling of portfolio allocations, necessitating adjustments by portfolio managers. Sustainable Investment Analyst The acquisition of CropEnergies AG, a company involved in the production of renewable energy from biomass, by Suedzucker AG, highlights a trend in the industry towards consolidation and could have implications for sustainable investing. The indices in question are focused on recycling and decarbonization, sectors that are increasingly relevant in the context of global efforts to combat climate change.Investors with a focus on sustainability will be interested in how this acquisition aligns with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and whether the combined entity will continue to meet the thematic focus of the indices. The removal of CropEnergies and the adjustment of the indices may also prompt sustainable investors to reassess the ESG credentials of the new index composition and consider the long-term sustainability and performance implications of these changes. 02/22/2024 - 05:35 PM OVERLAND PARK, KS / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / Tortoise today announced that CropEnergies AG (Xetra:CE2 GY) will be removed from the Tortoise Recycling Decarbonization IndexSM (RCYCL) and the Tortoise Recycling Decarbonization UCITSSM Index (RECYCLE), as a result of the approved acquisition by Suedzucker AG.

As a reminder, the Investor Group recently announced the nomination of eight highly qualified, independent candidates (the “Investor Slate”) for election to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). In addition, the Investor Group announced it has identified a proposed management team that includes transportation network leader Jim Barber, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and lifelong railroad operator and turnaround expert Jamie Boychuk as Chief Operating Officer. To learn more about the Investor Slate and proposed management team, download a copy of the Investor Group’s presentation, entitled The Case for Leadership, Safety and Strategy Changes at Norfolk Southern, at www.MoveNSCForward.com. The Investor Group commented: “We agree with the Federal Railroad Administration’s statement that Norfolk Southern’s path to ‘immediate and long-term success is through a relentless focus on safety.’ We also share the agency’s concerns regarding ‘backsliding’ at the Company. Despite making reactionary safety commitments following the preventable derailment in East Palestine, Ohio in 2023, Norfolk Southern’s Board and management team have overseen multiple derailments and the tragic death of an engineer in 2024. This is one of the primary reasons why our proposed management team and slate of director candidates, which includes former policymakers with relevant expertise, continue to follow President Joe Biden’s calls to hold Norfolk Southern accountable. We believe Chair Amy Miles and the Board have presided over yet another failure of oversight by allowing Chief Executive Officer Alan Shaw to allocate millions of dollars to wide-ranging lobbying and public relations efforts, which now appear to be geared toward saving his role as one of the railroad industry’s highest-paid executives. We know for a fact that the Company’s private jets have been heading to Washington, D.C. with great frequency since we privately nominated a slate of director candidates in November of 2023. According to public records, the Company is represented by 41 lobbyists, who are tasked with engaging governmental bodies that include the Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board and Federal Railroad Administration.1 Nearly 80% of these lobbyists are considered ‘revolvers,’ meaning they previously worked at the very government entities they are now talking to on behalf of Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern.2 Fortunately, dedicated and engaged public officials are likely to see through Norfolk Southern’s defensive efforts and villainizing of the Investor Group. While Mr. Shaw is allowed to continue wasting money on self-serving lobbying and public relations strategies, rather than allocating that stream of funds to safety initiatives, we are going to focus on facts that include: Our slate’s Scheduled Network strategy would position the Company to enhance safety and reduce risks by shrinking the number of trains on the track and reducing dangerous workloads that can lead to exhaustion-driven mistakes. Our slate’s top priority is safety because Norfolk Southern cannot deliver sustained value for any stakeholder without first establishing a safety-first culture – Company billboards and photo ops do not translate to a real safety-first culture. Our slate is publicly committing to releasing a 100-day transition plan and detailed strategy overview after it is able to begin soliciting support for proposals at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Mr. Shaw has had more than 30 years to help establish a safety-first culture at Norfolk Southern, but stakeholders continue to have legitimate concerns about the lapses that are still occurring. Mr. Shaw has never held a senior role in operations, which is typically where safety protocols are established and enforced. The employees and partners of Ancora, which is an Ohio-based asset manager that serves the needs of individuals, families, pension funds and other institutions, have loved ones and family who have been directly impacted by the tragedy in East Palestine, Ohio – meaning this campaign is about much more than financial returns to Ancora.” *** About Ancora Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

Shareholders to vote on proposed amendments at an extraordinary general meeting. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The commitment of up to $50 million in equity investment by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the CEO of Vertical Aerospace, signals a strong vote of confidence in the company's future. This infusion of capital could serve to bolster Vertical's financial position, allowing it to continue developing its zero emissions aviation technology. Investors should note that such a move may have a dilutive effect on existing shares, but it also potentially reduces the risk of liquidity issues. The critical aspect to evaluate is the terms of the investment and how it aligns with the company's valuation and growth prospects.Moreover, the requirement for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to vote on amendments to the company's memorandum and articles of association suggests potential changes in corporate governance or operational structure. Shareholders should assess how these amendments might affect their rights and the overall strategy of the company. The outcome of the EGM could have implications on the stock's performance, depending on the market's reception of the proposed changes. Market Research Analyst In the context of the aerospace industry, particularly the emerging sector of zero emissions aviation, Vertical Aerospace's announcement is indicative of the industry's growth trajectory. The commitment from the CEO underscores the increasing importance of sustainable aviation solutions. The investment can be seen as a strategic move to position Vertical at the forefront of this market shift.

The long-term impact on Vertical's market share and revenue generation capabilities, as well as the broader industry dynamics, will be of interest to stakeholders tracking the evolution of eco-friendly transportation solutions. Legal Expert The procedural aspect of calling an EGM to vote on amendments is a formal requirement that reflects the company's adherence to corporate governance norms. The specifics of the proposed amendments will be crucial for shareholders to understand, as they could affect shareholder rights, voting powers and the company's operational flexibility. Legal analysis of the proposed changes should focus on whether they align with best practices in corporate governance and how they might influence the company's ability to make strategic decisions and react to market changes.It is also important to consider the legal implications of the investment agreement itself, including any conditions or covenants imposed on the company. Such terms could have significant effects on the company's operations and governance, potentially influencing future strategic decisions and impacting shareholder value.

The forecast highlights the company's expectations for significant growth and shareholder value increase post-acquisition. Projected net sales and EBITDA figures for FY25, FY26, and FY27 were provided, showcasing the potential financial impact of the acquisition. The company emphasized the importance of the acquisition in driving future growth and value creation for shareholders. Pro forma guidance was presented to offer insights into the combined businesses' performance after the acquisition. Negative None. Financial Analyst The release of TechPrecision Corporation's three-year consolidated forecast following the acquisition of Votaw Precision Technologies provides a significant indicator of the company's growth trajectory and strategic direction. The forecasted increase in net sales and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) for fiscal years 2025 through 2027 suggests an optimistic outlook on the company's operational efficiency and profitability post-acquisition.Analysts would scrutinize the projected EBITDA margins, which appear to improve annually, indicating management's confidence in achieving higher operational leverage and cost synergies. The anticipated consolidation of STADCO into the Votaw facility and the expected leasehold savings are concrete actions that could support these projections. However, the lack of intent to update forecasts could be a point of concern for investors seeking ongoing transparency. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Votaw by TechPrecision is strategically placed within the defense sector, a domain often characterized by long-term contracts and stable revenue streams. The mention of funded purchase orders and government programs such as the Virginia Class submarines and the F-15EX fighter jet program highlights the company's involvement in critical defense supply chains. This could resonate well with investors who value exposure to government contracts due to their perceived stability compared to commercial projects.However, the projections are based on numerous assumptions, including the integration of STADCO's operations and the ramp-up of specific government programs. Market analysts would caution that any delays or changes in government funding could materially impact these projections. It is also noteworthy that the company has chosen not to comment on the sources of equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which could be a critical factor in assessing the risk profile of the transaction. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the fact that TechPrecision has not independently verified the financial information provided by Votaw's parent, Doerfer Corporation and will not do so until post-acquisition, introduces a layer of risk. This reliance on seller-provided data without independent verification until deal closure is not uncommon in acquisitions but requires a strong due diligence process to mitigate potential misrepresentations. The company's disclaimer regarding the achievement of projections and the acknowledgment of potential changes underscores the inherent uncertainty in such forecasts and serves as a caution to stakeholders about the non-guaranteed nature of future performance. 02/22/2024 - 05:30 PM Three Year Consolidated ForecastVotaw November and December 2023 Unaudited Summary FinancialsStatus of Filing Fiscal Year 2024 Q3 10-QWESTMINSTER, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / TechPrecision Corporation (NASDAQ:TPCS) (""TechPrecision"" or ""the Company,"" ""we,"" ""us"" or ""our"") today provided additional financial information in connection with the company's pending acquisition of Votaw Precision Technologies, Inc.

In connection with the pending acquisition of Votaw, the Company has produced financial projections for potential new investors. We are providing a portion of these forecasts to our current shareholders and the general public. Below is the Company's projected, post-acquisition three-year consolidated net sales and EBITDA forecast for FY25, FY26 and FY27.Attached as a footnote, FN1, and as part of these projections are assumptions and comments that should be read in conjunction with the forecast provided.The Company does not intend to update these forecasts at any time. All those who read these projections should understand and consider that in the future, circumstances and situations may and almost certainly will change, perhaps materially for the better or worse.

The Company expects to file the report by the end of February 2024, at which time it will schedule an earnings conference call.(FN1) Assumptions/CommentsVotaw1) All the projections regarding Votaw are based upon information provided by Votaw's parent, Doerfer Corporation in connection with our acquisition of Votaw. The Company has not independently verified any of this information aside from reviewing some of the information during due diligence in connection with the acquisition and is not in a position to do so until, if and when, the acquisition is closed. We are advised that this information is based upon past and present purchase orders, backlog, customer relationships, currently funded programs, and advice from Votaw's clients as to future purchase orders, and similar items.Ranor & Stadco1) Projected revenue is based on, among other things, funded purchase orders and information publicly stated as to government programs by year where applicable (for example the build rate schedule for Virginia Class submarines), history of the scope of work done by the companies on these programs and historical pricing of same.2) We assume Ranor margins will increase year-over year due to increased volume.3) Projections are based, in part, on STADCO consolidating into the Votaw facility as scheduled, the ramp up of the Sikorsky helicopter program per information publicly stated as to that government program, the build rate for the F-15EX per information publicly stated as to that government program, history of work done by the Company on these programs, and historical pricing.Stadco Savings1) The projections are based in part on the assumption that STADCO will have consolidated into the Votaw facility within two years of acquisition.2) The projections recognized partial savings in years 1 and 2, and full savings thereafter3) Projections are also based on expected leasehold savings of approximately $1.3M from the closing of STADCO's present facility and approximately $1.7M from the consolidation of personnel and equipment into the Votaw facility.DATES1) All projections are based on the closing of the acquisition of Votaw occurring on or about March 31, 2024.FN2 EBITDA included in the select financial information for Votaw presented above is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net gain or loss is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to EBITDA. We believe EBITDA provides our board of directors, management, and investors with a helpful measure for comparing Votaw's operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.We also believe that EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and is a measure contained in our debt covenants. However, while we consider EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.We define EBITDA as net loss plus interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.FN3 EBITDA FY25 has been reduced by approximately $2.3 million primarily due to STADCO moving expenses.FN4 EBITDA FY26 has been reduced by approximately $2.1 million primarily due to STADCO moving expenses.About TechPrecision CorporationThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ranor, Inc. and STADCO, we manufacture large-scale, metal fabricated and machined precision components and equipment.

The company addresses pending litigation with Siemens Energy, asserting it as a routine commercial dispute. Fluence maintains a strong relationship with Siemens AG despite legal matters. The report inaccurately suggests AES is moving away from Fluence, whereas Fluence remains AES' preferred supplier. The company emphasizes its commitment to corporate governance, internal controls, and shareholder value creation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The response from Fluence Energy to the short-seller's report touches upon several key financial and strategic aspects of the company's operations. Firstly, the litigation with Siemens Energy, while described as a minor commercial dispute, involves sums that are material enough to warrant attention. The claim and counterclaim, totaling approximately $11 million, could impact Fluence's financials, particularly if the outcome is unfavorable. However, the company's assertion that this does not affect its relationship with Siemens AG, an investor and minority owner in Siemens Energy, suggests that the financial implications may be contained within this specific dispute.Furthermore, the company's clarification about its ongoing relationship with AES as a preferred supplier refutes the short-seller's implication of a weakening business partnership. If true, this would maintain the revenue stream from a key customer and support Fluence's sales pipeline stability. The mention of a growing customer base indicates potential for revenue diversification, which is a positive sign for resilience and long-term financial health.In terms of corporate governance, Fluence's commitment to transparency and high standards could reassure investors, especially in the context of a short-seller's allegations. It is essential, however, for the market to monitor the company's subsequent disclosures and actions to ensure that these standards are indeed being upheld. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the ongoing litigation between Fluence and Siemens Energy is significant as it highlights the risks associated with commercial disputes. The nature of the dispute, characterized by Fluence as 'ordinary course commercial,' suggests that such disagreements are not uncommon in the industry. Nonetheless, the legal process will determine the veracity of the claims and counterclaims. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for how similar disputes might be handled in the future, influencing contract negotiations and risk assessments for Fluence and its competitors.Additionally, the distinction made between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy is critical. It underscores the complexity of corporate relationships and investments in the energy sector. Investors often require clarity on these relationships to assess potential conflicts of interest or impacts on strategic partnerships. The clarification provided by Fluence aims to dispel concerns about the broader implications of the dispute on its investor relations and business strategy. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on Fluence's diversified customer base and the reaffirmation of AES as a key technology partner are strategic elements that can influence the company's market position. The energy storage sector is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, with technological advancements and shifting regulatory landscapes. Fluence's ability to maintain and grow its customer base is indicative of its competitive strength and could be a positive signal to the market regarding its adaptability and innovation.It is also important to consider the broader market implications of the short-seller's report. Such reports can create volatility in the stock market, affecting not just the targeted company but also its competitors and the industry at large. The response from Fluence is an attempt to mitigate this volatility by providing reassurance to shareholders and the market. The effectiveness of this communication in stabilizing investor sentiment will be an important factor to watch in the short-term market performance of Fluence's stock. 02/22/2024 - 05:32 PM ARLINGTON, Va., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluence Energy, Inc. (“Fluence” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: FLNC), a leading global provider of energy storage products, services, and optimization software for renewables and storage, today issued a statement in response to a report published by a known short-seller. The Company believes that the report is an attempt by a self-interested short-seller to profit at the expense of Fluence’s shareholders by manipulating Fluence’s stock price. We believe that the report contains numerous inaccuracies and distortions. The Company believes it is important to set the record straight regarding three blatant misrepresentations: The short-seller's report references pending litigation between Fluence and Siemens Energy, attempting to characterize it as a ""critical and dramatic development."" While any dispute with a customer is unfortunate, this is a small, ordinary course commercial dispute arising from a single project. Fluence brought the action to collect approximately $2 million in unpaid amounts due, and Siemens Energy responded with counterclaims of approximately $9 million. Fluence strongly denies Siemens Energy’s counterclaims and the case is progressing in the ordinary course. Siemens AG and its German retirement fund are investors in Fluence. Siemens AG has a minority ownership interest in Siemens Energy – it is not the same company and there is no legal case between Siemens AG and Fluence. We believe the litigation with Siemens Energy has no effect on our strong relationship with Siemens AG. The short-seller's report wrongly implies AES is moving away from Fluence as a supplier. In fact, Fluence continues to be AES’ preferred Battery Energy Storage Systems technology provider. Our robust pipeline of sales to other customers continues to grow. Contrary to the implications in the short-seller report, the diversification of our customer base reflects the financial strength of our business and is part of our long-term strategy. The Company reiterates its commitment to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and internal controls, as well as transparent and timely disclosure in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Fluence is confident that it has the right strategy, products, solutions, and team in place to create shareholder value. About Fluence Fluence Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: FLNC) is a global market leader in energy storage products and services, and optimization software for renewables and storage. With a presence in 47 markets globally, Fluence provides an ecosystem of offerings to drive the clean energy transition, including modular, scalable energy storage products, comprehensive service offerings, and AI-enabled SaaS products for managing and optimizing renewables and storage from any provider.

Healthy asset quality with low credit risk portfolio. Stable liquidity position with $1,999 million in liquidity. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A. (Bladex) reflect a substantial growth in profitability, with a net profit increase of 50% YoY for the fourth quarter and 81% for the full year. This significant improvement can be attributed to both an increase in total revenues and successful strategic execution. Notably, the Net Interest Income (NII) saw a growth of 58% YoY, contributing to the expansion of the Net Interest Margin (NIM) by 78 basis points YoY. Such growth in NII suggests that Bladex has effectively capitalized on higher average volumes and rates, which is indicative of a strong lending environment and possibly an optimized interest rate strategy.The Return on Equity (ROE) has also seen a notable increase, which is significant for shareholders as it indicates that the bank is generating more profit from every dollar of equity. The reported ROE of 14.7% for FY23 is well above the industry average, signaling strong operational efficiency and profitability. Additionally, the efficiency ratio improved, staying below 30%, which is a positive sign of cost control despite the increase in operating expenses related to strategic initiatives. This ratio is crucial as it measures the cost of generating revenue and a lower ratio typically signifies better performance. Market Research Analyst Bladex's performance should be seen in the context of the broader economic conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The bank's record levels of fee income, driven by loan syndication and letter of credit business, suggest robust trade activity and demand for financial services in the region. The increase in fee income by 64% YoY is particularly impressive and may reflect greater regional economic integration and trade finance activity. Furthermore, the all-time high Credit Portfolio indicates that Bladex has successfully expanded its lending activities, which is a positive indicator for regional economic growth.Moreover, the stability of Bladex's Investment Portfolio and the high quality of its asset base, with 96% classified as low risk, provide confidence in the bank's risk management practices. The bank's liquidity position, with 19% of total assets in liquid form, ensures resilience against potential market fluctuations. This strong liquidity, coupled with a diversified funding structure, positions Bladex favorably for continued operations and growth opportunities in 2024. Economist The capital adequacy ratios reported by Bladex, including a Tier 1 Basel III Capital Ratio of 15.4% and a Regulatory Capital Adequacy Ratio of 13.6%, are well above the Basel III minimum requirements. This indicates a strong capital buffer and financial stability, which is particularly important in the event of economic downturns. Such robust capitalization can support future growth and provide assurance to investors and regulators alike.The bank's focus on maintaining a healthy asset quality and diversified credit-risk exposure is also a prudent strategy in the context of potential economic uncertainties. With a mere 0.1% of the credit portfolio being impaired and a reserve coverage of 6.5 times, Bladex demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. This level of provisioning is commendable and suggests that the bank is well-prepared to absorb potential credit losses. 02/22/2024 - 06:00 PM PANAMA CITY, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A.

With Sandeep's addition, we are strengthening the Company's management capabilities to better unlock the value potential of the Casino project."" Mr. Singh commented ""I see tremendous value in Casino as one of very few viable assets in the copper-gold development space. Casino strikes a unique balance of important scale, attractive commodity mix, low jurisdictional risk, and quick payback through the higher-grade core of the deposit. The credible data, underpinning a thorough feasibility study, and remaining upside from additional resources or optimizations to the project provide tangible upside potential.

Delcath Systems Announces Healthcare Setting Locator for HEPZATO™ KIT (melphalan/Hepatic Delivery System),2024-02-22T22:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Positive,"Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH) launches Healthcare Setting Locator for HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma patients. The Locator aims to assist patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers in finding treatment sites and accessing necessary information.","Delcath Systems Announces Healthcare Setting Locator for HEPZATO™ KIT (melphalan/Hepatic Delivery System) Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH) launches Healthcare Setting Locator for HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma patients. The Locator aims to assist patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers in finding treatment sites and accessing necessary information. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The introduction of the Healthcare Setting Locator for Delcath Systems' HEPZATO KIT represents a significant advancement in patient care for those suffering from metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). This tool facilitates access to treatment by enabling patients and healthcare providers to identify appropriate healthcare settings for the administration of the HEPZATO KIT. It is crucial to note that mUM is a rare and aggressive cancer and options for targeted therapy are limited. Therefore, the availability of such a locator can be pivotal in expediting treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes.From a clinical perspective, the HEPZATO KIT, which is designed for liver-directed therapy, offers a specialized treatment for a niche patient demographic. The treatment's specificity for patients with unresectable hepatic metastases and limited extrahepatic disease underscores the importance of precision medicine in oncology. As an oncologist, the ability to direct patients to qualified treatment centers can streamline the treatment process, reduce the burden on patients and caregivers and contribute to a more efficient healthcare delivery system. Medical Research Analyst Delcath Systems' strategy to launch a dedicated Locator for their HEPZATO KIT aligns with the broader trend in the pharmaceutical industry towards improving patient access and support services. The Locator not only serves as a patient aid but also acts as a marketing tool to increase the visibility and adoption of the HEPZATO KIT among healthcare providers. By simplifying the process of finding treatment locations, Delcath is likely to see an uptick in the utilization of their product.Furthermore, the establishment of a permanent J-Code for HEPZATO (J9248) is a critical step in ensuring reimbursement and reducing financial barriers for patients. This coding is essential for billing and insurance purposes and often influences the adoption rate of new medical treatments. The combination of the Locator and the J-Code could result in increased market penetration and a positive impact on Delcath's financial performance, as it may lead to a higher volume of treatments administered. Market Research Analyst The deployment of the Healthcare Setting Locator by Delcath Systems is indicative of a company actively working to enhance its product's marketability and patient reach. In the context of the stock market, such initiatives can be viewed favorably by investors as they demonstrate the company's commitment to supporting its products post-launch. It's a strategic move that can strengthen the company's competitive position within the interventional oncology space.Analyzing the potential impact on Delcath's stock, investors will likely monitor the adoption rates post-launch of the Locator and the subsequent financial results. Increased accessibility and ease of locating treatment centers could translate into higher demand for the HEPZATO KIT. Long-term, the success of such tools can contribute to the company's reputation and brand loyalty among both patients and healthcare providers, which is an intangible asset that can have a positive influence on the company's valuation. 02/22/2024 - 05:00 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Delcath Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DCTH), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, today announced that the Company has launched a Healthcare Setting Locator (Locator) on the hepzatokit.com website. Potential patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers may use the Locator to identify healthcare settings, offering treatment with the HEPZATO KIT. Sites included on the Locator are accepting inquiries from patients or their physicians seeking potential treatment with HEPZATO KIT. These sites either have or expect to have completed all training and internal approvals necessary to treat a patient subsequent to the normal screening for eligibility. ""The Healthcare Setting Locator, which the Company will update periodically, is an important tool to assist patients, their caregivers, and their healthcare providers, as they consider appropriate treatment options,"" said Kevin Muir, Delcath's General Manager of U.S. Interventional Oncology. ""The previously announced establishment of the permanent J-Code for HEPZATO (J9248) and the launch of the Locator are two important steps in providing information and access to patients for this treatment."" ""The Healthcare Settings Locator is a great resource for metastatic uveal melanoma patients. Finding treatments is one of the hardest tasks for a mUM patient. With this Locator, patients can find and coordinate care on their own rather than relying only on the treatments their local physician provides,"" said Melody Burchett, President of A Cure In Sight, a leading advocacy group for patients with Uveal Melanoma. The HEPZATO KIT is a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. About Delcath Systems, Inc., HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT (Hepzato (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to surgically isolate the liver while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT. In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, that can cause actual results to differ materially from those described.

Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties relating to: the Company's commercialization plans and its ability to successfully commercialize the HEPZATO KIT; the Company's successful management of the HEPZATO KIT supply chain, including securing adequate supply of critical components necessary to manufacture and assemble the HEPZATO KIT; successful FDA inspections of the facilities of the Company and those of its third-party suppliers/manufacturers; the Company's successful implementation and management of the HEPZATO KIT Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy; the potential benefits of the HEPZATO KIT as a treatment for patients with primary and metastatic disease in the liver; the Company's ability to obtain reimbursement for the HEPZATO KIT; and the Company's ability to successfully enter into any necessary purchase and sale agreements with users of the HEPZATO KIT. For additional information about these factors, and others that may impact the Company, please see the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.

However, a net loss of $23.4 million was recorded due to investments in Ting Fiber network and higher expenses. Positive Consolidated net revenue increased by 10.2% to $87.0 million in Q4 2023. Gross profit rose by 4.8% to $17.8 million in Q4 2023. Net loss for Q4 2023 was $23.4 million, compared to $13.4 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 62% to $2.6 million in Q4 2023. Cash equivalents at the end of Q4 2023 were $92.7 million, down from $110.7 million in Q3 2023. Tucows continues to invest in Ting and Wavelo businesses while managing debt. Shareholders can submit questions to management until February 29, 2023, for a response on March 12, 2024. Negative Net loss increased due to investments in Ting Fiber network and higher expenses. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 62% in Q4 2023. Cash equivalents decreased to $92.7 million at the end of Q4 2023. Financial Analyst Financial Performance Assessment: Tucows Inc.'s reported financial results indicate a mixed performance with a 10% year-over-year increase in consolidated revenue, which is a positive indicator of top-line growth. However, the net loss widened significantly, from $13.4 million to $23.4 million, primarily due to higher costs associated with Ting Fiber network investments, increased network depreciation and higher interest expenses. This suggests that the company's expansion efforts are currently weighing on profitability. The substantial 62% decrease in adjusted EBITDA further underscores the financial strain from these investments.The growth in Wavelo and consistent performance in Tucows Domains are noteworthy, as they could represent stable revenue streams. However, the decrease in cash equivalents from $110.7 million to $92.7 million quarter-over-quarter raises concerns about liquidity, especially in the face of continued investments and debt management efforts. The company's strategy of deleveraging through payments on syndicated debt using cash flow from its core businesses is prudent, yet it may limit financial flexibility in the short term. Market Research Analyst Market Position and Competitive Landscape: The expansion of Tucows' Ting network footprint, despite its current impact on profitability, may position the company to capture a larger market share in the longer term. The growth of Wavelo, a platform service, is particularly promising, as it suggests that Tucows is effectively diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional domain services. The competitive landscape in internet services is rapidly evolving, with customer demand for high-speed and reliable connectivity increasing. Tucows' investment in fiber infrastructure could eventually lead to a competitive edge, provided the company can achieve economies of scale and improve its cost structure over time.It is also essential to analyze customer acquisition costs and long-term value in the context of the Ting Internet Services segment. While current expenses are high, the potential for recurring revenue from a growing customer base could justify the upfront investment. The company's ability to retain customers and upsell additional services will be critical in realizing the potential benefits of its expansion strategy. Debt Analyst Debt and Interest Expense Analysis: The increased net loss and higher interest expenses reported by Tucows are concerning from a debt management perspective. With interest rates rising, the cost of servicing debt becomes more expensive, which could further pressure the company's financials. The focus on deleveraging is a positive sign, indicating that management is cognizant of the risks associated with high leverage. However, investors should closely monitor the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios in future quarters to assess the sustainability of its capital structure.While the deleveraging efforts using cash flow from operations demonstrate a commitment to reducing financial risk, the impact of these payments on the company's liquidity profile must be considered. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents suggests that Tucows is using a significant portion of its liquid assets to manage debt, which could limit its ability to respond to unforeseen challenges or invest in new opportunities. 02/22/2024 - 05:05 PM TORONTO, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Tucows Inc. (NASDAQ: TCX) (TSX: TC), a global internet services leader, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. All figures are in U.S. dollars. ""We finished 2023 at the high end of our range for Adjusted EBITDA guidance, a result driven by robust growth from Wavelo and consistent performance of Tucows Domains,"" said Elliot Noss, Tucows President and CEO. ""Consolidated revenue grew 10% year over year, which, along with a strong finish to the year, helped drive operating cash flow up to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter, up from $2.9 million in Q4 of last year. We continue to make growth investments and direct cash flow to build the Ting and Wavelo businesses, while also managing our debt. In Q4, we further deleveraged the business with payments on the syndicated debt using cash flow from Wavelo and Tucows Domains."" Financial Results Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 10.2% to $87.0 million from $78.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth in Wavelo, Ting and Domains revenues was offset by a small decrease in revenue from Tucows Corporate. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 4.8% to $17.8 million from $17.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in gross profit was driven primarily by robust gross profit gains from Wavelo, as well as gross profit increases in line with expectations for Ting and Domains. The increase was partially offset by increased network depreciation and network expenses as the Ting network footprint expands. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.4 million, or a loss of $2.14 per share, compared with net loss of $13.4 million, or $1.25 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increased loss is primarily the result of costs from the continued investment in the Ting Fiber network and operations, network depreciation, and higher interest expenses resulting from higher interest rates and increased debt. Adjusted EBITDA1 for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 62% to $2.6 million from $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA1 was primarily related to planned investments in Ting's operating capacity and growing customer base. Cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were $92.7 million compared with $110.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $23.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

Notes: 1. Adjusted EBITDA Tucows reports all financial information required in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, to assist financial statement users in an assessment of our historical performance, the Company typically discloses and discusses a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA, in press releases and on investor conference calls and related events that exclude certain non-cash and other charges as the Company believes that the non-GAAP information enhances investors' overall understanding of our financial performance. The Company believes that the provision of this supplemental non-GAAP measure allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business using similar evaluation measures to those used by management. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to measure its performance and prepare its budgets. Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, the Company's calculation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is calculated before certain recurring cash charges, including interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a liquidity measure. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. The Company endeavors to compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA to net income based on U.S. GAAP, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results. Tucows strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company's adjusted EBITDA definition excludes depreciation, impairment and loss on disposition of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, income tax provision, interest expense (net), accretion of contingent consideration, stock-based compensation, asset impairment, gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions, loss on debt extinguishment and costs that are not indicative of on-going performance (profitability), including acquisition and transition costs. Gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions removes the unrealized effect of the change in the mark-to-market values on outstanding unhedged foreign currency contracts, as well as the unrealized effect from the translation of monetary accounts denominated in non-U.S. dollars to U.S. dollars.

Tucows Announces $40 Million Stock Buyback Program,2024-02-22T22:06:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Tucows Inc.

The program will be executed through the Nasdaq Capital Market, funded from working capital and existing credit facilities.","Tucows Announces $40 Million Stock Buyback Program Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Tucows Inc. (TCX) announces a $40 million stock buyback program to repurchase its common stock, starting February 23, 2024, and ending on or before February 22, 2025. The program will be executed through the Nasdaq Capital Market, funded from working capital and existing credit facilities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Stock buyback programs, such as the one announced by Tucows Inc., are a significant financial maneuver that can influence a company's stock price and shareholder value. By repurchasing up to $40 million of its common stock, Tucows is signaling to the market that it believes its stock is undervalued. This action can potentially increase the earnings per share (EPS) as there will be fewer shares outstanding, which can be attractive to investors seeking growth in per-share metrics.From a financial perspective, the use of working capital and existing credit facilities to fund the buyback suggests that Tucows is confident in its liquidity and financial health. However, it is crucial to monitor the company's balance sheet as buybacks can sometimes lead to increased leverage and reduced cash reserves, which could impact the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or weather economic downturns. Market Research Analyst A stock buyback program can also be a strategic tool for managing market perceptions. By retiring the purchased shares to treasury, Tucows is effectively reducing the supply of its stock in the market, which could lead to a price increase if demand remains constant. This move may be interpreted by the market as a management vote of confidence in the company's future prospects.However, it is important to contextualize this decision within the broader industry and market conditions. If Tucows' sector is experiencing bullish trends, the buyback could further propel the stock performance. Conversely, if the sector is bearish, the buyback might not yield the expected positive impact on the stock price. Additionally, the decision not to purchase shares from management or insiders can be seen as an effort to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure fairness in the trading process. 02/22/2024 - 05:06 PM TORONTO, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Tucows Inc. (NASDAQ: TCX) (TSX: TC) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a stock buyback program to repurchase, from time to time if and as appropriate, up to $40 million of its common stock in the open market. The new $40 million buyback program will commence February 23, 2024 and will terminate on or before February 22, 2025. Purchases for the new buyback program will be made exclusively through the facilities of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The previously announced $40 million buyback program, which commenced February 10, 2023, has been terminated. Any shares purchased by Tucows under the stock buyback program will be retired and returned to treasury. The timing and exact number of common shares purchased will be at Tucows' discretion and will depend on available cash and market conditions. Tucows may suspend or discontinue the repurchases at any time, including in the event Tucows would be deemed to be making an acquisition of its own shares under Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules, all purchases will occur through the open market and may be in large block purchases. Tucows does not intend to purchase its shares from its management team or other insiders. The purchase will be funded from available working capital and existing credit facilities.

"Bladex Announces $50,000,000 Common Stock Repurchase Plan",2024-02-22T23:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Bladex announces a $50 million stock repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders and support future growth.,"Bladex Announces $50,000,000 Common Stock Repurchase Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Bladex announces a $50 million stock repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders and support future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The authorization of a $50 million stock repurchase program by Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (Bladex) signals a strategic deployment of the bank's excess capital. This move is often interpreted by the market as a positive indicator of the bank's financial health and a signal that management believes the stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the repurchase program could potentially increase earnings per share (EPS) and the intrinsic value of the remaining shares, assuming steady net income levels.Investors should consider the repurchase in the context of Bladex's overall capital allocation strategy. The decision to return capital to shareholders rather than reinvesting in growth or mergers and acquisitions could suggest a lack of viable investment opportunities within the bank's horizon or a focus on maximizing shareholder value in the short term. The market's response may vary depending on the perceived opportunity cost of forgoing other investments. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Bladex's repurchase plan should be analyzed considering the current banking industry dynamics and stock market conditions. If the banking sector is experiencing bullish trends, the repurchase initiative might be viewed as a move to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Conversely, if the sector is bearish, the repurchase could be seen as a defensive strategy to support the stock price.Moreover, the repurchase plan's effectiveness will largely depend on the execution strategy and market conditions at the time of buyback. The use of mechanisms like Rule 10b5-1 trading plans can provide a systematic approach to repurchasing shares, potentially mitigating insider trading concerns and signaling a well-thought-out strategy to the market. Legal Expert Bladex's adherence to Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is crucial to ensure the repurchase program's compliance with securities laws. This rule provides a safe harbor for issuers, allowing them to repurchase their own stock in the market without being deemed to manipulate the market. The mention of a potential Rule 10b5-1 plan indicates a premeditated structure to the buyback, which mitigates legal risks associated with the timing of the repurchases that could otherwise be construed as trading on material non-public information.It is important for investors to note that the bank's board reserves the right to adjust, suspend, or discontinue the program, which introduces a level of uncertainty. The flexibility of the program's terms allows the bank to respond to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements, which could affect the anticipated benefits to shareholders. 02/22/2024 - 06:00 PM PANAMA CITY, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A.

The Bank may commence such repurchases immediately, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The Bank may enter into a pre-arranged stock trading plan in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 to effectuate the Bank's new stock repurchase program. However, the Bank has no obligation to repurchase shares and the timing, actual number, and value of shares to be repurchased is subject to management's discretion and will depend on the Bank's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements, and other market conditions.

Financial Analyst The announcement of BNY Mellon Alcentra Global Credit Income 2024 Target Term Fund's (DCF) monthly distribution maintains its previous rate of $0.035 per share, which is a critical factor for income-focused investors. The consistency in distribution suggests stability in the Fund's income-generating capabilities. However, the caveat that the Fund may not distribute all of its net income and that the distribution policy may change indicates a need for investors to monitor the Fund's performance and management decisions closely. Such distributions are a reflection of the Fund's operational results and its asset management strategy, which can impact the Fund's attractiveness to investors seeking regular income.Investors should also be aware of the trading dynamics of closed-end funds, which can trade at a premium or discount to net asset value (NAV). This can significantly affect the investment's total return, especially if an investor purchases shares at a premium or sells at a discount. The Fund's performance relative to its NAV will be an important metric to watch, as it can signal investor sentiment and the efficacy of the Fund's investment strategy. Market Research Analyst BNY Mellon Investment Management's position as one of the world's largest asset managers, with $2.0 trillion in assets under management, underscores the firm's influence in the financial markets. The scale of operations can provide significant competitive advantages in terms of market access, investment opportunities and risk management. For stakeholders, the firm's ability to leverage its size and expertise across various asset classes can be indicative of potential for sustained performance and innovation in investment products.However, the broader economic environment and market conditions can impact the performance of asset managers like BNY Mellon. Factors such as interest rate changes, regulatory developments and market volatility can affect asset valuations and investor behavior. Analysts and investors should contextualize the Fund's distributions within these external conditions to gauge the potential impact on future distributions and the Fund's overall investment strategy. 02/22/2024 - 05:03 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On February 22, 2024, BNY Mellon Alcentra Global Credit Income 2024 Target Term Fund, Inc.

"Lending Enablement Solutions Create a Path to Auto Ownership for ITIN Holders, Open Lending Analysis Shows",2024-02-22T22:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Open Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: LPRO) releases data highlighting the creditworthiness of borrowers with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) compared to Social Security Number (SSN) holders, showcasing the opportunities for financial institutions in automotive lending.","Lending Enablement Solutions Create a Path to Auto Ownership for ITIN Holders, Open Lending Analysis Shows Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Open Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: LPRO) releases data highlighting the creditworthiness of borrowers with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) compared to Social Security Number (SSN) holders, showcasing the opportunities for financial institutions in automotive lending. Positive Open Lending's data analysis reveals that ITIN holders have a higher average credit score than borrowers with SSNs, enabling them to qualify for larger loan amounts and afford more expensive vehicles. ITIN automotive loans have a return on assets at 3.81%, significantly higher than the credit union system average of 0.75%, indicating the value they bring to lenders. The analysis emphasizes the importance of ITIN lending in advancing financial inclusion, particularly in securing vehicle financing for individuals without SSNs, such as nonresident and resident aliens. Open Lending's focus on Lending Enablement Solutions demonstrates their commitment to leveraging data and technology to connect with deserving borrowers and promote auto ownership for all. The research highlights the popularity of pick-up trucks among ITIN holders, with the Chevy Silverado 1500 being the most popular model, showcasing the role of vehicle ownership in employment and upward mobility. ITIN holders are viewed as a low-risk group by financial institutions, further emphasizing the creditworthiness and value they bring to the lending market. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure by Open Lending Corporation regarding ITIN borrowers possessing higher average credit scores than those with SSNs is a noteworthy development for financial institutions. It signals a potential market segment that could be undervalued and underpenetrated. The return on assets (ROA) figure of 3.81% associated with ITIN lending, as reported by the Filene Research Institute, is particularly striking when compared to the credit union system average of 0.75%. This suggests a robust profitability metric that could attract more lenders to consider ITIN lending as part of their portfolio.From a financial analysis standpoint, this data could lead to a reevaluation of risk models, as ITIN holders may be perceived as lower-risk due to their higher credit scores. Financial institutions might adjust their lending strategies to include ITIN holders, potentially increasing their customer base and interest income. However, it's important to consider the scalability of this segment and the regulatory environment surrounding ITIN lending, as these factors could influence the long-term sustainability of these returns. Market Research Analyst Open Lending's focus on ITIN holders reveals a nuanced understanding of consumer behavior within the automotive financing sector. The preference for pick-up trucks among ITIN holders, especially the Chevy Silverado 1500, indicates a demand for vehicles that serve dual purposes—both personal and professional. This consumer insight could guide automotive manufacturers and dealerships in inventory management and marketing strategies targeted at this demographic.Moreover, the fact that ITIN automotive loans are primarily secured through credit unions underscores the importance of these institutions in promoting financial inclusion. This could incentivize credit unions to further specialize in this type of lending, differentiating themselves from larger banks and potentially attracting a loyal customer base that values community-oriented financial services. Economic Sociologist The data analysis provided by Open Lending Corporation extends beyond mere financial implications to touch upon broader socio-economic impacts. ITIN holders' pursuit of auto ownership for employment and upward mobility illustrates the critical role of financial services in facilitating economic integration for nonresidents and resident aliens. This demographic's ability to secure larger loan amounts for more expensive vehicles is indicative of a positive feedback loop where credit access leads to enhanced economic opportunities.It's essential to contextualize these findings within the broader narrative of financial inclusion and the systemic barriers that non-SSN holders face. The role of credit unions in advancing this inclusion reflects a commitment to serving underserved communities, potentially leading to a more equitable financial ecosystem. While the benefits for ITIN holders and financial institutions are clear, it's important to monitor how expanded access to credit impacts broader economic inequality and social mobility over time. 02/22/2024 - 05:30 PM Borrowers with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers have a higher average credit score than those with Social Security numbers AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Open Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: LPRO) (“Open Lending” or the “Company”), an industry trailblazer in automotive lending enablement and risk analytics solutions for financial institutions, today released data on automotive financing access for consumers with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (“ITIN”), a federal tax identification number that can be used to access financial services. Nonresident and resident aliens, regardless of immigration status, are issued ITINs for the purposes of filing taxes with the IRS. Supported by findings from the Filene Research Institute, Open Lending’s data analysis highlights how Lending Enablement Solutions break down barriers for ITIN holders while bringing value to financial institutions. ITIN lending helps make auto ownership and credit-building possible for those living in the U.S. without a Social Security number (“SSN”). According to Filene, it also delivers measurable value to lenders, with a return on assets at 3.81%, significantly higher than the credit union system average of 0.75%. Open Lending has built on this research to show that ITIN holders are a highly creditworthy group, and financial institutions can leverage new technologies to bridge the accessibility gap. Open Lending’s data analysis found: ITIN holders see vehicle financing as an opportunity for employment and upward mobility. Pick-up trucks, which can be used for personal and professional use, make up the top five most popular models among ITIN holders, with the Chevy Silverado 1500 being the most popular. ITIN holders have a higher average FICO score than borrowers with SSNs. As ITIN holders have higher average credit scores, they are qualifying for larger loan amounts, hence their ability to afford larger, more expensive vehicles. The higher average credit score also speaks to how ITIN lending financial institutions are viewing them as having a lower risk profile. ITIN automotive loans are overwhelmingly secured through credit unions, which underscores their vital role in advancing financial inclusion in their communities. “We believe everyone deserves the chance to pursue a better life through auto ownership. Lenders can play a major role in opening those doors,” said Kevin Filan, senior vice president of marketing at Open Lending. “Lending Enablement Solutions allow lenders to identify creditworthy ITIN holders who would otherwise be overlooked, and they don’t have to sacrifice a healthy bottom line to do it. When you look beyond traditional measures of creditworthiness, you unlock value and connect with deserving borrowers.” For over two decades, Open Lending has focused on developing automotive Lending Enablement Solutions that expand vehicle accessibility, proving that data and technology can and should be used to advance financial inclusion.

The company's subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, accepted $677,975,000 in principal amount for purchase. The Tender Offer expires on March 8, 2024, with early settlement on February 23, 2024, and final settlement on March 11, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Wynn Resorts' announcement regarding the early results and upsizing of the tender offer for their 5.500% Senior Notes due 2025 indicates a proactive approach to debt management. The acceptance of $677,975,000 in principal amount of notes tendered by the early tender date, against an upsized tender cap of $800,000,000, reflects a substantial interest from note holders. This suggests that the market conditions are favorable for such a transaction, which could potentially lead to a reduction in interest expenses and an improvement in the company's debt profile.From a financial standpoint, the repurchase of debt before its maturity can be a strategic move to take advantage of current interest rates, refinance the debt at lower rates, or improve the balance sheet. Investors and analysts will be monitoring the final results post the expiration time to assess the overall impact on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios. It's also important to consider the liquidity position of Wynn Resorts, as executing a tender offer requires substantial cash outflow. The fact that the notes are being purchased at a premium, including accrued and unpaid interest, indicates a strong cash position and financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst The tender offer's early results can be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, reflecting confidence from the management in the company's future cash flows and earnings potential. The upsizing of the tender cap may also indicate that Wynn Resorts is taking advantage of the market's appetite for such financial maneuvers. This could be seen as a strategic move to optimize the capital structure and potentially unlock shareholder value.Moreover, the market's response to this tender offer could influence the pricing and demand for Wynn Resorts' future debt issuances. A successful tender offer often leads to a positive reevaluation of the company's creditworthiness, which in turn can result in more favorable borrowing terms in the future. On the flip side, it is crucial to monitor the market's perception of such financial strategies as they may also signal to some investors that the company is trying to reduce debt in anticipation of less favorable market conditions ahead. Debt Capital Markets Expert The mechanics of the tender offer, including the early tender date and the final settlement date, are structured to incentivize note holders to participate before the deadline, which could influence the liquidity and secondary market pricing of the remaining notes. The fact that Wynn Resorts has opted for a tender offer as opposed to a more traditional refinancing could be due to a variety of strategic reasons, including current market rates, the company's credit spread and the specific covenants associated with the 5.500% Senior Notes.Understanding the implications of the tender offer on Wynn Resorts' cost of capital and future financial flexibility is essential. The tender offer and the subsequent reduction in outstanding debt will likely lead to a change in the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which is an important metric for valuing the firm and making investment decisions. The reduction in debt also has the potential to alter the risk profile of the company, which could affect both equity and remaining debt valuations. 02/22/2024 - 07:10 PM LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) (“Wynn Resorts”) today announced the early results and upsizing of the previously announced tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) by its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, to purchase a portion of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp.’s outstanding 5.500% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”).

Liberty Latin America Reports Q4 & FY 2023 Results,2024-02-22T21:38:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Liberty Latin America Ltd. reported strong financial and operating results for Q4 and FY 2023, with significant subscriber growth and Adjusted OIBDA increase. The company's commitment to infrastructure investments led to robust network capabilities, resulting in organic broadband and mobile subscriber additions. The completion of the Puerto Rico integration is expected to drive future growth.

The company's commitment to infrastructure investments led to robust network capabilities, resulting in organic broadband and mobile subscriber additions. The completion of the Puerto Rico integration is expected to drive future growth. LLA also shared its medium-term outlook, anticipating a mid to high single digit Adjusted OIBDA rebased CAGR and over $1 billion in Adjusted FCF before distributions to noncontrolling interests in the next three years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Liberty Latin America Ltd. (LLA) show a mixed performance with a significant increase in operating income from $87 million to $518 million year-over-year (YoY), indicating a strong operational turnaround. However, when examining the revenue figures, there's a flat growth YoY for Q4 and a 6% decline for the full year. This discrepancy suggests that the company's revenue streams may be under pressure, but cost management and efficiency improvements are driving profitability. The reported Adjusted OIBDA being flat YoY and the rebased growth of 6% indicates that the company is managing its operational costs effectively, contributing to its profitability despite revenue challenges.The repurchase of $300 million in equity and convertible notes signals confidence by management in the company's future prospects and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This could be seen as a positive sign by investors, potentially impacting the stock positively. Additionally, the integration progress in Puerto Rico and the migration of mobile subscribers are critical strategic moves that are likely to reduce operational complexity and costs in the future, potentially boosting profitability.LLA's medium-term financial guidance projecting a mid to high single-digit Adjusted OIBDA rebased CAGR and aggregate Adjusted FCF of more than $1 billion over the next three years could be a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory and financial health. This forward-looking statement would likely be of interest to investors as they assess the company's future earning potential and overall stability. Telecommunications Market Analyst The telecommunications industry is characterized by high capital expenditures (CapEx) due to the need for continuous investment in infrastructure to maintain competitiveness. LLA's CapEx as a percentage of revenue is at approximately 16%, which is within industry norms for telecom companies that are in a growth or maintenance phase. The focus on enabling 1 Gbps speeds on fixed networks and the addition of broadband subscribers align with industry trends of increasing demand for high-speed internet services.The migration of over 800,000 mobile subscribers in Puerto Rico is a significant operational milestone that indicates a strategic focus on consolidating market presence and streamlining services post-acquisition. The completion of this integration is likely to enhance the company's competitive position in the region and improve its ability to attract and retain customers.The monetization of tower assets, resulting in $244 million of proceeds, reflects a strategic decision to unlock capital for reinvestment or debt reduction. This is a common practice in the telecom industry, where companies often sell physical assets to specialized operators to free up capital and focus on service delivery. The anticipated completion of the Bahamas portion of the transaction could provide additional liquidity and further strengthen the balance sheet. Economist LLA's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment of Latin America, which has been facing currency volatility and economic uncertainty. The appreciation of the Costa Rican colon has had a positive impact on LLA's reported revenue and Adjusted OIBDA in Liberty Costa Rica, showcasing the influence of foreign exchange movements on multinational companies' financials. Investors must consider currency risks when evaluating LLA's performance, as future adverse movements could negate some of the current gains.The company's focus on disciplined capital allocation and robust stakeholder value growth is in line with prudent financial management practices, especially important in regions with economic instability. The reduction in group net leverage is a strategic priority that can improve the company's risk profile and potentially lead to lower borrowing costs in the future, benefiting long-term profitability.Overall, LLA's financial results and operational highlights suggest a company that is navigating a challenging revenue environment through cost control, strategic investments and efficiency gains. The company's medium-term outlook, if achieved, could position it well for sustainable growth in a competitive and fast-evolving telecommunications industry. 02/22/2024 - 04:38 PM 186,000 organic broadband and postpaid mobile subscriber net adds in 2023 Operating income of $518 million; Adj.

CEO Balan Nair commented, “We ended the year well, generating healthy subscriber and Adjusted OIBDA growth and delivering Adjusted FCF before distributions to noncontrolling interests of $273 million, 43% higher than the prior year.” “Our commitment to investing in leading infrastructure has created robust, high-speed networks across our fixed, mobile and subsea platforms. At the end of 2023, over 80% of our fixed networks had been upgraded to enable speeds in excess of 1 Gbps and this investment helped us add 81,000 broadband subscribers during the year. Our postpaid mobile base also grew strongly as we added 105,000 subscribers, primarily in Liberty Costa Rica and C&W Caribbean.” “In addition to our significant organic opportunities, completing the migration of mobile customers in Puerto Rico and the USVI is expected to be a key driver of LLA's future growth. We are on-track to achieve this goal by the end of April, enabling us to conclude our TSA with AT&T by the end of June, which will create significant cost savings and also allow us to drive our mobile business more effectively, removing restrictions that currently impact our commercial flexibility.” “As we approach the completion of key migration activities we feel it is the right moment to share our medium-term outlook for LLA. We anticipate delivering a mid to high single digit Adjusted OIBDA rebased CAGR and aggregate Adjusted FCF before distributions to noncontrolling interests of more than $1 billion over the next three years.

Reported revenue for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2023 was flat and declined by 6%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. Reported revenue in Q4 was flat as (1) net organic growth driven by Liberty Costa Rica and C&W Panama and (2) net foreign exchange benefits of $21 million, were offset by organic declines in Liberty Puerto Rico and Liberty Networks. Reported revenue declined in FY 2023 as (1) net foreign exchange benefits of $84 million, (2) the addition of $70 million from the acquisition of América Móvil's Panama operations (Claro Panamá) on July 1, 2022 and (3) net organic growth driven by C&W Panama and Liberty Costa Rica, were more than offset by the negative year-over-year impact of $451 million related to VTR's deconsolidation and organic decline in Liberty Puerto Rico. Q4 2023 Revenue Growth – Segment Highlights C&W Caribbean: revenue was flat on both a reported and rebased basis, year-over-year. Fixed residential revenue increased by 2% and 3%, respectively on a reported and rebased basis. Rebased revenue growth was driven by higher broadband ARPU and subscribers, primarily in Jamaica where we added 23,000 RGUs over the last twelve months. This was partly offset by lower ARPU from video and telephony services due to fixed-mobile convergence incentives. Mobile residential revenue increased by 5% on a reported and rebased basis. The increase followed our focus on fixed-mobile convergence propositions which drove 70,000 postpaid mobile additions in the year. We have also continued to see an increase in inbound roaming revenue as tourism has recovered in the region. B2B revenue was 6% lower on both a reported and rebased basis. The discontinuation of a non-core transit services agreement at the beginning of 2023 at C&W Jamaica had a $10 million negative impact on revenue as compared to the prior year quarter. This translates to an approximately 300 basis point and 700 basis point impact on C&W Caribbean's total revenue and B2B revenue rebased growth rates, respectively, and more than offset underlying B2B growth in the period. C&W Panama: revenue grew by 2% on a reported and rebased basis. Fixed residential revenue was up 6% as we added 62,000 RGUs over the past twelve months, following investments in our networks, products and commercial activities. Mobile residential revenue decreased by 5%, driven by lower prepaid volume including the impacts of disruptions from the mining protests, partially offset by higher prepaid ARPU. B2B revenue grew by 8% driven by increased revenue from government-related projects and data and managed services. Liberty Networks: revenue declined by 8% and 9% on a reported and rebased basis, respectively. The year-over-year decline was driven by (i) lower wholesale network revenue associated with a significant customer that is recognized on a cash basis and (ii) a reduction in non-cash IRU revenue due to lower amortization year-over-year. This was partly offset by higher enterprise revenue due to an increase in new contracts and continued growth in B2B connectivity and managed services. Liberty Puerto Rico: revenue was 5% lower on a reported and rebased basis. Residential fixed revenue growth of 5% was driven by 23,000 net broadband subscriber additions over the past twelve months and higher ARPU following rate increases. Residential mobile revenue was 11% lower compared to the prior-year period. This was driven by: (1) reduced equipment sales due in part to migration activities, (2) a decline in the average number of prepaid mobile subscribers as compared to the prior year period, and (3) lower roaming revenue. Other revenue declined by $3 million as compared to the prior-year quarter due to a reduction in revenue recognized on funds received from the FCC. Liberty Costa Rica: revenue grew by 28% on a reported basis and 10% on a rebased basis. Reported performance benefited from an $18 million positive foreign exchange impact year-over-year, as the Costa Rican colon appreciated against the U.S. dollar. The strong year-over-year rebased performance was driven by higher B2B service revenue and higher mobile revenue due to postpaid subscriber growth and equipment sales. Operating Income Operating income was $113 million and $107 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $518 million and $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase for the three-month comparison is primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, (ii) higher Adjusted OIBDA and (iii) higher depreciation and amortization. The increase for the twelve-month comparison is primarily due to the net impact of (i) lower impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, mostly due to goodwill impairments recorded during the second quarter of 2022 and (ii) higher depreciation and amortization. Adjusted OIBDA Highlights The following table presents (i) Adjusted OIBDA of each of our reportable segments and our corporate category for the periods indicated and (ii) the percentage change from period-to-period on both a reported and rebased basis: Three months ended Year ended December 31, Increase (decrease) December 31, Increase (decrease) 2023 2022 % Rebased % 2023 2022 % Rebased % in millions, except % amounts C&W Caribbean $ 160.0 $ 138.1 16 16 $ 596.9 $ 535.2 12 12 C&W Panama 66.7 57.2 17 17 227.7 188.8 21 25 Liberty Networks 61.5 79.7 (23 ) (22 ) 261.5 276.3 (5 ) (4 ) Liberty Puerto Rico 103.9 117.6 (12 ) (12 ) 485.5 530.8 (9 ) (9 ) Liberty Costa Rica 57.9 36.1 60 36 203.1 134.7 51 23 VTR — — N.M.

Reported Adjusted OIBDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 7% and was flat, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. Reported Adjusted OIBDA was higher in Q4, driven by (1) organic growth in C&W Caribbean, Liberty Costa Rica, and C&W Panama, and (2) the appreciation of the Costa Rican colon, which were partly offset by organic declines in Liberty Networks and Liberty Puerto Rico. Reported Adjusted OIBDA was flat YTD as (1) organic growth in C&W Caribbean, C&W Panama, and Liberty Costa Rica, and (2) the appreciation of the Costa Rican colon, were offset by the deconsolidation of VTR and organic decline in Liberty Puerto Rico. Q4 2023 Adjusted OIBDA Growth – Segment Highlights C&W Caribbean: Adjusted OIBDA increased by 16% on a reported and rebased basis, respectively. Performance was driven by lower direct costs, including declines in handset and programming expenses, and lower bad debt expense. Our Adjusted OIBDA margin improved by over 600 basis points year-over-year to 44%. C&W Panama: Adjusted OIBDA increased by 17% on a reported and rebased basis. The performance was driven by revenue growth, lower bad debt expense and value capture activities related to the Claro Panamá acquisition, partly offset by higher direct costs related to government-related projects. Liberty Networks: Adjusted OIBDA decreased by 23% and 22% on a reported and rebased basis, respectively. Our rebased performance was driven by the aforementioned revenue decline in the quarter. Liberty Puerto Rico: Adjusted OIBDA declined by 12% on a reported and rebased basis. The performance was driven by the net impact of our aforementioned revenue decline, lower direct costs, primarily due to lower gross sales, and higher other operating costs mainly related to migration and integration activities, year-over-year. Liberty Costa Rica: Adjusted OIBDA grew by 60% and 36% on a reported and rebased basis, respectively. Rebased performance was driven by the aforementioned revenue growth, favorable foreign exchange movements on non-CRC denominated costs and execution of our integration plan. Corporate: Adjusted OIBDA improved by 31% on a reported and rebased basis, respectively, driven by lower bonus costs.

Glossary Adjusted OIBDA Margin – Calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue for the applicable period. ARPU – Average revenue per unit refers to the average monthly subscription revenue (subscription revenue excludes interconnect, mobile handset sales and late fees) per average customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. ARPU per average customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential fixed and SOHO fixed services by the average of the opening and closing balances for customer relationships for the indicated period. ARPU per average mobile subscriber is calculated by dividing the average monthly mobile service revenue by the average of the opening and closing balances for mobile subscribers for the indicated period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per average RGU is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from the applicable residential fixed service by the average of the opening and closing balances of the applicable RGUs for the indicated period. Unless otherwise noted, ARPU in this release is considered to be ARPU per average customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. Consolidated Debt and Finance Lease Obligations to Operating Income Ratio – Defined as total principal amount of debt outstanding (including liabilities related to vendor financing, the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations) to annualized operating income from the most recent two consecutive fiscal quarters. Consolidated Net Debt and Finance Lease Obligations to Operating Income Ratio – Defined as total principal amount of debt outstanding (including liabilities related to vendor financing, the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations) less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash related to debt to annualized operating income from the most recent two consecutive fiscal quarters. CRU – Corporate responsible user. Customer Relationships – The number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (“EBU”) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our customer relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes below. Customer relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two customer relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from customer relationships. Fully-swapped Borrowing Cost – Represents the weighted average interest rate on our debt (excluding finance leases and including vendor financing obligations, debt related to the Tower Transactions and other debt), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts, which includes a discount on the convertible notes issued by Liberty Latin America associated with a conversion option feature, and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. Homes Passed – Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant. Certain of our homes passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. Internet (Broadband) RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our network. Leverage – Our gross and net leverage ratios, each a non-GAAP measure, are defined as total debt (total principal amount of debt outstanding, including liabilities related to vendor financing, the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations, net of projected derivative principal-related cash payments (receipts)) and net debt to annualized Adjusted OIBDA of the latest two quarters. Net debt is defined as total debt (including the convertible notes and liabilities related to vendor financing and finance lease obligations) less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash related to debt. For purposes of these calculations, debt is measured using swapped foreign currency rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements. Mobile Subscribers – Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. Our Liberty Puerto Rico segment prepaid subscriber count includes mobile reseller subscribers, which represent organizations that purchase minutes and data at wholesale prices and subsequently resell it under the purchaser's brand name. These reseller subscribers result in a significantly lower ARPU than the remaining subscribers included in our prepaid balance. Additionally, our Liberty Puerto Rico segment postpaid subscriber count includes CRUs, which represent an individual receiving mobile services through an organization that has entered into a contract for mobile services with us and where the organization is responsible for the payment of the CRU’s mobile services. NPS – Net promoter score. Property and Equipment Addition Categories Customer Premises Equipment: Includes capitalizable equipment and labor, materials and other costs directly associated with the installation of such CPE; New Build & Upgrade: Includes capitalizable costs of network equipment, materials, labor and other costs directly associated with entering a new service area and upgrading our existing network; Capacity: Includes capitalizable costs for network capacity required for growth and services expansions from both existing and new customers. This category covers Core and Access parts of the network and includes, for example, fiber node splits, upstream/downstream spectrum upgrades and optical equipment additions in our international backbone connections; Baseline: Includes capitalizable costs of equipment, materials, labor and other costs directly associated with maintaining and supporting the business. Relates to areas such as network improvement, property and facilities, technical sites, information technology systems and fleet; and Product & Enablers: Discretionary capitalizable costs that include investments (i) required to support, maintain, launch or innovate in new customer products, and (ii) in infrastructure, which drive operational efficiency over the long term. Proportionate Net Leverage Ratio (C&W) – Calculated in accordance with C&W's Credit Agreement, taking into account the ratio of outstanding indebtedness (subject to certain exclusions) less cash and cash equivalents to EBITDA (subject to certain adjustments) for the last two quarters annualized, with both indebtedness and EBITDA reduced proportionately to remove any noncontrolling interests' share of the C&W group. Revenue Generating Unit (RGU) – RGU is separately a video RGU, internet RGU or telephony RGU. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in Puerto Rico subscribed to our video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. RGUs are generally counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled video, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as RGUs during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. SOHO – Small office/home office customers. Telephony RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our network. Telephony RGUs exclude mobile subscribers. Tower Transactions – Transactions entered into during 2023 associated with certain of our mobile towers across various markets that (i) have terms of 15 or 20 years and did not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a sale and leaseback and (ii) also include ""build to suit"" sites that we are obligated to construct over the next 5 years. U.S. GAAP – Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Video RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our network, primarily via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Video RGUs that are not counted on an EBU basis are generally counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one RGU. Additional General Notes Most of our operations provide telephony, broadband internet, mobile data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B service revenue is derived from SOHO customers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHO customers, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs and SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our B2B SOHO customers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes. Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels, and hospitals, in Puerto Rico. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates. While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber and homes passed statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber and homes passed counting process. We periodically review our subscriber and homes passed counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber and homes passed statistics based on those reviews. Non-GAAP Reconciliations We include certain financial measures in this press release that are considered non-GAAP measures, including (i) Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin, each on a consolidated basis, (ii) Adjusted Free Cash Flow, (iii) rebased revenue and rebased Adjusted OIBDA growth rates, and (iv) consolidated leverage ratios. The following sections set forth reconciliations of the nearest GAAP measure to our non-GAAP measures, as well as information on how and why management of the Company believes such information is useful to an investor. Adjusted OIBDA On a consolidated basis, Adjusted OIBDA, a non-GAAP measure, is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted OIBDA is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to determine how to allocate resources to segments. As we use the term, Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income or loss before share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted OIBDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (i) readily view operating trends, (ii) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (iii) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our Adjusted OIBDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted OIBDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income. A reconciliation of our operating income or loss to total Adjusted OIBDA is presented in the following table: Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 in millions Operating income $ 113.0 $ 106.9 $ 517.7 $ 86.5 Share-based compensation expense 10.9 10.9 88.7 93.5 Depreciation and amortization 302.7 249.0 1,008.3 910.7 Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net 5.3 35.8 86.9 619.2 Adjusted OIBDA $ 431.9 $ 402.6 $ 1,701.6 $ 1,709.9 Operating income margin1 9.7 % 9.2 % 11.5 % 1.8 % Adjusted OIBDA margin2 37.1 % 34.7 % 37.7 % 35.6 % Calculated by dividing operating income by total revenue for the applicable period. Calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue for the applicable period. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Definition and Reconciliation We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF), a non-GAAP measure, as net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, (ii) expenses financed by an intermediary, (iii) proceeds received in connection with handset receivables securitization, (iv) insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment and (v) certain net interest payments or receipts incurred or received, including associated derivative instrument payments and receipts, in advance of a significant acquisition, less (a) capital expenditures, net, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries, (c) principal payments on finance leases, and (d) distributions to noncontrolling interest owners. We believe that our presentation of Adjusted FCF provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted FCF should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view Adjusted FCF as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table provides the reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted FCF for the indicated period: Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 in millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 390.5 $ 377.0 $ 897.0 $ 868.8 Cash payments for direct acquisition and disposition costs 0.9 8.1 5.9 26.5 Expenses financed by an intermediary1 44.6 33.4 176.9 149.1 Capital expenditures, net (162.1 ) (166.0 ) (585.0 ) (660.1 ) Principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (74.1 ) (42.6 ) (239.0 ) (196.7 ) Pre-acquisition interest payments, net2 — — — 3.9 Principal payments on finance leases (0.3 ) (0.2 ) (1.0 ) (1.1 ) Proceeds from handset receivables securitization 18.4 — 18.4 — Adjusted FCF before distributions to noncontrolling interest owners 217.9 209.7 273.2 190.4 Distributions to noncontrolling interest owners (34.2 ) — (75.4 ) (1.9 ) Adjusted FCF $ 183.7 $ 209.7 $ 197.8 $ 188.5 For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses, including value-added taxes, financed by an intermediary are treated as operating cash outflows and financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our Adjusted FCF definition, we add back the operating cash outflows when these financed expenses are incurred and deduct the financing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary. The amounts for the 2022 periods relate to the portion of interest paid that relates to the pre-acquisition debt for the Claro Panama Acquisition. Rebase Information Rebase growth rates are a non-GAAP measure. For purposes of calculating rebased growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned during the current year, we have adjusted our historical revenue and Adjusted OIBDA to include or exclude the pre-acquisition amounts of acquired, disposed or transferred businesses, as applicable, to the same extent they are included or excluded from the current year. The businesses that were acquired, disposed or transferred impacting the comparative periods are as follows: Claro Panamá, which was acquired on July 1, 2022; VTR, which was deconsolidated as of October 6, 2022; and the January 2023 acquisition by our Liberty Costa Rica segment of the B2B Costa Rican operations within our Liberty Networks segment. In addition, we reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the prior-year periods at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the corresponding current-year periods. We have reflected the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA of acquired entities in our prior-year rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial statements), as adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally accepted accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (d) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired entities during the pre-acquisition periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present their revenue and Adjusted OIBDA on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post-acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors. In addition, the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA that will occur in the future. The rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis and should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP reported growth rates. The following tables provide the aforementioned adjustments made to the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA amounts for the periods indicated, to derive our rebased growth rates. Due to rounding, certain rebased growth rate percentages may not recalculate. In the tables set forth below: reported percentage changes are calculated as current period measure, as applicable, less prior-period measure divided by prior-period measure; and rebased percentage changes are calculated as current period measure, as applicable, less rebased prior-period measure divided by rebased prior-period measure. The following tables set forth the reconciliation from reported revenue to rebased revenue and related change calculations.

The following tables set forth the reconciliations from reported revenue by product for our C&W Caribbean segment to rebased revenue by product and related change calculations. Three months ended December 31, 2022 Residential fixed revenue Residential mobile revenue Total residential revenue B2B revenue Total revenue In millions Revenue by product – Reported $ 128.2 $ 101.4 $ 229.6 $ 137.7 $ 367.3 Rebase adjustment: Foreign currency (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.7 ) Revenue by product – Rebased $ 128.0 $ 101.1 $ 229.1 $ 137.5 $ 366.6 Reported percentage change 2 % 5 % 3 % (6 )% — % Rebased percentage change 3 % 5 % 4 % (6 )% — % Non-GAAP Reconciliation for Consolidated Leverage Ratios We have set forth below our consolidated leverage and net leverage ratios. Our consolidated leverage and net leverage ratios (Consolidated Leverage Ratios), each a non-GAAP measure, are defined as (i) the principal amount of debt and finance lease obligations less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash related to debt divided by (ii) last two quarters of annualized Adjusted OIBDA as of December 31, 2023. We generally use Adjusted OIBDA for the last two quarters annualized when calculating our Consolidated Leverage Ratios to maintain as much consistency as possible with the calculations established by our debt covenants included in the credit facilities or bond indentures for our respective borrowing groups, which are predominantly determined on a last two quarters annualized basis. For purposes of these calculations, adjusted total debt and finance lease obligations is measured using swapped foreign currency rates. We believe our consolidated leverage and net leverage ratios are useful because they allow our investors to consider the aggregate leverage on the business inclusive of any leverage at the Liberty Latin America level, not just at each of our operations. Investors should view consolidated leverage and net leverage as supplements to, and not substitutes for, the ratios calculated based upon measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of the numerator and denominator used to calculate the consolidated leverage and net leverage ratios as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 are set forth below: December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 in millions, except leverage ratios Total debt and finance lease obligations $ 8,179.9 $ 7,914.7 Discounts, premiums and deferred financing costs, net 67.8 73.1 Adjusted total debt and finance lease obligations 8,247.7 7,987.8 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 988.6 571.6 Restricted cash related to debt1 8.0 8.0 Net debt and finance lease obligations $ 7,251.1 $ 7,408.2 Operating income2: Operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 N/A $ 135.4 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 $ 162.7 162.7 Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 113.0 N/A Operating income – last two quarters $ 275.7 $ 298.1 Annualized operating income – last two quarters annualized $ 551.4 $ 596.2 Adjusted OIBDA3: Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended June 30, 2023 N/A $ 441.2 Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 $ 428.4 428.4 Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended December 31, 2023 431.9 N/A Adjusted OIBDA – last two quarters $ 860.3 $ 869.6 Annualized Adjusted OIBDA – last two quarters annualized $ 1,720.6 $ 1,739.2 Consolidated debt and finance lease obligations to operating income ratio 15.0 x 13.4 x Consolidated net debt and finance lease obligations to operating income ratio 13.2 x 12.4 x Consolidated leverage ratio 4.8 x 4.6 x Consolidated net leverage ratio 4.2 x 4.3 x N/A – Not Applicable. Amount relates to restricted cash at Liberty Puerto Rico that serves as collateral against certain lines of credit associated with the funding received from the FCC to continue to expand and improve our fixed network in Puerto Rico. Operating income or loss is the closest U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted OIBDA, as discussed in Adjusted OIBDA above. Accordingly, we have presented consolidated debt and finance lease obligations to operating income and consolidated net debt and finance lease obligations to operating income as the most directly comparable financial ratios to our non-GAAP consolidated leverage and consolidated net leverage ratios. Adjusted OIBDA is a non-GAAP measure. See Adjusted OIBDA above for reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure for the three months ended December 31, 2023. A reconciliation of our operating income to Adjusted OIBDA for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 is presented in the following table: Three months ended September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 in millions Operating income $ 162.7 $ 135.4 Share-based compensation expense 24.1 24.5 Depreciation and amortization 230.5 240.5 Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net 11.1 40.8 Adjusted OIBDA $ 428.4 $ 441.2 Non-GAAP Reconciliations for Our Borrowing Groups The financial statements of each of our borrowing groups are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We include certain financial measures for our C&W, Liberty Puerto Rico and Liberty Costa Rica borrowing groups in this press release that are considered non-GAAP measures, including: (i) Adjusted OIBDA; (ii) Adjusted OIBDA Margin; (iii) Proportionate Adjusted OIBDA, (iv) rebased revenue and (v) rebased Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income or loss before share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, related-party fees and allocations, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Proportionate Adjusted OIBDA is defined as Adjusted OIBDA less the noncontrolling interests' share of Adjusted OIBDA. We believe these measures at the borrowing group level are useful to investors because they are one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. These measures should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income.

The company aims to balance growth and shareholder returns, reflecting confidence in its strategy and financial strength. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Meritage Homes Corporation regarding the increase in quarterly dividend from $0.27 to $0.75 per share represents a substantial elevation in shareholder returns. This action signals a strong confidence in the company's financial health and future performance. The dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price, will see a notable rise, which may attract income-focused investors. The implementation of a formal share repurchase plan further underscores the company's commitment to capital return strategies. Share buybacks can be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially leading to a positive market reaction and an increase in stock valuation. However, it is important to monitor how these buybacks are financed, as excessive debt usage to fund such activities could pose risks. Corporate Governance Expert The consolidation of the Nominating/Governance and Environmental, Social and Sustainability board committees into a single entity reflects a growing trend in corporate governance towards integrating sustainability with core business strategies. This move could enhance the efficiency of the board's oversight on these critical areas, promoting a more holistic approach to governance. Deb Henretta's appointment as the chair of the new committee may bring a fresh perspective and potentially drive stronger governance practices. Investors often view such structural changes positively, as they can lead to better alignment of the company's long-term objectives with environmental and social goals, which is increasingly important to stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Meritage Homes' strategic financial decisions come at a time when the homebuilding industry is facing various macroeconomic challenges, such as interest rate fluctuations and changing consumer demand. The confidence reflected in the company's actions may differentiate it from competitors, suggesting a robust business model and operational efficiency. The aggressive share repurchase and dividend increase could be a signal to the market of underlying value not yet reflected in the stock price. However, it is crucial to analyze the broader market conditions and sector performance to gauge the potential impact of these moves on the company's stock performance in both the short and long term. 02/22/2024 - 04:50 PM Nominating / Governance and Environmental, Social and Sustainability Board Committees Consolidated into Single CommitteeSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meritage Homes Corporation (NYSE: MTH, “Meritage” or the “Company”), the fifth-largest homebuilder in the U.S., today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share, which increased from the $0.27 per share quarterly dividend in 2023.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by BayCom Corp represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. The dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price per share, is a critical metric for income-focused investors. This announcement may positively influence investor sentiment and could potentially lead to an uptick in the stock's demand, thus possibly affecting its price.It's essential to consider the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends. A sustainable payout ratio, typically below 60% for healthy companies, suggests that the firm is not compromising its growth or operational funds. Stakeholders should compare this ratio to industry peers to gauge BayCom's financial health and dividend policy's sustainability. Market Research Analyst This dividend announcement could be indicative of BayCom Corp's financial stability and confidence in its cash flow management. In the banking sector, consistent dividend payments are often seen as a sign of a company's maturity and reliability. Investors may interpret regular dividends as a signal of strong governance and a stable customer base, which is particularly important for regional banks like United Business Bank that rely on local market penetration and customer loyalty.However, investors should also assess the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and regulatory changes, which can impact the banking industry's profitability. These factors can influence the company's ability to maintain or increase dividend payments in the future. Economist Dividend distributions can have broader economic implications, particularly for the local economies where the shareholders reside. Cash dividends increase the disposable income of shareholders, which can lead to increased consumer spending and stimulate economic activity. For a community-focused bank like United Business Bank, this can have a positive feedback loop, potentially leading to more business opportunities and loan demand within its operational regions.Moreover, the timing and consistency of dividend payments can reflect the company's economic outlook. A steady dividend may suggest that BayCom Corp's management expects continued operational profitability despite potential economic headwinds, such as fluctuating interest rates or economic slowdowns. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM WALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BayCom Corp (NASDAQ: BCML) (“BayCom” or the “Company”), the parent company of United Business Bank, today announced that its Board of Directors (“the Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock.

It provides insights into how much money is being returned to shareholders versus being reinvested into the company for growth. In this case, the $0.06 per share dividend indicates a commitment to delivering shareholder value.Investors often view regular dividends as a sign of a company's stability and maturity, as well as a reliable source of income. However, it's important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. A yield that is too high may be unsustainable, while one that is too low might not be attractive to income-focused investors. Comparing ESAB's dividend yield to industry peers and sector averages can provide a benchmark for its attractiveness in the market. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market's reaction to dividend announcements is essential for gauging the potential impact on ESAB's stock price. Historically, markets have tended to react positively to dividend announcements, seeing them as a sign of corporate health and shareholder alignment. However, the size and frequency of dividend payments can also indicate how the company is positioned in its life cycle and its future growth prospects.For instance, a company that increases its dividends might be perceived as having limited growth opportunities and thus returning more cash to shareholders. Conversely, a company that maintains or decreases its dividend might be signaling reinvestment into expansion or innovation. It's crucial to analyze ESAB's dividend in the context of its capital allocation strategy and the broader industrial compounding sector's trends to assess the long-term implications for its market position and stock performance. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM NORTH BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ESAB Corporation (“ESAB” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ESAB), a focused premier industrial compounder, announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company’s common stock.

Healthcare Industry Analyst The recent announcement by HCA Healthcare regarding the transition of CAR T-cell therapy patients to outpatient settings represents a significant operational advancement within the healthcare sector. The integration of an outpatient management process not only optimizes the utilization of hospital resources, by saving over 1,200 hospital bed days for the initial cohort of patients, but also reflects a broader trend in healthcare towards patient-centric and cost-effective care delivery models.The adoption of remote patient monitoring platforms, such as the one provided by Best Buy Health, illustrates the growing intersection of healthcare and technology. This initiative could serve as a benchmark for other healthcare providers in terms of operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. The ability to avoid hospitalization for approximately 20% of patients not only enhances the patient experience but also reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections and other complications associated with inpatient stays.The expansion of this model to additional sites is likely to have a positive impact on HCA Healthcare's operational efficiency and may contribute to an improved financial performance due to the reduced need for inpatient care resources. Furthermore, the standardization of care across multiple cell therapy programs is indicative of a systematic approach to treatment that could lead to better patient outcomes and more predictable cost structures for providers. Medical Research Analyst Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, commonly known as CAR T-cell therapy, is at the forefront of personalized cancer treatments. The ability to reprogram a patient's own immune cells to target and destroy cancer cells is a remarkable medical innovation. However, the complexity of administering such therapies has traditionally necessitated prolonged hospital stays for close monitoring due to the potential for severe complications.The transition to outpatient monitoring managed by HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute is indicative of advancements in both the understanding of CAR T-cell therapy and the ability to manage its associated risks. The use of wearable devices for continuous vital sign monitoring and symptom tracking represents a leap forward in patient care. This approach not only reduces the psychological and financial burden on patients but also enables healthcare providers to collect a wealth of data that can be used to further refine treatment protocols and improve outcomes.As the SCTCTN is one of the nation's largest providers of CAR T-cell therapies, the implications of this shift to outpatient care are substantial. It could signify a paradigm shift in the management of complex therapies, potentially setting new standards for care that other institutions may follow. The research abstracts presented at the Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Tandem Meetings will likely contribute valuable insights to the medical community and could influence future clinical practice. Market Research Analyst HCA Healthcare's initiative to transition CAR T-cell therapy patients to outpatient settings has the potential to be a disruptive factor in the healthcare market. By reducing the need for inpatient services, HCA is not only improving the efficiency of its own operations but also setting a precedent that could lead to competitive pressures on other healthcare providers to adopt similar models. The healthcare market is increasingly driven by innovations that improve patient outcomes while reducing costs and HCA's program aligns with these market demands.The collaboration with Best Buy Health and the use of their Current Health remote patient monitoring platform is a strategic move that could open up new revenue streams for technology companies in the healthcare space. As the demand for such technologies grows, we might see an increase in partnerships between healthcare providers and tech companies, potentially leading to a more integrated healthcare ecosystem.From a market perspective, HCA's expansion plans for this care model could positively influence investor sentiment, as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and efficiency. The ability to provide high-quality care with reduced resource utilization could enhance HCA's competitive position in the market and might lead to improved financial metrics, such as cost savings and increased patient throughput, which are key factors considered by investors when evaluating healthcare stocks. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced that the Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute (SCCI) of HCA Healthcare has successfully established an integrated management process that safely transitioned more than 75% of HCA Healthcare’s CAR T-cell therapy patients into an outpatient setting for monitoring. The program model resulted in more than 1,200 hospital bed days saved for the first 100 patients of the program compared to historical results, and approximately 20% of patients avoided hospitalization altogether. Piloted at four Sarah Cannon Transplant and Cellular Therapy Network (SCTCTN) sites and using new technology for at-home patient monitoring, trained outpatient clinical teams, including nurses, clinical pharmacists, advanced practice professionals, social workers and case managers, have created a model to help reduce the time patients spend in the hospital after treatment during the typical two-week monitoring period. “Patients heal better outside the hospital if they can get these complicated therapies, which carry risk for significant complications, safely in the outpatient setting,” said Dr. Navneet Majhail, physician-in-chief of blood cancers, Sarah Cannon Transplant & Cellular Therapy Network. “We have leveraged technology and developed clinical pathways to care for patients receiving CAR T-cell therapies. Our clinical teams have accomplished this by standardizing care across a network of several cell therapy programs. In addition to patient benefits, their work has helped us better anticipate and meet the increasing demand for cell therapies as we continue to innovate our care delivery models to enhance timely access for these important treatments.” Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, also known as CAR T-cell therapy, is an immunotherapy designed to program a patient’s immune system to recognize and fight cancer. During the CAR T-cell treatment process, T-cells are drawn from a patient’s blood and genetically modified to recognize the patient’s cancer cells when reinfused. Because these oncology patients require intensive, specialized and time-sensitive care, they are closely monitored for any complications and have historically required inpatient hospitalization for up to two weeks post infusion. In February 2023, SCTCTN, through a collaboration with Best Buy Health, launched the initiative to safely transition a substantial portion of CAR T-cell therapy monitoring into patients’ homes. Best Buy Health’s remote patient monitoring platform, Current Health, tailored for CAR T-cell therapy patients, collects continuous vital sign data and monitors symptoms through integrated wearable devices. A dedicated team triages, manages and escalates patients' needs to SCTCTN teams locally, including registered nurses, using the Current Health platform to provide 24/7 monitoring. Colleagues from SCCI will be presenting three research abstracts on their experience with this initiative during this year’s Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Tandem Meetings of ASTCT and CIBMTR, February 21-24, in San Antonio, Texas. HCA Healthcare plans to expand this model of care to additional SCTCTN sites over the next year seeking to further improve patient and caregiver experiences nationwide. HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s largest health system research site networks with more than 43 million patient encounters annually. The SCTCTN is one of the nation’s largest providers of CAR T-cell therapies with more than 300 patients treated in 2023. Patients are treated across multiple cell therapy programs using standardized eligibility criteria, clinical pathways, and guidelines for supportive care and toxicity management. About HCA Healthcare Nashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 186 hospitals and approximately 2,400 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA Healthcare created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA Healthcare has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44%. HCA Healthcare is a learning health system that uses its more than 43 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.

ZK International Receives Nasdaq Notices Regarding Listing Deficiency,2024-02-22T21:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,ZK International Group (ZKIN) received Nasdaq notices regarding minimum bid requirements and not timely filing of annual report. The company has 180 days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of $1.00 per share. Failure to comply may lead to delisting.,"ZK International Receives Nasdaq Notices Regarding Listing Deficiency Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ZK International Group (ZKIN) received Nasdaq notices regarding minimum bid requirements and not timely filing of annual report. The company has 180 days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of $1.00 per share. Failure to comply may lead to delisting. Positive None. Negative ZK International Group faces the risk of delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market if it fails to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement of $1.00 per share within the specified compliance period. The company also needs to submit a plan to regain compliance for not timely filing its Form 20-F, with a deadline of April 22, 2024. There is uncertainty surrounding ZK International Group's ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, potentially impacting its stock performance. Financial Analyst The receipt of Nasdaq notices concerning minimum bid price requirements and the delay in filing the annual report on Form 20-F by ZK International is a significant regulatory concern that directly affects investor sentiment and the company's ability to maintain its listing status. In the short term, such notices can lead to increased volatility in the company's stock price as investors may perceive these issues as signs of potential financial instability or operational challenges.From a financial perspective, the company's failure to maintain the minimum bid price could be indicative of underlying financial distress or a lack of investor confidence. It is essential to note that a prolonged period of non-compliance could result in delisting, which would severely restrict the company's access to capital markets and potentially lead to a decrease in liquidity for existing shareholders. The requirement to maintain a minimum bid price is a common regulatory measure intended to ensure a basic level of market stability and investor protection.Furthermore, the delay in the filing of the annual report may raise concerns about the company's financial transparency and governance practices. Timely financial reporting is a key component of maintaining market confidence and providing stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed decisions. The potential long-term implications for ZK International include reputational damage and increased scrutiny from both regulators and investors. Market Research Analyst When a company like ZK International receives notices regarding non-compliance with stock market regulations, it often signals to the market that there may be deeper operational or strategic issues at play. The market's response to such news can vary, but typically, there is a negative impact on the company's market value as uncertainty takes hold among investors. Market participants will be closely monitoring the company's actions to address these compliance issues, as well as any strategic initiatives to improve its stock performance and resolve the delayed filing of its annual report.The steel industry, where ZK International operates, is highly competitive and capital intensive, which means that access to capital markets is crucial for funding operations, expansion and innovation. If the company were to be delisted, it could face significant challenges in raising funds, which would have a direct impact on its competitive position in the market. The company's ability to quickly and effectively address these compliance issues will be critical in maintaining investor confidence and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the business. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the notices received by ZK International from Nasdaq are a clear indication that the company is currently not in adherence with the market's regulatory framework. The legal implications of such non-compliance can be severe. It is crucial for the company to swiftly enact remedial measures to address the deficiencies cited by Nasdaq. The initial and any potential subsequent compliance periods offer a window for the company to rectify these issues, but if unsuccessful, it could face delisting.Delisting is a legal process that would not only affect the company's stock market presence but also its contractual obligations, investor relations and overall market reputation. The company's intention to monitor its closing bid price and consider available options is a step towards compliance, but it must also prepare for the possibility of an appeal to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, which is a legal recourse available to the company in the event of an unsatisfactory resolution. The legal team's role in navigating these regulatory waters is critical to minimize the potential negative consequences of these notices on the company's operations and stakeholder interests. 02/22/2024 - 04:30 PM WENZHOU, China, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ZK International Group Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: ZKIN) (""ZKIN,"" ""ZK International"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of advanced steel products, announced that it received the Nasdaq notices regarding minimum bid requirements and not timely filing of annual report on Form 20-F On February 15, 2024, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company that, based on the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares, no par value (the ""Ordinary Shares""), for the last 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer complies with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the ""Minimum Bid Price Requirement""), and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive trading days. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Ordinary Shares must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to August 13, 2024, and the Company must otherwise satisfy The Nasdaq Capital Market's requirements for listing. If the Company does not regain compliance by August 13, 2024, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would be required, among other things, to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares, which the Company does not currently meet, as well as all other standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company's Ordinary Shares will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal Nasdaq's determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of the Ordinary Shares and consider its available options to resolve the noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's continued listing requirements or that Nasdaq will grant the Company a further extension of time to regain compliance, if applicable. On February 20, 2024, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, since the Company has not yet filed its Form 20-F for the year ended September 30, 2023 (the ""Filing""), it no longer complies with Nasdaq Listing Rules for continued listing under Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Under Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has 60 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance and if Nasdaq accepts the Company's plan, Nasdaq can grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Filing's due date, or until August 13, 2024, to regain compliance. The Company shall submit its plan to Nasdaq no later than April 22, 2024. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company's plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing. The notices have no immediate effect on the listing of the Ordinary Shares at this time and the Ordinary Shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""ZKIN."".

The board approved regular cash dividends for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, for both common stock and Series Q Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Prologis, Inc.'s dividend increase is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and confidence in its future cash flows. A 10% hike in the annualized dividend rate is a strong signal to investors that the company is not only generating sufficient cash to support its operations and growth initiatives but also sees enough surplus to return a greater share to its shareholders.From a financial perspective, this move could potentially enhance the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors, which might lead to an uptick in demand for Prologis shares. However, it is also important to scrutinize the payout ratio to ensure that the new dividend rate is sustainable without compromising the firm's reinvestment capabilities or balance sheet strength. Market Research Analyst Within the context of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry, Prologis' decision to increase dividends may reflect broader industry trends. For instance, if other REITs are similarly raising dividends, it could suggest an overall sector upswing or a response to investor demand for higher yields amidst a potentially low-interest-rate environment.It's also essential to consider the competitive positioning of Prologis in the industrial real estate market. Their ability to raise dividends might be underpinned by strong leasing activity, high occupancy rates and the strategic management of their property portfolio. An in-depth market analysis could reveal whether Prologis is outperforming its peers or merely keeping pace with market expectations. Economist The dividend raise by Prologis can be viewed in light of the broader economic environment. Dividend policy decisions are often influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation and economic growth expectations. A 10% increase in dividends might indicate that Prologis is operating in an expansionary economic phase where industrial demand, driven by e-commerce and global trade, supports their business model.However, it's crucial to balance this view by considering the risk of economic downturns. In such scenarios, companies with high dividend commitments might face challenges in maintaining their payouts. Hence, the long-term sustainability of this increased dividend will depend on Prologis' ability to navigate economic cycles and maintain robust financial performance. 02/22/2024 - 05:30 PM SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Prologis, Inc.

The company operates through subsidiaries Afton Chemical Corporation, Ethyl Corporation, and American Pacific Corporation, focusing on chemical additives and specialty chemicals for petroleum, aerospace, and defense industries. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in NewMarket Corporation's quarterly dividend by approximately 11% is a positive signal to investors, indicative of the company's financial health and confidence in its future cash flows. A dividend hike often reflects a company's strong profitability and a well-capitalized balance sheet. It can also be seen as a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, a consistent and increasing dividend payout can enhance the attractiveness of the stock in a portfolio, particularly for income-focused investors.Investors may also interpret this move as NewMarket's management having a positive outlook on the sustainability of its earnings, especially given the specialized nature of its subsidiaries in chemical additives and specialty chemicals. However, it is crucial to consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to assess whether the increased dividend is sustainable in the long term without compromising future growth or financial stability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NewMarket's dividend increase places the company in a favorable position relative to its peers in the specialty chemicals industry. Dividend yield and growth are key factors for comparison among competitors and a substantial increase such as this could make NewMarket a more attractive option for dividend growth investors. This move might also reflect the company's strategic positioning to capitalize on the robust demand for chemical additives and specialty chemicals, sectors which are critical for various industries including petroleum, aerospace and defense.It is important to analyze industry trends, such as raw material costs and regulatory changes, which could impact the company's margins and ability to maintain dividend growth. Additionally, the performance of the company's subsidiaries, particularly in niche markets like solid rocket motors, could significantly influence NewMarket's overall financial performance and, by extension, its dividend policy. Economist From an economic standpoint, the decision by NewMarket Corporation to increase its dividend may be reflective of broader economic conditions. In periods of economic expansion, companies often experience increased demand for their products, leading to higher revenues and profits, enabling them to share the gains with shareholders through dividends. Conversely, during economic downturns, companies may cut back on dividends to preserve cash.It's also worth noting that dividends are taxed at the individual shareholder level, so the after-tax benefit of receiving dividends can vary depending on the investor's tax situation. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy can affect investor preference for dividend-paying stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, such stocks can become more appealing as they offer better income potential compared to fixed-income securities like bonds. 02/22/2024 - 05:01 PM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of NewMarket Corporation (NYSE: NEU) declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.50 per share on the common stock of the Corporation, an increase of $0.25, or approximately 11%, as compared to the last quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share.

Rapid out-diffusion of boron from the SOI layer into BOX (buried oxide) layer has been observed for regular RF-SOI substrates. It will be shown that the OI (oxygen insertion)-Si layer and the subsequent undoped Si layer epitaxially grown on a thin SOI starting substrate effectively retain boron in the SOI layer to enable formation of a SSR (super-steep retrograde) channel profile in a regular CMOS flow. The new SSROI substrate reduces body resistance for power handling improvement of RF switch devices, in addition to reducing the surface channel doping and thus impurity scattering for cutoff frequency improvement of LNA (low noise amplifier) devices. The benefits of SSROI substrate will be demonstrated via >20% improvement in Rdson at the same DC-breakdown from experimental data as well as extension of SOI thickness and gate length scaling from 3D-TCAD simulation data for RF switch devices and via >50% gm (trans-conductance) improvement from TCAD simulation data for LNA devices. Atomera’s RF-optimized Mears Silicon Technology (MST) is epitaxially deposited onto ultra-thin RF-SOI wafers, providing improvements in critical RF switch characteristics for 5G Advanced and 6G applications.

(OTC-Pink: BURCA), the parent company of multiple subsidiaries that are leading domestic manufacturers of boilers, furnaces and related HVAC products and accessories for residential, commercial, and industrial applications, today reported its consolidated financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes will be included in our Annual Report, expected to be available in mid- to late March 2024. Prior periods presented have been restated for a voluntary change in accounting principle related to our last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation. For 2022, the impact increased net income by $0.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.08. Burnham Holdings, Inc.'s consolidated financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2023 included the following: Net sales were $253.0 million for 2023, an increase of $12.4 million, or 5.2%, versus 2022. The net sales figure for 2023 represents the highest net sales number in BHI history, eclipsing the previous mark of $251.7 million set in 2004.Gross profit margin was 23.6% for 2023 compared to 19.2% for 2022 primarily due to continued realization of pricing actions to offset inflation. Operating efficiency also contributed to improved margins as cost of goods sold decreased by $1.2 million versus 2022 despite higher the 5.2% growth in net sales.Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $43.1 million in 2023 compared to $36.2 million in 2022, an increase of $6.7 million, or 19.0%. Prior year spend was lower than historical norms as we slowly returned to pre-Covid staffing, travel, and administrative spending levels. Although higher on a percentage of sales basis, SG&A spend was in line with expectations.The Company recognized a $2.3 million impairment of its investment in EnviroPower.Net income for 2023 was $9.4 million compared to $5.4 million in 2022 and is the highest net income since 2004.Diluted earnings per share were $2.02 for 2023 versus $1.18 in 2022.For 2023, sales of residential products were higher by 5.0% versus the same period in 2022, while sales of commercial products increased by 1.4% in 2023 versus 2022. Our new Service and Rentals businesses contributed $2.6 million of net sales in 2023. Overall, we are pleased with 2023's results as order velocity remains strong and our current backlogs are back in line with seasonal operating cycles. As previously noted, pricing actions taken during 2022 and 2023 contributed to the margin expansion realized in 2023. Further positive impacts on the results were provided by tighter inventory controls, which resulted in lower inventory across the organization, as well as a focus on overhead expenses and spending. Reduced volatility in raw material costs also had a significant impact on 2023 results. We will continue to closely monitor these areas as leading indicators for additional pricing actions during 2024. Average debt levels were higher throughout 2023 due to increased working capital needs and inflationary pressures impacting inventory valuations. In addition, interest rate hikes throughout 2023 increased borrowing costs. As a result of both factors, interest expense for 2023 was higher than 2022. However, year-end total debt was $6.3 million lower than the prior year. We continue to evaluate our working capital needs, including inventory levels, to ensure we can appropriately meet production volumes and fund future growth initiatives. We also previously announced that we have new lending facilities in place that provide us with up to $92.0 million in capacity. On January 30, 2024, a $10.0 million equipment financing line was entered into with our syndicated bank group that adds additional capacity and flexibility to our financing arrangements. At its meeting on February 22, 2024, Burnham Holdings, Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.23 per share, an increase of 4.5%. The dividend is payable on March 28, 2024 for shareholders of record as of March 21, 2024.

The company met its production and cost guidance, achieved significant free cash flow, and announced a dividend of C$0.07 per share. Centerra's strategic plan focuses on maximizing asset value, returning capital to shareholders, and exploring growth opportunities. Positive Centerra Gold Inc. delivered a strong finish to 2023 with 350,317 ounces of gold and 61.9 million pounds of copper production. The company ended the year with robust cash and cash equivalents exceeding $600 million. Fourth quarter of 2023 marked the second consecutive quarter of significant free cash flow for Centerra. In 2024, Centerra expects to produce between 370,000 and 410,000 ounces of gold, with copper production between 55 and 65 million pounds. The company's strategic plan aims to maximize asset value and drive future growth by returning capital to shareholders, investing in internal projects, and exploring external opportunities. Centerra renewed its NCIB program, repurchasing and cancelling 361,500 common shares in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company received a milestone payment of $25 million related to the Greenstone Gold Mines Partnership in the fourth quarter of 2023. Centerra announced a life of mine extension to 2035 for the Mount Milligan mine and established favorable parameters for potential future mine life extensions. The company's 2024 outlook includes increased gold and copper production, cost guidance, and capital expenditures for key projects. Negative None. Financial Analyst Centerra Gold Inc.'s financial performance in Q4 and the full year of 2023 demonstrates substantial operational success, marked by robust gold and copper production numbers that align with the company's revised guidance. The reported net loss juxtaposed with adjusted net earnings suggests a nuanced financial position influenced by non-recurring expenses such as reclamation provision revaluation and impairment losses. The company's free cash flow generation is a critical metric for investors, highlighting the company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital expenditures. The significant free cash flow in Q4, driven by operations at Öksüt, indicates strong operational efficiency and potential for shareholder returns, as evidenced by the declared dividend and share buyback activities. Looking ahead, the 2024 production guidance suggests an optimistic outlook with an expected increase in gold production, which could enhance revenue streams if gold prices remain favorable. However, the expected decrease in copper production warrants attention, as it could offset some of the revenue gains from gold. The capital expenditure guidance for 2024, while substantial, is indicative of strategic investments that could lead to long-term operational sustainability and growth. Market Research Analyst The mining sector is sensitive to commodity prices and operational efficiency. Centerra's average realized prices for gold and copper in 2023, which include impacts from streaming agreements and market conditions, are vital for understanding the company's revenue potential. The increase in average realized gold price and the stable copper price performance are positive indicators for revenue, despite the volatility in commodity markets.The company's liquidity position, with over $1 billion in total liquidity, positions it well to navigate market uncertainties and invest in strategic initiatives. The extension of the corporate credit facility until 2027 enhances financial flexibility.Centerra's strategic focus on returning capital to shareholders, alongside investing in internal projects and exploration, reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation that could appeal to investors seeking both growth and income. The mine life extension at Mount Milligan is a significant development that could contribute to sustained production levels and investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Legal Expert The financial results include references to several Non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net earnings and all-in sustaining costs, which are commonly used in the mining industry to provide a more comprehensive understanding of financial performance. However, these measures lack standardization, making it imperative for investors to consider GAAP measures as well to obtain a complete financial picture.The reclamation provision revaluation expense and impairment loss are significant adjustments that have impacted net earnings. These adjustments are indicative of the company's long-term obligations and asset valuations, which are essential considerations for stakeholders concerned with environmental and asset management practices.The announcement of the renewal of the Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) program and the subsequent share buybacks reflect the company's confidence in its intrinsic value and commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The NCIB program's renewal is also a sign of prudent capital management, as it allows the company to repurchase shares when it believes they are undervalued. 02/22/2024 - 05:10 PM All figures are in United States dollars. All production figures reflect payable metal quantities and are on a 100% basis, unless otherwise stated.

(together, “Royal Gold”) which entitles Royal Gold to purchase 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper produced, respectively, and requires Royal Gold to pay $435 per ounce of gold and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered (“Mount Milligan Streaming Agreement”) in the presented periods. Using an assumed market gold price of $1,850 per ounce and a blended copper price of $3.50 per pound for 2024, Mount Milligan Mine’s average realized gold and copper price for 2024 would be $1,355 per ounce and $2.94 per pound, respectively, compared to average realized prices of $1,431 per ounce and $3.01 per pound in 2023, when factoring in the Mount Milligan Streaming Agreement and concentrate refining and treatment costs. The blended copper price of $3.50 per pound factors in copper hedges in place as of December 31, 2023.In 2024, gold and copper production at the Mount Milligan Mine is projected with recoveries estimated at 64% and 78%, respectively. This compares to the 2023 recoveries of 64.0% for gold and 77.6% for copper for in 2023. Gold production at the Öksüt Mine assumes recoveries of approximately 76%.Unit costs include a credit for forecasted copper sales treated as by-product for all-in sustaining costsNG and all-in costsNG. Production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and metal deductions levied by smelters.Units noted as ($/oz) relate to gold ounces and ($/lb) relate to copper pounds.

In addition, approximately $0.8 million of capitalized project evaluation costs at the Goldfield project are also included in 2024 non-sustaining capital expendituresNG compared to $3.7 million of such costs in 2023.Outlook range for the Thompson Creek Mine relates to the first half of 2024 only.Relates to reclamation costs included in the reclamation provision as at December 31, 2023. Mount Milligan Mount Milligan produced 40,503 ounces of gold and 19.7 million pounds of copper in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the full year 2023, Mount Milligan produced 154,391 ounces of gold and 61.9 million pounds of copper, achieving production guidance for the year of 150,000 to 160,000 ounces of gold and 60 to 70 million pounds of copper. During the fourth quarter of 2023, mining activities were carried out in phases 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the open pit. A total of 12.4 million tonnes were mined in the fourth quarter of 2023. Process plant throughput for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 5.8 million tonnes and averaged 60,927 tonnes per day. In the full year 2023, Mount Milligan achieved the highest mill throughput since the start of operations in August 2013. Mount Milligan’s 2024 gold production guidance is 180,000 to 200,000 ounces, which, at the midpoint, is 23% higher than last year’s production. This is mainly due to mine sequencing and higher gold grades. 2024 copper production is expected to be 55 to 65 million pounds. Both gold and copper production are expected to be evenly weighted throughout the year, however, gold and copper sales in the second half of 2024 are expected to contribute approximately 55% of the annual sales. Gold production costs in the fourth quarter 2023 were $946 per ounce. Full year 2023 gold production costs were $1,088 per ounce, in line with the previously disclosed guidance range of $1,050 to $1,100 per ounce. Fourth quarter 2023 AISC on a by-product basisNG was $946 per ounce, and full year 2023 AISC on a by-product basisNG was $1,156 per ounce, beating the previously disclosed guidance range of $1,175 to $1,225 per ounce. At Mount Milligan, full year 2024 gold production costs are expected to be $950 to $1,050 per ounce. Full year 2024 AISC on a by-product basisNG guidance at Mount Milligan is expected to be $1,075 to $1,175 per ounce. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Centerra embarked on a site-wide optimization program at Mount Milligan, focused on a holistic assessment of occupational health and safety, as well as improvements in mine and plant operations. This program is focused on all aspects of the operation to maximize the potential of the orebody, setting up Mount Milligan for long-term success to 2035 and beyond. Some examples of initiatives include: Occupational health and safety: improvements through a complete engagement of the operating team, with a focus on improving employee retention and reduced turnover.Mine: improvements of the load/haul cycle, productivity, enhanced mine maintenance practices and refinement of the geometallurgical model; working towards seamless integration of mine and plant operations.Plant: continuous improvement in the overall operability of the plant, flotation circuit, consumables, materials handling systems, and blending consistency of feed to the plant. The Company expects these actions to enhance plant throughput and recovery. The Company is encouraged by the preliminary cash flow improvement estimates from the first phases of work on the program. Estimates of the potential cost savings from the asset optimization review are still being developed and are not included in Mount Milligan’s 2024 cost guidance ranges. On February 14, 2024, Centerra announced that the Company and its subsidiaries have entered into an additional agreement with Royal Gold relating to Mount Milligan, which has resulted in a life of mine extension to 2035 and established favourable parameters for potential future mine life extensions. Centerra will be initiating a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) to include significant drilling completed to the west of the pit not currently included in the existing resource, plus inclusion of existing resources, most of which are classified in the measured and indicated categories. The PEA will also evaluate several capital projects to support further expansion of Mount Milligan’s life, including options for a new tailings storage facility and potential process plant upgrades. The Company will also be starting the associated work on permitting and engagement with its First Nations partners and local stakeholders. The PEA is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. Öksüt Öksüt produced 88,756 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2023, and 195,926 ounces in the full year 2023, which is just above the midpoint of the guidance range of 190,000 to 210,000 ounces. During the quarter, mining activities were focused on phase 5 and phase 6 of the Keltepe pit and in phase 2 of the Güneytepe pit. In the fourth quarter 2023, a total of 3.5 million tonnes were mined and 1.2 million tonnes were stacked at an average grade of 1.95 g/t. Full year 2024 production guidance at Öksüt is 190,000 to 210,000 ounces of gold, which is unchanged from the previously disclosed life of mine plan published on September 18, 2023. Gold production is expected to be elevated in the first half of 2024, as the elevated leach pad inventories and stockpiles are processed through the adsorption, desorption, and recovery (“ADR”) plant. The Company estimates approximately 60% of the annual production is weighted to the first half of the year. Gold production costs and AISC on a by-product basisNG for the fourth quarter 2023 at Öksüt were $474 per ounce and $671 per ounce, respectively. Gold production costs and AISC on a by-product basisNG for the full year 2023 were $457 per ounce and $675 per ounce, respectively, in line with the previously disclosed guidance ranges of $425 to $475 per ounce and $625 to $675 per ounce, respectively. These low costs per ounce were primarily related to processing the gold-in-carbon and heap leach inventory that was accumulated at Öksüt in 2022 and first half of 2023 and had relatively low weighted average costs per ounce. Öksüt’s full year 2024 gold production costs guidance is expected to be $650 to $750 per ounce. Full year 2024 AISC on a by-product basisNG guidance at Öksüt is expected to be $900 to $1,000 per ounce. Costs in 2024 are expected to be higher than last year due to increased mining and hauling costs, and higher weighted average cost per ounce in the remaining inventory. The Turkish corporate income tax rate applicable to Öksüt is 25%. In 2024, Öksüt’s current income tax paid is expected to be between $85 to $95 million, which includes withholding tax related to repatriation of earnings. As a result of the expected timing of tax and annual royalty payments, free cash flow at Öksüt in the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be impacted by tax and royalty payments. Molybdenum Business Unit In the fourth quarter 2023, the Molybdenum Business Unit sold 2.2 million pounds of molybdenum, generating revenue of $47.4 million with an average realized price of $20.35 per pound. In the full year 2023, the Molybdenum Business Unit sold 11.2 million pounds of molybdenum, generating revenue of $306.7 million with an average realized price of $25.39 per pound. During the fourth quarter 2023, Thompson Creek Mine commenced some early works in the main open pit area that are expected to continue through 2024. The cost of these activities are expected to be expensed until mid-2024, following the completion of a feasibility study. In the first quarter of 2023, the Langeloth Facility required a $67 million investment in working capital to finance its business due to a rapid increase in molybdenum prices. Approximately $57 million of the investment in working capital has been released over the remainder of 2023.

Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures This document contains “specified financial measures” within the meaning of NI 52-112, specifically the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios and supplementary financial measures described below. Management believes that the use of these measures assists analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company in understanding the costs associated with producing gold and copper, understanding the economics of gold and copper mining, assessing operating performance, the Company’s ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and on an overall Company basis, and for planning and forecasting of future periods. However, the measures have limitations as analytical tools as they may be influenced by the point in the life cycle of a specific mine and the level of additional exploration or other expenditures a company has to make to fully develop its properties. The specified financial measures used in this document do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers, even as compared to other issuers who may be applying the World Gold Council (“WGC”) guidelines. Accordingly, these specified financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company’s recognized measures presented in accordance with IFRS. Definitions The following is a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios and supplementary financial measures used in this document: All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis divided by ounces of gold sold. All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as the aggregate of production costs as recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) earnings, refining and transport costs, the cash component of capitalized stripping and sustaining capital expenditures, lease payments related to sustaining assets, corporate general and administrative expenses, accretion expenses, asset retirement depletion expenses, copper and silver revenue and the associated impact of hedges of by-product sales revenue. When calculating all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis, all revenue received from the sale of copper from the Mount Milligan Mine, as reduced by the effect of the copper stream, is treated as a reduction of costs incurred. A reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis to the nearest IFRS measure is set out below. Management uses these measures to monitor the cost management effectiveness of each of its operating mines.All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis per ounce of gold or per pound of copper, is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as all-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis divided by ounces of gold or pounds of copper sold, as applicable. All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis is a non-GAAP financial measure based on an allocation of production costs between copper and gold based on the conversion of copper production to equivalent ounces of gold. The Company uses a conversion ratio for calculating gold equivalent ounces for its copper sales calculated by multiplying the copper pounds sold by estimated average realized copper price and dividing the resulting figure by estimated average realized gold price. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, 423 pounds of copper were equivalent to one ounce of gold. A reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis to the nearest IFRS measure is set out below. Management uses these measures to monitor the cost management effectiveness of each of its operating mines.Sustaining capital expenditures and Non-sustaining capital expenditures are non-GAAP financial measures. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as those expenditures required to sustain current operations and exclude all expenditures incurred at new operations or major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation. Non-sustaining capital expenditures are primarily costs incurred at ‘new operations’ and costs related to ‘major projects at existing operations’ where these projects will materially benefit the operation. A material benefit to an existing operation is considered to be at least a 10% increase in annual or life of mine production, net present value, or reserves compared to the remaining life of mine of the operation. A reconciliation of sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures to the nearest IFRS measures is set out below. Management uses the distinction of the sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditures as an input into the calculation of all-in sustaining costs per ounce and all-in costs per ounce.All-in costs on a by-product basis per ounce is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as all-in costs on a by-product basis divided by ounces sold. All-in costs on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP financial measure which includes all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis, exploration and study costs, non-sustaining capital expenditures, care and maintenance and other costs. A reconciliation of all-in costs on a by-product basis to the nearest IFRS measures is set out below. Management uses these measures to monitor the cost management effectiveness of each of its operating mines.Adjusted net earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting net (loss) earnings as recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) earnings for items not associated with ongoing operations. The Company believes that this generally accepted industry measure allows the evaluation of the results of income-generating capabilities and is useful in making comparisons between periods. This measure adjusts for the impact of items not associated with ongoing operations. A reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) earnings to the nearest IFRS measures is set out below. Management uses this measure to monitor and plan for the operating performance of the Company in conjunction with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS.Free cash flow (deficit) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less property, plant and equipment additions. A reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest IFRS measures is set out below. Management uses this measure to monitor the amount of cash available to reinvest in the Company and allocate for shareholder returns.Free cash flow (deficit) from mine operations is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash provided by mine operations less property, plant and equipment additions. A reconciliation of free cash flow from mine operations to the nearest IFRS measures is set out below. Management uses this measure to monitor the degree of self-funding of each of its operating mines and facilities. Certain unit costs, including all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis (including and excluding revenue-based taxes) per ounce, are non-GAAP ratios which include as a component certain non-GAAP financial measures including all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis which can be reconciled as follows: Three months ended December 31, ConsolidatedMount MilliganÖksüt(Unaudited - $millions, unless otherwise specified)2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022Production costs attributable to gold77.5 39.0 31.4 39.0 46.1 —Production costs attributable to copper30.7 30.8 30.7 30.8 — —Total production costs excluding Molybdenum BU segment, as reported108.2 69.8 62.1 69.8 46.1 —Adjust for: Third party smelting, refining and transport costs3.1 3.5 2.7 3.5 0.4 —By-product and co-product credits(52.0)(54.3)(51.9)(54.3)(0.1)—Adjusted production costs59.3 19.0 12.9 19.0 46.4 —Corporate general administrative and other costs11.6 12.1 0.1 0.4 — —Reclamation and remediation - accretion (operating sites)2.6 1.7 0.6 0.5 2.0 1.2Sustaining capital expenditures33.1 14.5 16.3 9.9 16.5 4.6Sustaining leases1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 0.2 0.2All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis108.2 48.8 31.3 31.1 65.2 6.0Exploration and evaluation costs10.8 23.0 2.3 2.0 0.8 1.4Non-sustaining capital expenditures(1)1.9 0.1 — 0.1 — —Care and maintenance and other costs5.8 5.8 — — — 1.3All-in costs on a by-product basis126.8 77.7 33.6 33.2 66.0 8.7Ounces sold (000s)130.3 49.4 33.1 49.4 97.2 —Pounds sold (millions)16.6 15.4 16.6 15.4 — —Gold production costs ($/oz)595 790 946 790 474 n/aAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis ($/oz)831 987 946 629 671 n/aAll-in costs on a by-product basis ($/oz)973 1,572 1,016 672 679 n/aGold - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/oz)905 1,308 1,237 950 671 n/aCopper production costs ($/pound)1.85 2.00 1.86 2.00 n/a n/aCopper - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/pound)2.42 2.40 2.42 2.40 n/a n/a (1) Non-sustaining capital expenditures are distinct projects designed to have a significant increase in the net present value of the mine.

Shareholders voted in favor of resolutions including reaffirming directors, conducting an investigation, enhancing corporate governance, and removing a former chairperson. Positive None. Negative None. Corporate Governance Expert The resolutions passed at YS Biopharma's EGM indicate a significant shift in the company's corporate governance structure. The reaffirmation of the board members and the direction to investigate the alleged misconduct of the former chairperson suggest a proactive approach to transparency and accountability. Strengthening corporate governance can improve investor confidence and potentially lead to better risk management and strategic decision-making. However, such transitions can also be disruptive in the short-term, potentially impacting the company's operations and strategic initiatives. Legal Expert The authorization of an independent investigation into the alleged misconduct of the former chairperson is a critical legal matter. It demonstrates due diligence in addressing potential legal and ethical issues that could have severe implications, including regulatory scrutiny and legal liability. This move may also be indicative of a more aggressive stance by the company against malpractice, which could deter future misconduct. However, the legal process might be lengthy and costly and any findings could have reputational consequences for the company. Financial Analyst The decision to remove the former chairperson and to enhance internal controls is likely to be closely monitored by analysts and investors. These changes could signal a strategic pivot or a response to past shortcomings in management practices. Financially, the cost of the investigation and any subsequent legal actions must be weighed against the potential long-term benefits of improved governance. Moreover, the market typically responds to such news with a degree of volatility as investors reassess the company's future prospects. 02/22/2024 - 05:00 PM GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- YS Biopharma Co., Ltd.

The company aims for long-term efficient, safe, and growing production across its operations. Positive Gold production expected to increase by 9% in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by upgrades at Kisladag and Olympias. Total cash costs and AISC to remain stable in 2024 compared to 2023, with costs ranging from $840 to $940 per ounce sold and $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold, respectively. Exploration expenditures of $27 to $30 million planned for 2024, focusing on resource conversion drilling and growth programs in Canada, Turkiye, and Greece. Production guidance for 2024 includes Lamaque Complex, Kisladag, Efemcukuru, Olympias, and the Skouries Project, with detailed cost breakdowns and capital expenditures. Skouries Project spending in 2024 to focus on advancing construction, with an expected increase in total capital needed to complete construction to $920 million. Exploration activities in 2024 to include approximately 196,000 meters of drilling across Canada, Turkiye, and Greece, targeting resource conversion, expansion, and early-stage projects. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Eldorado Gold Corporation's production and cost guidance for 2024, as well as its four-year production outlook, could have significant implications for investors and the company's financial performance. The projected 9% increase in gold production, assuming the mid-point of the range, suggests a positive trajectory in operational output. This could potentially lead to increased revenues, assuming gold prices remain stable or rise. However, the substantial growth capital allocated towards the Skouries project indicates a strategic investment in long-term production capabilities, which may affect short-term profitability due to the upfront costs involved.Investors should note the stability in the forecasted total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) compared to the previous year. These metrics are crucial for understanding the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Eldorado's mining operations. A stable AISC, in particular, is indicative of the company's ability to maintain its cost structure even as it scales up production. The detailed breakdown of costs and production across different sites provides transparency and aids in assessing the risks and potential of each mining operation. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Eldorado's guidance highlights the importance of understanding non-IFRS financial measures such as total cash costs and AISC. These measures are crucial for evaluating the profitability of mining companies, as they provide insights into the operational efficiency and the comprehensive costs associated with gold production. The provided ranges for these costs will help investors model potential future earnings and assess the company's cost management strategies.The expected capital expenditures, both sustaining and growth, offer a glimpse into the company's investment in maintaining current operations and expanding future production capabilities. The increase in estimated capital to complete the Skouries project construction by 9% is a significant development that stakeholders should monitor closely, as it may impact future financial results and return on investment timelines. Mining Sector Analyst Within the mining sector, Eldorado Gold Corporation's emphasis on advancing the Skouries project and the expected production ramp-up in 2025 and 2026 is of particular interest. The Skouries project's progress is a critical factor that could substantially contribute to the company's mid to long-term growth. The detailed exploration outlook for 2024, focusing on regions such as Canada, Turkiye and Greece, highlights the company's commitment to resource expansion and conversion drilling. This proactive approach to exploration is essential for sustaining production levels and ensuring the longevity of mining operations.Additionally, the expected increase in production at the Olympias mine due to productivity initiatives is an example of how operational improvements can positively impact output and costs. This kind of operational efficiency is a key driver in the mining industry, which can lead to improved margins and competitive advantage. 02/22/2024 - 05:01 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eldorado Gold Corporation (“Eldorado” or the “Company”) provides detailed 2024 production and cost guidance and four-year production outlook. All financial figures stated within this release are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. 2024 Guidance Highlights Gold production of 505,000 to 555,000 ounces, representing a 9% increase from 2023 gold production (assuming the mid-point of the range).Total cash costs(1) of $840 to $940 per ounce sold.All-in sustaining costs(1) (“AISC”) of $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold.Growth capital(1) of $497 to $569 million, including $375 to $425 million towards the advancement of the Skouries project.Sustaining capital(1) of $135 to $160 million.Exploration expenditures of $27 to $30 million, focused on resource conversion drilling at the Lamaque Complex and Efemcukuru, resource growth and discovery programs in Quebec, Turkiye and Greece. (1) These financial measures are non-IFRS financial measures.

At Olympias, we made tremendous progress, positioning it to deliver increased metal production and lower costs as we push development in the Flats zone. At Kisladag, we continue to optimize the agglomeration circuit to maintain consistent permeability as the material is stacked on the pads. It’s also an exciting year at Lamaque, as we will advance the Ormaque deposit through the mining and processing of a bulk sample leading to an expected inaugural reserve late this year.” “In addition, we made significant headway on our Skouries project as we ramped up into full construction. This year we expect to make substantial progress as we finalize the remaining contracts, advance construction of the major earth works including haul roads, the Integrated Extractive Waste Management Facility, water management facilities, and the crusher and filter buildings. We also expect work to continue to advance on the underground with a focus on lateral development and associated services for the year to setup mining of two test stopes in 2025.” “Our four-year production guidance is designed to provide an outlook as to how we see our current operations performing and the impact of the ramp-up of Skouries production in 2026 through 2027. Next year, to move in-line with peer companies, we will transition to providing three-year production guidance by mine,” added Burns. 2024 Guidance LamaqueComplexKisladagEfemcukuru(3)Olympias(3,4)SkouriesProjectTotal2023ActualGold Production(000’ oz)175 – 190180 – 19575 – 8575 – 85 505 – 555485Silver Production(000’ oz) 1,500 – 1,700 1,500 – 1,7001,382Lead Production(000’ t) 13 – 16 13 – 1612Zinc Production(000’ t) 12 – 15 12 – 1514Tonnes Processed(millions)0.87 – 0.9113.2 – 13.70.53 – 0.550.48 – 0.51 Gold Grade(g/t)6.3 – 6.80.7 – 0.85.0 – 5.58.0 – 9.0 Total Cash Costs(1)($/oz sold)700 – 800820 – 9201,080 – 1,180980 – 1,080 840 – 940(5)850All-in Sustaining Costs(1)($/oz sold)1,180 – 1,280890 – 9901,290 – 1,3901,280 – 1,380 1,190 – 1,290(5)1,220Capital Expenditures($ millions) Sustaining Capital(1)85 – 9510 – 1512 – 1728 – 33 135 – 160136Growth Capital(1,2)17 – 2285 – 956 – 914 – 18375 – 425497 – 569275Sustaining and Growth Capital(1,2)($ millions)102 – 11795 – 11018 – 2642 – 51375 – 425632 – 729411 (1) These financial measures are non-IFRS financial measures.

The increase in gold production is primarily driven by higher expected production at Kisladag as a result of the upgraded materials handling systems and the recently commissioned North Heap Leach Pad. In addition, we expect an increase at Olympias following the underground infrastructure upgrades completed in mid-2023 and productivity improvements that ramped-up during 2023. Similar to prior years, quarter-to-quarter gold production in 2024 is expected to fluctuate, with higher production expected in the second half due to the impact of winter conditions at Kisladag and ore grade variability across the portfolio. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) are expected to be relatively stable compared to 2023, with average total cash costs(1) in 2024 expected to be between $840 to $940 per ounce sold and an average AISC(1) of $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold. The expected 2024 costs, relative to 2023 cost performance, are driven by forecasted lower unit costs for fuel and other key consumables, and slightly offset by higher labour costs in some areas. Exploration and evaluation expenses are expected to be $27 to $30 million in 2024, with 65% expensed, and 35% capitalized. General and administrative expenses are expected to be $35 to $38 million in 2024, and depreciation expense expected to range from $280 to $290 million. (1) Total cash cost per ounce sold and AISC per ounce sold are non-IFRS financial measures. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference, and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section ‘Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios’ of Eldorado’s December 31, 2023, MD&A. OPERATING MINES: CANADA Lamaque Complex In 2024, production guidance of 175,000 to 190,000 ounces at the Lamaque Complex is consistent with the previously guided range of 180,000 to 190,000 ounces. The range has been widened slightly to reflect an updated mine plan that supports mine sequencing optionality and optimization as we move lower in the deposit. In 2024, the focus remains on resource conversion drilling at Ormaque, the completion of a bulk sample and a pre-feasibility study with the expectation of declaring an inaugural reserve at the end of the year. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2023, as a result of an increase in the use of consumables (fuel, cyanide, explosives) and increased labour costs. Sustaining capital expenditures of $85 to $95 million for 2024 are expected to include significant underground mine development and resource conversion drilling at the Triangle deposit. Expected growth capital of $17 to $22 million for 2024 includes non-sustaining exploration expenditures for resource conversion and resource expansion drilling at the Ormaque deposit, tailings management, and electric underground trucks. TURKIYE KisladagIn 2024, production guidance of 180,000 to 195,000 ounces at Kisladag is slightly lower than the previously guided range of 195,000 to 205,000 ounces, primarily due to the inventory build-up within the ore stacked in the leach facility, following the residual impacts of the high precipitation event in 2023. We continue to optimize our on-belt agglomeration and stacking processes to improve quality and consistency of stacked ore, along with focused activities to enhance inventory drawdown. Gold production in 2024 is expected to increase 21% from 2023 production, driven by higher ore grades, higher tonnage resulting from the upgraded materials handling circuit, and inventory drawdown. The recently commissioned North Heap Leach Pad and increased irrigation rates contribute to improved leach kinetics. Additional efficiencies will be realized with the completion and commissioning of the north adsorption-desorption and recovery plant in the second half of 2024. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be slightly higher, when compared to 2023, driven primarily by higher mining rates and increased labour costs. Consumption of fuel, explosives, cement, and cyanide are also expected to increase, impacting absolute costs. Planned 2024 sustaining capital of $10 to $15 million is primarily related to equipment overhauls and processing improvements. Planned 2024 growth capital of $85 to $95 million includes the continuation of the waste stripping campaign, the phased expansion of the North Heap Leach Pad, and the north adsorption-desorption and recovery plant construction. Efemcukuru In 2024, production guidance of 75,000 to 85,000 ounces is unchanged from the previously guided range. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be higher, when compared to 2023, and reflect increases in labour costs, and consumable costs. Planned sustaining capital expenditures of $12 to $17 million for 2024 include underground development and equipment overhauls. Planned growth capital of $6 to $9 million for 2024 is expected to be primarily based on development and infrastructure for expansion of the mining area towards the Kokarpinar and Bati vein systems. An updated technical report will be filed at the end of Q1 2024. GREECE Olympias In 2024, production guidance of 75,000 to 85,000 ounces at Olympias increased 14% from the previously guided range of 65,000 to 75,000 ounces, primarily driven by the results of productivity initiatives implemented over the past few years, including increased ventilation capacity, bulk emulsion explosives, and productivity improvements at the mine and the mill. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be lower compared to 2023, supported by increased production and throughput and higher by-product credits for silver, lead and zinc production and lower costs for certain consumables. Continued quarter to quarter variability in AISC and total cash costs due to by-product credits from timing on by-product concentrate shipments is expected. Planned 2024 sustaining capital expenditures of $28 to $33 million include underground mine development and management of the Kokkinolakas tailings management facility. Planned 2024 growth capital of $14 to $18 million is primarily focused around mill expansion to support ramp-up to 650 ktpa and upgrading of ancillary facilities. An updated technical report will be filed at the end of Q1 2024. GROWTH CAPITAL INVESTMENTS: SkouriesProject spending at Skouries in 2024 of between $375 and $425 million will be focused on advancing the construction of the major earthworks structures including the haul roads, Integrated Extractive Waste Management Facility (“IEWMF”) construction, low-grade stockpile, water management, process facilities, crusher building and filter building. In addition, work will focus on underground development to support test stope mining in 2025. Mechanical, piping and electrical installations will also progress in all process and infrastructure areas. On the critical path is the filter plant building, which continues to advance, with the piling work having commenced. In Q2 2024, it is expected that the filter building contract will be awarded which will include the building structure, assembly of equipment within the building, comprising air compressors, conveyors, filter presses and other ancillary equipment, in addition to the piping and electrical work. The filter press plates arrived on site in Q1 2024 with the frames for supporting the filter press plates fabricated and expected to ship in Q2 2024. Preassembly is expected to start in Q2 2024. Work for the mill / flotation building is in progress with commissioning work on overhead cranes, installation of construction lighting and scaffolding, and the commencement of structural steel work. Mobilization for the process plant mechanical, piping and electrical work will start in Q1 2024. By the end of 2024, we expect to have completed the IEWMF coffer dam and significantly advanced the IEWMF earthworks, water management facilities, process plant and filter plants. The first phase of underground development continues to advance the West Decline and access to the test stopes with a local contractor. The second underground development contract proposals are in the final evaluation stage, awarding of the contract is planned for the end of Q2 2024. This contract includes the test stope work as well as additional development and services work to support the development of the underground mine. We expect to complete approximately 2,200 metres of underground development in 2024. The time we invested in diligently negotiating the key project contracts has increased our execution confidence with a modest effect on the production schedule. First production is now expected in Q3 2025 from prior guidance of mid-2025. We expect a steep ramp up curve over the second half of 2025 and remain on track for commercial production at the end of 2025. With a back end weighted ramp-up curve we expect to produce a lower amount of high-quality copper-gold concentrate in 2024. This has resulted in a lowered gold production range to between 50,000 to 60,000 ounces from prior guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 ounces. We also expect to produce between 15 to 20 million pounds of copper in 2025. We are assessing our plans with the goal of increasing our 2026 gold and copper production profile at Skouries. The estimated capital to complete construction has increased 9% to $920 million from $845 million as detailed in our 2023 Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial and Operational Results. 2024 EXPLORATION OUTLOOK Eldorado Gold’s exploration activities in 2024 are focused on the regions in which we operate: Canada, Turkiye and Greece, and includes in-mine resource conversion and expansion drilling, drill testing a range of near-mine and early-stage targets, as well as generating new targets and projects through generative initiatives. Global exploration expenditures planned for 2024 are $27 to $30 million, with an additional $8 to $10 million of non-sustaining exploration expenditures to support Ormaque resource conversion and expansion drilling at the Lamaque Complex and conversion and expansion drilling at the Kokarpinar vein at Efemcukuru. Across the portfolio, approximately 196,000 metres of drilling are planned, and includes approximately 43,000 metres of resource conversion and extension drilling at Lamaque Operations (Triangle), Efemcukuru (Kestanebeleni) and Olympias planned as capitalised sustaining, ~63,000 metres of resource conversion and extension drilling at Lamaque Operations (Ormaque) and Efemcukuru (Kokarpinar) planned as capitalised growth budget. In addition, over 90,000 metres of drilling are planned to test early stage targets across the portfolio and are expensed. CANADA Lamaque Complex and Near Mine Exploration Triangle Mine: Resource expansion and resource conversion drilling at the Triangle Mine will focus on the C6 and C7 zones with approximately 26,000 metres planned. A new exploration drive and drill platform at the 785 level will enable shorter holes and improved angles for resource conversion purposes. Ormaque Deposit: The 2024 exploration program at Ormaque is expected to include approximately 35,000 metres of underground resource conversion drilling within existing inferred resources. This drilling will continue to test the upper two-thirds of the deposit for further conversion from inferred to indicated resource (down to lens E100). In addition, approximately 18,000 metres of surface drilling testing step-outs to the east of and below the known deposit is planned. Sigma-Lamaque early-stage targets: Approximately 13,000 metres of underground exploration drilling planned from platforms along the Sigma-Triangle decline, testing multiple conceptual targets and step-outs from previous high-grade drill intercepts in the Sigma-Lamaque-Ormaque area. In addition, approximately 19,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test targets in the same area but away from the decline. The drilling will target high-grade vein systems similar in geological setting and mineralization style to those historically mined at both Sigma and Lamaque, including testing new conceptual targets that have been developed in recent years. Val d’Or exploration: We are advancing multiple early to advanced-stage exploration targets in the Val-d’Or district that are expected to provide opportunities for resource growth for the Lamaque Complex. Over 30,000 metres of drilling is planned on targets that include: Bourlamaque early-stage targets: Approximately 5,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test various early-stage targets mainly within the Bourlamaque Batholith, which have been defined by a combination of historical drilling results, geophysical anomalies, till geochemistry, and geological mapping. The drilling is expected to target high-grade vein systems similar in geological setting and mineralization style to those historically mined at the Beaufor mine and the mines in the Herbin area. Uniacke-Perestroika: The Uniake-Perestroika properties, located approximately 45 kilometres northeast of the Lamaque Complex, are being explored under an option agreement with Val d’Or Mining. Approximately 6,500 metres of drilling are planned to test a target that has been developed in the Héva-Cadillac area. Abitibi Exploration Eldorado Gold’s early-stage exploration in Canada is currently focused on generating and testing target areas within the greater Abitibi region that offer opportunities for standalone development outside of the Lamaque Complex area. The Company’s current exploration portfolio includes the Montgolfier project located along the Harricana-Turgeon greenstone belt to the east of the Casa Berardi mine, and a group of licenses in the Kirkland Lake belt currently being explored under an option agreement with the license holder Val-d’Or Mining Corp. At Montgolfier, a staged diamond drill program of up to 8,000 metres is currently underway, testing for the bedrock source of highly anomalous gold-in-till anomalies identified in a previous sonic drilling program, elevated concentrations of gold intercepted in the 2023 initial drill testing program, as well as integrated lithological structural and geophysical targets. The Kirkland Lake licenses are at the target definition stage, and targeting reviews are underway to assess if targets are appropriate for drill testing in 2024, where approximately 3,500 metres have been planned. TURKIYE 2024 exploration in Turkiye is focused on resource expansion and resource conversion drilling at Efemcukuru and advancing several early-stage projects in highly prospective priority regions throughout Turkiye. Efemcukuru During 2024, approximately 10,000 metres of resource conversion and expansion drilling is planned at the Kokarpinar South vein system and approximately 8,000 metres are planned for the South Ore and North Ore Shoots at the Kestanebeleni vein system. Approximately 23,000 metres of drilling is also to test earlier stage targets in the West Vein area, with the main focus on the Volcan and Huseyinburnu vein systems. Geologic mapping and geophysical surveys are also planned as part of assessing the wider exploration potential on existing licenses. Early-Stage Exploration We continue to explore regions of Turkiye that offer strong exploration potential for resource exploration and development. Current programs are focused in the Artvin (Hod Maden) district and along the Izmir-Ankara Suture Zone, where approximately 12,500 metres of drilling are planned for 2024 to test early-stage targets. Project generation activities and early-stage project work within the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex are also being conducted with a Turkish joint venture partner. GREECE Exploration activities in Greece in 2024 are focused in supporting drill program execution at the Olympias mine and at the Skouries project, in addition to undertaking basic field activities to define targets for future drill testing across our exploration licenses. Olympias Approximately 9,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test for extensions to known mineralization in the East, West (Flats) and North Zones at Olympias. Four-Year Outlook Overview: Gold production of 675,000 to 735,000 ounces by 2027, resulting in growth of 45% over the four-year period from 2023 production and a compound annual growth rate of over 9%.Continued strong commitment to exploration to unlock the outstanding potential of the Company’s brownfields property portfolio and identifying and developing new opportunities in Eldorado’s focus jurisdictions.Skouries first production in Q3 2025, with commercial production by the end of 2025. 20242025(2)202620272023 ActualGold Production(000’ oz)Lamaque Complex175 – 190(1)170 – 180180 – 200180 – 200177Kisladag180 – 195175 – 185150 – 165165 – 175155Efemcukuru75 – 8570 – 8075 – 8560 – 7086Olympias75 – 8580 – 9080 – 9075 – 8567Skouries 50 – 60(2)145 – 155195 – 205 Total Gold Production(000 oz)505 – 555545 – 595630 – 695675 – 735485Copper Production(Mlbs)Skouries 15 – 2050 – 6060 - 80 Total Copper Production(Mlbs) 15 – 2050 – 6060 - 80 (1) Includes production ounces from the bulk sample process at Ormaque.

The company ended the year with total debt of $4.0 billion, produced 1.7 Tcfe, and invested $2.1 billion in capital. Despite challenges like a decrease in realized prices, Southwestern Energy focused on debt reduction and operational efficiency. Positive Strong financial results for Q4 and full-year 2023, with $2.5 billion net cash from operations and $1.6 billion net income $744 million adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and $2.4 billion adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) Total debt of $4.0 billion at the end of 2023, with a focus on debt reduction and operational efficiency Production of 1.7 Tcfe, capital investments of $2.1 billion, and placing 132 wells to sales in 2023 Challenges like lower commodity prices affecting weighted average realized prices Negative Decrease in weighted average realized prices due to lower commodity prices Downward price revisions leading to a decrease in total proved reserves from 21.6 Tcfe to 19.7 Tcfe Discontinuation of guidance due to pending merger with Chesapeake Energy Corporation Financial Analyst Southwestern Energy's 2023 financial results highlight a mixed performance, with a notable decline in net income and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. The company's strategic focus on debt reduction, as evidenced by the decrease from $4.4 billion to $4.0 billion in total debt, has positively impacted its leverage ratio, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA improving to 1.6x. However, investors should consider the volatility in commodity prices, such as the 59% decrease in NYMEX and the 18% decrease in WTI, which have had a significant impact on the company's realized prices and may continue to pose risks moving forward. The free cash flow generation of $142 million, while positive, is substantially lower than the previous year's $848 million, indicating potential challenges in sustaining capital investments and shareholder returns if commodity prices remain depressed. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is highly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices and Southwestern Energy's performance reflects this volatility. The company's production mix, which is heavily skewed towards natural gas (86% of total production), exposes it to the dynamics of the natural gas market. The weighted average realized price before transportation expense and excluding derivatives of $2.72 per Mcfe is a critical metric for investors to monitor, as it directly impacts revenue generation. Moreover, the capital investment of $2.1 billion and the placement of 132 wells to sales demonstrate the company's commitment to maintaining production levels. However, the reduction in proved reserves from 21.6 Tcfe to 19.7 Tcfe raises concerns about long-term sustainability and may require strategic reassessment. Energy Sector Analyst Southwestern Energy's operational focus on the Appalachia and Haynesville regions is a strategic choice, considering the abundant natural gas resources and the potential for cost-efficient production. The company's proved developed finding and development costs of $0.91 per Mcfe, particularly in Appalachia at $0.66 per Mcfe, are competitive within the industry, suggesting efficient capital allocation. However, the downward price revisions leading to a decrease in proved reserves highlight the sensitivity of reserve valuations to price fluctuations. Investors should be aware of the potential for further revisions should prices continue to decline. Additionally, the company's operational results, such as the average lateral length of wells, can be indicative of technological advancements and operational efficiency, which are key factors in maintaining competitive production costs. 02/22/2024 - 05:08 PM SPRING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) (the “Company” or “Southwestern Energy”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. 2023 Highlights Generated $2.5 billion net cash provided by operating activities, $1.6 billion net income and $744 million adjusted net income (non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $2.4 billion and free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $142 million Ended the year with total debt of $4.0 billion, including the impacts of working capital Produced 1.7 Tcfe, or 4.6 Bcfe per day, including 3.9 Bcf per day of natural gas and 105 MBbls per day of liquids Invested $2.1 billion of capital and placed 132 wells to sales, including 67 in Appalachia and 65 in Haynesville 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results FINANCIAL STATISTICS For the three months ended For the years ended December 31, December 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income (loss) $ (658 ) $ 2,901 $ 1,557 $ 1,849 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)2 $ 192 $ 287 $ 744 $ 1,479 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.60 ) $ 2.63 $ 1.41 $ 1.66 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.17 $ 0.26 $ 0.67 $ 1.33 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 611 $ 732 $ 2,407 $ 3,283 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 477 $ 958 $ 2,516 $ 3,154 Net cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 579 $ 677 $ 2,273 $ 3,057 Total capital investments (1) $ 417 $ 537 $ 2,131 $ 2,209 Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 162 $ 140 $ 142 $ 848 (1) Capital investments on the cash flow statement include an increase of $78 million and an increase of $44 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a decrease of $44 million and an increase of $88 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to the change in accrued expenditures between periods. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Southwestern Energy recorded a net loss of $658 million, or ($0.60) per diluted share. Adjusting for the impact of the Company’s full cost ceiling test impairment, gain on unsettled derivatives, and other one-time items, adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $192 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $611 million.

However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Another such non-GAAP financial measure is pre-tax PV-10. Management believes that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows (“standardized measure”), or after-tax PV-10 amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV-10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the PV-10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. Additional non-GAAP financial measures the Company may present from time to time are free cash flow, net debt, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company’s position and performance are measured relative to the position and performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. 3 Months Ended December 31, 12 Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Adjusted net income: (in millions) Net income (loss) $ (658 ) $ 2,901 $ 1,557 $ 1,849 Add back (deduct): Merger-related expenses — — — 27 Impairments 1,710 — 1,710 — Gain on unsettled derivatives (1) (526 ) (2,548 ) (2,088 ) (24 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 8 19 14 Other loss (2) 7 3 17 4 Adjustments due to discrete tax items (3) (74 ) (660 ) (547 ) (386 ) Tax impact on adjustments (267 ) 583 76 (5 ) Adjusted net income $ 192 $ 287 $ 744 $ 1,479 (1) Includes ($1) million and ($7) million of non-performance risk adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $5 million non-performance risk adjustment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

A key highlight is the increase in total revenue to $280.7 million, up from $259.2 million in the previous year. This growth is primarily attributed to enhanced Bitcoin production and an uptick in the cryptocurrency's price. The strategic expansion of the Rockdale Facility and the partnership with MicroBT are pivotal factors that have contributed to Riot's increased mining capacity and reduced cost per Bitcoin mined to $7,539, down by 33% from the previous year.From a market perspective, Riot's strong balance sheet, featuring $597 million in cash and 7,362 Bitcoin, coupled with minimal long-term debt, positions the company favorably for sustained growth and resilience in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The company's forward-looking statements regarding hash rate targets suggest aggressive growth plans, aiming to reach 100 EH/s in the long term. These plans are likely to be well-received by investors, as they demonstrate a clear roadmap for scaling operations.However, despite these positive indicators, the company reported a net loss of $49.5 million for the year. This loss is significantly lower than the previous year's $509.6 million, which included substantial non-cash impairment charges. The reduction in net loss and the substantial non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $214.0 million, which includes a gain on Bitcoin held, reflect a healthier operational status. Investors will need to balance the company's growth trajectory against the inherent risks of the cryptocurrency sector, including price volatility and regulatory challenges. Financial Analyst Riot Platforms, Inc.'s financial results for 2023 demonstrate a strategic focus on enhancing their mining efficiency and expanding capacity, which has yielded a lower cost of production and increased Bitcoin yield. The significant increase in power credits, from $27.3 million in 2022 to $71.2 million in 2023, underscores the effectiveness of Riot's power strategy in leveraging the ERCOT grid's volatility. This has not only contributed to a reduced cost of mining but also provided additional revenue streams.The company's adoption of ASU 2023-08, allowing for the recognition of Bitcoin at fair value, introduces a new dynamic into their financial reporting. This change has contributed to the reported non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, providing a more favorable view of the company's profitability when considering the unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings. It's important for stakeholders to consider the implications of such accounting practices, as they can introduce significant volatility to the financial statements based on the fluctuating price of Bitcoin.While Riot's expansion and technological partnerships indicate a strong position within the industry, the net loss reported, though significantly reduced from the previous year, indicates that the company is still navigating the path to consistent profitability. The decrease in Data Center Hosting revenue and the reported net loss reflect areas where the company may need to optimize further. Investors should consider the company's long-term growth strategy, including the ambitious hash rate targets, against the backdrop of these financial nuances and the broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Cryptocurrency Analyst Riot Platforms, Inc.'s performance metrics, such as the 19% increase in Bitcoin production and the 28% increase in hash rate capacity, are indicative of a robust operational strategy in the cryptocurrency mining sector. The reduction in the cost to mine each Bitcoin, alongside the increase in total Bitcoin produced, suggests that Riot is effectively scaling its operations and improving its competitive edge in the market. The company's strategic partnership with MicroBT, securing a long-term supply of the latest-generation miners, is a critical move that ensures Riot maintains one of the most efficient mining fleets in the industry.Looking ahead, the development of the Corsicana Facility, which is slated to become the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world, represents a significant step towards Riot's goal of increasing hash rate capacity. The anticipated growth to 28 EH/s by the end of 2024 and 38 EH/s by the end of 2025 reflects the company's commitment to scaling up its mining operations. These developments should be closely monitored by stakeholders, as they have the potential to significantly impact Riot's market share and influence within the cryptocurrency mining industry.However, it is crucial to note that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate widely, impacting the valuation of Riot's holdings and its profitability. The company's financial health, as evidenced by its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves, provides a buffer against market downturns but does not entirely mitigate the risk associated with the industry's unpredictability. 02/22/2024 - 04:45 PM Riot Reports Record Results, with $280.7 Million in Total Revenue, 6,626 Bitcoin Produced, and Record Hash Rate Capacity of 12.4 EH/sCASTLE ROCK, Colo., Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (“Riot” or “the Company”), an industry leader in vertically integrated Bitcoin (“BTC”) mining, reports financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023. The audited financial statements are available on Riot’s website and here. “I am pleased to announce results for Riot for 2023, which proved to be another milestone year in Riot’s ongoing development as a leading vertically integrated Bitcoin miner,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “We achieved record results in 2023, generating all-time highs of $281 million in total revenues, 6,626 Bitcoin produced, and $71 million in power credits earned from our unique power strategy. “In addition to our record financial performance in 2023, Riot achieved significant progress across our key strategic development targets, including: (i) completion of our 700 megawatt Rockdale Facility expansion; (ii) successful scaling of our power strategy, which drove our industry-leading low cost to mine in FY 2023 to $7,539 per Bitcoin; (iii) a landmark partnership with MicroBT to lock-in a long-term, fixed-price supply of latest-generation miners, ensuring that Riot operates among the most efficient mining fleets in our industry; and (iv) ongoing development of our 1 gigawatt Corsicana Facility, which will begin energization at the end of Q1 2024 and which, when fully developed, will be the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world. “At the same time, Riot has also further enhanced our already industry-leading balance sheet strength, ending 2023 with approximately $597 million in cash, 7,362 Bitcoin, worth approximately $311 million based on year-end Bitcoin prices, and nominal long-term debt. As a leading vertically integrated Bitcoin miner, coupling development of our Corsicana Facility with a secured supply of leading-edge miners from MicroBT, and our strong balance sheet gives Riot the most secure, visible path in our industry to achieving our growth plans. Our targets are to reach 28 EH/s in total hash rate capacity by the end of 2024, 38 EH/s by the end of 2025, and ultimately 100 EH/s and beyond.” Fiscal Year 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights Key financial and operational highlights for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 include: Total revenue of $280.7 million, as compared to $259.2 million for the same period in 2022, primarily driven by higher Bitcoin production and higher price for Bitcoin.Earned $71.2 million in power credits through support of the ERCOT grid in Texas during several weather-related supply/demand issues in 2023. The amount of power credits earned equated to approximately 2,497 Bitcoin, as computed by using average daily closing Bitcoin prices on a monthly basis.Produced 6,626 Bitcoin, as compared to 5,554 during the same twelve-month period in 2022, a 19% increase, notwithstanding the impact of the Company’s effective employment of its power strategy, under which Bitcoin production was suspended while the Company received significant benefits from power credits earned.Bitcoin Mining revenue of $189.0 million, as compared to $156.9 million during the same twelve-month period in 2022. The increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue was driven by slightly higher values of Bitcoin mined in 2023, which averaged $28,859 per Bitcoin as compared to an average price of $28,245 per Bitcoin in 2022, as well as more Bitcoin mined in 2023 from an increase in miners deployed.Data Center Hosting revenue of $27.3 million, as compared to $36.9 million for the same twelve-month period in 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to the termination of certain hosting agreements during the period.Engineering revenue of $64.3 million, as compared to $65.3 million for the same twelve-month period in 2022.Reported a net loss of $49.5 million, as compared to a net loss of $509.6 million in the same period in 2022, which was significantly impacted by non-cash impairment charges totaling $538.6 million in 2022.Reported non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $214.0 million in 2023 which included a $184.7 million gain on Bitcoin held on the balance sheet. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, under which, Riot recognizes its Bitcoin held at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized in income. Riot elected to early adopt this guidance in 2023.Maintained industry–leading financial position, with $887.6 million in net working capital, including $597.2 million in cash on hand, nominal long-term debt, and 7,362 Bitcoin, all of which were produced by the Company’s self-mining operations, as of December 31, 2023.Riot’s cost to mine Bitcoin for 2023, net of power credits allocated to self-mining, averaged $7,539 per Bitcoin versus $11,225 in 2022, a decrease of 33% year-over-year.Increased hash rate capacity by 28% to 12.4 exahash per second (“EH/s”) as of December 31, 2023, compared to 9.7 EH/s as of December 31, 2022. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $280.7 million, and consisted of $189.0 million in Bitcoin Mining revenue, $27.3 million in Data Center Hosting revenue, $64.3 million in Engineering revenue, and $0.1 million in other revenue. Bitcoin Mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $92.4 million (48.9% of mining revenue), as compared to $82.5 million (52.6% of mining revenue) for the same twelve-month period in 2022, an increase of $9.9 million. Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue consists primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, and insurance, but excluding depreciation and amortization. The increase in Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue in 2023 is primarily due to the increase in mining capacity at the Rockdale Facility, which requires more headcount and direct costs necessary to maintain and support the mining operations. Data Center Hosting cost in excess of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $69.8 million. Data Center Hosting costs consisted primarily of direct power costs, with the balance primarily incurred for compensation and rent costs. Engineering revenue in excess of engineering cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3.7 million. Engineering cost of revenue for 2023 consisted primarily of direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs. Under Riot’s long-term power agreements, the Company has the ability to return unused power and receive power credits at market-driven spot prices. Power credits received from these activities totaled $71.2 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $27.3 million during the same twelve-month period in 2022, equating to approximately 2,497 Bitcoin as computed by using average daily closing Bitcoin prices on a monthly basis. If power credits were directly allocated between Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue and Data Center Hosting cost of revenue based on proportional power consumption, Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue would have decreased by $46.6 million, increasing Bitcoin Mining revenue in excess of Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue to $139.0 million (73.6% of Bitcoin Mining revenue) on a non-GAAP basis, while Data Center Hosting cost of revenue would have decreased by $24.6 million, and Data Center Hosting revenue in excess of Data Center Hosting cost of revenue would equal $(45.2) million ((165.9)% of Data Center Hosting revenue) on a non-GAAP basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $100.3 million, as compared to $67.5 million for the same twelve-month period in 2022. The increase of $32.9 million was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense, which increased by $12.2 million as a result of hiring additional employees to support Riot's ongoing growth, increased stock-based compensation of $7.6 million due to the adoption of the long-term incentive plan and additional headcount, increased legal and professional fees of $8.1 million primarily related to ongoing litigation and public company compliance, and an increase of $5.0 million in other general operating costs such as insurance and information technology projects to support the Company’s growth. Net loss for 2023 was $(49.5) million, or $(0.28) per share, compared to a net loss of $(509.6) million, or $(3.65) per share in 2022. The net loss in 2023 included non-cash stock-based compensation of $32.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $252.4 million. Net loss in 2023 was impacted by the early adoption of ASU 2023-08, which was issued by FASB in December 2023, under which Riot recognizes its Bitcoin held at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized in income. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was $214.0 million, as compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $(67.2) million for the same twelve-month period in 2022. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was impacted by the early adoption of ASU 2023-08, which was issued by FASB in December 2023, under which Riot recognizes its Bitcoin held at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized in income. Hash Rate Growth Riot plans to energize the first building (Building A1) at its new Corsicana Facility at the end of Q1 2024. Miners will be brought online in batches over the first several weeks of April 2024. Building A2 is expected to be completed and brought online towards the end of Q2 2024, with Buildings B1 & B2 being brought online during the third and fourth quarters of 2024.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance In addition to financial measures presented under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we consistently evaluate our use of and calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures such as “Adjusted EBITDA”. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure defined as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations, which management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company’s core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure becauseit allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric for share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, net income, the most comparable measure under GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this financial measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure: Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net income (loss) $(49,472) $(509,553) $(15,437)Interest (income) expense (8,222) (454) 296 Income tax expense (benefit) (5,093) (11,749) 254 Depreciation and amortization 252,354 107,950 26,324 EBITDA 189,567 (413,806) 11,437 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 32,170 24,555 68,491 Acquisition-related costs — 78 21,198 Change in fair value of derivative asset (6,721) (71,418) (12,112)Change in fair value of contingent consideration — (159) 975 Realized gain on sale/exchange of long-term investment — — (26,260)Realized loss on sale of marketable equity securities — 8,996 — Unrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities — — 13,655 Loss (gain) on sale/exchange of equipment 5,336 (16,281) — Casualty-related charges (recoveries), net (5,974) 9,688 — Impairment of goodwill — 335,648 — Impairment of miners — 55,544 — Other (income) expense (260) 59 (2,378)License fees (97) (97) (97)Adjusted EBITDA $214,021 $(67,193) $74,909 In addition to Adjusted EBITDA , we believe “Bitcoin Mining revenue in excess of cost of revenue, net of power curtailment credits”, “Data Center Hosting revenue in excess of cost of revenue, net of power curtailment credits”, “Cost of revenue – Bitcoin Mining, net of power curtailment credits” and “Cost of revenue – Data Center Hosting, net of power curtailment credits” are additional non-GAAP performance metrics that represent a key indicator of the Company’s core business operations of both Bitcoin Mining and Data Center Hosting. We believe our ability to offer power back to the grid at market-driven spot prices, thereby reducing our operating costs, is integral to our overall strategy, specifically our power management strategy and our commitment to supporting the ERCOT power grid. While participation in various grid demand response programs may impact our Bitcoin production, we view this as an important part of our partnership-driven approach with ERCOT and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities. We also believe netting power credits against our costs can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments. We have allocated the benefit of the power sales to our Bitcoin Mining and Data Center Hosting segments based on their proportional power consumption during the periods presented. Bitcoin Mining revenue in excess of cost of revenue, net of power curtailment credits, Data Center Hosting revenue in excess of cost of revenue, net of power curtailment credits, Cost of revenue – Bitcoin Mining, net of power curtailment credits and Cost of revenue – Data Center Hosting, net of power curtailment credits are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to Revenue – Bitcoin Mining, Revenue – Data Center Hosting, Cost of revenue – Bitcoin Mining or Cost of revenue – Data Center Hosting as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financial Analyst The reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 for 2023, up from $1.77 in 2022, indicate a positive trajectory for Essential Utilities Inc.'s profitability. This increase, albeit modest, suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency, particularly in light of the reported decrease in operations and maintenance expenses. Investors should note the company's ability to maintain a steady EPS growth despite the challenges posed by warmer weather, which typically reduces utility usage.The initiation of the 2024 EPS guidance range of $1.96 to $2.00 is a forward-looking statement that may influence investor expectations and stock valuation. However, the caveat regarding the pending rate cases adds an element of uncertainty that could impact future profitability. The capital investment guidance of $7.2 billion from 2024 through 2028 signals a significant commitment to infrastructure, which is likely to enhance long-term service reliability and regulatory compliance but may also lead to increased debt or equity financing, thereby affecting the company's financial leverage and cost of capital. Market Research Analyst Essential Utilities Inc.'s record infrastructure investments and strategic acquisitions, like the seven systems adding over $44 million in rate base and 11,000 customers, reflect a growth-oriented approach. The company's compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) projections for its rate base—8% for water and 10% for natural gas through 2028—suggest a robust expansion strategy that could outpace industry averages, potentially positioning the company as a strong player in the utilities sector. This growth, however, hinges on successful rate cases and the ability to integrate new acquisitions effectively.The company's focus on regulated infrastructure investments aligns with the broader industry trend towards modernizing aging utility systems and complying with environmental regulations. Essential's commitment to addressing PFAS contamination and reducing methane emissions is not only a regulatory necessity but also positions the company favorably in terms of corporate responsibility and may enhance its reputation among increasingly environmentally-conscious consumers and investors. Legal Expert The mention of base rate cases filed by Essential Utilities' subsidiaries is a critical regulatory aspect that can significantly affect the company's revenue streams. Rate cases are subject to approval by public utility commissions and can result in either favorable or unfavorable outcomes for utilities. The outcomes of these cases will determine the rates the company can charge customers and ultimately influence its financial performance. It is essential for investors to monitor these proceedings as they can have material impacts on the company's profitability.Additionally, the sale of non-core assets, such as the West Virginia natural gas utility assets and the microgrid projects, is indicative of the company's strategic focus on its primary regulated utility business. This divestiture allows for a more streamlined operation and could reduce legal and regulatory complexities associated with managing diverse business units. 02/22/2024 - 04:42 PM Earnings per share of $1.86 for 2023, compared to 2022 earnings of $1.77 Record infrastructure investments of $1.19 billion Acquired seven systems, adding over $44 million in rate base and 11,000 customers Initiating 2024 annual earnings per share guidance range of $1.96 to $2.00 Initiating capital investment guidance of $7.2 billion from 2024 through 2028 BRYN MAWR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essential Utilities Inc. (NYSE: WTRG) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Essential’s net income of $498.2 million or $1.86 per share for 2023 compared favorably to $465.2 million or $1.77 per share reported for 2022. “Despite the winter weather that was significantly warmer than normal in 2023, we successfully delivered earnings per share that met our 2023 guidance expectations,” said Essential Utilities Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Franklin. “Also, for the third consecutive year, Essential has been named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies. We are honored to be recognized for our commitments to operational excellence, environmental stewardship, and sustainable business practices and are excited to continue in our role as an industry leader throughout 2024.” Full-year 2023 Operating Results Essential reported revenues of $2.05 billion in 2023 compared to $2.29 billion in the prior year. The decrease in revenues for the year were primarily due to lower purchased gas costs and unfavorable weather resulting in decreased volume from the regulated natural gas segment, which were offset by additional revenues from regulatory recoveries. Operations and maintenance expenses were $575.5 million for 2023 compared to $613.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in operations and maintenance expenses was primarily a result of lower operating expenses, customer assistance program expenses, employee retirement expenses, and customer bad debt, offset partially by higher water production expenses and regulated water segment customer growth. Essential’s net income of $498.2 million or $1.86 per share compared to $465.2 million or $1.77 per share reported through the same period of 2022. Regulatory recoveries, decreased expenses, and regulated water segment customer growth were offset by lower regulated natural gas segment and regulated water segment volumes and other items. Essential’s regulated water segment reported revenues of $1.15 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to $1.08 billion in 2022. Regulatory recoveries and customer growth were the largest contributors to the increase in revenues for the period. Operations and maintenance expenses for Essential’s regulated water segment decreased to $368.8 million compared to $370.9 million in 2022. Essential’s regulated natural gas segment reported revenues of $863.8 million, compared to $1.14 billion in 2022. Purchased gas costs were $327.5 million as compared to $551.0 million in 2022. As a result, the recovery of lower purchased gas costs was the primary driver in the decrease of revenues. Operations and maintenance expenses for the same period for Essential’s regulated natural gas segment decreased to $209.1 million, from $239.5 million in 2022. Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating Results Essential reported net income of $135.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $114.9 million for the same quarter in 2022. Earnings per share were $0.50 for the quarter compared to $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the quarter, lower expense, revenues from regulatory recoveries, and other items were offset by lower regulated natural gas segment and regulated water segment volumes. Revenues for the quarter were $479.4 million compared to $705.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower purchased gas costs, decreased volume from the regulated natural gas segment, due to unfavorable weather, and regulated water segment, and other items were the primary contributors to the decrease in revenues for the quarter, which was offset by additional revenues from regulatory recoveries. Operations and maintenance expenses decreased to $157.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $184.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Essential 2024 Financial and Growth Guidance In December 2023, Essential’s largest regulated natural gas subsidiary, Peoples Natural Gas, filed a base rate case and the company’s largest regulated water subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, also expects to seek rate relief in the second quarter of 2024. Therefore, the company will refrain from providing a multi-year earnings per share guidance range until the conclusion of these base rate cases. The following is the company’s 2024 guidance: In 2024, net income per diluted common share will be $1.96 to $2.00 In 2024, regulated infrastructure investments will be approximately $1.3 to $1.4 billion Through 2028, we will make regulated infrastructure investments of approximately $7.2 billion, weighted towards the regulated water segment Through 2028, the regulated water segment rate base will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8% Through 2028, the regulated natural gas segment rate base will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 10% Through 2028, the regulated utility rate base will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 8% The regulated water customer base (or equivalent dwelling units) of the business will grow at an average annual growth rate of between 2 and 3% from acquisitions and organic customer growth The regulated natural gas customer base of the business will be stable for 2024 In 2024, approximately $250 million in equity is expected to be raised using an ATM equity program Dividend As previously announced in 2023, Essential’s board of directors declared a March 1, 2024, quarterly cash dividend of $0.3071 per share of common stock, this dividend will be payable to shareholders of record on February 9, 2024. On February 21, 2024, Essential’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3071 per share of common stock payable on June 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on May 10, 2024. The company has paid a consecutive quarterly cash dividend for more than 79 years. Financing At year-end 2023, Essential’s weighted average cost of fixed-rate long-term debt was 3.86%, and the company had $538.5 million available on its credit lines. As part of the company’s 2024 financing plan, on January 8, 2024, Essential completed a $500 million issuance of long-term debt, due in 2034 with an interest rate of 5.375%. This debt was used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The company also expects to raise approximately $250 million in equity in 2024 using an At-The-Market (ATM) equity program. Rate Activity In 2023, the company’s regulated water segment received rate awards or infrastructure surcharges in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia of $47.2 million and its regulated natural gas segment received infrastructure surcharges in Pennsylvania and Kentucky of $21.3 million. To date in 2024, the company’s regulated water segment received rate awards or infrastructure surcharges in Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania of $9.1 million and its regulated natural gas segment received infrastructure surcharges in Pennsylvania and Kentucky of $22.1 million. The company currently has base rate cases or infrastructure surcharges pending in Illinois, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia for its regulated water segment, which combined would add an estimated $43.2 million in incremental annual revenues, and a base rate case pending in Pennsylvania for its regulated natural gas segment for an estimated $156.0 million in incremental annual revenues. Capital Expenditures In 2023, Essential invested a record amount of approximately $1.19 billion to improve its regulated water and natural gas infrastructure systems and to enhance customer service across its operations. The company continues to be a leader in the country at replacing miles of underground utility pipe and is committed to maintaining elevated levels of infrastructure investment. In 2024, the company expects to invest between $1.3 to $1.4 billion in needed infrastructure investments. From 2024 through 2028, the company expects to invest approximately $7.2 billion to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers through improved information technology. Essential’s investments during this time period include at least $450 million to address PFAS, replacing and expanding its water and wastewater utility infrastructure, and replacing and upgrading its natural gas utility infrastructure, with the latter leading to significant reductions in methane emissions that occur in aged gas pipes. The capital investments made to rehabilitate and expand the infrastructure of the communities’ Essential serves are critical to its mission of safely and reliably delivering Earth’s most essential resources. Water Utility Growth by Acquisition Essential’s continued growth by acquisition allows the company to provide safe and reliable water and wastewater service to an even larger customer base than it could from organic customer growth alone. In 2023, the company acquired seven systems, that collectively added over $44.5 million in rate base and more than 11,000 new customers or equivalent dwelling units to the company’s footprint. Coupled with organic growth, the company increased its water and wastewater customer base by approximately 1.7%. The company has six signed purchase agreements for additional wastewater systems in Pennsylvania and Illinois that are pending closing and are expected to serve over 215,000 equivalent retail customers or equivalent dwelling units and total approximately $380 million in purchase price. This includes the recently signed agreement with North Versailles Township Sanitary Authority to acquire their wastewater system in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania for up to $30 million, which is expected to add approximately 4,400 customers. The company’s $276.5 million agreement to acquire the Delaware County Regional Water Quality Control Authority (DELCORA), a Pennsylvania sewer authority that serves approximately 198,000 equivalent dwelling units in the Philadelphia suburbs, is included among these signed purchase agreements. The pipeline of potential water and wastewater municipal acquisitions the company is actively pursuing represents over 400,000 total customers. Sale of Assets As previously announced in 2023, the company completed the sale of its West Virginia natural gas utility assets. The sale enables Essential to prioritize the growth of its water and wastewater utilities in states in which it has scale, while the remaining gas operations will continue to focus on efficient, safe operation and reducing emissions through pipeline replacement. On January 30, 2024, the company completed the previously announced $165 million sale of its three non-utility microgrid and district energy projects in Pittsburgh, including the innovative microgrid at the Pittsburgh International Airport. The company will use the proceeds to finance its capital expenditures and water and wastewater acquisitions in place of external funding from equity and debt issuances. This sale, which allows the company to focus on its core business as a regulated utility, resulted in a one-time gain to be recognized in the first quarter of 2024. Sustainability Guidance and Commitments Reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 from the company’s 2019 baseline Multiyear plan to ensure that finished water does not exceed the federal maximum contaminant level once finalized, of PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA compounds Essential reaffirms its commitment to substantially reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. The company plans to achieve these reductions through extensive gas pipeline replacement, the purchase of renewable energy, accelerated methane leak detection and repair, and various other planned initiatives. Essential continues to be an industry leader regarding water quality with its commitment to test and treat for PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA compounds across all states served by its regulated water segment. The company reaffirms its commitment to providing finished water that will meet the EPA timelines and standards. Guidance Assumptions Essential Utilities does not guarantee future results of any kind. Guidance is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those factors outlined in the “Forward Looking Statements” of this release and the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The earnings per share, infrastructure investment and rate base guidance includes the signed municipal water and wastewater acquisitions for which the company has entered into signed purchase agreements as of the date the guidance was announced but does not include DELCORA or other potential municipal acquisitions from the company’s list of acquisition opportunities that currently represents over 400,000 customer equivalents. The average annual regulated water segment growth guidance reflects the company’s proven acquisition track record of adding nearly 129,000 customers or equivalent dwelling units and over $500 million in rate base since 2015, its current backlog of approximately $380 million of signed pending acquisitions with over 215,000 equivalent customers, and the current acquisition landscape. The company’s guidance includes the expectation that the company will continue to issue equity and debt on an as needed basis to support acquisitions and capital investment plans.

Higher revenue in Q4 2023 and full-year 2023, leading to increased net cash generated from operating activities. Net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA show substantial growth in Q4 2023 and full-year 2023. Skouries project advances as planned, with capital cost estimates revised and production schedule updated. Negative None. Financial Analyst Eldorado Gold Corporation's recent financial and operational results indicate a company that is navigating the complexities of the mining industry with notable success. The reported 7% increase in gold production and the 16% increase in revenue year-over-year are significant metrics that suggest operational efficiency and a favorable market position, especially given the challenging inflationary environment. The reduced cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold reflect a disciplined approach to cost management, which is critical in an industry where production costs can significantly impact margins.The strategic investment by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the project financing for the Skouries project underscore confidence in Eldorado's growth trajectory and its ability to manage large-scale projects. However, the $75 million capital cost increase for the Skouries project, now estimated at $920 million, represents a deviation from initial estimates, which may raise concerns about project execution and cost control moving forward. Investors should monitor progress closely, as cost overruns and schedule delays can affect future profitability and cash flow projections. Mining Sector Analyst Eldorado Gold's operational upgrades, such as the commissioning of new infrastructure at Kisladag and productivity enhancements at Olympias, are indicative of a proactive management approach to asset optimization. The focus on extending mine life and improving production processes can lead to more sustainable operations and potentially enhance the company's long-term reserves profile. The revelation of a 9% increase in the capital cost estimate for the Skouries project, while within a manageable range, does highlight the volatility and risks inherent in large-scale mining projects, particularly in the face of global inflationary pressures affecting labor and material costs.The company's strategic moves, including the closing of significant financing facilities and a bought deal offering, reflect a robust balance sheet and a commitment to funding its growth initiatives. However, the negative free cash flow in 2023 due to substantial investment in growth capital could be a point of caution for stakeholders. The anticipated production schedule adjustment for Skouries, with the first production now expected in Q3 2025, will be an important milestone to assess the project's impact on the company's overall production and financial health. Market Research Analyst The gold mining sector is sensitive to fluctuations in gold prices and Eldorado's ability to secure an average realized gold price per ounce sold above the industry average in 2023 is a testament to their market acumen. The company's strategic hedging activities, such as the zero-cost gold collar contracts, are prudent measures to stabilize cash flows during capital-intensive periods. The record gold production figures in Quebec and Greece reflect not only favorable geological conditions but also successful operational enhancements and productivity improvements.Investors should consider the broader implications of Eldorado's performance within the context of the global gold market and mining industry trends. The increased production and reduced costs per ounce position Eldorado favorably against competitors, but the increased capital expenditure for the Skouries project, global inflationary pressures and potential geopolitical risks associated with mining operations in multiple jurisdictions remain critical factors that could influence the company's stock performance and market valuation. 02/22/2024 - 05:00 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eldorado Gold Corporation, (“Eldorado” or “the Company”) today reports the Company’s financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. For further information please see the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com under the Company’s profile. Q4 2023 and Full-Year Summary Operations Gold production: 143,166 ounces in Q4 2023 reflecting continued improvements across the portfolio. Full year production of 485,139 ounces in 2023 was at the midpoint of the tightened guidance range and an increase of 7% from 2022 production of 453,916 ounces, driven by operational upgrades at Kisladag and increased productivity at Olympias.Gold sales: 144,827 ounces in Q4 2023 at an average realized gold price per ounce sold(1) of $1,999, and 483,978 ounces in 2023 at an average realized gold price per ounce sold of $1,944.Production costs: $137.6 million in Q4 2023, and $478.9 million in 2023, compared to $122.2 million in Q4 2022, and $459.6 million in 2022. The increases are due to higher volumes of production and sales, as well as higher royalty expense.Cash operating costs(1): $716 per ounce sold in Q4 2023 and $743 per ounce sold in 2023, within the lowered guidance range, and a decrease from $741 per ounce sold in Q4 2022 and $788 per ounce sold in 2022. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to higher production and slightly lower unit costs for key consumables, including energy and fuel.All-in sustaining costs(1) (""AISC""): $1,207 per ounce sold in Q4 2023 and $1,220 per ounce sold in 2023, within the tightened guidance range for the year, and lower than $1,246 per ounce sold in Q4 2022 and $1,276 per ounce sold in 2022. Decreases in both periods primarily reflect the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold, partially offset by higher royalties due to higher metal prices. The decrease in the year was also due to lower sustaining capital expenditures.Total capital expenditures: $128.6 million in Q4 2023, and $401.9 million in 2023, including $52.5 million and $153.8 million of growth capital(1) invested at our Skouries project in the respective periods. Growth capital at the operating mines of $121.1 million in 2023 was primarily focused at Kisladag, including waste stripping to support mine life extension, construction of the first phase of the North Heap Leach Pad (""NHLP""), and upgraded higher-capacity conveyors. Sustaining capital at operating mines(1) totaled $121.8 million in 2023, including $72.7 million at Lamaque primarily related to underground development, equipment rebuilds, and expansion of the tailings management facility. Financial Revenue: $306.9 million in Q4 2023 an increase of 25% from revenue of $246.2 million in Q4 2022, and $1,008.5 million in 2023, an increase of 16% from revenue of $872.0 million in 2022, both due to higher average realized gold prices and higher volumes sold.Net cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations: $159.6 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $96.2 million in Q4 2022, and $382.9 million in 2023, an increase from $211.2 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were due to higher revenue, lower unit operating costs, lower income taxes paid, and lower mine standby costs.Cash flow from operating activities, before changes in working capital(2): $138.0 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $85.2 million in Q4 2022 and $411.2 million in 2023, an increase from $239.5 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were primarily due to higher net cash generated from operating activities.Cash, cash equivalents and term deposits: $541.6 million as at December 31, 2023, up from $314.7 million as at December 31, 2022.Net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders from continuing operations: $91.8 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $41.9 million in Q4 2022, and $106.2 million in 2023, an increase from net loss of $49.2 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were primarily due to higher revenue, and lower mine standby costs, write-downs of assets, and income taxes.Adjusted net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA"")(2): $147.2 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $97.1 million in Q4 2022, and $463.3 million in 2023, an increase from $321.5 million in 2022. These increases were driven by higher net earnings, combined with the reversal of unrealized losses on derivative instruments of $24.6 million in Q4 2023 and $9.6 million in 2023, among other adjustments.Adjusted net earnings(2): $49.3 million or $0.24 per share in Q4 2023, an increase from $25.8 million or $0.14 per share in Q4 2022, and $110.7 million or $0.57 per share in 2023, an increase from $10.1 million or $0.05 per share in 2022. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 2023 removes a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment and added back a $24.6 million loss on derivative instruments, among other adjustments. Adjusted net earnings in 2023 removes a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment and added back a one-time deferred tax expense adjustment of $22.6 million related to a retroactive income tax rate increase from 20% to 25% in Turkiye as well as a $29.3 million loss on foreign exchange translation of deferred tax balances, among other things.Free cash flow(2): $29.3 million in Q4 2023, and negative $47.2 million in 2023 due to significant investment in growth capital. Free cash flow excluding capital expenditures at Skouries(2) was $82.0 million in Q4 2023 and $112.6 million in 2023.Project Term Facility Drawdowns: Drawdowns on the Skouries Term Facility as of December 31, 2023 totaled €153.2 million. “Eldorado finished 2023 with its strongest quarter of production, delivering 143,166 ounces of gold,” said George Burns, President and CEO of Eldorado Gold. “Across our four operating mines we produced 485,139 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,220 per ounce, within our guidance range. This was an important year as we delivered 7% production growth, a 6% lower cash cost per ounce and a 4% lower AISC per ounce compared to 2022. We achieved this in a challenging inflationary environment and successfully delivered key initiatives across our operations. Kisladag successfully commissioned the new agglomeration drum and North Heap Leach Pad; Olympias started up its ventilation system and bulk emulsion explosives; Lamaque converted a portion of the Ormaque inferred resources into indicated in preparation for an initial reserve later in 2024. By completing these critical activities we have set up our operations for success to deliver consistent, sustainable results through continued execution.” “In 2023, following the closing of the €680 million project financing facility with two Greek Banks we advanced into full construction on our transformational Skouries project in Greece. In addition, we completed a C$81.5 million strategic investment in Eldorado with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As we advanced on finalizing key contracts in 2023, we remained within the original capital cost estimate from the December 2021 feasibility study. More recent and pending contracts incorporate labor rates and labor hours established through a diligent tendering process that are higher than the feasibility study. This has positioned us to provide an update to the overall capital cost estimate which has increased by 9% to $920 million from $845 million. With the project financing in place and a robust balance sheet we remain fully funded to complete the construction of Skouries. We look forward to bringing online this world class copper-gold asset that will deliver an additional 40% of high-quality gold production growth for our company by 2027.” “I would like to thank our global team for all their contributions during the year. We are well positioned for a strong 2024 and beyond as we continue to benefit from our efforts over the past several years to optimize our asset portfolio. With a solid balance sheet we are well funded to complete construction of Skouries and to advance on continuous improvement projects across our assets. Our focus in 2024 is on safety, productivity and driving efficiencies across our portfolio to generate free cash flow,"" concluded George Burns. Skouries Highlights Capital Estimate and Schedule After finalizing key contracts in 2023, the capital cost estimate remained in line with the December 2021 feasibility study estimate. More recent and pending contracts incorporate labor rates and labor hours established through a diligent tendering process that are higher than the feasibility study. This has resulted in a revised capital estimate of $920 million, an increase of 9% over the original estimate of $845 million. The time invested in diligently negotiating the key project contracts has increased execution confidence with a modest effect on the production schedule. First production of the copper-gold concentrate is now expected in the third quarter of 2025 from prior guidance of mid-2025. As such, the 2025 gold production range has been lowered to between 50,000 to 60,000 ounces from prior guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 ounces. Copper production is expected to be between 15 to 20 million pounds in 2025. A steep ramp up curve is expected over that second half of 2025 and remains on track for commercial production at the end of 2025. We are assessing our plans with the goal of increasing our 2026 gold and copper production profile at Skouries. Between the Skouries project finance facility and our balance sheet the project remains fully funded. Capital spend towards the original estimate of $845 million totalled $52.5 million in Q4 2023, and $153.8 million in 2023. As at December 31, 2023: Overall project progress was 38% complete and 70% complete when including the first phase of construction;Detailed engineering was 61% complete and procurement was 82% complete;Project execution and ramp-up continued for major earthworks including construction of haul roads to support construction of earthworks structures;Mobilized contractor and commenced work on the tailings filtration infrastructure earthworks and pilings;Progress advanced on the foundation construction of the primary crusher; andCompleted the upgrade of the underground power supply from 400V to 690V and the ventilation upgrade. As the project advances in 2024 the capital spend is expected to be between $375 and $425 million. Upcoming milestones in 2024 include: Procurement and Engineering Substantial completion of procurement and engineering Process Plant Commence construction of the control room and electrical room buildingCommence construction of the tailings thickeners Tailings filter facility Awarding the filter facility contractPreassembly of the filter press plates and framesCompletion of the structural steel IEWMF Completion of the coffer dam Underground Awarding the underground development and test stoping contractCompletion of approximately 2,200 metres of underground development Construction Progress Work continues to ramp up on construction for the build of major earth works structures including the haul roads, IEWMF construction, low-grade stockpile, water management, process facilities, crusher and filter buildings. In addition, work will focus on the underground development to support test stope mining in 2025. Mechanical, piping and electrical installations will also progress in all process and infrastructure areas. On the critical path is the filter plant building which continues to advance, with the piling work having commenced. In Q2 2024 it is expected that the filter building contract will be awarded which will include the building structure, assembly of equipment within the building, including air compressors, conveyors, filter presses and other ancillary equipment, in addition to the piping and electrical work. The filter press plates arrived on site in Q1 2024 with the frames for supporting the filter press plates fabricated and expected to ship in Q2 2024. Preassembly is expected to start Q2 2024. Work for the mill/flotation building is in progress with commissioning work on overhead cranes, installation of construction lighting and scaffolding, and the commencement of structural steel work. Mechanical, piping and electrical work for the process plant are mobilizing with work commencing in Q1 2024. By the end of 2024 we expect to have completed the IEWMF coffer dam and significantly advanced the IEWMF earthworks, water management facilities, process plant and filter plants. The first four Company owned Cat 745 trucks have arrived on site with the remaining 15 scheduled for delivery through the end of Q2 2024. These trucks will be used once Skouries is in operation to build the lifts that will be required on the dry stack tailings facility. During construction of the civil works these trucks will be used as part of an integrated fleet with the earthwork's construction contractor for construction of the IEWMF facilities. Underground Development The upgrade of the underground power supply from 400V to 690V has been completed. The ventilation upgrade is also complete, and the new contact water pumping system will be fully operational in 2024. The first phase of underground development continues to advance the West Decline and access to the test stopes with a local contractor. The second underground development contract proposals are in the final evaluation stage and awarding of the contract is planned for Q2 2024. This contract includes the test stope work as well as additional development and services work to support the development of the underground mine. We expect to complete approximately 2,200 metres of underground development by the end of 2024. Engineering At December 31, 2023, engineering has been fully transitioned to Greece and was 61% complete with anticipated substantial completion in Q3 2024. Detailed engineering work continues to advance in all areas. The release of structural steel for fabrication is nearing completion and construction drawings are being issued to support the project schedule. Procurement At December 31, 2023, procurement was at 82% with substantial completion expected in Q2 2024. All long lead items have been procured and focus is now shifting to managing fabrication and deliveries. Operational Readiness Recruitment of qualified and experienced people began in 2023 and will continue through 2024 as we build workforce capability as Skouries advances towards first production. Under the direction of Louw Smith, Eldorado’s EVP, Development in Greece, we are progressing with establishing the Skouries operating team with approximately 40 personnel now on board. This includes 12 in leadership roles, 10 embedded in the construction projects teams of open pit mining, underground mining and dry stack tailings construction; and 9 in sustainability. Recruitment activities are on track with the operational workforce plan. Workforce In addition to the Operational Readiness team as of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 550 personnel on site which is expected to ramp up to 1,300 during 2024. Year in Review: Execution Focus and Delivery Health and Safety: The Company’s lost-time injury frequency rate per million person-hours worked (""LTIFR"") was 0.42 in Q4 2023, which was consistent with the LTIFR of Q4 2022 and overall was 0.65 in 2023, a 45% improvement from the LTIFR of 1.19 in 2022. We continue to take proactive steps to improve workplace safety and to ensure a safe working environment for our employees and contractors.Skouries Project Financing Completed: In April 2023, Eldorado closed on a low-cost strategic €680.4 million project financing facility for the development of the Skouries project in Northern Greece. The facility is structured to provide 80% of the funding required to complete the project. Skouries is on schedule to have first production in Q3 2025 and commercial production by the end of 2025.Strategic Investment by EBRD: In June 2023, Eldorado closed the CDN $81.5 million strategic financing from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (""EBRD""). The funds are being invested in the Skouries project in Northern Greece, and are credited against the Company’s 20% equity funding commitment for the Skouries Project.Bought Deal: In June 2023, the Company completed a bought deal offering for gross proceeds of CDN $135.2 million ($101.1 million). Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to fund growth initiatives across Eldorado's portfolio, as well as for general corporate and working capital purposes.Modified EIA Approval - Kassandra Mines: In April 2023, the modification to the Kassandra Mines Environmental Impact Assessment (""EIA"") was approved by the Ministry of Environment and Energy, allowing the expansion of the Olympias processing facility to 650 ktpa and improvements to the Stratoni port.Gold Collar Contracts: In May 2023, Eldorado entered into a series of zero-cost gold collar contracts in order to manage potential cash flow variability during the Skouries construction period.Record Gold Production in Quebec and Greece: The Lamaque Complex in Quebec delivered record gold production of 177,069 ounces in 2023, driven by increased grade and mill throughput. At the Olympias Mine in Greece, record gold production of 67,133 ounces in 2023 was achieved, a direct result of transformation initiatives implemented at the site including increased ventilation capacity, bulk emulsion, and productivity improvements at the mine and the mill.Enhanced Capacity at Kisladag: In July 2023, stacking commenced on the newly constructed North Heap Leach Pad, with three cells under leach. Additionally, in March 2023, the commissioning of the upgraded materials handling and fine-ore agglomeration circuit was completed. These productivity initiatives drove an increase in throughput and record tonnes placed on the pads and higher irrigation rates.Efemcukuru Met Guidance for the 9th Consecutive Year: Since 2014, Efemcukuru has met annual guidance expectations.Notable awards and recognitions across the business: Recognized by Resourcing Tomorrow with the Project Financing of the Year Award for the Skouries Project Financing Facility.Eldorado placed 1st overall in the Materials sector that includes Mining in the Globe & Mail's 2023 Board Games.

(3) By-product revenues are off-set against cash operating costs.(4) Attributable to shareholders of the Company.(5) Q1-Q3 2022 amounts have been adjusted to record additional depreciation expense upon review of the estimated remaining useful life of the existing heap leach pad and ADR plant at Kisladag (Q1 2022: $1.0 million, Q2 2022: $3.2 million, Q3 2022: $5.1 million, YTD 2022: $9.2 million). (6) A concentrate weight-scale calibration correction at Olympias has resulted in an adjustment to ending inventory as at March 31, 2023 of 1,024 gold ounces. Gold production in Q1 2023 has been reduced by this amount, resulting in additional production costs of $1.3 million and additional depreciation expense of $0.7 million for Q1 2023.(7) Q1-Q3 2023 revenues and production costs have been adjusted to reclassify freight-related concentrate sales pricing adjustments from selling expenses to revenues. The reclassification was $1.5 million for Q1 2023, $0.9 million for Q2 2023, and $0.4 million for Q3 2023, and has no impact on net income. Gold sales in 2023 totaled 483,978 ounces, an increase of 7% from 452,953 ounces in 2022. The higher sales volume in 2023 compared with the prior year primarily reflected an increase of 20,243 ounces sold at Kisladag due to an increase of tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in 2023 and utilization of the newly commissioned NHLP. There was also an increase of 10,402 ounces sold at Olympias due to higher tonnes mined, tonnes processed and average gold grade, and an increase of 3,086 ounces sold at Lamaque due to increased tonnes mined and processed. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 2,706 ounces sold at Efemcukuru due largely to lower average gold grade. Gold sales were 144,827 ounces in Q4 2023, an increase of 9% from 132,462 ounces in Q4 2022, primarily due to increased production at Kisladag and Lamaque in the quarter. The average realized gold price(3) was $1,944 per ounce sold in 2023, an increase from $1,787 per ounce sold in 2022, primarily driven by strong prices in Q3 and Q4 2023. The average realized gold price was $1,999 in Q4 2023 ($1,754 in Q4 2022). Total revenue was $1,008.5 million in 2023, an increase of 16% from revenue of $872.0 million in 2022. The increase was due primarily to both higher sales volumes and average realized gold price. Total revenue was $306.9 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 25% from revenue of $246.2 million in Q4 2022, which increased for the same reasons. Production costs of $478.9 million in 2023 increased from $459.6 million in 2022 and production costs of $137.6 million in Q4 2023 increased from $122.2 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods were the result of higher tonnes processed, resulting in increased labour costs and use of key consumables across most sites. This was partially offset by decreases in unit costs of key consumables such as electricity in Turkiye and Greece, and fuel in Turkiye and Canada, as global cost pressures eased during the year. Additionally, transport costs at Olympias were lower as a result of improved shipment logistics. Production costs include royalty expense, which increased to $51.8 million in 2023 from $40.6 million in 2022, and to $16.5 million in Q4 2023 from $10.2 million in Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher average gold prices combined with higher sales volumes. In Turkiye, royalties are paid on revenue less certain costs associated with ore haulage, mineral processing and related depreciation and are calculated on the basis of a sliding scale according to the average London Metal Exchange gold price during the calendar year. In Greece, royalties are paid on revenue and calculated on a sliding scale tied to international gold and base metal prices and the EUR:USD exchange rate. Cash operating costs(3) averaged $743 per ounce sold in 2023, a decrease from $788 per ounce sold in 2022. In Q4 2023, cash operating costs averaged $716 per ounce sold, a decrease from $741 per ounce sold in Q4 2022. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to higher production and slightly lower unit costs for key consumables, including energy and fuel. AISC per ounce sold(3)decreased slightly to $1,220 in 2023 from $1,276 in 2022, and to $1,207 in Q4 2023 from $1,246 in Q4 2022. Decreases in both periods primarily reflect the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold, partially offset by higher royalties due to higher metal prices. The decrease in the year was also due to lower sustaining capital expenditures. We reported net earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $106.2 million ($0.55 earnings per share) in 2023, compared to net loss of $49.2 million ($0.27 per share) in 2022 and net earnings of $91.8 million ($0.45 per share) in Q4 2023, compared to net earnings of $41.9 million ($0.23 earnings per share) in Q4 2022. Net earnings increased in 2023 primarily due to higher revenue, and lower mine standby costs, write-downs of assets, and income taxes. Net earnings in Q4 2023 reflected higher sales volumes and gold prices, and a higher income tax recovery, compared to Q4 2022. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations(4) were $110.7 million ($0.57 per share) in 2023, compared to $10.1 million ($0.05 per share) in 2022. Adjusted net earnings in 2023 removes a $29.3 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment, $2.0 million gain on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt, $9.6 million unrealized loss on derivative instruments, and a $22.6 million deferred tax expense relating to the impact of tax rate changes in Turkiye. Adjusted net earnings were $49.3 million ($0.24 per share) in Q4 2023 after adjusting for a $3.7 million gain on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment, a $4.0 million gain on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt, and a $24.6 million unrealized loss on derivative instruments. Higher sales volumes in 2023, combined with higher average realized prices, resulted in EBITDA(4) of $442.9 million, including $118.1 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(4) of $463.3 million in 2023 and $147.2 million in Q4 2023 exclude, among other things, share based payments and losses on derivative instruments.

Further details on these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are provided in the MD&A accompanying Eldorado’s financial statements filed from time to time on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com. Kisladag Kisladag produced 154,849 ounces of gold in 2023, a 14% increase from 135,801 ounces in 2022. Gold production of 46,291 ounces in the quarter increased 15% from 40,307 ounces in Q4 2022, benefiting from the newly commissioned NHLP, along with ongoing optimization of on-belt ore agglomeration. Recoverable ounces placed on the combined heap leach pads (North and South) increased from the prior year as a result of the efficient stacking enabled by upgrades of the higher capacity overland conveyors and the commissioning of the NHLP area. Production also benefited from average grade increasing in 2023 to 0.78 grams per tonne, from an average grade of 0.74 grams per tonne in 2022. Revenue increased to $304.8 million in 2023 from $243.3 million in 2022 and increased to $92.9 million from $69.9 million in Q4 2022, reflecting a combination of higher gold sales and higher average realized prices in the current year and quarter. Production costs increased to $122.8 million in 2023 from $120.1 million in 2022 primarily due to increased ore mined and processed and consumption of reagents, as well as higher royalties due to higher average gold prices, partially offset by decreases in unit costs of fuel and electricity as cost pressures in Europe eased in the year as compared to the prior year. Production costs during the quarter increased to $36.1 million from $32.2 million in Q4 2022 also as a result of higher gold production and ounces sold. Depreciation expense increased to $79.9 million in 2023 from $72.6 million in 2022 in line with higher tonnes mined and processed, and higher sales during the year. Depreciation in the quarter was in line with Q4 2022 despite higher sales in the current period due to less stacking on the South Leap leach pad, which depreciates at a faster rate given the shorter remaining useful life in terms of the number of ounces that can be stacked on the pad. Cash operating costs per ounce sold in 2023 decreased to $657 from $773 in 2022 and decreased to $623 in Q4 2023 from $709 in Q4 2022. Decreases in both periods were primarily due to higher gold production and sales, as well as lower unit costs of consumables. AISC per ounce sold decreased to $900 in 2023 from $1,000 in 2022 primarily due to lower cash operating costs per ounce sold, partly offset by higher sustaining capital expenditure. In the quarter, AISC per ounce sold increased to $909 from $884 in Q4 2022 primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cash operating costs per ounce sold. Sustaining capital expenditure of $16.0 million in 2023, including $5.6 million in Q4 2023, primarily related to equipment rebuilds, and processing and infrastructure improvements. Growth capital investment of $83.7 million in 2023, including $27.8 million in Q4 2023, primarily included waste stripping to support the mine life extension, construction of the first phase of the NHLP and related infrastructure, and building relocation due to pit expansion. Lamaque Lamaque produced 177,069 ounces of gold in 2023, a 2% increase from 174,097 ounces in 2022 as a result of slightly higher ore throughput in the year and slightly higher grade. This was despite the mining disruption caused by forest fires earlier in the year that led to reduced mining faces available for ore production in Q3. Gold production of 56,619 ounces in the quarter was higher compared to 51,349 ounces in Q4 2022 and reflected strong throughput that was achieved due to productivity improvements at the mine, which allowed the mill to perform at capacity. Average grade of 7.36 grams per tonne in the quarter was slightly lower compared to Q4 2022, while average grade of 6.76 grams per tonne in 2023 slightly exceeded 6.65 grams per tonne in 2022. Revenue increased to $346.3 million in 2023 from $313.0 million in 2022 primarily reflecting a higher average realized gold price in the year. In the quarter, both a higher average realized gold price and higher sales were responsible for the increase in revenue to $114.9 million from $90.0 million in Q4 2022. Production costs increased to $119.5 million in 2023 from $116.7 million in 2022, and $35.1 million in Q4 2023 from $29.2 million in Q4 2022, both primarily due to higher gold production and increased headcount to enable productivity, partially offset by slightly lower unit costs of key consumables, including fuel and cost savings from a weaker Canadian dollar as compared to the prior year. Cash operating costs per ounce sold was consistent between 2023 and 2022 but increased to $580 in Q4 2023 from $541 in Q4 2022 despite higher ounces sold primarily due to extra costs incurred in labour, contractors, and equipment rentals to increase productivity in the quarter. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,089 in 2023 from $1,036 in 2022 and to $977 in Q4 2023 from $925 in Q4 2022 with increases in both periods reflecting higher cash operating costs per ounce sold and higher sustaining capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditures of $72.7 million in 2023, including $20.7 million in Q4 2023, primarily related to underground development, equipment rebuilds, and expansion of the tailings management facility. Growth capital investments totalled $23.3 million in 2023, including $8.1 million in Q4 2023, and is primarily related to construction of underground infrastructure. Efemcukuru Efemcukuru produced 86,088 payable ounces of gold in 2023, a 2% decrease from 87,685 payable ounces in 2022, reflecting lower grades and recoveries in the year, partially offset by higher throughput. Gold production of 22,374 payable ounces in the quarter was 5% higher than 21,362 payable ounces produced in Q4 2022, primarily as a result of record throughput rates in the fourth quarter, averaging 1,500 tpd combined with higher grades. Revenue increased to $170.5 million in 2023 from $155.3 million in 2022 and to $46.7 million in Q4 2023 from $38.4 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods were driven primarily by higher average realized gold prices. Production costs increased to $80.1 million in 2023 from $73.1 million in 2022 and increased to $21.4 million in Q4 2023 from $17.9 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by rising costs of labour and increased royalties due to higher average realized gold prices. Operating cost increases and lower gold production in the year resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $797 in 2023, from $701 in 2022. Cost increases despite higher gold produced in the quarter resulted in an increase in cash operating cost per ounce sold to $816 in Q4 2023 from $738 in Q4 2022. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,154 in 2023 from $1,091 in 2022 and to $1,201 in Q4 2023 from $1,138 in Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher cash operating costs per ounce sold. Sustaining capital expenditure of $14.0 million in 2023, including $4.4 million in Q4 2023, related primarily to underground development and equipment rebuilds. Growth capital investment included both development drilling and resource conversion drilling at each of the Kokarpinar and Bati vein systems. Olympias Olympias produced 67,133 ounces of gold in 2023, a 19% increase from 56,333 ounces in 2022, reflecting higher average gold grade and higher throughput in the year. Throughput in 2023 was 15% higher than in 2022 due to higher mining rates, a result of key transformation initiatives implemented throughout the year, enabling stronger mining productivity and record mill throughput. Achievements in 2023 included a new electrical substation resulting in increased ventilation capacity, commissioning of bulk emulsion blasting, ongoing training and equipment optimization. Gold production of 17,882 ounces in Q4 2023 increased from 15,435 in Q4 2022 as a result of 13% higher throughput and higher gold grades in the quarter. Lead and silver production increased as well compared to Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher throughput. Revenue increased to $186.8 million in 2023 from $159.9 million in 2022 and increased to $52.4 million in Q4 2023 from $47.9 million in Q4 2022 as a result of higher sales volumes and a higher average realized gold price. From October 1, 2021, revenue has been impacted by the 13% VAT import charge levied on customers importing Olympias gold concentrate into China. When levied, this import charge reduces revenue by a corresponding amount. Revenues in 2023 benefited from lower gold treatment and refining charges as we made more shipments to alternative markets where this 13% import VAT on gold concentrate was not imposed. Approximately 54% of shipments in 2023 were not subject to the 13% import VAT. Production costs increased to $156.5 million in 2023 from $149.5 million in 2022 and to $44.9 million in Q4 2023 from $42.9 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods reflect higher production and volumes of concentrate sold, partially offset by decreases in unit costs of certain consumables, including electricity and fuel, and other cost savings as a result of recent transformation initiatives. Production costs also benefited from lower transport costs as a result of improved shipment logistics onsite. Cash operating costs per ounce sold decreased to $1,133 in 2023 from $1,409 in 2022, primarily as a result of higher ounces sold, higher by-product credits, and less shipments to China incurring the 13% VAT import charge, which is included in cash operating costs. Similarly, cash operating costs per ounce sold decreased to $1,224 in Q4 2023 from $1,325 in Q4 2022 primarily due to higher ounces sold and by-product credits. AISC per ounce sold decreased to $1,688 in 2023 from $2,155 in 2022 and to $1,872 in Q4 2023 from $1,998 in Q4 2022 primarily due to the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold and lower sustaining capital. Sustaining capital expenditure decreased to $19.0 million in 2023 from $30.3 million in 2022 and to $7.2 million in Q4 2023 from $10.5 million in Q4 2022. Spending in both periods primarily included underground development and underground infrastructure improvements. Growth capital investments in 2023 and 2022 primarily related to underground development.

Adjusted net income was $19.4 million. The company eliminated 2024 debt maturity and secured consolidated order intake worth $739 million. 2024 guidance includes expected net income of $125-155 million, EBITDA of $330-380 million, and free cash flow of $110-150 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Oceaneering International's reported net income of $44.5 million, or $0.43 per share, on revenue of $655 million for Q4 2023 indicates a robust performance, particularly when compared to the previous year's figures. The company's ability to eliminate its 2024 debt maturity through strategic transactions is a strong positive signal to investors, suggesting effective financial management and a focus on reducing long-term liabilities. Additionally, the secured order intake of $739 million provides a solid foundation for future revenue streams.However, it's important to scrutinize the adjusted net income which excludes certain one-time benefits and costs. This adjusted figure stands at $19.4 million, or $0.19 per share, which is a more conservative representation of the company's performance. Investors should consider these adjustments when evaluating the company's financial health. The expectation of continued improvement in financial performance and meaningful free cash flow generation for 2024 is promising, but it hinges on the company's ability to maintain or improve its operational efficiency and market position. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in annual revenue by 17% and the fifth consecutive year of improved adjusted EBITDA performance reflect positively on Oceaneering International's market position and operational effectiveness. The Subsea Robotics (SSR) and Manufactured Products segments are highlighted as key drivers of this growth, which points to strong market demand for these services. The company's backlog of $622 million in Manufactured Products suggests sustained demand, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.31 indicating a healthy inflow of new orders relative to revenue recognized.Investors should note the seasonal variability in the company's performance, as indicated by the sequential decline in ROV days on hire, which was partially offset by an increase in drill support days. This variability can impact short-term financial results and should be factored into investment decisions. The forecasted EBITDA for 2024 and the expected increase in free cash flow generation provide a positive outlook for the company's market performance in the upcoming year. Energy Sector Analyst Oceaneering's performance in the energy sector, particularly through its Subsea Robotics and Offshore Projects Group, is indicative of the current state of the oil and gas industry. The 68% Q4 utilization rate for the ROV fleet and the average revenue per day on hire of $9,618 demonstrate a stable demand for subsea operations, which is crucial for maintenance and development in offshore oil fields. The sector's recovery from previous downturns appears to be continuing, which may lead to increased capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and, consequently, more business for Oceaneering.The company's long-term debt reduction from $700 million to $500 million and the extension of the term of its credit facility to April 2027 provide it with a more comfortable liquidity position and the ability to withstand industry volatility. The energy sector's cyclical nature means that Oceaneering's financial flexibility and robust backlog are key to its resilience in the face of fluctuating oil prices and investment levels in the industry. 02/22/2024 - 05:01 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oceaneering International, Inc. (""Oceaneering"") (NYSE:OII) today reported net income of $44.5 million, or $0.43 per share, on revenue of $655 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted net income was $19.4 million, or $0.19 per share, reflecting the impact of $(23.7) million benefit from discrete tax adjustments, primarily due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and prior year estimates; $2.3 million of pre-tax adjustments associated with foreign exchange gains recognized during the quarter; and $0.9 million tax effect on adjustments associated with foreign exchange gains.

Larson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oceaneering, stated, ""2023 consolidated revenue increased 17% over 2022 to $2.4 billion, driving our fifth consecutive year of improved adjusted EBITDA performance. For the full year of 2023, our adjusted EBITDA of $289 million was slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and we generated $109 million of free cash flow. All of our operating segments, except for Integrity Management and Digital Solutions (IMDS), achieved improved sequential annual operating results, led by Subsea Robotics (SSR) and Manufactured Products. I am grateful to our Oceaneers for their dedication and commitment to excellence in delivering these results. ""2023 cash flow from operations increased to $210 million, compared to $121 million in 2022. Capital expenditures also increased, from $81.0 million in 2022 to $101 million in 2023. Free cash flow increased to $109 million, compared to $39.8 million in 2022. Our ability to generate substantial levels of free cash flow over the last several years enabled us to retire our 2024 senior notes during the year, using proceeds from our 2023 debt offering together with cash on hand. As a result, we reduced Oceaneering’s long-term debt from $700 million at the end of 2022 to $500 million at the end of 2023 and extended the term of our credit facility to April 2027. As reflected in the 2024 guidance above, we expect to see continuing improvement in our financial performance and condition, including another year of meaningful free cash flow generation. “Our fourth quarter 2023 performance produced consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $75.1 million, which was above the mid-point of the implied guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter and slightly above consensus estimates."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Segment Results SSR's fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA represented its best quarter in 2023. Sequentially, operating income and revenue improved slightly, with lower activity levels in the ROV and survey businesses being offset by continuing improvement in ROV pricing. As a result, SSR EBITDA margin of 32% during the fourth quarter was above the 31% achieved during the third quarter of 2023. Revenue split was 76% from the ROV business and 24% from the combined tooling and survey businesses. ROV days on hire declined 2% as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Increased drill support days were more than offset by lower vessel-based days due to normal seasonality. Fourth quarter average ROV revenue per day on hire of $9,618 was 3% higher than in the third quarter of 2023. Manufactured Products revenue of $133 million was 8% higher than in the third quarter of 2023 on increased product throughput in Oceaneering Mobile Robotics. Operating income and margin of $5.4 million and 4%, respectively, declined sequentially due to changes in product mix. As recently announced, Manufactured Products had solid bookings during the fourth quarter of approximately $200 million and ended 2023 with a backlog of $622 million, compared to the September 30, 2023 backlog of $556 million. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.31 for the full year of 2023. Offshore Projects Group (OPG) operating income declined sequentially on higher revenue. Revenue benefited from the carryover of international work from the third quarter along with more seasonal activity in the Gulf of Mexico than originally expected. Operating income margin of 9% declined from 18% achieved in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to changes in project mix and pricing for Gulf of Mexico work. IMDS revenue and operating income were essentially flat period over period. Operating income margin of 5% for the fourth quarter was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Aerospace and Defense Technologies (ADTech) fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined from the third quarter of 2023. ADTech operating income margin declined sequentially to 12%, due to changes in project mix. Fourth quarter 2023 Unallocated Expenses of $37.9 million were lower than the third quarter. Full Year and First Quarter 2024 Guidance 2024 financial results are forecasted to improve year over year based on 2023 year-end backlog and continuing supportive market fundamentals. As outlined in the guidance above, EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $330 million to $380 million, with increased EBITDA and operating income from each operating segment, including higher margins in the SSR and OPG segments, and relatively stable margins in the Manufactured Products, IMDS and ADTech segments. At the midpoint of this range, 2024 EBITDA would represent a 23% increase over 2023 adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $110 million to $150 million. For the first quarter 2024, EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to the timing of vessel charters and two vessels undergoing planned, regulatory dry docks during the first quarter, leading to fewer available vessel days in the first quarter for OPG. Conference Call Details Oceaneering has scheduled a conference call and webcast on Friday, February 23, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, as well as more detailed guidance for the full year and first quarter 2024.

We have included Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share, each of which excludes the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. As a result, these amounts are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these are useful measures for investors to review because they provide consistent measures of the underlying results of our ongoing business. Furthermore, our management uses these measures as measures of the performance of our operations. We have also included disclosures of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), EBITDA Margins, 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Estimates, and Free Cash Flow, as well as the following by segment: EBITDA, EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins and related information by segment exclude the effects of certain specified items, as set forth in the tables that follow. EBITDA and EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins, and related information by segment are each non-GAAP financial measures. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow provided by operating activities less organic capital expenditures (i.e., purchases of property and equipment other than those in business acquisitions). We have included these disclosures in this press release because EBITDA, EBITDA Margins and Free Cash Flow are widely used by investors for valuation purposes and for comparing our financial performance with the performance of other companies in our industry, and the adjusted amounts thereof provide more consistent measures than the unadjusted amounts. Furthermore, our management uses these measures for purposes of evaluating our financial performance. Our presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA Margins and Free Cash Flow (and the Adjusted amounts thereof) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as substitutes for our reported operating results, cash flows or any other measure prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. The tables that follow provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
