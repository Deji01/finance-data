The data show consistent and sustained reductions in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) over six months, with a 24-30% reduction achieved. The implant was well-tolerated, with no impact on corneal health observed. The results indicate potential for repeat dosing without stacking of implants. Positive None. Negative None. Ophthalmology Specialist The recent findings from Ocular Therapeutix regarding their PAXTRAVA implant for glaucoma treatment are noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, the reported efficacy in terms of IOP reduction is substantial. A 24-30% decrease is significant, considering that even a 1 mmHg drop in IOP can reduce the risk of glaucoma progression. This level of efficacy could position PAXTRAVA as a strong contender in the market, potentially altering treatment paradigms.Furthermore, the reported safety profile is encouraging. The absence of corneal endothelium impact is particularly important, as corneal health is a major concern in glaucoma management. The fact that the implant is bioresorbable implies a reduced risk of long-term complications associated with non-resorbable implants. If these results are replicated in larger studies, it could lead to a shift in clinician preference towards such implants, impacting the market share of current treatments. Biotech Market Analyst Ocular Therapeutix's positive Phase 2 data could have a favorable impact on their stock valuation. Investors typically respond well to strong clinical trial results, especially when they suggest a product has a competitive edge. The potential for repeat dosing without stacking implants addresses a significant limitation in current glaucoma therapies, which could translate into a unique selling proposition upon commercialization.From an industry perspective, the glaucoma treatment market is quite competitive, with several established players. However, innovation that offers improved safety and efficacy can capture market share quickly. If Ocular Therapeutix can navigate the regulatory pathway efficiently and execute a successful market entry, they could see substantial revenue growth. This would be of particular interest to investors looking for growth opportunities in the biotech sector. Clinical Trials Expert The statistical significance of the IOP reductions at each time point is a strong indicator of PAXTRAVA's potential efficacy. However, it's important to note that the lack of prespecified formal statistical testing could raise questions among regulatory bodies. Future trials will need to address this to ensure robust data that can withstand scrutiny during the FDA approval process.Additionally, the fact that a majority of patients did not require additional IOP-lowering therapy is a testament to the sustained effect of the treatment. This could lead to better patient compliance and outcomes in the long run. The ability to re-dose without stacking is also significant, as it suggests a favorable safety profile over repeated treatments. These factors will be important during the FDA's evaluation of the long-term safety and efficacy of the implant. 04/06/2024 - 10:00 AM Phase 2 data highlight consistent and sustained reductions in Intraocular Pressure (IOP), statistically significant (p<0.0001) through six months, with clinically meaningful reductions of 24-30% achieved with a single PAXTRAVA implant Generally well tolerated with no impact on corneal health observed Consistent durability of IOP reduction and implant bioresorption shows potential for repeat dosing without stacking of implants Expanded Focus on Retinal Disease Highlighted at the April 4th Eyecelerator BEDFORD, Mass., April 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL, “Ocular”, the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to enhancing people’s vision and quality of life through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and other diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced positive Phase 2 data for PAXTRAVA (travoprost intracameral implant or OTX-TIC) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (reported together as “glaucoma”, below) The data are being presented by Mark Gallardo, MD during the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) Annual Meeting. “Ocular is very pleased to report positive six-month topline results for PAXTRAVA in the Phase 2 glaucoma study. We designed the Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate PAXTRAVA over several time points that we believe are clinically meaningful, through six months. Observation of IOP reduction as early as the first follow-up visit, at 2 weeks, and demonstration of a 24-30% reduction in mean IOP through six months, with consistent and sustained reductions at each and every timepoint, are at the core of our enthusiasm for these results. That the majority of eyes (81.3%) treated with PAXTRAVA did not require additional IOP lowering therapy through six months further supports the strength of the data,” said Rabia Gurses Ozden, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Ocular Therapeutix. “As we incorporate these efficacy data, coupled with the expanded safety database, into our evaluation of next steps for the program, we thank all of the patients, caregivers and study sites who participated in this Phase 2 study.” Summary of Data and Findings: Efficacy: PAXTRAVA 26 µg single implant demonstrated consistent IOP control through 6 months: Statistically significant IOP changes from baseline were observed for each and every individual and mean diurnal measurement at Week 2 (M0.5), Week 6 (M1.5), and Week 12 (M3), as well as Months 4.5 and 6 (p<0.0001), although no formal statistical testing was prespecifiedClinically meaningful mean IOP reduction of ~24-30% from baseline observed over six monthsA majority (81.3%) of treated eyes did not require additional IOP-lowering therapy through 6 months indicating sustained and consistent treatment effects Safety: PAXTRAVA 26 µg was generally well-tolerated No impact on corneal endothelium was observed at 6 months following a single administrationMajority of adverse events (AEs) were mild in severity and generally resolved with topical medical treatment. Most ocular AEs within 3 days were deemed related to the injection procedure by the investigators. Post injection AEs observed (>3 days post injection procedure) were consistent with the travoprost label. One implant required removal (classified as a serious adverse event), most likely due to a peri-implantation bacterial infection, per investigatorConsistent bioresorption of the implant coupled with the durable effect seen in the trial suggests redosing would be possible, without the risk of stacking implants “I have dedicated my career to taking care of people with glaucoma and the evaluation of new therapies. I am enthusiastic about PAXTRAVA because of the positive, durable IOP reductions, accompanied by a good overall safety profile,” said Mark Gallardo, MD. Dr. Gallardo is a Study Investigator and Glaucoma Specialist at El Paso Eye Surgeons. He is an active principal investigator of innovative new treatments, having participated in more than 20 clinical trials over the last 7 years. “We were pleased to observe that PAXTRAVA generally stays in place at the site of implantation and maintains its form, that the majority of implants (64.5%) were significantly or fully bioresorbed at six months and that the implants were not observed to impact the surrounding corneal endothelium. Together, these features could address the compliance challenge of daily eyedrops and enable repeat dosing, without the risk of stacking, critical for the treatment of chronic disease. The totality of these features makes me optimistic about this product candidate.” The complete presentation (Travoprost Intracameral Implant for Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension: Results from a Phase 2 Clinical Trial) will be available in the Scientific and Medical presentations section of the Company’s investor website. Phase 2 Study Overview: The PAXTRAVA Phase 2 study was designed as a randomized, parallel-group, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PAXTRAVA in subjects with open-angle glaucoma (“OAG”) or ocular hypertension (“OHT”) and reported together as “glaucoma”, per above. Following a standard medication wash-out, patients were randomized 1:1:1 into one of three dosing groups (5 µg or 26 µg of PAXTRAVA or DURYSTA® (bimatoprost implant)), dosed in ‘the study eye’ and followed for frequent assessments through the six month analysis point. Due to elevations in IOP observed in seven out of the 16 subjects enrolled in the PAXTRAVA 5 μg arm of the trial, the Company closed enrollment in this arm and continued with the PAXTRAVA 26 μg and DURYSTA arms of the trial. Safety and efficacy data presented at ASCRS and reported in this press release are based on the 26 µg dosing group, as a result. The enrolled subjects had a mean age of 65 years and had been previously treated with a mean of about 1.2 IOP-lowering agents prior to study entry. The treatment groups were well balanced for key demographics and baseline characteristics. The primary efficacy endpoints included measurement of changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) at three diurnal measurements (8 AM, 10AM and 4 PM) at weeks 2, 6, 12 and secondary endpoints included measurements at all other visits including 4.5 and 6 months. No formal statistical testing was prespecified in the clinical trial protocol or the statistical analysis plan. Other assessments included an evaluation of the need for additional IOP-lowering therapy, changes in endothelial count and central corneal thickness, as well as an evaluation of safety for the period. Summary of next steps: Seek an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to finalize development plans for PAXTRAVA Phase 3 trials and move to a next generation, commercial injector that eases initiation of therapy. Strategic Focus on Retinal Disease Highlighted at the April 4th Eyecelerator@ASCRS Conference On Thursday, April 4th, Pravin Dugel, MD, Executive Chairman of Ocular Therapeutix presented at the Eyecelerator@ASCRS conference. “Ocular was very pleased to connect with the Eyecelerator community to share more about our strategic vision for Ocular as we transition to a retina-focused company”, said Dr. Dugel. “There are three important pillars related to our Phase 3 program for AXPAXLI™ for wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD) that support our transformation to a leading retina company: promising clinical data, de-risking regulatory pathway, and an expansive market opportunity.

The data highlighted the significant impact of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA in reducing MACE and lowering cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline LDL-C levels. The Lp(a) analysis results were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), reinforcing the positive outcomes of the study. Positive None. Negative None. Cardiologist The recent presentations on VASCEPA/VAZKEPA's effectiveness in various patient subgroups based on Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and LDL-C levels offer a nuanced perspective on cardiovascular risk management. Specifically, Lp(a) is a lipid marker that has been associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and LDL-C is a well-known target for lipid-lowering therapies. The data suggesting that VASCEPA/VAZKEPA can reduce Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) irrespective of these baseline levels may influence clinical practice, potentially leading to broader prescribing patterns.In terms of patient impact, individuals with high Lp(a) levels have limited therapeutic options and this new evidence could guide treatment decisions. However, it's important to consider the cost-effectiveness of such therapies, as well as the need for long-term studies to confirm sustained benefits and safety profiles. Healthcare Financial Analyst The findings presented have the potential to affect Amarin Corporation's market performance, considering the expanded utility of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA could lead to increased sales. A broader indication for use based on these findings could result in a larger target patient population. Investors will be interested in the market size expansion and the drug's competitive positioning against other lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, the publication in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) adds a layer of credibility to the findings, which may positively influence investor sentiment.However, it is critical to scrutinize the company's ability to capitalize on these results, taking into account regulatory hurdles, marketing strategies and payer negotiations. Long-term, the impact on the company's revenue growth and profitability will depend on the adoption rate among healthcare providers and the drug's inclusion in treatment guidelines. Pharmaceutical Market Research Analyst With the release of these findings, there is a potential shift in the competitive landscape for cardiovascular disease treatments. The ability of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA to lower the risk of cardiovascular events across different Lp(a) and LDL-C baseline levels could position it as a preferred option in lipid management. Market research will need to assess physician awareness and perceptions of these new findings, as well as patient advocacy and awareness efforts that could drive demand.Furthermore, the impact on insurance coverage and reimbursement policies will be a key factor in determining the drug's accessibility to patients. Payer acceptance, influenced by the strength of clinical evidence and cost-benefit analyses, will ultimately affect market penetration. Tracking prescription trends post-publication will provide insights into the real-world implications of these study results. 04/06/2024 - 03:30 PM -- Findings Presented on VASCEPA/VAZKEPA Utility in REDUCE-IT Patient Subgroups by Baseline High/Low Lp(a), LDL-C Levels -- -- Lp(a) Results Published Simultaneously in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) – DUBLIN, Ireland and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., April 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) today highlighted two data presentations at ACC.24 describing the effects of VASCEPA®/VAZKEPA® (icosapent ethyl) on reducing MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) in patients with baseline high or low Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, as well as reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients irrespective of baseline LDL-C level. The REDUCE-IT analysis results relating Lp(a) concentrations with CV risk were also published online today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). “These new findings provide additional important evidence about the clinical utility of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA and further demonstrate its value in reducing cardiovascular events in at-risk patients in key subgroups,” said Nabil Abadir, MB. CH.B., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs, Amarin. “At Amarin, we’re focused on the continuous generation of science to further advance the medical community’s understanding of the role and value of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA in reducing cardiovascular events in at-risk patients globally, and we are proud to add to the body of research that further demonstrates our commitment to value creation.” The subgroup analyses and their key findings are outlined below: Icosapent Ethyl Reduces MACE in Patients with Elevated Triglycerides and High or Low Lipoprotein(a) Concentrations: A REDUCE-IT Subanalysis High Lp(a) concentrations are associated with increased CV event risk, even when LDL-C levels are well-managed. There are no treatments currently approved to reduce residual CV risk on top of contemporary medical therapy in patients with high Lp(a) levels. In this post hoc analysis of REDUCE-IT, the relationship between continuous baseline Lp(a) concentration and risk of MACE was analyzed in models that also accounted for baseline LDL-C, baseline triglycerides (TG), and double-blind treatment. REDUCE-IT participants were randomized to receive either 2g twice daily of icosapent ethyl (IPE) or matching placebo and followed for a median 4.9 years. In this subanalysis, there were 7,026 REDUCE-IT patients with baseline Lp(a) data and a median Lp(a) value of 11.6 (Q1-Q3: 5.0-37.4) mg/dL. Results showed that baseline Lp(a) had a strong and significant relationship with MACE irrespective of baseline LDL-C, baseline TGs, and treatment assignment, and that the benefit of IPE was consistent across Lp(a) concentrations. Importantly, the treatment benefit of IPE was evident across subgroups with both high (≥50 mg/dL) and low (<50 mg/dL) Lp(a) concentrations. Specifically, for first MACE, the relative IPE treatment effects for Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL and <50 mg/dL were HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.64-0.97; P=0.0248) and HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.84; P<0.0001), respectively. Absolute risk reductions at 5 years with IPE were 6.5% and 5.7% for Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL and <50 mg/dL, respectively.1 Limitations include that participants in REDUCE-IT were not selected on the basis of their baseline Lp(a) concentration and that not all REDUCE-IT patients had available baseline Lp(a) data. “In this analysis, IPE showed a clear clinical benefit for patients with both high and low Lp(a) levels. IPE provided a relative risk reduction of 21% among patients with an Lp(a) level of ≥50 mg/dL and 25% for those patients with an Lp(a) level of <50 mg/dL,” said Dr. Michael Szarek, professor, Division of Cardiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine and a faculty member at CPC Clinical Research. “These findings are important, as high baseline Lp(a) concentrations are a predictor for MACE, and this analysis reinforces IPE’s clinical benefit in these at-risk patient sub-populations.” The analysis and its findings were published simultaneously online in JACC. Efficacy of Icosapent Ethyl for Reducing Cardiovascular Outcomes by Baseline Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Level Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established major CV risk factor supported by clinical evidence showing decreased atherosclerotic disease events when LDL-C is therapeutically lowered. Recent international guidelines recommend lowering LDL-C to <55 mg/dL in those patients who are at very high risk for a future CV event. In this post hoc analysis, investigators explored REDUCE-IT data to determine if IPE reduces CV outcomes among high-risk CV patients irrespective of baseline LDL-C. Patients were stratified by LDL-C <55 vs ≥55 mg/dL. The primary outcome was a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. Among statin-treated REDUCE-IT patients with baseline LDL-C data, 1,058 (12.9%) had LDL-C <55 mg/dL and 7,117 (87.1 %) had LDL-C ≥55 mg/dL. The primary outcome rate among patients with LDL-C <55 mg/dL was 16.2% in the IPE group and 22.8% in the placebo group, HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.50-0.87; P=0.003). Findings were consistent in the LDL-C ≥55 mg/dL subgroup, with rates of 17.4% in the IPE group and 21.9% in the placebo group, HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.85; P<0.0001). No significant interaction by baseline LDL-C was observed. Limitations are that randomization was not stratified by baseline LDL-C, however, baseline characteristics were similar among the two baseline LDL-C subgroups. REDUCE-IT patients were on statin therapy, but with low rates or unavailability of other lipid therapies such as ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapies. “As we know, LDL-C is a well-established major CV risk factor. These data are important and show that among adults with increased CV risk and elevated TGs, icosapent ethyl clearly reduced the rate of CV outcomes irrespective of baseline LDL-C, including in those with very well controlled LDL-C <55 mg/dL,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA, Director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital. All analyses highlighted above were funded by Amarin. Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt served as the principal investigator for REDUCE-IT and his institution received research funding from Amarin. About AmarinAmarin is an innovative pharmaceutical company leading a new paradigm in cardiovascular disease management. We are committed to increasing the scientific understanding of the cardiovascular risk that persists beyond traditional therapies and advancing the treatment of that risk for patients worldwide. Amarin has offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey in the United States, Dublin in Ireland, Zug in Switzerland, and other countries in Europe as well as commercial partners and suppliers around the world. About REDUCE-IT® REDUCE-IT was a global cardiovascular outcomes study designed to evaluate the effect of VASCEPA in adult patients with LDL-C controlled to between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline 75 mg/dL) by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or diabetes mellitus and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (primary prevention cohort). REDUCE-IT, conducted over seven years and completed in 2018, followed 8,179 patients at over 400 clinical sites in 11 countries with the largest number of sites located within the United States. REDUCE-IT was conducted based on a special protocol assessment agreement with FDA. The design of the REDUCE-IT study was published in March 2017 in Clinical Cardiology.2 The primary results of REDUCE-IT were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2018.3 The total events results of REDUCE-IT were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in March 2019.4 These and other publications can be found in the R&D section on the company’s website at www.amarincorp.com. About Cardiovascular Risk Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the world. In the United States alone, cardiovascular disease results in 859,000 deaths per year.5 And the number of deaths in the United States attributed to cardiovascular disease continues to rise. In addition, in the United States there are 605,000 new and 200,000 recurrent heart attacks per year (approximately 1 every 40 seconds). Stroke rates are 795,000 per year (approximately 1 every 40 seconds), accounting for 1 of every 19 U.S. deaths. In aggregate, in the United States alone, there are more than 2.4 million major adverse cardiovascular events per year from cardiovascular disease or, on average, 1 every 13 seconds. Controlling bad cholesterol, also known as LDL-C, is one way to reduce a patient’s risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke or death. However, even with the achievement of target LDL-C levels, millions of patients still have significant and persistent risk of cardiovascular events, especially those patients with elevated triglycerides. Statin therapy has been shown to control LDL-C, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by 25-35%.6 Significant cardiovascular risk remains after statin therapy. People with elevated triglycerides have 35% more cardiovascular events compared to people with normal (in range) triglycerides taking statins.7,8,9 About VASCEPA®/VAZKEPA® (icosapent ethyl) CapsulesVASCEPA (icosapent ethyl) capsules are the first prescription treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comprised solely of the active ingredient, icosapent ethyl (IPE), a unique form of eicosapentaenoic acid. VASCEPA was launched in the United States in January 2020 as the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of the studied high-risk patients with persistent cardiovascular risk despite being on statin therapy. VASCEPA was initially launched in the United States in 2013 based on the drug’s initial FDA approved indication for use as an adjunct therapy to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Since launch, VASCEPA has been prescribed more than twenty million times. VASCEPA is covered by most major medical insurance plans. In addition to the United States, VASCEPA is approved and sold in Canada, China, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. In Europe, in March 2021 marketing authorization was granted to icosapent ethyl in the European Union for the reduction of risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk, under the brand name VAZKEPA. In April 2021 marketing authorization for VAZKEPA (icosapent ethyl) was granted in Great Britain (applying to England, Scotland and Wales). VAZKEPA (icosapent ethyl) is currently approved and sold in Europe in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, the UK, Spain and the Netherlands. United StatesIndications and Limitation of UseVASCEPA is indicated: As an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adult patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and established cardiovascular disease ordiabetes mellitus and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. As an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. The effect of VASCEPA on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined. Important Safety Information VASCEPA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to VASCEPA or any of its components.VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (3% vs 2%) of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at an increased risk of an allergic reaction to VASCEPA. Patients with such allergies should discontinue VASCEPA if any reactions occur.VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (12% vs 10%) of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin.Common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% more frequent than placebo): musculoskeletal pain (4% vs 3%), peripheral edema (7% vs 5%), constipation (5% vs 4%), gout (4% vs 3%), and atrial fibrillation (5% vs 4%).Common adverse reactions in the hypertriglyceridemia trials (incidence >1% more frequent than placebo): arthralgia (2% vs 1%) and oropharyngeal pain (1% vs 0.3%).Adverse events may be reported by calling 1-855-VASCEPA or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.Patients receiving VASCEPA and concomitant anticoagulants and/or anti-platelet agents should be monitored for bleeding.

More than 75% of participants showed significant improvement in symptoms over 52 weeks, with promising safety and tolerability profiles. Positive More than 75% of participants achieved >30% improvement in symptoms from baseline KarXT showed significant improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia across all efficacy measures at 52 weeks Patients previously on placebo in acute trials experienced significant reduction of symptoms beginning at week two KarXT demonstrated favorable impact on weight and long-term metabolic profile over 52 weeks KarXT was generally well tolerated with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The interim results from the Phase 3 EMERGENT-4 trial for KarXT bring promising news for the treatment of schizophrenia, a chronic mental health disorder. The data indicating that over 75% of participants achieved more than 30% improvement in their symptoms as measured by the PANSS total score is a significant clinical milestone. This is particularly noteworthy as the PANSS is a widely recognized tool for measuring the severity and improvement of schizophrenia symptoms, including positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, negative symptoms such as lack of emotion and general psychopathology.The continuation of symptom improvement over a 52-week period suggests that KarXT could offer a sustainable long-term benefit, which is a critical factor in the management of schizophrenia, as many antipsychotics lose efficacy or are not tolerated over longer periods. The observed stability or improvements in metabolic parameters are also key, given the well-documented metabolic side effects associated with many antipsychotic drugs, which can lead to additional health complications like diabetes and heart disease. The favorable metabolic profile of KarXT could thus position it as a preferable option for long-term management, potentially influencing prescribing practices and market share within the antipsychotic drug segment. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of the EMERGENT-4 trial results for KarXT are multifaceted. For healthcare systems, the prospect of a new treatment that is both efficacious and well-tolerated over the long term could mean fewer hospitalizations, reduced need for adjunctive therapies and potentially lower overall treatment costs for schizophrenia. A treatment that does not exacerbate metabolic issues could also decrease the long-term burden on healthcare resources by mitigating the risk of secondary conditions that are costly to treat.From a payer perspective, a medication that improves patient outcomes while reducing the incidence of side effects could lead to shifts in formulary placements and insurance coverage decisions. This could enhance market access for KarXT and increase its adoption. However, the cost of the drug, the reimbursement landscape and the competitive market dynamics will ultimately influence its economic impact. The long-term data could also be leveraged in value-based contracting, where reimbursement is tied to patient outcomes, offering an innovative approach to pricing and reimbursement negotiations. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement regarding KarXT's performance in the EMERGENT-4 trial is likely to have a positive impact on the market perception of Bristol Myers Squibb, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock valuation. The clinical success of KarXT in a long-term study not only strengthens the product's profile but also enhances the company's reputation in the neuroscience field. The market for antipsychotic drugs is competitive and a new entrant that demonstrates sustained efficacy and safety over a year-long period could disrupt the current market dynamics.Investors will be particularly interested in the potential market size for KarXT, the scalability of its production and the strategic plans for its commercialization. Additionally, the anticipation of further conversations with the FDA suggests a trajectory towards potential approval, which is a critical milestone for any pharmaceutical product. The stock market often reacts positively to such progressive clinical developments, especially when they address a substantial unmet medical need, as is the case with long-term management of schizophrenia. 04/06/2024 - 01:15 PM Long-term treatment with KarXT was associated with continued improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia across all efficacy measures at 52 weeks More than 75% of participants achieved >30% improvement in symptoms from baseline, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, at one year Participants previously on placebo in acute trials experienced significant reduction of symptoms beginning at week two and maintained throughout treatment PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced new interim results from the Phase 3 EMERGENT-4 open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) in adults with schizophrenia. Long-term efficacy data from the trial were presented in a poster titled, “Maintenance of Efficacy of KarXT (Xanomeline and Trospium) in Schizophrenia” (Poster F264) at the Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) being held April 3-7, 2024, in Florence, Italy. “We are pleased to see a continued and consistent meaningful reduction in symptoms of schizophrenia across 52-weeks in an outpatient setting, beyond what was seen in the short-term, in-patient five-week trials (EMERGENT-2 and EMERGENT-3),” said Roland Chen, MD, senior vice president and head, Immunology, Cardiovascular and Neuroscience development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We look forward to continued conversations with the FDA and to sharing additional data from the EMERGENT program later this year.” EMERGENT-4 is a Phase 3, 52-week, outpatient, open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who previously completed the treatment period of one of the Phase 3, five-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies, EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. At the time of the data cutoff of April 17, 2023, 110 patients were part of the interim efficacy analysis, with 29 patients having completed 52 weeks of treatment. In the interim analysis, KarXT was associated with significant improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia across all efficacy measures at 52 weeks. At the end of the open-label extension, more than 75% of participants achieved >30% improvement in symptoms, with an average reduction of 33.3-points from baseline (98.4), as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. In addition, participants had a mean 1.7-point change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from baseline (5.2), representing an average shift from ‘markedly ill’ at baseline to ‘moderately’ or ‘mildly’ ill at one year. Improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia continued throughout the 52-week trial regardless of whether participants were previously treated with KarXT or placebo during the acute trials. Prior to enrolling in the open-label extension, participants who previously received placebo in EMERGENT-2 and EMERGENT-3 had a significantly higher mean PANSS total score compared to those who received KarXT (placebo 86.5 vs. KarXT 76.1). When dosed with KarXT, the patients previously on placebo had significant improvements in symptoms within two weeks of treatment with KarXT. After four weeks, PANSS total scores were comparable between those who received KarXT or placebo in the acute trials. “These interim data from EMERGENT-4 continue to validate the potential of KarXT in the long-term management of schizophrenia, with continued benefit across 52 weeks of treatment,” said Elan Cohen, Ph.D., principal investigator, CenExel Hassman Research Institute and investigator in the EMERGENT program. “The consistency of efficacy results across all EMERGENT clinical trial programs is encouraging and suggest KarXT could provide a differentiated treatment approach for people living with schizophrenia.” In additional data presented at the congress, KarXT demonstrated a favorable impact on weight and long-term metabolic profile where most patients experienced stability or improvements on metabolic parameters over 52 weeks of treatment. In long-term trials, KarXT was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials of KarXT in schizophrenia. KarXT was not associated with significant changes related to prolactin or clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scale scores over 52 weeks (Oral Session: New Pharmacological Treatments and Assessments and Poster F74). About KarXT KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) is an investigational muscarinic antipsychotic in development for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis related to Alzheimer’s disease. Through its novel mechanism of action, KarXT acts as a dual M1/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in the central nervous system, which is thought to improve positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Unlike existing treatments, KarXT does not directly block dopamine receptors, representing a potential new approach to treating schizophrenia. About Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a persistent and often disabling mental illness impacting how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and affects nearly 24 million people worldwide, including 2.8 million people in the U.S. It is characterized by three symptom domains: positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (difficulty enjoying life and withdrawal from others), and cognitive impairment (deficits in memory, concentration, and decision-making). In part due to limitations with current treatments, people living with schizophrenia often struggle to maintain employment, live independently, and manage relationships. While current treatments can be effective in managing select symptoms, approximately 30% of people do not respond to therapy, with an additional 50% experiencing only a partial improvement in symptoms or unacceptable side effects.

The data from the Phase 3 RISE trial reinforces the efficacy and safety profile of UZEDY, supporting its FDA approval. Qualitative data from the ADVANCE surveys highlight regional differences in LAI utilization rates and patient perceptions of LAIs in schizophrenia. The presentation also includes data on other pharmaceutical products like AUSTEDO XR and TV-44749, providing a comprehensive overview of Teva's research efforts. UZEDY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, with a warning about increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. TV-44749 is an investigational product with no regulatory approval for any use, and its safety and efficacy are not established. Negative None. Pharmacology Expert Understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antipsychotic medications is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes in schizophrenia. The population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling data presented for UZEDY (risperidone) indicates a thoughtful approach to addressing the complexities of medication transitions. The data suggests that healthcare providers could switch patients from a biweekly intramuscular LAI formulation to a monthly or bimonthly subcutaneous dose with comparable PK exposures. This is significant because it may lead to improved adherence due to less frequent dosing and potentially reduce the burden on patients and healthcare systems.Furthermore, the clinical benefit and risk profile, assessed by the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH), provides a quantitative method for evaluating the efficacy and safety of UZEDY. These metrics are important in clinical decision-making, as they translate clinical trial results into practical, understandable terms for healthcare providers. A lower NNT value indicates a more effective treatment, while a lower NNH suggests fewer adverse effects, which could make UZEDY a competitive option in the market for long-acting antipsychotics. Healthcare Market Analyst The presentation of these studies at a major congress like the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) is strategic for Teva Pharmaceuticals, as it highlights the company's commitment to innovation in schizophrenia treatment. The emphasis on UZEDY's efficacy and safety profile, along with its dosing flexibility, could position it favorably among healthcare providers and patients, potentially leading to increased market share in the antipsychotic segment.The real-world insights from the ADVANCE survey study are also noteworthy. Understanding regional differences in LAI utilization and the factors influencing these differences can inform marketing strategies and educational programs. Addressing these factors could improve the adoption of LAIs like UZEDY, which in turn may impact Teva's business performance positively. It is also indicative of a growing trend in the pharmaceutical industry to incorporate real-world evidence to complement clinical trial data. Psychiatric Care Specialist The qualitative data from the ADVANCE surveys provide a glimpse into the challenges faced by patients and caregivers regarding the use of long-acting injectables (LAIs) in schizophrenia. Early experiences and perceptions can significantly influence treatment acceptance and adherence, which are critical factors for successful long-term management of schizophrenia. Tailoring patient education and support services to address these concerns is an essential component of comprehensive care.Moreover, the potential for UZEDY to reduce relapse and hospitalization rates is of particular interest to psychiatric care. Schizophrenia requires a long-term treatment approach and treatments that can offer both efficacy and convenience may lead to better patient outcomes. The flexibility of UZEDY's dosing regimen could be a deciding factor for many patients who are seeking less frequent medication administration without compromising the control of their symptoms. 04/06/2024 - 01:00 PM PK modeling data provide insights into potential dosing conversions and strategies for switching to UZEDY from a long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation of risperidone microspheres (R064766) Additional UZEDY data include a new analysis from the Phase 3 RISE trial reinforcing its efficacy and safety profile in adults with schizophrenia ADVANCE, a global survey study, will also provide real-world findings on LAI utilization from healthcare professionals, caregivers and patients TEL AVIV, Israel & PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teva Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA), today announced the presentation of eight studies from its LAI schizophrenia research program, including data evaluating UZEDY, an extended-release injectable suspension of risperidone for subcutaneous use every one or two months for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The data were presented at the 2024 Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) taking place from April 3-7, 2024 in Florence, Italy. “As part of Teva’s commitment to advancing treatment innovation for schizophrenia patients, this research provides clinical insights into how healthcare providers may switch appropriate patients to UZEDY, a subcutaneous risperidone LAI option with flexible dosing,” said Eric Hughes, MD, Ph.D, Executive Vice President of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva. “Schizophrenia is a complex mental health condition where the treatment needs and preferences of those living with it may evolve over time. These data collectively demonstrate the efficacy and safety profile of UZEDY – reinforcing its potential as a treatment option that may help lower rates of relapse and hospitalization.” Presented data include population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling to investigate dosing conversion strategies for switching patients to a once-monthly or once every two-months subcutaneous dose of UZEDY from a biweekly intramuscular LAI formulation of risperidone microspheres (R064766). The analysis aims to address the knowledge gap as limited clinical data currently exist on optimal strategies for switching between the various available LAI treatment options, which have differing pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In the PopPK analysis, patient model simulations showed that switching to UZEDY at 4-6 weeks after the last dose of R064766 provided comparable PK exposures by the second dose. Specifically, switching patients to UZEDY 5 weeks after the last dose of R064766 achieved PK exposures similar to those achieved with R064766 at a steady state. The optimal switching strategy should be determined by clinicians on an individual basis, considering factors such as patient preference, scheduling convenience, and potential tolerability issues or risk of symptom breakthrough. Additional key data being presented at the SIRS Annual Meeting include: New data from RISE (Risperidone Subcutaneous Extended-Release Study), the Phase 3 pivotal trial that supported the FDA approval of UZEDY. An analysis estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH), clinically relevant measures that help provide healthcare providers with an understanding of the benefits and risks of UZEDY and inform clinical decision-making. Qualitative data from two ADVANCE (Attitudes Driving Regional Differences in LAI Antipsychotic Utilization for Schizophrenia Among Healthcare Professionals, Patients, and Caregivers) surveys: In the healthcare provider survey, ten psychiatrists (spending an average of 45% of their time at hospital-based outpatient clinics) and seven psychiatric nurses (averaging 47% of time at community mental health centers) were interviewed. Findings suggest that regional differences in LAI utilization rates are likely influenced by a combination of factors, including systemic, HCP, and patient factors. In the patient survey, approximately 20 patients and 19 caregivers completed a 60-minute interview regarding the use of LAIs in schizophrenia. Unfavorable early experiences, especially in the inpatient setting, can negatively impact patients’ perception of and willingness to accept LAIs. The survey findings offer further key insights into addressing global adherence and inconsistent utilization challenges with LAIs. Below is the full set of data presented by Teva at SIRS 2024.

WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. UZEDY is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis and has not been studied in this patient population. See below for additional Important Safety Information. TV-44749 (olanzapine) is an investigational extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use and its safety and efficacy are not established. About Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a chronic, progressive and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks, feels and acts.1 Patients experience an array of symptoms, which may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior and impaired cognitive ability.1,2,3 Approximately 1% of the world’s population will develop schizophrenia in their lifetime, and 3.5 million people in the U.S. are currently diagnosed with the condition.2,3 Although schizophrenia can occur at any age, the average age of onset tends to be in the late teens to the early 20s for men, and the late 20s to early 30s for women.3 The long-term course of schizophrenia is marked by episodes of partial or full remission broken by relapses that often occur in the context of psychiatric emergency and require hospitalization.3 Approximately 80% of patients experience multiple relapses over the first five years of treatment, and each relapse carries a biological risk of loss of function, treatment refractoriness, and changes in brain morphology.4,5,6 Patients are often unaware of their illness and its consequences, contributing to treatment nonadherence, high discontinuation rates, and ultimately, significant direct and indirect healthcare costs from subsequent relapses and hospitalizations.1,2,3,4,5,6 About UZEDY UZEDY (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In clinical trials, UZEDY significantly reduced the risk of schizophrenia relapse.7,8 UZEDY administers risperidone through copolymer technology under license from MedinCell that allows for absorption and sustained release after subcutaneous injection. UZEDY is the only long-acting, subcutaneous formulation of risperidone available in both one- and two-month dosing intervals.7 For full prescribing information, visit https://www.uzedy.com/globalassets/uzedy/prescribing-information.pdf. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTINUED CONTRAINDICATIONS: UZEDY is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to risperidone, its metabolite, paliperidone, or to any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, have been reported in patients treated with risperidone or paliperidone. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions: In trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in patients treated with oral risperidone compared to placebo. UZEDY is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): NMS, a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue UZEDY and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring. Tardive Dyskinesia (TD): TD, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause TD is unknown. The risk of developing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop, after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation. TD may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient treated with UZEDY, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with UZEDY despite the presence of the syndrome. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (DM), in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone. Patients with an established diagnosis of DM who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including UZEDY, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for DM (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including UZEDY, should undergo fasting blood glucose (FBG) testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including UZEDY, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including UZEDY, should undergo FBG testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic, including risperidone, was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of risperidone. Dyslipidemia has been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Monitoring weight is recommended. Hyperprolactinemia: As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents. Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: UZEDY may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope. UZEDY should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension and in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of oral risperidone and antihypertensive medication. Falls: Antipsychotics, including UZEDY, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of risperidone. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotic agents, including risperidone. In patients with a pre-existing history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of UZEDY at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue UZEDY in patients with ANC < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC until recovery. Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: UZEDY, like other antipsychotics, may cause somnolence and has the potential to impair judgement, thinking, and motor skills. Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with oral risperidone treatment. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that treatment with UZEDY does not affect them adversely. Seizures: During premarketing studies of oral risperidone in adult patients with schizophrenia, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients (9 out of 2,607 patients), two in association with hyponatremia. Use UZEDY cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Dysphagia: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Antipsychotic drugs, including UZEDY, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration. Priapism has been reported during postmarketing surveillance for other risperidone products. A case of priapism was reported in premarket studies of UZEDY. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. Body temperature regulation. Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral risperidone use. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use UZEDY with caution in patients who experience these conditions. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions with risperidone (≥5% and greater than placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and pharyngolaryngeal pain. The most common injection site reactions with UZEDY (≥5% and greater than placebo) were pruritus and nodule. DRUG INTERACTIONS Carbamazepine and other strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease plasma concentrations of risperidone. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and other strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increase risperidone plasma concentration. Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of centrally-acting drugs, including alcohol, may increase nervous system disorders. UZEDY may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential. UZEDY may antagonize the pharmacologic effects of dopamine agonists. Concomitant use with methylphenidate, when there is change in dosage of either medication, may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause EPS and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including UZEDY, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or online at http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinicaland-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Lactation: Infants exposed to risperidone through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and EPS. Fertility: UZEDY may cause a reversible reduction in fertility in females. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of UZEDY have not been established in pediatric patients. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Carefully titrate on oral risperidone up to at least 2 mg daily before initiating treatment with UZEDY. Patients with Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies can experience increased sensitivity to UZEDY. Manifestations and features are consistent with NMS. Please see the full Prescribing Information for UZEDY, including Boxed WARNING. About AUSTEDO® XR Extended-Release Tablets and AUSTEDO® Tablets AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are the first vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in adults for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. AUSTEDO XR is the once-daily formulation of AUSTEDO. INDICATIONS AND USAGE AUSTEDO® XR (deutetrabenazine) extended-release tablets and AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine) tablets are indicated in adults for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Depression and Suicidality in Patients with Huntington’s Disease: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington’s disease. Balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Inform patients, their caregivers, and families of the risk of depression and suicidality and instruct them to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Exercise caution when treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients who are suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression. Contraindications: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients with Huntington’s disease who are suicidal, or have untreated or inadequately treated depression. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are also contraindicated in: patients with hepatic impairment; patients taking reserpine or within 20 days of discontinuing reserpine; patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing MAOI therapy; and patients taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine. Clinical Worsening and Adverse Events in Patients with Huntington’s Disease: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects. QTc Prolongation: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may prolong the QT interval, but the degree of QT prolongation is not clinically significant when AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is administered within the recommended dosage range. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex reported in association with drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission, has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine. The risk may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. The management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO; intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems. Akathisia, Agitation, and Restlessness: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and restlessness. The risk of akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. If a patient develops akathisia, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. Parkinsonism: AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause parkinsonism in patients with Huntington’s disease or tardive dyskinesia. Parkinsonism has also been observed with other VMAT2 inhibitors. The risk of parkinsonism may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. If a patient develops parkinsonism, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. Sedation and Somnolence: Sedation is a common dose-limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO and know how the drug affects them. Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence. Hyperprolactinemia: Tetrabenazine elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues: Deutetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues and could accumulate in these tissues over time.

The safety profile of Leqvio was consistent with previous studies, reinforcing the need for more aggressive LDL-C lowering in ASCVD patients. Positive V-INITIATE trial demonstrates a 60% reduction in LDL-C levels with Leqvio compared to 7% with usual care. 81.8% of patients on Leqvio achieved the guideline-recommended LDL-C goal vs. 22.2% on usual care. Patients on Leqvio maintained adherence to existing lipid-lowering therapy with a low discontinuation rate of background statin therapy. The safety results from V-INITIATE were consistent with previous Phase III clinical trials and long-term extension studies. The study highlights the importance of early initiation of non-statin therapies like Leqvio for ASCVD patients struggling to reach LDL-C goals. Negative None. Cardiologist From a cardiologist's perspective, the V-INITIATE trial's findings are significant for the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The trial's emphasis on early intervention with Leqvio, especially prior to ezetimibe, is a notable shift from traditional cholesterol management strategies. This could influence treatment protocols, potentially leading to a revision of current guidelines. The data suggests that Leqvio, when administered biannually, could become a standard treatment option for patients who are statin-intolerant or for whom statins alone are insufficient.Moreover, the maintenance of adherence to statin therapy in the Leqvio group is an important factor, as it indicates that the addition of Leqvio does not negatively impact patient compliance with existing lipid-lowering therapies. The safety profile, consistent with previous studies, is reassuring for long-term use. However, it's important to monitor for any emerging safety concerns as the drug sees wider use in a diverse patient population. Healthcare Economist From a healthcare economics standpoint, the results of the V-INITIATE trial could have substantial cost implications for the healthcare system. Effective management of LDL-C levels in ASCVD patients can lead to decreased incidence of cardiovascular events, which are major cost drivers in healthcare. The potential reduction in hospitalizations and cardiovascular procedures could translate to significant savings.However, the cost-effectiveness of Leqvio will depend on its pricing relative to other lipid-lowering therapies, potential reductions in cardiovascular event rates and the broader impacts on patient quality of life. It's important to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis, considering the twice-yearly administration of the drug and its long-term safety profile. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst An analysis from a pharmaceutical market perspective reveals that the positive results from the V-INITIATE trial could enhance the market position of Novartis's Leqvio. The drug's efficacy in lowering LDL-C significantly more than standard care could lead to an increased demand, especially among patients who are unable to meet LDL-C goals with statins alone. This could result in a competitive advantage over other lipid-lowering therapies.Additionally, the fact that Leqvio is administered by a healthcare provider could lead to increased patient adherence, which is a key factor in chronic disease management and can affect market uptake. The trial's real-world setting and diverse patient population also add to the credibility of the findings, potentially influencing prescribing habits. However, market adoption will also be influenced by factors such as insurance coverage, accessibility and healthcare provider endorsement. 04/06/2024 - 04:16 PM V-INITIATE trial demonstrates that early initiation with Leqvio, prior to guideline-recommended ezetimibe, for ASCVD patients unable to achieve LDL-C goal on statin therapy alone led to significant LDL-C reduction vs. clinician-determined usual care (60% vs. 7% respectively)1A significantly greater proportion of the ASCVD patients receiving Leqvio achieved guideline-recommended LDL-C goal vs. the usual care arm while maintaining adherence to statin treatment1Results from usual care arm reinforce the urgent need for more aggressive LDL-C lowering in ASCVD patients, 92% of whom did not reach their LDL-C goal with statins alone1The Leqvio safety profile was consistent with the Phase III clinical studies and long-term open-label extension trials for up to 6 years of treatment1-4EAST HANOVER, N.J., April 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Novartis today announced new data demonstrating the early addition of twice-yearly* Leqvio® (inclisiran) to maximally tolerated statin therapy, prior to guideline-recommended ezetimibe, in a real-world setting significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with a history of an ASCVD-related event, who could not reach their goal on statin therapy alone1. The late-breaking data were presented at the 2024 American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session & Expo and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ""V-INITIATE evaluated a solution to the important challenge seen in clinical practice of too many patients with ASCVD not achieving guideline-recommended LDL-C goal on statins alone and effective non-statin therapies being markedly underutilized,"" said Michael Koren, M.D., Medical Director and CEO of Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research, and the primary investigator of the study. ""Given the urgent need to more aggressively manage LDL-C, the results from V-INITIATE show that when added earlier in the treatment continuum, the structured use of effective non-statin therapies like Leqvio can significantly reduce LDL-C for ASCVD patients who are struggling to reach or maintain their LDL-C goal."" In the V-INITIATE study, patients receiving Leqvio experienced significant reductions in LDL-C compared to those receiving usual care (60% vs. 7%, respectively; p<0.001), which consisted mostly of statin therapy alone (73%)1. Four in five patients receiving Leqvio achieved the guideline-recommended LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL compared to just one in five patients receiving usual care (81.8% vs. 22.2%, respectively; p<0.001)1. Notably, patients receiving health care provider (HCP)-administered Leqvio maintained adherence to existing lipid-lowering therapy, and the discontinuation rate of background statin therapy did not differ between the Leqvio and usual care arms (5.8% vs. 16.7%, respectively)1. The safety results from V-INITIATE were consistent with findings from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial program and long-term open-label extension trials, ORION-3 and ORION-8, which demonstrated sustained safety for up to six years of treatment1-4. ""The data from V-INITIATE illustrate that earlier initiation of innovative non-statin therapies, like Leqvio, presents a real opportunity to do better for ASCVD patients and improve the way we approach LDL-C lowering,"" said David Soergel, M.D., Global Head of Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Drug Development at Novartis. ""This study adds data from a real-world setting to the growing body of evidence for Leqvio being generated through our robust VictORION program, and further reinforces the clinical value of this twice-yearly HCP-administered therapy."" V-INITIATE is a 12-month Phase IIIb open-label study evaluating the effectiveness of adding Leqvio earlier, following a patient's failure to reach LDL-C goal on maximally tolerated statin therapy, compared to usual care, in a setting that reflects U.S. clinical practice. It was designed to more accurately represent the diversity of the U.S. general population across age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, income level, education, prior medical history and statin intolerance1. Unlike placebo arms in typical double-blind trials, the usual care arm reflected U.S. clinical practice by allowing treating physicians to make changes to lipid-lowering treatment based on LDL-C measurements. Usual care was defined as clinician determined based on the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommendations1. *After an initial dose and another at three months. IndicationLEQVIO (inclisiran) is an injectable prescription medicine used along with diet and other cholesterol-lowering medicines in adults with high blood cholesterol levels called primary hyperlipidemia (including a type of high cholesterol called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) or ""bad"" cholesterol. Important Safety Information:The most common side effects of Leqvio were: injection site reaction (including pain, redness, and rash), arthralgia (joint pain), bronchitis (chest cold). These are not all the possible side effects of Leqvio. Ask your health care provider for medical advice about side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088. Please click here for Leqvio full Prescribing Information. About Leqvio Leqvio is a subcutaneous injection given by a health care provider (HCP) with an initial dose, another at three months, and then every six months2,5. As a twice-yearly, HCP-administered treatment, Leqvio may help to circumvent the challenges of treatment adherence, a common issue in cholesterol management. Leqvio is the first and only small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy to lower LDL-C. It is approved in over 90 countries, including the U.S., EU, Japan and China1,5,6. Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics. About V-INITIATEV-INITIATE is a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase IIIb study in 450 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients in the U.S. with elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥70 mg/dL. The study evaluated the effectiveness of adding HCP-administered Leqvio earlier, following a patient's failure to reach LDL-C goal on maximally tolerated statin therapy, compared to usual care1. Usual care was determined by the clinicians and based on the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommendations; most patients (73%) in the usual care arm remained on statins only1. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 330 and the discontinuation of statin therapy, defined as no statin use ≥30 days before the end of study visit1. This is the first Novartis trial where all patients have been tokenized with the intention of following their outcomes for two additional years post-trial completion, providing additional insights on the real-world effectiveness of Leqvio7. About VictORIONThe V-INITIATE trial is part of VictORION, an innovative and robust clinical program for Leqvio, comprising more than 30 trials and enrolling over 60,000 patients in more than 50 countries worldwide7. The program is designed to expand on the foundational evidence of LDL-C reduction with Leqvio in diverse patient populations to include randomized clinical trials, implementation research, real-world evidence, and trials that aim to establish its potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes in primary and secondary prevention. A growing number of studies are planned to generate a vast array of data with major trials such as ORION-4 (secondary prevention), V(VictORION)-2-PREVENT (secondary prevention), V-1-PREVENT (high-risk primary prevention), V-INCEPTION and V-MONO. About Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)ASCVD refers to a variety of diseases caused by the development and growth of plaques in the inner lining of the arteries8. The atherosclerotic plaque is mainly composed of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which accumulates over time8. Cumulative exposure to LDL-C is proportionally related to arterial plaque growth and progression leads to subsequent risk of cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke8,9. Accounting for 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths, ASCVD is the primary cause of mortality in the European Union and its burden in the United States is greater than that of any other chronic diseases10-13. ASCVD risk-equivalent corresponds to conditions that confer a similar risk for an ASCVD event (e.g., diabetes and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia)4,13. About Novartis in Cardiovascular Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects hundreds of millions of people and claims more lives globally than cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes combined14. It is time to change that. Around 80% of premature cardiovascular deaths can be prevented by addressing factors that cause or worsen CVD15. We have a responsibility to make that a reality for more people. Novartis has been advancing the scientific understanding and treatment of CVD for more than four decades. Through early intervention, pioneering science and technological innovation, we are addressing factors that increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, improving the function of damaged hearts and easing the burden of care for patients. We also collaborate with healthcare professionals, patient communities and diverse organizations to improve preventive CV care worldwide. Together, we will help more people with CVD get the right treatments at the right time and live longer and healthier lives.

Bristol Myers Squibb Presents New Pooled Interim Long-Term Safety and Metabolic Outcomes Data from the EMERGENT Program Evaluating KarXT in Schizophrenia at the 2024 Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society,2024-04-06T17:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Bristol Myers Squibb presents favorable long-term metabolic profile and safety data for KarXT in schizophrenia treatment at the Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society.,"Bristol Myers Squibb Presents New Pooled Interim Long-Term Safety and Metabolic Outcomes Data from the EMERGENT Program Evaluating KarXT in Schizophrenia at the 2024 Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bristol Myers Squibb presents favorable long-term metabolic profile and safety data for KarXT in schizophrenia treatment at the Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society. Positive KarXT demonstrated positive long-term metabolic outcomes with most patients experiencing weight reductions and stability over 52 weeks of treatment. The interim data showed a mean weight decrease of 2.6kg in patients after one year of treatment with KarXT. No significant changes related to prolactin or clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scale scores were observed over 52 weeks. KarXT was generally well tolerated with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials in schizophrenia. The trials included 718 patients with 134 completing one year of treatment, showing promising results for KarXT in schizophrenia treatment. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The interim results from the Phase 3 EMERGENT program for KarXT present a significant advancement in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly focusing on the metabolic effects and safety profile of the drug over a one-year period. The data indicating most patients experienced stability or improvements in metabolic parameters and a majority saw weight reductions, is a notable deviation from the typical antipsychotic medication profile, which often leads to weight gain and metabolic issues.From a medical research perspective, the implications of these findings are multifaceted. For patients, the potential for a treatment option that does not exacerbate metabolic disorders is a considerable benefit, potentially improving adherence to medication and overall quality of life. For healthcare providers, it offers an alternative that may reduce the burden of managing the side effects associated with conventional antipsychotics. Moreover, this could lead to a shift in prescribing patterns if KarXT is approved, as its safety profile might be preferred over existing treatments.For Bristol Myers Squibb, these positive results could translate into a competitive advantage in the antipsychotic drug market. The ability to offer a medication that mitigates common side effects could drive market share growth and bolster the company's revenue stream, assuming the drug receives regulatory approval and is well-received by the medical community. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of the long-term use of KarXT, as per the EMERGENT program data, could be substantial for the healthcare system. The reduction in weight and the absence of significant metabolic side effects could translate into lower long-term healthcare costs associated with the management of weight-related comorbidities and metabolic disorders, which are common in patients treated with other antipsychotic drugs.Moreover, the potential decrease in discontinuation rates due to adverse side effects, as suggested by the tolerability of KarXT, might lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced hospitalization rates. These factors combined could offer substantial cost savings for both payers and patients and might influence reimbursement decisions and the positioning of KarXT within treatment guidelines.It is also important to consider the broader economic impact, including the potential for increased productivity and reduced disability claims if patients experience fewer side effects and better manage their schizophrenia. This could have positive ripple effects on the economy, with patients potentially maintaining more consistent employment and requiring less social support. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement of the interim long-term safety and metabolic outcomes data from Bristol Myers Squibb's Phase 3 EMERGENT program is likely to be closely watched by investors and market analysts. The results showing a favorable metabolic profile and weight reduction in patients treated with KarXT could position the drug as a strong contender in the antipsychotic market, which is valued at several billion dollars globally.Given the chronic nature of schizophrenia and the size of the patient population, a drug that offers a better side effect profile could capture significant market share. The data presented could lead to a reassessment of Bristol Myers Squibb's stock valuation by analysts, potentially factoring in the future revenue streams from KarXT, should it gain regulatory approval.Investors will be interested in the potential for KarXT to become a blockbuster drug, which is typically defined as a drug generating more than $1 billion in annual sales. The market's response to these interim results could be reflected in the short-term stock price movement of Bristol Myers Squibb, with long-term value being contingent upon successful commercialization and market adoption of KarXT. 04/06/2024 - 01:15 PM KarXT demonstrated a favorable long-term metabolic profile where most patients experienced stability or improvements on metabolic parameters over 52 weeks of treatment A majority of patients (65%) experienced reductions in weight over the course of the trial, with a mean weight decrease of 2.6kg observed at one year Data show no significant changes related to prolactin or clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scale scores over 52 weeks KarXT was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials of KarXT in schizophrenia PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced interim long-term safety, tolerability and metabolic outcomes data from its Phase 3 EMERGENT program evaluating KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) in adults with schizophrenia. These data were presented in a poster titled, “Long-Term Safety of KarXT (Xanomeline and Trospium) in Schizophrenia” (Poster F74) and in the Oral Session “Long-Term Metabolic Outcomes Associated With KarXT (Xanomeline and Trospium): Interim Results From Pooled, Long-Term Safety Studies EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5” at the Annual Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) being held April 3-7, 2024, in Florence, Italy. “These long-term safety results and metabolic outcomes from the EMERGENT program are extremely encouraging, allowing us to further understand the tolerability profile of KarXT in people living with schizophrenia,” said Roland Chen, MD, senior vice president and head, Immunology, Cardiovascular and Neuroscience development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “It is promising to see that over one year of treatment, KarXT was not associated with burdensome side effects, specifically weight gain and metabolic dysfunction, as well as extrapyramidal symptoms, which underscores its potential to provide a meaningful and differentiated option for people living with schizophrenia.” Pooled Interim Long-Term Metabolic Outcomes Associated with KarXT (EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5) The EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5 trials are Phase 3, outpatient, 52-week, open-label trials evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia. At the time of the data cutoff of August 18, 2023, the interim pooled data analysis included 718 patients who received at least one dose of KarXT, with 134 patients having completed one year of treatment. In the pooled analysis, KarXT demonstrated a favorable impact on weight and long-term metabolic profile where most patients experienced stability or improvements on key metabolic parameters over 52 weeks of treatment. The majority of patients (65%) experienced an overall reduction in weight over the course of the trial, with more patients (18%) experiencing potentially clinically significant (≥7% change) decreases in weight vs. 4% of patients experiencing increases in weight (≥7% change). In patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment with KarXT, an average reduction in weight of 2.6kg was observed, with a larger mean reduction in weight of 4.1kg observed in clinically obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Total cholesterol, triglyceride and HbA1c levels did not meaningfully change over one year of treatment. Interim Long-Term Pooled Safety Outcomes Associated with KarXT (EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5) In the long-term studies, KarXT was generally well-tolerated across 52 weeks of treatment, with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials of KarXT in schizophrenia. The overall discontinuation rate in the trial was 53% and primary reasons for discontinuation included withdrawn consent (19%), treatment-related adverse events (15%), participant lost to follow-up (8%), and participant failed to adhere to protocol requirements (7%). Across the long-term EMERGENT trials, 62% of participants reported at least one treatment-related adverse event. The most common treatment-related adverse events (≥5%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dizziness, hypertension, and diarrhea, of which nearly all were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. KarXT was not associated with significant changes related to prolactin or clinically meaningful changes in movement disorder scale scores over 52 weeks. “People living with schizophrenia and their care partners have long carried the burden of the condition, with a lack of treatment options that adequately treat the symptoms of schizophrenia without common debilitating side effects. To see that the long-term tolerability profile of KarXT remains consistent with earlier studies, where the cholinergic side effects of KarXT remained mainly mild or moderate in severity, and were transient and resolving with continued treatment is very encouraging,” said Rishi Kakar, M.D., chief scientific officer and medical director of Segal Trials and investigator in the EMERGENT program. “These results are extremely promising and add to the growing body of data which suggest that, if approved, KarXT could provide a long-desired, differentiated treatment option for people living with schizophrenia.” In additional interim long-term data presented at the congress, KarXT was associated with significant improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia across all efficacy measures at 52 weeks in the EMERGENT-4 trial. Improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia continued throughout the open-label extension regardless of whether participants were previously treated with KarXT or placebo during the acute trials, EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3 (Poster F264). About KarXT KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) is an investigational muscarinic antipsychotic in development for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis related to Alzheimer’s disease. Through its novel mechanism of action, KarXT acts as a dual M1/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in the central nervous system, which is thought to improve positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Unlike existing treatments, KarXT does not directly block dopamine receptors, representing a potential new approach to treating schizophrenia. About Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a persistent and often disabling mental illness impacting how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and affects nearly 24 million people worldwide, including 2.8 million people in the U.S. It is characterized by three symptom domains: positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (difficulty enjoying life and withdrawal from others), and cognitive impairment (deficits in memory, concentration, and decision-making). In part due to limitations with current treatments, people living with schizophrenia often struggle to maintain employment, live independently, and manage relationships. While current treatments can be effective in managing select symptoms, approximately 30% of people do not respond to therapy, with an additional 50% experiencing only a partial improvement in symptoms or unacceptable side effects.
