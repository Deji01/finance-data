The studies highlight the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling in improving patient outcomes and access to effective treatments. Positive Labcorp showcases the significance of biomarker testing in addressing testing gaps in clinical practice. Studies confirm the value of combining BRCA and HRD testing to determine PARP inhibitor therapy benefits for EOC patients. Research underscores the impact of comprehensive biomarker testing on advancing ovarian cancer treatment and patient care. Findings reveal the potential of FRα testing in guiding targeted therapy for platinum-resistant EOC patients. High expression of Folate-receptor Alpha (FRα) in primary EOC tumors may lead to improved overall survival with targeted therapy. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent research presented by Labcorp underscores the progressive nature of biomarker testing in the clinical management of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The findings suggest that a comprehensive approach, incorporating both BRCA and Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) testing, could refine the selection of patients for poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors therapy. This is notable since PARP inhibitors are a significant advancement in EOC treatment, particularly for those with specific genetic mutations.From a research perspective, the data indicating that less than half of the patients underwent HRD testing raises concerns about the underutilization of available diagnostic tools. This gap in testing could result in suboptimal treatment decisions. The differentiation in treatment continuation rates among patients with various genetic profiles highlights the potential of personalized medicine in improving patient outcomes and possibly reducing healthcare costs by avoiding ineffective treatments. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the application of these study results could be transformative for patient care. The distinction between primary and metastatic tumor sites in relation to Folate-receptor Alpha (FRα) expression is particularly noteworthy. The actionable nature of FRα as a biomarker and its overexpression in a high percentage of EOC cases points to the importance of targeted therapies like Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV). The potential for MIRV to improve survival in patients with platinum-resistant EOC is a significant development in the treatment landscape.Ensuring that healthcare providers are adequately educated on the clinical utility of these comprehensive genomic approaches is important for integrating these findings into practice. The implications for patient prognoses are profound, as the correct application of these diagnostic tools can lead to more personalized and effective treatment regimens, which is the ultimate goal in oncology. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of these studies are multifaceted. Firstly, the integration of biomarker testing in clinical practice could lead to more efficient allocation of healthcare resources by matching patients to the most effective therapies. This personalized approach could reduce the financial burden of ineffective treatments and the associated side effects. Secondly, the underutilization of HRD testing reveals a potential area for cost savings and improved patient care. By increasing the adherence to testing guidelines, there could be a reduction in unnecessary treatment expenses.Long-term, the adoption of comprehensive genomic profiling may lead to a shift in healthcare spending towards more targeted, precision medicine. This could potentially improve the cost-effectiveness of cancer care, but it requires investment in provider education and infrastructure to support widespread genomic testing. As precision medicine becomes more prevalent, it will be important to monitor its impact on overall healthcare costs and patient outcomes. 03/16/2024 - 10:29 AM Outcomes point to value of biomarker testing in addressing testing gaps in clinical practice BURLINGTON, N.C., March 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Labcorp (NYSE: LH), a global leader of innovative and comprehensive laboratory services, today presented the results from two studies at the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting on Women's Cancer. The studies demonstrate the value of biomarker testing in closing testing gaps and guiding targeted therapies for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). With the rapid rate at which cancer biomarkers are being identified and new targeted therapies become available, comprehensive testing approaches are becoming even more critical as corresponding treatment guidelines evolve. Labcorp researchers conducted two studies to generate further evidence of the value of comprehensive genomic profiling to drive guideline-compliant testing that enables increased patient access to targeted therapies for improved outcomes. Combination of BRCA testing with HRD Testing Needed to Inform Benefit of PARP Inhibitor TherapyIn one such study, conducted in partnership with Illumina, a leader in next-generation sequencing technologies, 1,093 patients diagnosed with EOC were evaluated to assess real-world clinical practice patterns for ordering BRCA and Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) testing. When combined, the results of BRCA and HRD testing can determine which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. For patients who test negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2, testing for HRD can help determine the degree of benefit from a PARP inhibitor.1 PARP inhibitors have transformed the standard of care, especially for women with germline or deleterious somatic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.2 However, at least 40% of patients do not respond to PARP inhibitors, and if treated with PARP inhibitors, may experience longer treatment durations and potentially serious side effects,3 as well as increased overall costs. Treatment guidelines for PARP inhibitors emphasize the importance of diagnostic testing and individualized patient assessments.1 Within the study population, 84% of patients underwent evaluation for BRCA mutations or HRD testing; however, less than 50% of patients underwent HRD testing. Researchers then evaluated PARP inhibitor utilization and evaluated the time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) among patients with germline/somatic BRCA mutations, tumors with HRD, and those that were homologous recombination proficient (HRP). Patients with BRCA mutations4 or HRD[5] tend to do well on PARP inhibitors, so testing for each can help identify patients who may be most appropriate for PARP inhibitor maintenance. Consistent with prior prospective clinical trials, researchers reported that the median TTD of first-line PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy was the longest for patients with germline or somatic BRCA mutations or HRD tumors. Among the study groups, 77% of the patients with a germline BRCA mutation, 65.1% of patients with a somatic BRCA mutation, and 42.7% of those with HRD and BRCA wild-type continued PARP inhibitor therapy at 18 months, compared to 29% of patients in the HRP/BRCA wild-type group. ""This research emphasizes the power of comprehensive biomarker testing in advancing the treatment of ovarian cancer. By closing critical diagnostic gaps through precision testing, we are not just improving patient care but also propelling science and healthcare forward,"" said Shakti Ramkissoon, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, head of oncology at Labcorp. ""These findings affirm that access to advanced technology, in collaboration with partners with a shared commitment to the most current care models, is the cornerstone of developing innovative diagnostic tools. These new assays can offer more patients with access to effective, biomarker-guided therapies, ultimately leading to better prognoses and opening doors to new possibilities in gynecologic oncology."" The studies are among the growing body of evidence highlighting the value of biomarker testing for EOC, specifically in real-world settings. High-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest of all gynecological cancers, with 70% of patients having a cancer recurrence within two to three years and almost 50% dying from the disease after five years of diagnosis. ""This research highlights the need for additional healthcare provider education on comprehensive genomic approaches and the clinical utility of guideline-driven testing to improve patient care in ovarian cancer,"" said Pratheesh Sathyan, head of oncology for Americas region in medical affairs at Illumina. High Folate-receptor Alpha (FOLR1/FRα) Expression Seen in Primary EOC TumorsIn another study, Labcorp researchers evaluated real-world testing practice patterns for Folate-receptor Alpha (FRα) on primary tumors versus metastatic tumors to guide targeted therapy for patients with platinum-resistant EOC. FRα is an actionable biomarker in ovarian cancer and is overexpressed in up to 90% of EOC patients.6 Patients with platinum-resistant EOC whose tumors highly express FRα may be eligible for treatment with Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV), the only currently available targeted therapy that improves overall survival for patients with platinum-resistant EOC. Researchers performed a retrospective analysis of tumor samples from 432 patients with EOC undergoing standard-of-care testing via the VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) RxDx Assay (developed by Roche). Of the tumor samples analyzed, 291 were from metastatic tumors, and 133 were from primary tumors. Researchers reported that 36.2% of patients had tumors that highly expressed FRα. In a critical study finding, tumor samples from primary sites were associated with higher rates of FRα positivity than those from metastatic sites. ""This study demonstrates not only the important role that FOLR1 testing can play in developing treatment strategies, but how it can help guide clinicians on the appropriate tumor sites to test to acquire the best information for that treatment guidance,"" said Ramkissoon.

Positive RUBY phase III data show potential for Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) combinations in more patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer,2024-03-16T12:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,GSK announces positive results from the RUBY phase III trial for dostarlimab-gxly in combination with chemotherapy and niraparib for endometrial cancer. The trial shows significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival in the overall population and MMRp/MSS population.,"Positive RUBY phase III data show potential for Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) combinations in more patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary GSK announces positive results from the RUBY phase III trial for dostarlimab-gxly in combination with chemotherapy and niraparib for endometrial cancer. The trial shows significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival in the overall population and MMRp/MSS population. Positive Statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) results were observed in Part 1 of the RUBY trial for dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The addition of niraparib to dostarlimab-gxly in the maintenance setting significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in first-line primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer compared to chemotherapy alone. The trial data presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2024 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer show promise for broader patient populations with treatment options. GSK expects US FDA regulatory submission acceptance based on RUBY Part 1 data for an expanded indication in the overall population in the first half of this year. The safety profiles of the combinations were generally consistent with known profiles of individual medicines, with manageable adverse events reported. The positive results from the trial support the role of dostarlimab-gxly as a key component in GSK's immuno-oncology development program. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent data from the RUBY phase III trial on dostarlimab-gxly in combination with chemotherapy and its impact on overall survival in endometrial cancer patients, is a significant development. As an oncologist, the 31% reduction in risk of death and the improvement of 16.4 months in median overall survival are particularly noteworthy. These figures suggest a substantial advancement in the treatment paradigm for a disease where options were previously limited, especially for the MMRp/MSS population.When evaluating the clinical impact, it's essential to consider the balance between efficacy and safety. The reported adverse events, while consistent with known profiles of PD-(L)1 inhibitors, do raise concerns about the treatment's tolerability. Approximately 12% higher incidence of serious treatment-emergent adverse events in the treatment arm warrants a focused discussion on patient selection and management of side effects in clinical practice. Medical Research Analyst The progression-free survival (PFS) benefit observed with the addition of niraparib to dostarlimab-gxly in the maintenance setting is a critical aspect of the RUBY trial's Part 2 results. From a research perspective, the 37% reduction in disease progression or death and the 6-month improvement in median PFS for the MMRp/MSS population highlight the potential of combination therapies in oncology. This data could influence future research directions and inform the development of protocols for maintenance therapy in endometrial cancer.Moreover, the regulatory implications of these results cannot be understated. With GSK expecting FDA submission acceptance based on Part 1 data, this could lead to an expanded indication for dostarlimab-gxly. This expansion would not only impact GSK's market position but could also set a precedent for the approval process of similar immuno-oncology combinations in the future. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, GSK's announcement could potentially influence its stock performance, as the trial results may lead to an expanded indication for Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly). This expansion would likely increase the drug's addressable market, particularly for patients with MMRp/MSS tumors. Investors will be watching closely for the FDA's decision, as approval can significantly enhance GSK's competitive edge in the immuno-oncology space.It's also important to consider the broader industry context. As new treatments demonstrate efficacy in previously hard-to-treat populations, there may be a shift in investment towards companies that are developing similar combination therapies. This could lead to a realignment of market expectations and valuations within the biopharmaceutical sector. 03/16/2024 - 08:00 AM Dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy is the only immuno-oncology combination to show statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) in the overall population 31% reduction in risk of death and 16.4-month improvement in median OS observed with dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in the overall population 37% reduction in risk of disease progression or death and 6-month improvement in median progression-free survival observed with the addition of Zejula (niraparib) to dostarlimab-gxly maintenance following dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in MMRp/MSS population where treatment options are still needed PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GSK plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) results from Part 1 and progression-free survival (PFS) results from Part 2 of the RUBY/ENGOT-EN6/GOG3031/NSGO phase III trial in adult patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. These data were presented today in a late-breaking plenary session at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2024 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer (March 16-18). The goal of the RUBY phase III trial program is to evaluate which patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer could potentially benefit from treatment with Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) plus chemotherapy, with or without the addition of Zejula (niraparib) maintenance. Part 1 of the RUBY phase III trial is investigating dostarlimab-gxly plus standard-of-care chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) followed by dostarlimab-gxly compared to chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo. Part 2 of the RUBY phase III trial is evaluating dostarlimab-gxly plus standard-of-care chemotherapy, followed by dostarlimab-gxly plus niraparib as maintenance therapy compared to chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo. The safety and tolerability profiles of dostarlimab-gxly plus carboplatin-paclitaxel and dostarlimab-gxly plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab-glxy plus niraparib were generally consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. Previous data showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS with Jemperli plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in frontline mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. These data led to regulatory approvals for this patient population in the US, EU and certain other countries. Data presented today show additional potential benefit of dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy, with or without the addition of niraparib, in the overall population of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, including patients with mismatch repair proficient (MMRp)/microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, for which there are currently no approved immuno-therapy-based regimens. Hesham Abdullah, Senior Vice President, Global Head Oncology, R&D, GSK said: “The positive data presented today further show how dostarlimab-gxly-based regimens could benefit a broader set of patients with endometrial cancer. The results we’ve seen to date comprise the growing body of evidence supporting the role of dostarlimab-gxly as the backbone of our immuno-oncology development program. Our goal is to continue to identify ways to use dostarlimab-gxly alone and in combination with other therapies to help improve outcomes for patients with limited treatment options.” RUBY Part 1: a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS was observed for dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy, meeting a primary endpoint of the study. Dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone showed: In the overall population: a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death by 31% (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.69; [95% CI: 0.539–0.890]) a clinically meaningful improvement of 16.4 months in median OS (44.6 months vs 28.2 months) In a prespecified exploratory analysis of the MMRp/MSS population: a clinically meaningful trend in reduced risk of death by 21% (HR: 0.79; [95% CI: 0.602–1.044]) a clinically meaningful improvement of seven months in median OS (34.0 months vs 27.0 months) Full OS summaries are shown below. dostarlimab-gxly + carboplatin-paclitaxel placebo + carboplatin-paclitaxel Overall population, Number (N) 245 249 OS, HR (95% CI) 0.69 (0.539–0.890) P-value1 0.002 OS, median (95% CI), mo. 44.6 (32.6–NR) 28.2 (22.1–35.6) dMMR/MSI-H population2, N 53 65 OS, HR (95% CI) 0.32 (0.166–0.629) OS, median3 (95% CI), mo.

Matthew Powell, MD, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, and US principal investigator of the RUBY trial said: “RUBY Part 1 is the first clinical trial to show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for an immuno-oncology therapy in combination with chemotherapy in the overall population of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. As a clinician, I celebrate the results of the RUBY Part 1 trial presented today, which show how dostarlimab-gxly added to chemotherapy could potentially benefit a broader set of patients with this type of cancer.” In RUBY Part 1, grade 3 or higher and serious treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were approximately 12% higher in the dostarlimab-gxly plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (treatment arm) compared with the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (control arm). The nature and types of immune-related AEs in the dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy safety profile were consistent with the mechanism of action of dostarlimab-gxly and similar to those reported for other PD-(L)1 inhibitors. In the trial, 40.7% of participants in the treatment arm and 16.3% of participants in the control arm had immune-related AEs assessed by the investigator as related to dostarlimab-gxly or placebo, respectively. Discontinuation of dostarlimab-gxly or placebo due to a treatment-emergent AE occurred in 19.1% of patients in the treatment arm and 8.1% of patients in the control arm. GSK expects US Food and Drug Administration regulatory submission acceptance based on RUBY Part 1 data for an expanded indication in the overall population in the first half of this year. RUBY Part 2: addition of niraparib to dostarlimab-gxly in maintenance setting significantly improved PFS in first-line primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer compared to chemotherapy alone, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. Dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy followed by dostarlimab-gxly plus niraparib compared to placebo plus chemotherapy followed by placebo showed: In the overall population: a statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR: 0.60 [95% CI: 0.43–0.82]) a clinically meaningful improvement of 6.2 months in median PFS (14.5 months vs 8.3 months) In the MMRp/MSS population: a statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 37% (HR: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.44–0.91]) a clinically meaningful improvement of 6.0 months in median PFS (14.3 months vs 8.3 months) Dr Mansoor Raza Mirza, Chief Oncologist, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark, and RUBY principal investigator said: “In RUBY Part 2, we observed that the use of dostarlimab-gxly in combination with niraparib in the maintenance therapy setting further improved progression-free survival versus placebo for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. These findings are particularly important for patients who have MMRp/MSS tumors as the data help build on the initial benefit observed with an immuno-oncology plus chemotherapy regimen, reflecting the potential for the addition of niraparib maintenance to address unmet medical need for these patients.” In RUBY Part 2, grade 3 or higher and serious treatment-emergent AEs were approximately 36% and 24% higher, respectively, in the dostarlimab-gxly plus chemotherapy followed by dostarlimab-gxly plus niraparib arm (treatment arm) compared with the placebo plus chemotherapy followed by placebo arm (control arm). In the trial, 36.6% of participants in the treatment arm and 6.3% of participants in the control arm had immune-related AEs assessed by the investigator as related to dostarlimab-gxly or placebo, respectively. No cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia were reported; other secondary primary malignancies occurred in 1 patient each in both treatment arms. Discontinuation of dostarlimab-gxly or placebo due to a TEAE occurred in 24.1% of patients in the treatment arm and 5.2% of patients in the control arm. Discontinuation of niraparib or placebo due to a treatment-emergent AE occurred in 15.7% of patients in the treatment arm and 4.2% of patients in the control arm. About endometrial cancer Endometrial cancer is found in the inner lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in developed countries, with approximately 417,000 new cases reported each year worldwide1, and incidence rates are expected to rise by almost 40% between 2020 and 2040.2,3 Approximately 15-20% of patients with endometrial cancer will be diagnosed with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.4 About RUBY RUBY is a two-part global, randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase III trial of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Part 1 is evaluating dostarlimab-gxly plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab-gxly versus carboplatin-paclitaxel plus placebo followed by placebo. Part 2 is evaluating dostarlimab-gxly plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab-gxly plus niraparib versus placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by placebo. In Part 1, the dual-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed PFS based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 and OS. The statistical analysis plan included pre-specified analyses of PFS in the dMMR/MSI-H and overall populations and OS in the overall population. Pre-specified exploratory analyses of PFS and OS in the MMRp/MSS population and OS in the dMMR/MSI-H populations were also performed. RUBY Part 1 included a broad population, including histologies often excluded from clinical trials and had approximately 10% of patients with carcinosarcoma and 20% with serous carcinoma. In Part 2, the primary endpoint is investigator-assessed PFS in the overall population, followed by PFS in the MMRp/MSS population, and OS in the overall population is a key secondary endpoint. Additional secondary endpoints in Part 1 and Part 2 include PFS per blinded independent central review, PFS2, overall response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, patient-reported outcomes, and safety and tolerability. RUBY is part of an international collaboration between the European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT), a research network of the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) that consists of 22 trial groups from 31 European countries that perform cooperative clinical trials, and the GOG Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to transforming the standard of care in gynecologic oncology. About Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) Jemperli is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.5 Jemperli was discovered by AnaptysBio, Inc. and licensed to TESARO, Inc., under a collaboration and exclusive license agreement signed in March 2014.

Grade 2 nephritis, including tubulointerstitial nephritis, occurred in 0.5% (3/605) of patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-bullous/exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in <1% of the 605 patients treated with JEMPERLI or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, other ocular inflammatory toxicities. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Other (Hematologic/Immune): Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection Infusion-Related Reactions Severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported with PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Severe infusion-related reactions (Grade 3) occurred in 0.2% (1/605) of patients receiving JEMPERLI. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI based on severity of reaction. Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibody, which may occur despite intervening therapy. Monitor patients closely for transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity and Lactation Based on its mechanism of action, JEMPERLI can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JEMPERLI and for 4 months after their last dose. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from JEMPERLI in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with JEMPERLI and for 4 months after their last dose.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for ZEJULA Important Safety Information Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received ZEJULA. In PRIMA, MDS/AML occurred in 6 out of 484 (1.2%) patients treated with ZEJULA, and in 3 out of 244 (1.2%) patients treated with placebo. The duration of therapy with ZEJULA in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 3.7 months to 2.5 years. In NOVA, of patients within the gBRCAmut cohort, MDS/AML occurred in 10 out of 136 (7%) patients treated with ZEJULA and in 2 out of 65 (3%) patients treated with placebo. The duration of therapy with ZEJULA in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 3.6 months to 5.9 years. All patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy. For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged hematological toxicities, refer the patient to a hematologist for further evaluation. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Hematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and/or pancytopenia) have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. The overall incidence of Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 31%, and 21% of patients receiving ZEJULA in PRIMA and 29%, 25%, and 20% of patients receiving ZEJULA in NOVA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 4%, 2%, and 2% of patients in PRIMA and 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients in NOVA. In patients who were administered a starting dose of ZEJULA based on baseline weight or platelet count in PRIMA, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 22%, 23%, and 15% of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients. Do not start ZEJULA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by prior chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first month, monthly for the next 11 months, and periodically thereafter. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days following interruption, discontinue ZEJULA, and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations. Hypertension and hypertensive crisis have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 1% of patients receiving placebo in PRIMA, with no reported discontinuations. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 2% of patients receiving placebo in NOVA, with discontinuation occurring in <1% of patients. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first two months, then monthly for the first year, and periodically thereafter during treatment with ZEJULA. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the ZEJULA dose if necessary. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurred in 0.1% of 2,165 patients treated with ZEJULA in clinical trials and has also been described in postmarketing reports. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of PRES, which include seizure, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. Diagnosis requires confirmation by brain imaging. If suspected, promptly discontinue ZEJULA and administer appropriate treatment. The safety of reinitiating ZEJULA is unknown. Embryo-fetal toxicity and lactation: Based on its mechanism of action, ZEJULA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after receiving their final dose of ZEJULA. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ZEJULA in breastfed infants, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with ZEJULA and for 1 month after receiving the last dose.
