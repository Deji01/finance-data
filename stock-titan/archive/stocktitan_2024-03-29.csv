U Power Limited Announces 1-for-100 Share Consolidation,2024-03-29T08:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,U Power  (UCAR) announces shareholder approval for a 1-for-100 reverse share split to regain Nasdaq compliance.,"U Power Limited Announces 1-for-100 Share Consolidation Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary U Power (UCAR) announces shareholder approval for a 1-for-100 reverse share split to regain Nasdaq compliance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of U Power Limited's 1-for-100 reverse share split is a strategic financial maneuver designed to address compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. This action typically indicates that a company's share price has been trading below the Nasdaq's stipulated threshold, which necessitates a corrective measure to boost the share price nominally and maintain its listing status.A reverse split reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the price per share correspondingly. However, it does not intrinsically change the company's market capitalization or its underlying value. Investors should note that while this may improve the optics of the stock price, it does not alter the company's fundamentals. Historically, reverse splits have been met with mixed reactions, as they can be perceived as a signal of distress, potentially leading to a short-term decline in investor confidence.For long-term stakeholders, the pivotal aspect to monitor will be the company's progression towards becoming a comprehensive EV battery power solution provider. Success in this transformation could counterbalance the negative connotations of a reverse split, but this is contingent on effective execution of business strategy and market reception. Market Research Analyst The EV battery power solutions sector in China is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements and increasing competition. U Power's vision to pivot into this space suggests an attempt to capture growth opportunities within an industry that is central to the global transition towards clean energy. The reverse share split could be seen as a short-term tactical move to stabilize the company's equity structure and appeal to a broader investor base.It's important for stakeholders to consider the competitive landscape U Power will be entering. Market dynamics, such as government policies, technological advancements and consumer adoption rates, will play a critical role in determining the company's future prospects. The ability of U Power to leverage its existing vehicle sourcing services into a more lucrative and high-growth battery power market could be a significant growth driver.However, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with such strategic shifts, including the intense capital requirements and potential execution risks. The success of the Share Consolidation in the short term and the strategic pivot in the long term, will be dependent on U Power's ability to differentiate itself and capitalize on the burgeoning EV market in China. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 AM SHANGHAI , March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- U Power Limited (Nasdaq: UCAR) (the ""Company"" or ""U Power""), a vehicle sourcing services provider with a vision to becoming a comprehensive EV battery power solution provider in China, today announced that the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on Monday, March 25, 2024, at which the shareholders approved the proposal for a 1-for-100 reverse share split of the Company's ordinary shares (the ""Share Consolidation"").

The proposed combination may limit customer choice and entrench Keysight's leading position. VIAVI's Acquisition represents certain value in this scenario. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Keysight Technologies' acquisition of Spirent Communications has potential market implications that warrant a closer look. One key aspect to consider is the competitive landscape within the technology and communications sector. The acquisition could consolidate Keysight's market position, possibly leading to reduced competition. This, in turn, could affect pricing power and innovation dynamics within the industry.From an investor's perspective, the market's reaction to such news is often mixed. While the acquiring company might see a short-term dip in stock price due to the costs associated with the acquisition, the long-term benefits could include synergies and an expanded customer base. For Spirent shareholders, the acquisition price will be a critical factor, as it will determine the immediate financial benefit of the deal.Lastly, the regulatory scrutiny that such acquisitions attract is notable. Authorities may investigate to ensure that the acquisition does not breach antitrust laws, which could delay or even prevent the transaction. This presents a risk factor that shareholders of both companies must monitor closely. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial dimensions of the proposed acquisition, the market will be keenly observing the deal valuation and the method of payment, whether it's a cash deal or involves stock considerations. The premium that Keysight is willing to pay over Spirent's current market valuation will be scrutinized to assess the acquisition's accretiveness to earnings.Investors should also consider the impact on VIAVI's financial position, given that they are noting limited business overlap with Spirent. VIAVI's response to the acquisition may signal its own strategic positioning and potential future moves, which could include looking for other acquisition targets or strengthening its core competencies to compete more effectively.Furthermore, VIAVI's engagement of Qatalyst Partners LP and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as financial advisors suggests a significant commitment to the process, indicating that they may be preparing a counteroffer or other strategic responses. Legal Expert The legal implications of such a high-profile acquisition are multifaceted. Firstly, the regulatory approvals required for the deal to proceed are a critical step. These may include antitrust clearance and foreign investment approvals, especially if the companies operate in multiple jurisdictions. The announcement mentions restrictions for overseas shareholders, which underlines the complexity of cross-border transactions and the need for compliance with various international securities laws.Another important aspect is the adherence to the Takeover Code, which governs the conduct of takeovers in the UK. The Scheme Document mentioned will contain important details regarding the terms of the acquisition and the rights of the shareholders. Shareholders of both companies should review these documents carefully to understand the legal ramifications of the transaction.The legal proceedings surrounding the deal will also be closely watched by the industry for precedent-setting outcomes, particularly in terms of how regulatory bodies view market consolidation in this sector. 03/29/2024 - 03:00 AM CHANDLER, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VIAVI Solutions (“VIAVI”) (NASDAQ: VIAV) notes the announcement made by Keysight Technologies, Inc.

The receipt of such approval will constitute disinterested shareholder approval.

All Settlement Shares will be subject to a four-month and one- day hold period.The Company is proposing to issue the Settlement Shares to preserve cash to fund future operations.About the Imperial Gold ProjectKORE owns 100% of the Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District which captures the entire 28-kilometer trend from the operating Mesquite mine (Equinox Gold) to the closed Picacho mine and including KORE's Imperial project. In the District, gold is hosted in local fault structures related to a series of regional faults connecting the known District deposits. Those three District deposits (Mesquite, Imperial and Picacho) were discovered in exposed outcrops and from placer workings. The rest of the District is covered by alluvium and has never been systematically explored.The Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District centers on KORE's Imperial project. Imperial is a structurally controlled intermediate sulfidation epithermal gold deposit. The 100% oxide gold deposit is currently defined at 2.44 kilometer long and up to 0.75 kilometer wide and is open both along strike and downdip. It is hosted in a shallowly southwest dipping, amphibolite grade metamorphic rock suite along a west-northwest trending low-angle regional thrust fault system which controls the regional geometry of mineralization. East-west striking, post-mineralization normal faults control the property scale geometry of mineralization. Geophysical characterization of the deposit and regional controlling structures is an essential component of exploration for additional resources. Imperial has a mineral resource estimate and a positive preliminary economic assessment effective April 6, 2020 with the following highlights:US$ 343 million NPV5% post-tax with 44% IRR at US$ 1,450 per ounce gold US$ 590 million NPV5% at US$ 1,800 per ounce gold;Low capital intensity project with only US$ 143 million pre-production capital costAverage 146,000 ounces gold per year over 8 years for 1.2 million ounces total productionTechnically simple project: shallow open pit, run-of-mine heap leach with existing infrastructureValue enhancement through Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District exploration and resource expansionThe Company's NI 43-101 compliant resource and preliminary economic assessment is titled ""Preliminary Economic Assessment - Technical Report Imperial Gold Project"" effective as of April 6, 2020 and revised and amended on June 10, 2021, prepared by Terre Lane and Todd Harvey of Global Resource Engineering and Glen Cole of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. can be found under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website.About KORE's Long Valley Gold DepositThe Long Valley deposit is an intact low sulphidation epithermal Au-Ag deposit with a large 2.5 km by 2 km oxide footprint, hosted within a melange of fine to coarse volcanogenic sedimentary lithologies. Mineralization at Long Valley has developed due to a combination of deep-rooted fault structures and a resurgence of rhyolite within an active caldera. The Hilton Creek Fault structure transects and served as a fluid conduit for interaction with the underlying hydrothermal system, while the rhyolite resurgence caused brittle fracturing of sediments and created voids or traps for mineralization and gold deposition. The combination of these factors yields strongly altered kaolin and quartz-hematite zones that are the primary host for gold mineralization.The Hilton Creek Fault remains underexplored on-strike north and south and several parallel structures have been defined using geophysics, the eastern one hosting some of the current mineral resource and the western one being unexplored. Long Valley is therefore open to potential new oxide discoveries in all directions. More details on the deposit geology and exploration potential can be found in KORE's January 30, 2020 and March 24, 2020 news releases. About KORE's Long Valley Gold ProjectLong Valley is 100% owned epithermal gold and silver project located in Mono County, California. The large land package is district in scale and covers all deep-rooted fault structures of similar genesis to the Hilton Creek fault, the primary 'conduit' for the current Long Valley deposit.A total of 896 holes have been drilled on the Project, the majority being completed by reverse circulation with lesser core, rotary and air track. The current mineral resource estimate is 1,217,000 ounces of Indicated gold and 456,000 ounces of Inferred gold from 63.7 million tonnes of 0.58 grams per tonne and 22.0 million tonnes of 0.65 grams per tonne, respectively. The mineral resource consists of oxide, transition and sulphides. The estimate was prepared by Neil Prenn, P.E. of Mine Development Associates with an effective date of September 15, 2020. A Preliminary Economic Assessment for a shallow, low-strip heap leach Au-Ag project was filed October 27, 2020 with the following highlights:US $273 million NPV5% post-tax with IRR of 48% at US$ 1,600 per ounce gold;US$ 395 million NPV5% at spot US$ 1,900 per ounce gold;102,000 ounces gold per year over 7 years mine life;Technically simple: shallow open pit, heap leach with nearby infrastructure;Unmodelled silver potential from metallurgical test-work; andShallow oxide and sulphide feeder exploration potential to further enhance project.More information is available in the technical report filed on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on KORE's website at www.koremining.com.

(NASDAQ: PEGY) extends CVR agreement to December 31, 2024, following the merger with Communications Systems Inc. The agreement involves the distribution of contingent value rights to CSI shareholders, allowing them to receive proceeds from the disposition of pre-merger assets. The extension is due to delays in the disposition process, with no confirmed timeline for cash distribution to CVR holders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The extension of the Contingent Value Rights (CVR) Agreement by Pineapple Energy is a strategic move that can have implications for both the company's financial flexibility and shareholder value. CVRs are financial instruments that provide shareholders with potential additional payments post-merger based on the performance or sale of remaining assets. The delay in asset disposition suggests complexity in unwinding the pre-merger assets which could be due to a variety of factors, such as market conditions or legal challenges.From a financial perspective, the extension may indicate that Pineapple Energy is working to maximize the value of these assets rather than selling at unfavorable prices. This could be positive for CVR holders in the long run, but it also introduces uncertainty regarding the timing of any potential distributions. Furthermore, it may reflect on the company's due diligence and asset management capabilities.For investors, the extension could be a signal to monitor Pineapple Energy's operational efficiency and management effectiveness. The company's ability to resolve these contingencies and realize value from the pre-merger assets will be a test of its strategic decision-making. Mergers & Acquisitions Expert In the context of mergers and acquisitions, CVRs are often used to bridge valuation gaps and provide a form of earn-out to the selling shareholders. The extension of the CVR Agreement in the case of Pineapple Energy and CSI indicates a longer-than-expected period for asset liquidation. This can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can allow for a more favorable market or operational conditions to dispose of the assets. On the other, it can be indicative of potential overvaluation of the assets at the time of the merger or unforeseen legal and operational complexities.For stakeholders, the key takeaway is the need to assess the terms of the CVR and the company's asset management strategy. The ability to effectively dispose of assets is important for realizing the expected value and avoiding prolonged periods of uncertainty. This situation also underscores the importance of understanding the risks associated with CVRs as they can be subject to such extensions and delays.It is essential for stakeholders to closely follow the company's communications regarding the asset disposition process to gauge the potential impact on their investment. 03/28/2024 - 08:48 PM MINNETONKA, Minn., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pineapple Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGY), a leading provider of sustainable solar energy and back-up power to households and small businesses, today announced CVR agreement extended to December 31, 2024. Pursuant to the merger of Communications Systems Inc. (CSI) and Pineapple Energy, Inc. on March 28, 2022, CSI shareholders of record at the close of business on March 25, 2022 (the “CVR Holders”) received one contractual, non-transferable contingent value right (“CVR”) per share of CSI common stock each respectively owned. A total of 2,429,341 CVRs were issued following the merger, and each CVR represents the right to receive a pro rata portion of proceeds available from the disposition of CSI’s pre-merger assets following the merger. The CVRs were distributed, pursuant to a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (“CVR Agreement”) between Pineapple Energy, the CVR Holders’ Representative, and Equiniti Trust Company. At the time of the merger, it was contemplated that the disposition of CSI’s pre-merger assets would be completed within two years following the merger and the CVR Agreement was scheduled to expire on March 28, 2024. However, the disposition of all of CSI’s pre-merger assets and resolving contingencies related to such assets has taken longer than originally anticipated. As a result, Pineapple Energy, Equiniti and the CVR Holders’ Representative have agreed to extend the term of the CVR Agreement to December 31, 2024. Pending completion of this disposition process, it is not possible, at this time, to provide any information regarding the possibility and timing of a further cash distribution, if any, to the CVR holders.

Key upcoming milestones include the completion of the bulk sample at Cariboo Gold Project and regional drilling at Tintic Project. Positive The company reported 2,090 ounces of gold sold in Q4 2023, generating $6.9 million in revenues. Osisko Development received an Environmental Assessment Certificate for the Cariboo Gold Project in October 2023. The company formed Electric Elements Mining Corp. with O3 Mining to explore lithium potential. Leadership changes were announced, with Mr. Luc Lessard retiring as COO and Mr. Éric Tremblay becoming interim COO. The 2024 Trixie MRE showed measured, indicated, and inferred resources for the Trixie deposit. A non-cash impairment charge of $160.5 million was recognized for Trixie in the company's financial statements. Key upcoming milestones include the completion of the bulk sample at Cariboo Gold Project and regional drilling at Tintic Project. Negative A non-cash impairment charge of $160.5 million was recognized for Trixie. The San Antonio Gold Project was placed into care and maintenance with no production anticipated. Mr. Francois Vézina resigned from his position as Senior Vice President. The company is undergoing a strategic review of the San Antonio Gold Project. Financial Analyst Osisko Development Corp.'s report detailing its financial and operating results for Q4 2023 and the full year highlights several key aspects that investors should consider. The reported gold sales from their operations, totaling 2,090 ounces in Q4 and 10,743 ounces for the year, indicate a stream of operational revenue. However, the revenues of $6.9 million for the quarter and $31.6 million for the year should be juxtaposed against the cost of sales, which stood at $6.4 million for Q4 and $32.3 million for the full year. This suggests a narrow margin in Q4 and a slight loss over the entire year, which could raise concerns about cost efficiency and profitability.The non-cash impairment charge of $160.5 million recognized for the Trixie project is a significant figure that will affect the company's balance sheet. While this does not impact cash flows, it does reflect a substantial adjustment to the asset's carrying value, which could influence investor confidence and the stock's valuation. The impairment is attributed to assumptions about future expenditures and potential mining methods, which may signal to investors that the project's future cash flows are not as robust as previously thought.Lastly, the announcement of the $50 million Credit Facility to fund pre-construction activities at the Cariboo Gold Project is a strategic move. This influx of capital is earmarked for specific development activities, which could accelerate the project's timeline towards production. The expected permit receipt in Q2 2024 could serve as a catalyst for the stock, as it would pave the way for construction and eventual production ramp-up. Investors should weigh the potential for future revenue generation against the costs and risks associated with development. Market Research Analyst The strategic review of the San Antonio Gold Project, including the search for a financial or strategic partner, is a noteworthy development. This decision to potentially divest or partner in the asset could unlock value and provide a cash infusion or risk-sharing arrangement. The market's reaction to such strategic shifts often hinges on the terms of the deal and the perceived fit with the company's long-term strategy. In the context of the current market, where mergers and acquisitions are prevalent in the mining sector, this move by Osisko Development could attract significant attention.Another point of interest is the formation and capitalization of Electric Elements Mining Corp. for lithium exploration, demonstrating diversification in Osisko Development's portfolio. With the increasing demand for lithium due to the electric vehicle boom, this venture could represent a strategic pivot that might appeal to investors looking for exposure to the battery metals market. The market will likely monitor the progress of this spinout transaction and the subsequent exploration results closely, as success in this area could add a lucrative dimension to Osisko Development's valuation. Environmental and Mining Operations Expert The receipt of the Environmental Assessment Certificate for the Cariboo Gold Project is a pivotal milestone in the project's development timeline. This achievement reflects a successful navigation of the environmental regulatory landscape, which is often a complex and lengthy process in the mining industry. The support from First Nations partners and the approval from provincial ministers adds a layer of social license that is increasingly important for mining operations. The anticipated permits in Q2 2024 are essential for the transition from exploration to construction and ultimately to production, which could substantially impact the company's operational outlook.On the operational front, the suspension of test mining activities at Trixie and the shift to care and maintenance pending further technical work and funding is a critical development. This decision indicates a strategic pause, allowing for reassessment and potentially a recalibration of the project's development plan. Investors will need to monitor how this decision affects the project's timelines and capital requirements. The updated Mineral Resource Estimate for Trixie, with increased measured and indicated resources, provides a more concrete basis for evaluating the project's potential but must be balanced against the impairment charge and the need for additional funding. 03/28/2024 - 08:36 PM (All monetary references are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated) MONTREAL, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Osisko Development Corp.

Tintic Project – Utah, U.S.A. (100%-owned) 2023 Trixie Exploration Program. During Q4 2023, the Company continued underground exploration and delineation activities on the existing Trixie deposit as part of its 2023 underground infill and exploration program. In 2023, a total of 6,028 meters (""m"") (19,776 feet (""ft"")) were drilled in 73 underground diamond drill holes, including an additional 1 geotechnical hole totalling 349 m (1,145 ft), with assay results for 17 and 8 diamond drilling holes released on October 11, 2023, and December 21, 2023, respectively. Assay results for all remaining drill holes from the 2023 exploration program were released on February 22, 2024 (see Subsequent to Q4 2023). Porphyry Target Drilling. An initial regional surface diamond drilling campaign to test for copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry mineralization potential, namely in the Big Hill area, commenced in early December 2023, following receipt of the required surface drill permits. An initial 3,000 meter (9,842 feet) of two drilling holes comprises phase one of the surface diamond drilling program. One diamond drill rig is currently active at surface testing a porphyry target at Big Hill and is at a current depth of 378 m (1,240 ft). The Company completed a first drill hole at Big Hill to a depth of 1,180 m (3,872 ft) when it transitioned out of the prospective alteration zone, and commenced the second drill hole by repositioning the drill rig at a modified angle.One diamond drill hole tested a copper-gold-porphyry target below Trixie from underground and was drilled to a depth of 759.6 m (2,492 ft) when it crossed the Eureka Lily Fault to the east and out of the prospective alteration zone. Further drill testing of a copper-gold porphyry target at depth below the Trixie deposit is recommended to the west.The drilling of porphyry targets continues and is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2024, at which point the Company will provide an exploration update including any material assay results relating to the preliminary drilling program, as appropriate. Exploration Target Potential. The Company has advanced rehabilitation at the 750 level to allow for further underground diamond drilling to test for the down dip extent of the 756 zone and the porphyry target below Trixie. Data compilation from historic mines in the area is ongoing and is anticipated to generate additional exploration drill targets on the greater Tintic Project property. Test mining activities at Trixie were suspended in December 2023 and are expected to remain in care and maintenance for the foreseeable future pending completion of technical work and additional funding. 2024 Trixie Mineral Resource Estimate (""MRE""). Subsequent to Q4 2023, on March 15, 2024, the Company released an updated MRE for the underground Trixie deposit (the ""2024 Trixie MRE"") in accordance with NI 43-101 (as defined herein). The 2024 Trixie MRE incorporated an additional 1,674 underground chip samples over 1,678 m (5,507 ft) of underground development, and 7,385 m of drilling (24,229 ft) in 122 holes completed since the initial Trixie MRE (the ""2023 Trixie MRE""), with an effective date of January 10, 2023. The 2024 Trixie MRE, which will be further described in the full technical report being prepared for the 2024 Trixie MRE in accordance with NI 43-101, comprises: Measured resources of 119,847 tonnes grading 27.36 grams per tonne (""g/t"") gold (""Au"") and 61.73 g/t silver (""Ag""), for a total of 105,437 ounces (""oz"") Au and 237,868 oz Ag.Indicated resources of 124,743 tonnes grading 11.17 g/t Au and 59.89 g/t Ag, for a total of 44,811 oz Au and 240,211 oz Ag.Inferred resources of 201,603 tonnes grading 7.80 g/t Au and 48.55 g/t Ag, for a total of 50,569 oz Au and 314,678 oz Ag. Trixie Non-cash Impairment. The Company completed a review of the carrying value of its assets in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as at December 31, 2023. As a result of this review, a non-cash impairment gross charge of $160.5 million ($115.9 million on a net carrying value basis) was recognized for Trixie in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. As previously disclosed, the impairment charge is primarily a result of, among other things, assumptions related to required future exploration and capital expenditures, potential mining and processing methods, and average processed gold grades related to the gold targets only.The asset impairment charge relates only to Trixie and is a non-cash item and, for the avoidance of doubt, has no impact on Company's cash flows. Cariboo Gold Project – British Columbia, Canada (100%-owned) Permitting Progress. Receipt of the EA Certificate in October 2023 successfully concludes the EA process for the Cariboo Gold Project, which was launched in October 2019 (see Figure 1). A Joint Permit Application for the BC Mines Act / Environmental Management Act is in progress, and the Company is currently advancing through round 3 of the Mine Review Committee review period. The Company anticipates receiving permits in Q2 2024 which would enable construction of the Cariboo Gold Project. The Company continues to explore its options, including sourcing a fully-funded solution for the Cariboo Gold Project. Figure 1: Cariboo Gold Project – Permitting Timeline Summary Pre-Construction Activities. Subsequent to Q4 2023, the Company secured a US$50 million Credit Facility (as defined herein), which will be exclusively used to fund ongoing detailed engineering and pre-construction activities at the Cariboo Gold Project. This includes the commencement of an underground development drift from the existing Cow Portal into the Cariboo Gold Project's mineral deposit at Lowhee Zone and extraction of 10,000 tonnes of material under an existing provincial permit expected to be completed by the end of Q4 2024. San Antonio Gold Project – Sonora State, Mexico (100%-owned) Following completion of processing of the remaining stockpile inventory from the heap leach pad in Q3 2023, the San Antonio Gold Project was placed into care and maintenance, with no production anticipated henceforth.The Company awaits next steps from the government of Mexico with respect to the permitting process and the status of open pit mining in the country.Strategic Review. The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Gold Project, which includes exploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The Company has engaged a financial advisor in connection with such strategic review. SUBSEQUENT TO Q4 2023 On February 2, 2024, the Company announced that Mr. Francois Vézina resigned from his position as Senior Vice President, Project Development, Technical Services and Environment effective as of March 1, 2024 to pursue outside interests in the mining sector.On February 22, 2024, the Company disclosed the remaining assay results from 14 diamond drilling holes and chip samples from new development areas as part of its 2023 exploration program at Trixie.

Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not mineral reserves and that the economic viability of resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. The mineral resource estimate disclosed in this news release may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's ""CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves"" incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under NI 43-101, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for preliminary economic assessments. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be mined economically. Cautionary Statement Regarding Financing Risks The Company's development and exploration activities are subject to financing risks. At the present time, the Company has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test mining, but has no mines in the commercial production stage that generate positive cash flows. The Company cautions that test mining at its operations could be suspended at any time. The Company's ability to explore for and discover potential economic projects, and then to bring them into production, is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial markets. Any projects that the Company develops will require significant capital expenditures. To obtain such funds, the Company may sell additional securities including, but not limited to, the Company's shares or some form of convertible security, the effect of which may result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Company's Shareholders. Alternatively, the Company may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance the development of any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary financing(s) could have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition and project scheduling. Cautionary Statement Regarding Test Mining Without Feasibility Study The Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. Cautionary Statement to U.S. Investors The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws and as a result reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources, including the information in its technical reports, financial statements, MD&A and this news release, in accordance with Canadian reporting requirements, which are governed by NI 43-101. As such, such information concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources, including the information in its technical reports, financial statements, MD&A and this news release, is not comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").

Negative Increase in R&D and G&A expenses impacting net loss. Restatement of prior financial statements due to accounting errors regarding common stock warrants. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial performance of Zevra Therapeutics, the reported Q4 2023 net revenue of $13.2M and FY 2023 net revenue of $27.5M indicate a substantial increase when compared to the previous year. This growth is attributed to the royalties from AZSTARYS®, the French EAP for arimoclomol and initial sales of OLPRUVA®. However, the reported net loss of ($19.6) million for Q4 and ($46.0) million for the full year raises concerns. The increase in R&D and G&A expenses reflects the company's strategic investments in product development and commercial infrastructure. The cash runway extending into 2026 suggests stability, but it's important to monitor the commercial success of OLPRUVA and the potential FDA approval of arimoclomol to fully assess the financial health and growth prospects of the company. Medical Research Analyst Zevra's pipeline includes OLPRUVA, now in the commercial phase and two investigational candidates, arimoclomol and KP1077, targeting rare diseases. The positive Phase 2 results for KP1077 in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) and the planned end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA are significant steps forward. The extension of the FDA review period for arimoclomol's NDA to September 2024, however, introduces uncertainty. The potential approval and the Priority Review Voucher could be transformative for Zevra, but the reliance on a single regulatory event is a notable risk. The company's strategy to leverage existing commercial operations for OLPRUVA to support arimoclomol's launch, if approved, could be cost-effective and expedite market penetration. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Acer Therapeutics has expanded Zevra's portfolio and commercial capabilities, which could enhance its market position in the rare disease sector. The focus on approximately 40 centers of excellence for OLPRUVA's launch is a targeted strategy that may optimize resource utilization and market penetration. The over 70% coverage for OLPRUVA with commercial and government payors is a positive indicator for its market access. However, it's important to monitor the market response to OLPRUVA and the company's ability to maintain reimbursement levels. Additionally, the EAP data and clinical study results for arimoclomol will be critical in shaping physician perception and supporting market access, should the drug receive approval. 03/28/2024 - 04:32 PM Launch of OLPRUVA® underway Topline results from KP1077 phase 2 study demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for key IH symptoms Q4 2023 net revenue of $13.2M, and FY 2023 net revenue of $27.5M Conference call scheduled for today, March 28, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET CELEBRATION, Fla., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ZVRA) (Zevra, or the Company), a rare disease therapeutics company, today provided corporate updates and reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We made solid progress on our key priorities in 2023,” said Neil F. McFarlane, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zevra. “As we look to 2024, our strategic priorities are clear; first, successfully launch OLPRUVA® and ensure access for patients; second, prepare for the launch of arimoclomol; and third, advance the KP1077 development program in sleep disorders. Mr. McFarlane continued, “We are encouraged by the positive data from our Phase 2 study of KP1077 in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. KP1077 has been well tolerated while demonstrating early signs of differentiated clinical benefits. These data will help inform our registrational study, which we will discuss with FDA at an end of phase 2 meeting.” Recent Business and Corporate Highlights: Completion of the Acquisition of Acer Therapeutics, Inc. (Acer): On November 20, 2023, the Company announced the completion of its acquisition of Acer. The acquisition brought multiple complementary rare disease assets, increased Zevra’s revenue potential, and bolstered Zevra’s commercial and development capabilities. OLPRUVA, an FDA-approved treatment indicated for certain urea cycle disorders (UCDs): To support the commercial launch, the Company accelerated the build-out of a focused and effective customer-facing team with decades of experience in rare diseases. The team includes Rare Disease Sales Specialists, Marketers, Patient Services and Market Access professionals, as well as Medical Science Liaisons and Patient Advocates who are in the field engaging with key customers, with our efforts largely focused on approximately 40 centers of excellence across the United States.To raise awareness of the benefits of OLPRUVA, the Company has established Quick Start, which is a 30-day free trial to allow patients and physicians to gain experience with the treatment. Zevra continues to partner with the patient community and UCD treatment centers of excellence to drive brand recognition, while also working with payors to ensure access to OLPRUVA.The Company has seen a meaningful increase in reimbursement coverage since the acquisition, and currently there is more than 70% overall coverage for OLPRUVA with commercial and government payors.The Company expects that OLPRUVA’s commercial operations and capabilities will provide scale and cost synergies to support and accelerate the launch and commercialization of arimoclomol, if approved. Arimoclomol, an investigational therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), an ultra-rare, genetic, progressive and fatal neurological disease: During Q4 2023, the Company submitted a comprehensive data set to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supporting its resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for arimoclomol.On March 4, 2024, the Company announced that the FDA had extended the review period for the NDA, resulting in a revised Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of September 21, 2024. The FDA re-affirmed its intent to present the resubmission for discussion at an advisory committee meeting to be scheduled.If approved, arimoclomol will be a first-in-class, orally delivered treatment for NPC, and the Company will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher.Zevra is preparing for the commercial launch of arimoclomol in the U.S., if approved, and will leverage the commercial infrastructure that is in place for OLPRUVA.The Company plans to publish real-world evidence data from its Expanded Access Program (EAP) and additional data from clinical studies regarding safety and efficacy, to inform physician treatment decision-making and support market access.The Company intends to complete the regulatory filing for arimoclomol in the U.S., and then continue its evaluation of optimal regulatory pathways to approval in the E.U. and other parts of the world. KP1077 (serdexmethylphenidate, or SDX), an investigational therapeutic candidate both for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), a rare sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, and for the treatment of narcolepsy: On March 26, 2024, the Company reported positive topline data from its placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of KP1077 in patients with IH. KP1077 was well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in the trial, including the highest dose of 320 mg daily, regardless of dosing regimen (once or twice daily), supporting the study’s primary endpoint of safety and tolerability.KP1077 produced clinically meaningful improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness, as assessed by change from baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. This improvement was maintained during both the five-week open-label titration period and throughout the 2-week double-blind withdrawal period for both dosing regimens. Patients administered KP1077 showed benefits in change from baseline for the IH Severity Scale, Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale and Brain Fog severity Scale at the end of the open-label dose titration, and at the end of the double-blind withdrawal period.The study successfully fulfilled the objectives of providing key information for the design of a potentially pivotal efficacy trial, and the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints are supportive of initiating a Phase 3 trial of KP1077. The Company plans to request an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek guidance on the Phase 3 clinical trial design.The Company will present new data from a Phase 1 study completed under the narcolepsy IND, and the final results from its Phase 2 study of KP1077 in IH at the upcoming SLEEP 2024 conference. Overview of Q4 2023 and FY 2023 Financial Results: Net revenue for Q4 2023 was $13.2 million, compared to prior year Q4 net revenue of $2.2 million. The components of revenue during the current quarter include ongoing royalties from AZSTARYS®, reimbursements from the French EAP for arimoclomol, and some initial sales of OLPRUVA. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $11.4 million for Q4 2023, compared to $6.5 million in Q4 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study in KP1077, and ongoing work supporting to support the arimoclomol NDA which was resubmitted to the FDA in December 2023. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $14.7 million for Q4 2023, compared to $4.7 million in Q4 2022. The period-over-period increase was primarily related to an increase in personnel costs and professional fees associated with our commercial and business development activities. Net loss for Q4 2023 was ($19.6) million, or ($0.51) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($3.0) million, or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2022. Net revenue for FY 2023 was $27.5 million compared to prior year net revenue of $10.2 million. The period-over-period increase was primarily attributed to an increase of $18.5 in royalties and milestones received under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, which includes $15.0 million in one-time net sales milestone payments earned during FY 2023, an increase in sales of arimoclomol of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in consulting revenue of $4.5 million. R&D expenses were $39.8 million for FY 2023, compared to $19.8 million for FY 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by the ongoing KP1077 Phase 2 clinical study in IH, along with work to prepare the arimoclomol NDA for resubmission. G&A expenses were $34.3 million for FY 2023, compared to $15.0 million in FY 2022. The period-over-period increase was primarily related to an increase in personnel costs and professional fees associated with our commercial and business development activities. Net loss for FY 2023 was ($46.0) million, or ($1.30) per basic and diluted share, which includes the non-cash impact of the change in fair value adjustment for the warrant liability of ($1.4) million, or ($0.04) per basic and diluted share. Net loss for FY 2022 was ($26.8) million, or ($0.78) per basic and diluted share. As of December 31, 2023, total cash, cash equivalents, and cash investments were $67.7 million, a decrease of $15.7 million compared to $83.4 million as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven, in part, by increased third-party R&D costs related to the KP1077 clinical development program, the arimoclomol program, and increased G&A expenses during the period as the Company invested in its commercial infrastructure. Based on our current operating forecast and available resources, our cash runway is expected to extend into 2026. Our cash runway forecast includes revenue from the expected sales of OLPRUVA, ongoing reimbursements from the French EAP for arimoclomol, and investments into the incremental commercial activities needed to support the launch of arimoclomol, if approved, and completion of the KP1077 development program for IH. Our cash runway forecast does not include any commercial revenue from arimoclomol which could follow a potential FDA approval, or the potential sale of the Priority Review Voucher which would be received upon approval. On November 17, 2023, Zevra completed the acquisition of Acer. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acer continues as a wholly owned subsidiary of Zevra. The Merger included the acquisition of OLPRUVA® (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension, which was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2022, for the treatment of urea cycle disorders. Acer also has a pipeline of investigational product candidates, including celiprolol for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, patients with a confirmed type III collagen (COL3A1) mutation. At the effective time of the Merger (the ""Effective Time""), each share of common stock of Acer, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding cancelled shares and any shares held by holders who have exercised their appraisal rights) were converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1210 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Zevra, par value $0.0001 per share, and (ii) one non-transferable contingent value right (“CVR”) issued by Zevra, which represents the right to receive one or more contingent payments up to an additional $76.0 million upon the achievement, if any, of certain commercial and regulatory milestones for Acer’s OLPRUVA and celiprolol products within specified time periods. Certain additional cash payments are also possible pursuant to the CVRs with respect to milestones involving Acer’s early-stage program ACER-2820 (emetine). As of December 31, 2023, total shares of common stock outstanding were 41,534,668, and fully diluted common shares outstanding were 58,230,596, which included 5,603,729 shares issuable upon exercise of warrants. On March 25, 2024, the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors, after discussion with senior management and the Company’s independent registered public accountants, concluded that the Company’s previously issued audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, (collectively, the “Prior Financial Statements”) should no longer be relied upon. In connection with the preparation of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), the Audit Committee concluded that, in prior years it had not appropriately accounted for certain common stock warrants as liabilities. These errors led to understatements of derivative and warrant liability and additional paid-in capital and fluctuations in fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability during the impacted periods. In addition, in connection with the restatements, the Company has concluded that the previously disclosed errors led to misstatements of fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability, derivative and warrant liability, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings/(accumulated deficit) that were previously disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 (collectively, the “Prior Interim Financial Statements”). On March 25, 2024, the Audit Committee, after discussion with senior management and the Company’s independent registered public accountants, concluded that the Prior Interim Financial Statements should no longer be relied upon. The errors and corrective adjustments identified by the Company are non-cash in nature; and they do not impact results of operations or key metrics used by the Company in managing operations, such as revenue, operating expenses, and loss from operations.

Therefore, it is important to adhere to any dietary protein restrictions and have alternative medication options to help control ammonia levels. About OLPRUVA® OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) was approved for the treatment of certain UCDs in December 2022 and has recently been marketed under the brand name, OLPRUVA®. OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension is a prescription medicine used along with certain therapy, including changes in diet, for the long-term management of adults and children weighing 44 pounds (20 kg) or greater and with a body surface area (BSA) of 1.2 m2 or greater, with urea cycle disorders (UCDs), involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), or argininosuccinic acid synthetase (AS). Please see Important Safety Information and full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information. Important Safety Information Certain medicines may increase the level of ammonia in your blood or cause serious side effects when taken during treatment with OLPRUVA. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you or your child take, especially if you or your child take corticosteroids, valproic acid, haloperidol, and/or probenecid. OLPRUVA can cause serious side effects, including: 1) nervous system problems (neurotoxicity). Symptoms include sleepiness, tiredness, lightheadedness, vomiting, nausea, headache, confusion, 2) low potassium levels in your blood (hypokalemia) and 3) conditions related to swelling (edema). OLPRUVA contains salt (sodium), which can cause swelling from salt and water retention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child get any of these symptoms. Your doctor may do certain blood tests to check for side effects during treatment with OLPRUVA. If you have certain medical conditions such as heart, liver or kidney problems, are pregnant/planning to get pregnant or breast-feeding, your doctor will decide if OLPRUVA is right for you. The most common side effects of OLPRUVA include absent or irregular menstrual periods, decreased appetite, body odor, bad taste or avoiding foods you ate prior to getting sick (taste aversion). These are not all of the possible side effects of OLPRUVA. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. About Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an ultra-rare, progressive, and neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and other lipids within the cell, leading to an accumulation of these substances in various tissue areas, including brain tissue. The disease is caused by mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes, which are responsible for making lysosomal proteins. Both children and adults can be affected by NPC with varying clinical presentations. Those living with NPC lose independence due to physical and cognitive limitations, with key neurological impairments presenting in speech, cognition, swallowing, ambulation, and fine motor skills. Disease progression is irreversible and can be fatal within months or take years to be diagnosed and advance in severity. About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol, Zevra’s orally delivered, first-in-class investigational product candidate for the treatment of NPC, has been granted Orphan Drug designation, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA has accepted the resubmission of the NDA for arimoclomol and has set a user fee goal date (PDUFA date) of September 21, 2024. About Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Patients with IH experience daytime lapses into sleep, or an irrepressible need to sleep that persists even with adequate or prolonged nighttime sleep. Additionally, those with IH have extreme difficulty waking, otherwise known as sleep inertia, severe brain fog, and often fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times. These symptoms of IH often lead to further, even more debilitating problems such as memory lapses, difficulty maintaining focus, and depression. It is estimated, based on claims data, that approximately 37,000 patients in the United States are currently diagnosed with IH, although the total patient population may be much larger due to some patients who have not yet been diagnosed, have been misdiagnosed, or are not currently seeking treatment. About KP1077 KP1077 (serdexmethylphenidate or SDX) is Zevra’s proprietary prodrug of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH) and its sole active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). KP1077 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of IH, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has classified SDX, the sole API in KP1077, as a Schedule IV controlled substance based on evidence suggesting SDX has a lower potential for abuse when compared to d-MPH, a Schedule II controlled substance.

(NHS) declares a distribution of $0.0905 per share of common stock payable on April 30, 2024. The Fund aims to maintain regular monthly distributions, subject to market conditions and various factors affecting income stability. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Neuberger Berman High Yield Strategies Fund Inc. of a distribution of $0.0905 per share is a reflection of the fund's current financial health and its ability to generate income for its shareholders. The key factors influencing the sustainability of such distributions include the income from investments and the cost of leverage. Investors should consider the implications of the fund's use of leverage, as it can amplify both gains and losses. The distribution's composition is also significant; if it includes a return of capital, it implies that part of the money shareholders receive is not from income but from their original investment, which can be less favorable in the long run.Furthermore, the consistency in distribution amounts suggests a focus on providing shareholders with predictable returns, which might be appealing to income-focused investors. However, the reliance on capital gains and return of capital to maintain these distributions could indicate that the fund's income is not sufficient to cover the distributions on its own. This could potentially lead to a depletion of assets over time if not managed prudently. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the composition of the fund's distributions is important for shareholders. Distributions that are classified as return of capital are generally not taxed until the shareholder's cost basis in the stock is recovered. This differs from distributions classified as net investment income or capital gains, which are subject to different tax treatments. The fund's compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ensures transparency in the characterization of distributions, allowing shareholders to plan for potential tax liabilities.Shareholders should be aware of the tax implications of these distributions and the final determination of their sources at the year's end, as this will affect their individual tax situations. It is essential for investors to understand the tax characteristics of all distributions to accurately report income and adjust their investment strategy accordingly. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman High Yield Strategies Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NHS) (the ""Fund"") has announced a distribution declaration of $0.0905 per share of common stock. The distribution announced today is payable on April 30, 2024, has a record date of April 15, 2024, and has an ex-date of April 12, 2024. Under its level distribution policy, the Fund anticipates that it will make regular monthly distributions, subject to market conditions, of $0.0905 per share of common stock, unless further action is taken to determine another amount. The Fund's ability to maintain its current distribution rate will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and stability of income received from its investments, the cost of leverage and the level of other Fund fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular amount or that a distribution will consist only of net investment income. Due to an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the distribution announced today, as well as future distributions, may consist of net investment income, net realized capital gains and return of capital. In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice would be for informational purposes and not for tax reporting purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of the year.

The Fund plans to make regular monthly cash distributions based on its investments' net rate of return and other factors.","NEUBERGER BERMAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCOME FUND ANNOUNCES MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Neuberger Berman Energy Infrastructure and Income Fund Inc. (NML) declares a distribution of $0.0584 per share of common stock payable on April 30, 2024. The Fund plans to make regular monthly cash distributions based on its investments' net rate of return and other factors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Neuberger Berman Energy Infrastructure and Income Fund regarding its distribution declaration is of interest to investors as it directly impacts shareholder returns. The fixed rate distribution suggests a stable income stream, which can be appealing for income-focused investors. However, the reliance on distributable cash flow, composed of various investment income streams minus operating expenses and taxes, indicates a potential variability in the payouts. The mention of distributions potentially including a non-taxable return of capital is significant. While this can provide immediate cash benefits, it also carries implications for the stockholder's tax situation and future capital gains calculations.Investors should note that the Fund is subject to federal income tax, which is not typical for investment companies. This could result in lower distributions compared to direct investments in master limited partnerships (MLPs). The tax efficiency of MLPs is often a key reason investors choose them, so the Fund's tax burden might be a deterrent. The notice regarding compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 is also noteworthy, as it ensures transparency about the nature of distributions, allowing investors to make informed decisions. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the Fund's expected distribution of a portion as a return of capital has implications for investors. A return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the Fund's shares, which can result in higher capital gains taxes upon the sale of those shares. This is a double-edged sword; it provides tax benefits in the short term by reducing taxable income but may lead to increased tax liabilities in the long term.Investors should also be aware that the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of distributions is made post-year-end, necessitating careful tax planning. The Fund's unique status as being subject to federal income tax, unlike most investment companies, means that the net amount available for distribution may be less than expected. This could influence an investor's decision to invest in the Fund versus direct MLP investments, which are generally more tax-efficient due to their pass-through status. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman Energy Infrastructure and Income Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NML) (the ""Fund"") has announced a distribution declaration of $0.0584 per share of common stock. The distribution announced today is payable on April 30, 2024, has a record date of April 15, 2024, and has an ex-date of April 12, 2024. The Fund currently intends to make regular monthly cash distributions to holders of its common stock at a fixed rate per share, to be determined based on the projected net rate of return of the Fund's investments as well as other factors, subject to ongoing review and adjustment from time to time. The Fund currently intends to pay its regular monthly distributions out of its distributable cash flow, which generally consists of (1) cash and paid-in-kind distributions from master limited partnerships (""MLPs"") or their affiliates, dividends from common stocks, interest from debt instruments and income from other investments held by the Fund less (2) current or accrued operating expenses, including leverage costs, if any, and taxes on its taxable income. The Fund expects that a portion of its distributions to stockholders will constitute a non-taxable return of capital. A ""return of capital"" is a distribution by the Fund which represents a return of a common stockholder's original investment, and should not be confused with a dividend. To the extent the Fund pays a return of capital, a common stockholder's basis in Fund shares will be reduced, which will increase a capital gain or reduce a capital loss upon sale of those shares. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular amount, or that a distribution will consist solely of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits. In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice would be for informational purposes and not for tax reporting purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of the year. The Fund is subject to federal income tax on its taxable income, unlike most investment companies. Any taxes paid by the Fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to stockholders, and therefore investors in the Fund will likely receive lower distributions than if they invested directly in MLPs.

The Fund anticipates regular monthly distributions under its level distribution policy, subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The distribution declaration by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. is a reflection of the fund's operational strategy and financial health. A steady distribution can signal stability and could potentially attract income-focused investors. However, the caveat that the distribution might not always consist of net investment income is significant. This suggests that distributions could, in part, be a return of capital, which might not be as favorable for long-term growth as it effectively reduces the investment's principal.Investors should closely monitor the Fund's performance, particularly the stability of income from investments and the impact of leverage costs. Leverage can amplify returns but also increases risk and costs. If leverage becomes too costly, or if investment income decreases, maintaining the current distribution rate could be challenging. This could influence the fund's share price negatively, as market conditions and investor sentiment react to changes in distribution levels. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the composition of the Fund's distribution is important for shareholders. Distributions that are classified as return of capital are not taxed immediately but reduce the cost basis of the investment, which can affect capital gains tax upon sale of the shares. It's important for shareholders to understand that the final tax characteristics of the distributions will only be determined at the end of the year, which requires careful tax planning and might impact the attractiveness of the fund for tax-sensitive investors.Moreover, the compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ensures transparency in distribution composition, which aids investors in making informed decisions. However, the complexity of tax implications necessitates that investors consult with tax professionals to fully understand the impact on their individual tax situations. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market, the real estate securities sector can be influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, real estate market trends and economic cycles. The Fund's distribution policy and its ability to maintain it can serve as an indicator of how well it is navigating these factors. A consistent distribution policy could be perceived as a positive sign, potentially making the Fund more attractive compared to its peers.However, investors should be aware that the real estate market has its unique risks and cycles, which can affect the income generated by such funds. It's important to evaluate the Fund's portfolio diversification, asset quality and management's ability to adapt to changing market conditions when considering the Fund's long-term prospects. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

(NBXG) declares a distribution of $0.10 per share of common stock, payable on April 30, 2024. The Fund plans to maintain monthly distributions of $0.10 per share, subject to market conditions. The distribution may include net investment income, capital gains, and return of capital. The Fund's ability to sustain this rate depends on various factors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a $0.10 per share distribution by Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund is a reflection of the fund's current financial health and its ability to generate income from its investments. Investors typically view regular distributions as a sign of a fund's stability and income-generating capability. This announcement may positively influence investor sentiment and could potentially lead to an uptick in the fund's stock price as it signals a return on investment.However, the caveat that future distributions may include returns of capital alongside net investment income and capital gains suggests that the fund's income might not be solely from profits. This could indicate that some of the distributions are essentially a return of the investors' own money, rather than a return on their investment, which might not be sustainable in the long run. It's essential for stakeholders to monitor the fund's performance to ensure that distributions are not eroding the capital base over time. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the composition of the fund's distribution is significant. Distributions that are classified as net investment income or capital gains are taxed differently than those classified as a return of capital. A return of capital is not immediately taxed; instead, it reduces the investor's cost basis in the fund, potentially increasing the capital gains tax owed when shares are sold. Investors should keep track of these notices to accurately report their taxes and understand the tax implications of their investments in the fund.It is also important to note that the final tax characteristics of the distributions will only be determined at the end of the year. This means that investors will need to wait until they receive the year-end tax documents to know the exact nature of the distributions received throughout the year for tax reporting purposes. Market Research Analyst When analyzing the fund's distribution policy, it's important to consider the broader market context. The level distribution policy can be attractive to certain investors who prefer predictable income streams, especially in volatile market conditions. However, if the fund's distributions are frequently supplemented by returns of capital, it might suggest that the fund is struggling to find profitable investment opportunities or is facing challenges in terms of income stability.Investors should compare the fund's distribution yield to industry averages and peer funds. If the yield is significantly higher than similar funds, it might be a red flag that the distribution is not sustainable. Conversely, if the yield is in line with or below average, it may suggest a more conservative and potentially sustainable approach. Analyzing the fund's investment portfolio and strategies can provide further insights into the potential for capital appreciation and income generation, which are key factors for long-term distribution sustainability. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund Inc.

IAMGOLD progressing well with Côté Gold Project construction. Maintained a strong strategic partnership with Beedie Investments Negative None. Market Research Analyst Metalla Royalty & Streaming Ltd.'s acquisition of Nova Royalty Corp. represents a strategic consolidation within the royalty sector, aiming to capitalize on the robust prospects of copper and gold assets. This move is indicative of a trend where companies seek to diversify their portfolios to enhance growth and stability. The increase in attributable gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) surpassing guidance suggests operational efficiency and may positively influence investor sentiment. However, the net loss reported despite revenue from royalty interests raises questions about the sustainability of profits in the face of expansion costs and market volatility.Looking forward, the expected production commencement of Tocantinzinho, Côté and Amalgamated Kirkland projects may offer additional revenue streams. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with project development, including potential delays and cost overruns. The focus on Gosselin's drilling program and its potential as a tier 1 royalty asset could significantly impact future valuations, contingent on exploration success. Financial Analyst The financial restructuring through the amended and restated convertible loan facility with Beedie Investments Ltd. reflects a strategic shift in Metalla's capital management. The increase in principal amount and adjustment of conversion prices, coupled with the equity placement, suggests an aggressive approach to financing growth, albeit with a heightened debt profile. The conversion of debt to equity could dilute current shareholders but may also reduce financial leverage and interest expenses in the long term.Investors should consider the impact of these financial maneuvers on Metalla's balance sheet and the implications for future cash flows. The special dividend payment indicates a commitment to shareholder returns, which could bolster investor confidence. Nevertheless, the reported operating cash margin of $1,861 per GEO is impressive and reflects the low-cost nature of royalty and streaming business models, which is favorable for profitability. Legal Expert The completion of the Nova Transaction required compliance with various regulatory requirements and adherence to the terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement. The distribution of common shares to Nova shareholders and the vesting of restricted share units into common shares are transactions that must be executed with precision to avoid legal pitfalls. The termination of the equity distribution agreement under the 2022 ATM Program indicates a strategic pivot away from this fundraising method, likely due to the sufficient capital raised through other means.It is important for stakeholders to understand the legal complexities of such transactions and their potential influence on company governance and shareholder rights. The retention of royalties on sold properties, such as the Pine Valley and Tower Mountain, ensures ongoing interests in these assets, which could provide long-term benefits despite the immediate cash inflow from the sales. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM (All dollar amounts are in thousands of United States dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for shares, per ounce, and per share amounts) TSXV: MTANYSE American: MTA VANCOUVER, BC, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Metalla Royalty & Streaming Ltd.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures Metalla has included certain performance measures in this press release that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including (a) attributable gold equivalent ounces (GEOs), (b) average cash cost per attributable GEO, (c) average realized price per attributable GEO, (d) operating cash margin per attributable GEO, and (e) adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. (a) Attributable GEOsAttributable GEOs are a non-IFRS financial measure that is composed of gold ounces attributable to the Company, plus an amount calculated by taking the revenue earned by the Company in the period from payable silver, copper and other metals ounces attributable to the Company divided by the average London fix price of gold for the relevant period, plus an amount calculated by taking the cash received or accrued by the Company in the period from the derivative royalty asset divided by the average London fix gold price for the relevant period. Included in the calculation of attributable GEOs is any cash received from the Higginsville price participation royalty, which is accounted for as a derivative royalty asset, as such any payments received under this royalty are treated as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset on the Company's statement of financial position and not shown as revenue on the Company's statement of profit and loss. However, operationally as the Company receives payment similar to the Company's other royalty interests, the results have been included for more accurate comparability and to allow the reader to accurately analyze the operations of the Company. The Company presents attributable GEOs as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The Company's attributable GEOs for the year ended December 31, 2023, were as follows: Attributable GEOs during the period from: Higginsville (1) 1,476 Wharf 1,008 El Realito 1,066 La Encantada 259 Aranzazu 67 NLGM 113 Total attributable GEOs 3,989 (1) The Higginsville participation royalty has reached full 34,000 gold ounce threshold and is no longer payable to Metalla. (b) Average cash cost per attributable GEOAverage cash cost per attributable GEO is a non-IFRS financial measure that is calculated by dividing the Company's total cash cost of sales, excluding depletion by the number of attributable GEOs. The Company presents average cash cost per attributable GEO as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The Company's average cash cost per attributable GEO for the year ended December 31, 2023, was: Cost of sales for NLGM $22 Total cash cost of sales 22 Total attributable GEOs 3,989 Average cash cost per attributable GEO $6 (c) Average realized price per attributable GEOAverage realized price per attributable GEO is a non-IFRS financial measure that is calculated by dividing the Company's revenue, excluding any revenue earned from fixed royalty payments, and including cash received or accrued in the period from derivative royalty assets, by the number of attributable GEOs sold. The Company presents average realized price per attributable GEO as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. The Company's average realized price per attributable GEO for year ended December 31, 2023, was: Royalty revenue (excluding fixed royalty payments) $4,360 Payments from derivative assets 2,866 Revenue from NLGM 220 Sales from stream and royalty interests 7,446 Total attributable GEOs sold 3,989 Average realized price per attributable GEO $1,867 (d) Operating cash margin per attributable GEOOperating cash margin per attributable GEO is a non-IFRS financial measure that is calculated by subtracting the average cast cost price per attributable GEO from the average realized price per attributable GEO. The Company presents operating cash margin per attributable GEO as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. (e) Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure which excludes from net income taxes, finance costs, depletion, impairment charges, foreign currency gains/losses, share based payments, and non-recurring items. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to plan and forecast its operations, and assess leverage levels and liquidity measures. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. However, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities as determined under IFRS. The Company's adjusted EBITDA for year ended December 31, 2023, was: Net loss $(5,837) Adjusted for: Royalty interest impairment 2,355 Gain on sales of mineral claims (5,093) Interest expense 1,170 Finance charges 206 Loss on modification of loan payable 1,658 Income tax provision 1,361 Depletion 2,389 Foreign exchange loss (gain) 610 Share-based payments 2,255 Adjusted EBITDA $1,074 Refer the Company's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, for a numerical reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures described above.

Nuvve Provides Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Update,2024-03-28T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Nuvve Holding Corp. (NVVE) reports an increase in megawatts under management, a reduction in cash operating loss, and a recent capital raise of $9.6 million.

(NVVE) reports an increase in megawatts under management, a reduction in cash operating loss, and a recent capital raise of $9.6 million. The company also announced a partnership to build Taiwan's first electric vehicle V2G hub. Positive Increased megawatts under management by 18.4% to 25.1 megawatts as of December 31, 2023 Reduced cash operating loss in the fourth quarter 2023 to $6.5 million versus $7.7 million in the fourth quarter 2022 Raised an additional $9.6 million in gross proceeds through an underwritten public offering in January 2024 Announced a partnership with e-Formula to build Taiwan's first electric vehicle V2G hub Negative None. Energy Sector Financial Analyst The growth in megawatts under management by Nuvve is a significant indicator of the company's expansion in the green energy sector, particularly in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology space. An increase of 18.4% within a quarter suggests that the company is scaling up operations and possibly gaining market share. However, the reported cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million, coupled with the need for a capital raise of $9.6 million, might raise concerns about the company's liquidity and long-term financial stability. Investors should monitor whether the capital raised can support the accelerated growth without further diluting shareholder value.Furthermore, the reduction in cash operating loss is a positive sign of improving operational efficiency. This could reflect well on the company's cost management strategies and might be indicative of a path to profitability. However, the absolute value of the loss still requires attention, as it points to ongoing cash burn, which is not uncommon in growth-stage companies but remains a risk factor. Sustainable Technology Market Analyst The announcement of the RFP award with partner e-Formula to build Taiwan's first electric vehicle V2G hub is a strategic development that could open new market opportunities for Nuvve. This move not only diversifies their geographic presence but also demonstrates the adaptability of their technology in international markets. The launch of a dedicated website for V2G hubs could be seen as a marketing strategy to enhance customer engagement and provide transparency on project developments.Investors should consider the potential market size for V2G technologies and the competitive landscape. While Nuvve's recent developments suggest a growing interest in V2G solutions, it is essential to assess the company's market position relative to competitors and the overall adoption rate of EVs and V2G systems globally. The long-term success of Nuvve may hinge on the broader EV market's growth and regulatory support for renewable energy integration into the grid. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM Investor Conference Call to be Held Today at 5:00 PM Eastern Time (2:00 PM PT) SAN DIEGO, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvve Holding Corp.

Looking ahead, we are confident that the steps we are taking today laying the groundwork for continued expansion and value creation in 2024 and beyond."" 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Review Total revenue was $1.64 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.15 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.50 million, or 43.4%. The increase is attributed to a $0.27 million increase in products revenue and a $0.17 million increase in services revenue due to higher customers sales orders and shipments, and an increase of $0.07 million in grants. Products and services revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 consisted of sales of DC and AC Chargers of about $1.05 million, grid services revenue of $0.20 million, and engineering services of $0.27 million. Cost of product and service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023, increased by $0.4 million to $1.2 million, or 57.1%, compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to higher customers sales orders and shipments. Products and services margins for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 8.7% to 24.0%, compared to 32.7% for the same prior year period. Margin was negatively impacted mostly by a higher mix of hardware charging stations sales and a lower mix of engineering services. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of selling, marketing, payroll, administrative, finance, and professional expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 17.3%. The decrease during the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to decreases in compensation expenses of $0.5 million, including share-based compensation, decreases in insurance related expenses of expenses of $0.2 million, decreased in professional fees related to an annual audit of $0.2 million, decreases in travel related expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by increases in software subscription expenses of $0.2 million, and legal expenses of $0.4 million. Expenses resulting from the consolidation of Levo's activities during the three months ended December 31, 2023, accounted for $0.6 million of the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses was flat at $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Research and development expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were primarily attributable to compensation expenses and subcontractor expenses used to advance Nuvve's platform functionality and integration with more vehicles. Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense, change in fair value of warrants liability and derivative liability, and other income (expense). Other income (expense) decreased by $0.90 million of income, from $1.04 million of other income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, to $0.13 million in other income for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease during the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to the change in fair value of the warrants liability and derivative liability. Net loss decreased by $0.4 million from net loss of $7.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, to $7.3 million of net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in other income of $0.9 million, and a decrease in operating expenses of $0.8 million, and increase in revenue of $0.50 million, for the above aforementioned reasons. Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $0.04 million and $0.08 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net loss is allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to the relative ownership interests of the holders of non-controlling interests in Levo, an entity formed by us with Stonepeak and Evolve. We own 51% of Levo's common units and Stonepeak and Evolve own 49% of Levo's common units. We have determined that Levo is a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated Levo and recorded a non-controlling interest for the share of Levo owned by Stonepeak and Evolve during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Tax implications and fund performance data are also provided in the press release.","Principal Real Estate Fund Announces Notification of Sources of Distribution Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The Principal Real Estate Income Fund (PGZ) has announced a distribution of $0.1050 per share to shareholders, with 42% from net investment income and 58% from return of capital. The Fund may have distributed more than its income, potentially resulting in a return of capital to investors. Tax implications and fund performance data are also provided in the press release. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of distribution sources by the Principal Real Estate Income Fund (PGZ) highlights a significant portion, 58% for the current distribution and 60.55% for the fiscal year-to-date, being attributed to the return of capital. This indicates that the distributions are not solely from the fund's earnings but also from the capital initially invested by shareholders. Such a high return of capital percentage could imply that the fund's income-generating assets may not be performing at a level sufficient to sustain the distributions solely from investment income and realized capital gains.Investors typically look for funds that can generate income from their operations without dipping into the capital base, as a consistent return of capital can erode the asset base over time and potentially reduce the fund's ability to generate future income. The annualized distribution rate of 11.27% of NAV is attractive, but the negative 5-year average annual total return of -2.62% warrants caution, as it suggests that the fund has underperformed in the longer term, which could be a red flag for potential and current investors. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the classification of distributions is important for shareholders. The Fund's notice indicates that for tax purposes, the character of distributions may differ from what is reported under GAAP. This can affect investors' tax liabilities, as return of capital is typically not taxable in the year it is received but instead reduces the cost basis of the investment, potentially increasing capital gains tax upon sale of the shares.Furthermore, the fund's estimation that distributions may exceed income suggests that investors should prepare for the possibility that a larger portion of their distributions could be classified as taxable income. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will be made after the end of the fiscal year, which underscores the importance of tax planning and the need for shareholders to consult with tax professionals to understand the implications on their personal tax situations. Market Research Analyst Examining the fund's performance, a key point is the discrepancy between the NAV performance and the market price performance. While the NAV performance may be indicative of the fund's investment performance, it does not directly measure the value of a shareholder's investment. Shareholders must consider the market price, which reflects supply and demand dynamics in the open market.The reported cumulative total return on NAV of 18.82% for the fiscal year-to-date suggests that the fund has had a strong recent performance. However, this figure must be balanced against the 5-year average annual total return, which is negative. This contrast may influence investor sentiment and decision-making, as it points to potential volatility and inconsistency in returns over time. Shareholders and potential investors should weigh these factors when evaluating the fund's long-term growth prospects and stability. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM DENVER, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Principal Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE: PGZ) announces the sources of a distribution paid on March 28, 2024 of $0.1050 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan. This press release is issued as required by an exemptive order granted to the Fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and includes the notice below sent to shareholders regarding the source of the distribution. Statement Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), the Fund estimates the following percentages, of the total distribution amount per share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the Fund. Current Distribution from: Per Share ($) % Net Investment Income 0.0441 42.00 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain 0.0000 0.00 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain 0.0000 0.00 % Return of Capital or other Capital Source 0.0609 58.00 % Total (per common share) 0.1050 100.00 % Fiscal Year-to-Date Cumulative Distributions from: Per Share ($) % Net Investment Income 0.2071 39.45 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain 0.0000 0.00 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain 0.0000 0.00 % Return of Capital or other Capital Source 0.3179 60.55 % Total (per common share) 0.5250 100.00 % The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The timing and character of distributions for federal income tax purposes are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. As such, all or a portion of this distribution may be reportable as taxable income on your 2024 federal income tax return. The final tax character of any distribution declared in 2024 will be determined in January 2025 and reported to you on IRS Form 1099-DIV. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and not for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund's Net Asset Value per share (""NAV""), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution record date.

While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution Plan. Furthermore, the Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any potential distribution and the income, capital gain or capital available. The Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the Fund's distribution level, taking into consideration the Fund's net asset value and the financial market environment. The Fund's distribution policy is subject to modification by the Board of Trustees at any time.

The collaboration with ArriVent aims to accelerate the clinical trial, targeting EGFR mutations in lung cancer patients. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Clinical Research Analyst The initiation of the Phase 1b clinical study combining InnoCare's ICP-189 with ArriVent's furmonertinib marks a significant step in the exploration of new treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study's progression into patient dosing indicates a transition from theoretical research to practical application, which could potentially lead to a new standard of care if the results prove positive. The combination therapy targets two different molecular pathways, with SHP2 inhibitors like ICP-189 working to enhance anti-tumor activity and furmonertinib selectively inhibiting EGFR mutations known to drive cancer progression.The strategic collaboration between InnoCare and ArriVent reflects an emerging trend in the pharmaceutical industry where companies combine resources and expertise to expedite the development of promising therapies. Given the prevalence of NSCLC and the limited treatment options for advanced stages, this study could have a substantial impact on the market if the therapy demonstrates a significant clinical benefit. The safety profile and preliminary efficacy of ICP-189 as a monotherapy, coupled with furmonertinib's Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, suggest a strong foundation for the combination's potential success. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical market, particularly within oncology, is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes based on clinical trial outcomes. The dosing of the first patient in this Phase 1b study is an important milestone for investors to monitor, as it signals the progression of InnoCare's pipeline and potential for future revenue streams. The Breakthrough Therapy designation already granted to furmonertinib by the FDA is indicative of the drug's potential and could facilitate a faster route to market if clinical trials are successful.Investors should be aware of the implications of this study on InnoCare's market valuation and partnership dynamics. Positive trial results could lead to increased investor confidence and potential licensing deals, while any setbacks might negatively impact the company's stock performance. The focus on a significant unmet medical need within a large patient population provides a sizable market opportunity, which is a key factor for investment consideration. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Expert The regulatory landscape for new drug approvals is complex, particularly for combination therapies targeting diseases like NSCLC. The fact that furmonertinib has already been approved in China and received Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. for certain EGFR mutations bodes well for the regulatory pathway of the combination therapy. It is essential to consider the potential for expedited review processes that could arise from positive clinical data, especially in addressing high unmet medical needs.Furthermore, the regulatory success of furmonertinib in China, developed by Allist Pharmaceuticals, provides a precedent for the approval of novel therapies in the region. The collaboration between InnoCare and ArriVent may streamline the clinical and regulatory process, leveraging each company's expertise and regulatory experience. Stakeholders should monitor the communication with regulatory bodies as the trial progresses, as any positive endorsements or guidance can significantly affect the development timeline and market potential of the combination therapy. 03/28/2024 - 08:30 PM BEIJING, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- InnoCare Pharma (HKEX: 09969; SSE: 688428), a leading biopharmaceutical company announced that the first patient in China has been dosed in the Phase 1b clinical study of the combination of InnoCare’s novel SHP2 (Src Homology 2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase) allosteric inhibitor, ICP-189, with ArriVent’s furmonertinib, a highly brain-penetrant, broadly active mutation-selective EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is the predominant subtype of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. In July 2023, InnoCare and ArriVent BioPharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVBP) announced a clinical development collaboration, accelerating the clinical trial of ICP-189 in combination with furmonertinib in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC in China. Furmonertinib is being advanced by ArriVent in global studies in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations, including exon 20 insertion mutations. It is approved in China as a first-line treatment for adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion (19DEL) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, where it is being further developed for additional indications with Allist Pharmaceuticals (SSE: 688578) who discovered furmonertinib. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for furmonertinib for the treatment of patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Furmonertinib is also being evaluated for the treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR P-loop alpha-c helix compressing (PACC) mutations. ICP-189 is a potent and selective oral allosteric inhibitor of SHP2, developed by InnoCare for the treatment of solid tumors as a single agent and/or in combination with other antitumor agents. Preliminary efficacy was observed in ICP-189 monotherapy.

The hospital division operating income surged by 142% to $36.3 million. Net cash from operating activities was $1.3 million. The company aims to enhance cash flow by reducing operating expenses and optimizing its portfolio. Positive Total revenue increased by 13% to $247.6 million in 2023 compared to $219.3 million in 2022. Hospital division operating income rose by 142% to $36.3 million for the year ended 2023. Net cash from operating activities was $1.3 million for the year ended 2023. The company focuses on boosting cash flow through operating expense reductions and portfolio optimization. Negative Net loss attributable to Nutex Health Inc. was $31.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to negative $5.9 million in 2022. Net loss attributable to Nutex Health Inc. was $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, including asset impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $10.8 million in 2023 from $12.6 million in 2022. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue for Nutex Health Inc. reflects a positive trajectory in the company's earning power, with a notable 13% growth year-over-year. This is an indicator of potential market expansion or improved monetization of services. However, the net loss attributable to Nutex Health Inc. of $45.8 million, despite being a reduction from the previous year's $424.8 million, raises concerns regarding the company's profitability and cost management strategies.Scrutinizing the balance sheet, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $34.2 million to $22.0 million could signal liquidity constraints, which might influence the company's ability to finance operations and investments without resorting to additional debt or equity financing. The 142% increase in hospital division operating income suggests a significant improvement in operational efficiency or cost control within that segment, which could be a focal point for investors evaluating sector-specific performance.Considering the Adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million, a decrease from $12.6 million the previous year, it is important to analyze the underlying factors contributing to this decline, as Adjusted EBITDA is often used to assess a company's operational effectiveness excluding non-recurring items and non-cash charges. Medical Industry Analyst The healthcare industry, particularly the segment that Nutex Health operates in, is highly competitive and capital intensive. The increase in total revenue could be attributed to strategic initiatives such as technology integration and expansion of micro-hospitals, which are designed to provide cost-effective and patient-centric care. The impairment charges related to asset and goodwill, totaling $30.2 million, are indicative of adjustments to the carrying value of the company's assets, potentially due to hospital closures or a reassessment of the long-term profitability of certain operations.Investors would be interested in the company's strategic plan mentioned for 2024, including a focus on reducing operating expenses and portfolio optimization. These initiatives, if successful, could improve the company's financial health and position it for sustainable growth. The net cash from operating activities of $1.3 million, while positive, is relatively modest and warrants attention to the company's cash flow management practices.The medical industry is subject to stringent regulations and rapid technological changes, which requires continuous investment in innovation and compliance. The company's ability to adapt and invest in these areas while managing debt and improving profitability will be critical for long-term success. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the financial performance of Nutex Health Inc. is likely to influence investor sentiment. The reported figures suggest a mixed financial health: on one hand, there is a significant improvement in revenue and hospital division operating income, yet on the other hand, there is a substantial net loss and a decline in cash reserves. Market analysts might speculate on the potential for a turnaround based on the strategic efforts to streamline operations and optimize the portfolio.The healthcare delivery system is evolving, with a shift toward more decentralized and technology-driven models. Nutex Health's network of micro-hospitals aligns with this trend, which could position the company favorably in the market. However, the effectiveness of their recently implemented strategic plan will be important in determining their market competitiveness and ability to attract investment.Investors may also scrutinize the company's Adjusted EBITDA in relation to industry benchmarks, as it provides a lens to gauge operational performance excluding non-cash expenses and one-time charges. The slight decrease in Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year could be a point of concern, potentially offset by the positive trend in revenue growth. 03/28/2024 - 06:56 PM TOTAL REVENUE OF $247.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2023 VS $219.3 MILLION IN 2022, AN INCREASE OF 13%HOSPITAL DIVISION OPERATING INCOME OF $36.3 MILLION FOR YEAR ENDED 2023 VS $15.0 MILLION IN 2022, AN INCREASE OF 142%NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $1.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2023CONTINUED FOCUS ON INCREASED CASH FLOW THROUGH REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSES AND PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATIONHOUSTON, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nutex Health Inc.

DWS Municipal Income Trust Announces Termination and Liquidating Distribution to Shareholders and Distribution Rate Increase,2024-03-28T20:35:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) to Terminate Fund and Increase Distribution Rate,"DWS Municipal Income Trust Announces Termination and Liquidating Distribution to Shareholders and Distribution Rate Increase Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) to Terminate Fund and Increase Distribution Rate Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by the DWS Municipal Income Trust to terminate the fund and liquidate its assets by November 2026 marks a significant shift for investors and the market at large. The liquidation process involves selling off the fund's investments and distributing the proceeds to shareholders, which can have tax implications and may affect the market for municipal bonds, depending on the size of the fund's holdings. The increase in the monthly distribution rate to an annualized rate of at least 7% is notable as it suggests the fund is aiming to provide an enhanced return to investors prior to liquidation. This could be a strategy to manage redemptions by making the fund more attractive in the short term.However, the raised distribution rate warrants a close examination of the fund's ability to sustain such payouts without eroding the principal. Investors should consider the fund's underlying asset quality and income-generating potential. If the increased distributions are financed by return of capital rather than income, this could diminish the fund's NAV over time, potentially impacting the final liquidation value received by shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by KTF may influence investor sentiment towards closed-end municipal bond funds. The termination of the fund could be interpreted as a response to broader market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, demand for municipal bonds, or shifts in tax policy. Investors may seek to reassess the risk-return profile of similar investment vehicles, potentially leading to increased market volatility in this sector.The increase in distribution rate ahead of the fund's termination could attract short-term interest, but it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of such funds. Market analysts will likely monitor the fund's performance and the impact of its liquidation on the municipal bond market, including any shifts in yields and liquidity. Tax Advisor The termination of a municipal bond fund such as KTF has tax implications that must be carefully considered by shareholders. The increased distributions, if derived from income, are typically exempt from federal income tax, which is a key selling point for municipal bond funds. However, if distributions include a return of capital, this could alter the tax treatment and potentially result in a taxable event upon liquidation.Shareholders should consult with tax professionals to understand their individual tax situations, particularly as the liquidation date approaches. The timing of the liquidation could coincide with changes in tax laws or rates, which may affect the net after-tax proceeds that shareholders ultimately receive. Strategic tax planning will be essential to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential tax liabilities associated with the fund's termination. 03/28/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DWS Municipal Income Trust (NYSE: KTF) (the “Fund”) announced today that the Board of Trustees has approved the termination of the Fund, pursuant to which the Fund will make a liquidating distribution to shareholders no later than November 30, 2026. The Fund also announced that it is increasing its monthly distribution rate to an annualized distribution rate of at least 7% based on KTF’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share as of the then current distribution declaration date. The distribution rate increase will be implemented starting with KTF’s next monthly dividend scheduled to be announced on or about April 8, 2024. The annualized distribution rate target of at least 7% will remain in effect until the termination of KTF; provided that under certain limited circumstances, the monthly distribution amount may be reduced below the annualized distribution rate target of at least 7%. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s monthly distribution rate. A portion of the Fund’s increased distribution is expected to be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s NAV. As may be required by the Federal securities laws, the Fund will issue a notice to its common shareholders in connection with its monthly distributions containing information about the amount and sources of the distribution and other related information. Important Information DWS Municipal Income Trust. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Municipal securities are subject to the risk that litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions or the bankruptcy of the issuer could have a significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds and there may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to the net asset value. The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction. Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: (i) the effects of adverse changes in market and economic conditions; (ii) legal and regulatory developments; and (iii) other additional risks and uncertainties, including public health crises (including the pandemic spread of viruses), war, terrorism, trade disputes and related geopolitical events. War, terrorism, sanctions, economic uncertainty, trade disputes, public health crises and related geopolitical events have led, and, in the future, may lead to significant disruptions in US and world economies and markets, which may lead to increased market volatility and may have significant adverse effects on the fund and its investments.

Holders of the Notes will receive $69.2172 per unit on April 1, 2024, with any remaining Notes redeemable on or after April 1, 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by South Jersey Industries, Inc. regarding the unsuccessful final remarketing of its Series B 1.65% Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes is a significant event for both the company and its investors. The inability to remarket these notes indicates a potential lack of investor confidence or interest in the company's debt instruments, which could be symptomatic of broader market conditions or specific to the company's financial health. The fixed low-interest rate of 1.65% until 2029 may have been below the market's expectation for returns, considering the prevailing interest rates and the creditworthiness of the company.From a financial perspective, the automatic delivery of the Notes to satisfy the purchase contracts indicates a forced conversion that could dilute shareholder value if the company issues new equity to cover these obligations. The set price of $69.2172 per unit, along with accrued payments, will impact the company's cash outflows. The redemption option available from April 2026 at the principal amount plus interest provides some future liquidity options for the company but does not offer immediate relief. The market will likely monitor SJI's subsequent financial management strategies and its ability to service debt and maintain operations without the influx of capital from the remarketing effort. Market Research Analyst The unsuccessful remarketing effort by South Jersey Industries is indicative of the challenges faced by utilities and similar industries in raising capital through debt. The sector is typically characterized by stable but modest growth prospects, which can affect the attractiveness of such financial instruments to investors seeking higher yields, especially in a rising interest rate environment. This event may signal a reassessment of the risk profile associated with SJI's debt offerings.Investors and analysts may interpret this development as a cue to re-evaluate the company's stock, potentially leading to increased volatility in the short term. The company's future financing options may be perceived as limited, which could affect its ability to invest in growth or infrastructure projects. It is essential to monitor how this event influences the perception of SJI's creditworthiness and the broader utility market's dynamics, as it could impact the cost of capital for similar issuances in the future. 03/28/2024 - 06:52 PM Folsom, NJ, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE South Jersey Industries, Inc.

(NYSE: PRU) has closed a reinsurance transaction with Somerset Re for a portion of its guaranteed universal life block. This move aligns with the company's strategy to lower market sensitivity and enhance capital efficiency, with financial impacts in line with previous expectations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Prudential Financial's reinsurance transaction with Somerset Re represents a strategic move to mitigate risks associated with its guaranteed universal life insurance block. By ceding a portion of this block, Prudential is effectively transferring some of the risk and associated capital requirements to Somerset Re. This could potentially lead to improved capital efficiency, as less capital will be required to be held against these policies. Additionally, the reduction in market sensitivity means that Prudential's financial performance may become less volatile in response to market fluctuations, which is often appreciated by investors seeking stability.One aspect to consider is the cost of reinsurance, which can affect profit margins. However, if the deal is structured effectively, the long-term benefits of reduced capital requirements and enhanced stability could outweigh the costs. For stakeholders, the key points to monitor would be the changes in Prudential's risk profile and any improvements in return on equity (ROE) as a result of this transaction. Insurance Market Analyst In the context of the life insurance industry, reinsurance transactions are common practices used to manage risk and capital. Prudential's deal with Somerset Re is indicative of a broader industry trend where insurers look to optimize their product portfolios, particularly in lines of business that are capital-intensive or have long-term liabilities, such as guaranteed universal life insurance. The impact of such a transaction on the business could be multifaceted, potentially affecting the company's ratings, underwriting capacity and product pricing strategies.For competitors and the market at large, Prudential's move might signal a shift towards a more conservative risk management approach, which could prompt a reevaluation of the strategies employed by other market participants. 03/28/2024 - 06:19 PM NEWARK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Prudential Financial, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC and the Canadian Securities Administrators. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the tables above. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our business, we consider and use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of operating performance. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before share-based compensation, accretion expense, write-downs and impairments, gains and losses from changes in fair values of financial instruments, income or losses from equity-accounted investments, the effect of changes in accounting policy, non-recurring costs related to the Company's Recapitalization Transaction, litigation costs related to ongoing legal proceedings, and other income. We present EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance of other similarly situated companies in our industry, and we present Adjusted EBITDA because it removes non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that we believe may distort the comparability of EBITDA from period-to-period and with other industry participants. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not standardized financial measures defined under GAAP, and are not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than us, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools. We compensate for these limitations by relying on GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.

The Company does not file reports with the SEC and is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. 1 See press releases dated September 11, and September 18, 20232 See press release dated September 5, 20233 See press release dated November 8, 20234 See press releases dated February 7, 2023 and March 21, 2023 and “Technical Report on the Updated Mineral Resource Estimate at the Black Pine Gold Project, Cassia and Oneida Counties, Idaho, USA”, effective January 21, 2023, and signed March 10, 2023, prepared by Ryan Rodney, C.P.G of SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd; Gary L.

(CNS) announces distribution sources and cumulative distributions for fiscal year 2024. The Fund's managed distribution policy aims to provide long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions. Shareholders receive distributions from various sources, including capital gains and return of capital. The final tax characteristics are determined post-calendar year. Current distribution estimates show a breakdown of sources for March 2024 and year-to-date. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The distribution policy of Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund, Inc. suggests a strategic approach to managing investor payouts. By declaring fixed-rate monthly distributions, the Fund provides a predictable income stream, which can be particularly appealing to income-focused investors. The flexibility to realize capital gains throughout the year and distribute them monthly is a noteworthy feature, as it may smooth out the distribution amounts and potentially reduce the market impact of large, year-end distributions.However, the reliance on return of capital to fund distributions can be a double-edged sword. While it is not immediately taxable, it does reduce an investor's cost basis, which could lead to higher capital gains taxes when shares are eventually sold. This approach could indicate that the Fund is prioritizing steady distributions, possibly at the expense of capital growth. Investors should be mindful of the long-term implications of return of capital distributions on their overall investment return. Tax Specialist From a tax perspective, the Fund's distributions could have varying impacts on shareholders. Distributions that are classified as return of capital are beneficial in the short term, as they are not taxed as income. Instead, they reduce the shareholder's cost basis, potentially deferring taxes until shares are sold. This can be advantageous for investors seeking current income without an immediate tax liability.However, the Fund's final tax characteristics are only determined after year-end, which requires shareholders to wait for Form 1099-DIV to understand the full tax implications of their distributions. This uncertainty can complicate tax planning for investors who need to estimate their tax liabilities throughout the year. Market Research Analyst The Fund's managed distribution policy could influence its market price. Regular, predictable distributions are generally viewed positively by the market, as they suggest stability and can attract income-seeking shareholders. However, if the Board of Directors decides to amend, terminate, or suspend the policy, it could lead to volatility in the Fund's share price. Investors and analysts alike should monitor the Fund's ability to generate sufficient investment income and realized capital gains to cover its distributions without eroding its asset base over the long term.It is also important to consider the Fund's investment in MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships), which can contribute to the complexity of the distribution's tax characteristics. MLPs often distribute a significant portion of their cash flow, which can lead to a higher portion of distributions being classified as return of capital. This can be attractive for tax purposes but may also reflect a different risk profile compared to other types of investments. 03/28/2024 - 05:09 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (NYSE: UTF) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In March 2015, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. This policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in MLPs are attributed to various sources, including net investment income and return of capital. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.

Here we share our latest data, insights and news about small and microbusinesses. Venture Forward is a GoDaddy research initiative established in 2018 to quantify the growth and impact of online microbusinesses on their local economies, and to provide a unique view into the attitudes, demographics and needs of these entrepreneurs (GoDaddy defines microbusinesses as small businesses with a unique domain, an active website and most often fewer than 10 employees).Venture Forward supports GoDaddy's mission to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity more inclusive for all. We believe the more we uncover and learn about entrepreneurs and their microbusinesses, the better we can support them and advocate for their success. That's why we strive to share data and insights that are easily accessible and timely.We'd love to hear from you, so please leave a comment with your thoughts or takeaways. We encourage you to share this issue with other small business advocates in your network and if you haven't already, subscribe to get our latest insights delivered right to your LinkedIn newsfeed!Alexandra Rosen Sr. Director, Venture ForwardUpdated Microbusiness Data Hub and New U.S. Economic OutcomesThe Microbusiness Data Hub has been refreshed through December and the fourth quarter of 2023, including updated microbusiness density data, Microbusiness Activity Index, entrepreneur survey results and e-commerce trends.This week, we've also released our latest review of the impacts made by these entrepreneurs on job creation and unemployment based on the latest U.S. Census Data and BLS through December 2023.Statistically significant findings in partnership with UCLA Anderson Forecast economists include:1. At the county-level, every additional microbusiness entrepreneur adds about seven jobs, which has continued to grow based on data through 2023.Analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 found the effect of microbusiness entrepreneurship to be two or more new jobs for every additional entrepreneur, and from 2020 to 2022, about six new jobs.2. Adding 1,000 new microbusiness entrepreneurs in a county is associated with a drop of 0.11 percentage points in the unemployment rate.This means that studying Miami-Dade County in Florida, with almost 430,000 microbusinesses and 2.1 million people over the age of 18, adding just 1,000 entrepreneurs would reduce the region's unemployment rate by almost 7% (from 1.6% to 1.49%). And Cuyahoga County, Ohio (home to Cleveland), with over 72,000 microbusinesses, could see a decrease of 3% in unemployment from 3.2% to 3.09% by adding 1,000 new microbusiness entrepreneurs.Read more...GoDaddy Venture Forward Launches in Australia and CanadaIn February 2024, GoDaddy expanded its Venture Forward research initiative in two new international markets: Australia, with over 315,000 online microbusinesses, and Canada, which boasts over 770,000 online microbusinesses.We learned where those businesses are and how they're growing, and we surveyed thousands of the operators who own and run them.Some highlights:Australia is home to a thriving side-hustle culture. 61% of Australian entrepreneurs are running their business as a side hustle, meaning the venture is not their main source of income. In Canada, the barriers to entry for starting a microbusiness have never been lower. More than half of online microbusinesses were started with less than $5,000 CAD of initial capital.Discover more about Australia and Canada...Data ForwardData Forward is a data-driven content series that explores microbusiness trends and insights informed by GoDaddy's Venture Forward research initiative.

The portfolio includes public and private securities valued at $8.7 million. The Valuation Committee adjusted fair values of private companies, and the Fund entered into a fee waiver agreement with its investment adviser, waiving future management fees. Positive None. Negative Significant decrease in net assets from 2022 to 2023 Net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $30.4 million for the year Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, Inc. indicate a significant decrease in net assets from $30.6 million to $1.3 million within one fiscal year. This drastic reduction, from $4.44 to $0.18 per share, suggests a substantial decline in the value of the Fund's investments. The valuation of the portfolio at $8.7 million, contrasted with a high liability of $7.55 million, shows a tight net asset position, which could be alarming to investors considering the liquidity and solvency of the Fund.The fee waiver agreement with Firsthand Capital Management, Inc. is a strategic move to alleviate financial pressure on the Fund by reducing management fees. However, the stipulation of recoupment suggests that these fees could be reclaimed in the future, potentially affecting long-term financial stability. The net investment income of $1.1 million, despite a fee waiver, may not sufficiently compensate for the reported net losses of $30.4 million on investments, indicating a challenging year for the Fund and its stakeholders. Venture Capital Analyst The adjustments made by the Valuation Committee reflect a reevaluation of the Fund's private company holdings, which is a common practice in venture capital to align book values with market realities. However, the reported net realized and unrealized losses of approximately $30.4 million underscore the volatility and risk inherent in venture capital investments, particularly in the technology and cleantech sectors.The Fund's strategy of working closely with portfolio companies to improve performance and explore exit opportunities is a proactive approach to managing venture investments. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these efforts may be contingent on market conditions and the individual performance of portfolio companies. The Fund's future prospects will likely depend on its ability to navigate these challenges and capitalize on successful exits or follow-on investments. Market Research Analyst The performance of the Fund needs to be contextualized within the broader market environment, especially considering the impact of changes in market multiples within certain sectors. The technology and cleantech sectors have historically been subject to rapid shifts in investor sentiment and market dynamics. The Fund's ability to adjust its portfolio valuation in response to these shifts is critical, but it also reflects the uncertainties faced by investors in these markets.While the Fund's current position may seem precarious, it is essential to evaluate the long-term potential of its holdings. The technology and cleantech industries are known for their disruptive potential and high growth prospects. The Fund's future returns will hinge on the commercial success of its portfolio companies and market conditions that favor its investment thesis. 03/28/2024 - 05:35 PM SAN JOSE, Calif., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Firsthand Technology Value Fund, Inc. (OTCQB: SVVC) (the “Fund”), a publicly traded venture capital fund that invests in technology and cleantech companies, announced today its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, the Fund’s portfolio included public and private securities valued at approximately $8.7 million, or $1.27 per share, which includes approximately $0.01 per share in cash and cash equivalents.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Valuation Committee, which was composed of two directors, adjusted the fair values of the private companies in our portfolio. In arriving at these determinations and consistent with the Fund’s valuation procedures, and ASC 820, the Valuation Committee took into account information from an independent valuation firm and considered many factors, including the performance of the portfolio companies, recent transactions in the companies’ securities, as well as the impact of changes in market multiples within certain sectors. Effective September 30, 2023, the Fund has entered into a fee waiver agreement with its investment adviser, Firsthand Capital Management, Inc. (“FCM”). Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, FCM has agreed to (1) waive future accruals of the base management fee starting October 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024, with future recoupment to the extent permitted by the Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and FCM, and (2) waive $2.5 million of base management fee that has been accrued but unpaid as of September 30, 2023, subject to recoupment to the extent permitted under the fee waiver agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Fund reported a total investment income of approximately $0.1 million. After fees and expenses, including the aforementioned fee waiver, the Fund reported net investment income of approximately $1.1 million. The Fund reported net realized and unrealized losses on investments of approximately $30.4 million for the year.

Negative Delays in deliveries due to unresolved issues Litigation involving the purchase order 03/28/2024 - 06:05 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- dynaCERT Inc. (TSX: DYA) (OTCMKTS: DYFSF) (FRA: DMJ) (""dynaCERT"" or the ""Company"") provides an update regarding a purchase order of its HydraGEN™ Technology Units destined for Guyana (for details, see the Company's press release dated May 26, 2023 and the update dated July 31, 2023). The recipient of these HydraGEN™ Technology Units is a company located in Guyana (the “Recipient”). As announced on July 31, 2023, the Company previously delayed deliveries of HydraGEN™ Units under this order pending further notice by either the Recipient or its representatives, that certain outstanding issues were resolved to everyone’s satisfaction. Most notably, the Company was obliged to delay the delivery of all but two such HydraGEN™ Units and the Company was awaiting from the Recipient, through representatives, certain usual information regarding the specific electric voltage, engine information, On Board Diagnostic port types, and other data pertaining to the vehicles and equipment on which the HydraGEN™ Units of the Company are to be installed. Such information is necessary for the final assembly, packaging and shipping of the HydraGEN™ Units. The Company was also previously advised by representatives of the Recipient that the two HydraGEN™ Units that were delivered in 2023 are still awaiting clearing from Guyanese customs by an agent of the Recipient. Despite continued ongoing dialogue with representatives of the Recipient of these HydraGEN™ Units over past months, none of the aforementioned issues have been resolved to date. Further, the Company has been made aware of litigation that appears to involve the purchase order in question. This litigation consists of an initial claim requesting the return of the deposit that was received in May 2023, followed by a third-party claim among various extraneous parties claiming damages. These two matters have now been consolidated by the court. At a recent case conference the third party plaintiff’s counsel advised the court that he has agreed to give the Company a waiver of defence in respect of the third-party claim (such that the Company shall only require a defence to the deposit claim). The Company believes that this litigation has no merit against dynaCERT. Given the emergence of litigation and lack of progress in resolving delivery issues over past months, the Company has determined to suspend indefinitely this purchase order pending resolution by courts or clarification of the litigation issues in question.

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 05:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II (NYSE: SABA) (the “Fund”), a registered closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is notifying shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties of the sources of distributions pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION Distribution Notice. Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act, the Fund is providing its shareholders with an estimate of the source of the Fund's monthly distribution as required by current securities laws. The Fund’s estimated sources of the distribution paid on March 28, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows: Estimated Allocations for the distribution paid on March 28, 2024 (estimated as of March 21, 2024): Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.02900 $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.02900 (100.00%) Cumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of February 29, 2024, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.18470 $0.11830 (64.05%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.06640 (35.95%) Shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes. The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2024 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2025. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions. Effective on January 1, 2024, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Franklin Templeton Advisers, Inc. as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II (formerly known as the Templeton Global Income Fund). Performance of the Fund prior to January 1, 2024 is not attributable to Saba Capital Management, L.P.

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. 2The Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period’s distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV through February 29, 2024. 3Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV from October 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. 4The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the fiscal period October 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of February 29, 2024. Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.029 per share. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made. Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund’s most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=828803&owner=exclude. Certain Risk Factors: The Fund’s investment objective is to provide investors with high current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed‐end funds, reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including but not limited to index options) and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk. In addition, on an opportunistic basis, the Fund may also invest up to 15% of its total assets in private funds that focus on debt, equity or other investments consistent with the Fund’s investment objective. The value of equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.

The report includes audited consolidated financial statements accessible on the company's investor relations website or the SEC's website. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The filing of TuanChe Limited's annual report on Form 20-F is a routine regulatory requirement for companies listed on NASDAQ. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, including audited consolidated financial statements. Investors and analysts closely scrutinize such reports to assess the company's financial health, operational efficiency and strategic direction. Key metrics derived from these statements, such as revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow, are essential for evaluating the company's performance and potential investment value.From a market research perspective, TuanChe's report could indicate trends within China's automotive marketplace. For instance, if the company has experienced significant growth, this may suggest a rising demand for automotive services in China, potentially signaling a positive outlook for the sector. Conversely, if the report shows a decline, it could raise concerns about market saturation or increased competition. By analyzing the financials in correlation with industry trends, one can gauge the company's competitive position and growth prospects. Financial Analyst Investors often look beyond the raw numbers in an annual report to understand the underlying drivers of a company's performance. For example, TuanChe's cost structure, R&D investments and marketing expenses will influence its profitability and long-term viability. Additionally, the report may provide insights into the company's debt levels and liquidity, which are critical for assessing its financial resilience, especially in the volatile automotive industry.It is also important to consider the macroeconomic factors that may have affected TuanChe's performance, such as regulatory changes, trade policies and currency fluctuations. These factors can have a significant impact on multinational companies operating in China. A thorough analysis will compare TuanChe's performance against its peers to determine if the company is outperforming the market or if there are areas of concern that need to be addressed. Economist The broader economic implications of TuanChe's annual report should not be overlooked. The automotive industry is often seen as a barometer for economic health, as it is closely tied to consumer confidence and discretionary spending. TuanChe's performance can thus provide an indirect indicator of the economic conditions in China, including consumer spending patterns and the impact of governmental economic policies.Furthermore, given the size and growth of China's economy, shifts in the automotive sector can have ripple effects on global markets. For instance, changes in demand for vehicles in China can influence global commodity prices, supply chain dynamics and international trade balances. An economist would therefore examine TuanChe's report for signs of such macroeconomic trends, which could inform broader market expectations and strategies. 03/28/2024 - 05:30 PM BEIJING, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- TuanChe Limited (""TuanChe"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: TC), a leading integrated automotive marketplace in China, today announced that it filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 28, 2024.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year, leading to the delisting of the Common Shares from NYSE and TSX. Positive Shareholders voted to approve the acquisition of Tricon Residential Inc. by Blackstone Real Estate Partners X. The transaction involves Blackstone acquiring all outstanding common shares of Tricon for US$11.25 per share. Approximately 99.3% of Company Shareholders voted in favor of the special resolution approving the Arrangement. The Company intends to seek a final order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to approve the Arrangement on April 5, 2024. The completion of the Transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval under the Investment Canada Act. Following completion, the Common Shares are expected to be delisted from NYSE and TSX, and the Company will cease to be a reporting issuer under Canadian securities laws. Registered Company Shareholders can submit their Common Shares to receive the consideration for the Transaction. Beneficial Company Shareholders holding Common Shares through intermediaries must contact their brokers to arrange for the surrender of their shares. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Tricon Residential Inc. by Blackstone represents a significant event in the real estate investment sector. From a financial perspective, the unanimous shareholder approval indicates strong confidence in the value proposition of the deal. The cash acquisition price of US$11.25 per share provides a clear exit strategy for Tricon shareholders, potentially reflecting a premium over the trading price prior to the acquisition announcement.Investors and analysts will be keen to assess the premium paid, the strategic fit of Tricon within Blackstone's portfolio and the impact on Blackstone's financial leverage and earnings per share. The delisting of Tricon's shares post-transaction will consolidate Blackstone's position in the market, potentially leading to greater operational efficiencies and market influence. However, the removal of Tricon as a standalone investment option could reduce diversification choices for investors in the real estate sector. Legal Expert The transaction's adherence to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) and the stipulations of MI 61-101 showcases the legal complexities of such corporate arrangements. The requirement for a two-thirds majority and the exclusion of certain shareholders in the voting process ensures the protection of minority shareholders, a critical aspect of corporate governance.Post-transaction, the cessation of Tricon as a reporting issuer and the deregistration under the U.S. Exchange Act will relieve the company of certain disclosure and regulatory obligations, streamlining Blackstone's reporting processes. However, this also means a reduction in transparency for stakeholders accustomed to publicly available information. The legal intricacies of the Investment Canada Act will also play a role, as regulatory approval is necessary to finalize the deal, ensuring that it meets national interest criteria. Market Research Analyst The overwhelming shareholder support suggests that the market perceives the acquisition as beneficial for Tricon's stakeholders. The transaction reflects broader trends in the real estate sector, where consolidation is becoming increasingly common as companies seek scale and market presence. The deal could signal to the market that the real estate sector is ripe for further consolidation, potentially triggering similar transactions.Long-term implications for the industry could include increased competition among fewer, larger players, which may impact pricing, service levels and innovation. The anticipated delisting from stock exchanges may also affect the liquidity and marketability of real estate investments in the public markets, shifting some investor focus towards private real estate investment opportunities. 03/28/2024 - 05:01 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tricon Residential Inc.

(NASDAQ: TRIN) adjusts the conversion rate of its Convertible Notes due to a cash dividend of $0.51 per share.

Announces Adjustment to Conversion Rate of its 6.00% Convertible Notes due 2025 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trinity Capital Inc. (NASDAQ: TRIN) adjusts the conversion rate of its Convertible Notes due to a cash dividend of $0.51 per share. The new rate is 78.0543 shares per $1,000 principal amount, with a conversion price of $12.81 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The adjustment in the conversion rate of Trinity Capital Inc.'s Convertible Notes, in response to the company's cash dividend exceeding the initial threshold, is a strategic move that reflects the company's commitment to maintaining the value proposition for its convertible note holders. This adjustment ensures that the value of the notes remains intact despite the distribution of a higher dividend than initially set in the indenture agreement. It's an indication of strong corporate governance and a clear signal to the market about the company's financial health and its ability to reward shareholders while also considering the interests of its debt holders.From a financial perspective, the increase in the conversion rate dilutes the common stock to a certain extent, which could have a marginal impact on the stock price. However, it also potentially reduces the future cash outflow for the company when the notes are converted, as more shares will be issued at a lower price. This could be seen as a positive sign for stockholders, as it implies management's confidence in the company's future stock performance and its ability to generate sufficient earnings to cover the additional shares without eroding shareholder value. Tax Advisor Trinity Capital Inc.'s approach to distributions, aiming to disburse between 90% to 100% of its taxable quarterly income, is aligned with the typical strategies of regulated investment companies (RICs) to avoid corporate-level taxation. The decision to pay supplemental distributions to ensure that nearly all annual taxable income is distributed in the year it was earned, or to allow for spillover into the next year, is a tactical maneuver to manage tax liabilities effectively.For investors, understanding the tax implications of these distributions is essential. The mix of return of capital and/or capital gains in the distributions can have different tax consequences. A return of capital, for instance, reduces an investor's cost basis in the stock, which can affect capital gains taxes upon sale of the shares. Investors should closely monitor the tax characteristics reported on Form 1099-DIV and in the company's SEC filings to optimize their investment strategy in line with their individual tax situations. Market Research Analyst The proactive adjustment of the conversion rate for Trinity Capital Inc.'s Convertible Notes signifies a broader industry practice among growth-stage financial solution providers to maintain investor confidence and align interests between shareholders and debt holders. This move can be perceived as a reflection of the company's operational strength and its ability to manage capital structure proactively. It also underscores the importance of transparency in communicating with the market, as evidenced by the timely notice to the Convertible Notes holders and the trustee.For potential investors and market observers, such adjustments are important indicators of a company's responsiveness to market conditions and its commitment to upholding the terms of its financial instruments. It reflects the company's understanding of the delicate balance required to navigate shareholder returns and debt obligations, which is a critical aspect for assessing the company's long-term financial stability and growth prospects. 03/28/2024 - 05:05 PM PHOENIX, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Trinity Capital Inc. (NASDAQ: TRIN) (""Trinity"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of diversified financial solutions to growth stage companies, today announced an adjustment to the conversion rate of its 6.00% Convertible Notes due 2025 (the ""Convertible Notes"") as a result of the Company's cash dividend of $0.51 per share, payable on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 28, 2024. The ex-dividend date for such dividend was March 27, 2024. Effective immediately after the close of business on March 28, 2024, the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes will be adjusted to 78.0543 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes from the prior conversion rate of 76.9453 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which had been in effect since January 1, 2024. As a result, effective as of such time, the conversion price applicable to the Convertible Notes will be adjusted to $12.81 per share of common stock from $13.00 per share of common stock. The adjustment to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is being made pursuant to the second supplemental indenture, dated as of December 11, 2020, governing the Convertible Notes as a result of the Company's regular quarterly cash dividend discussed above exceeding the initial dividend threshold of $0.30 per share of common stock set forth in the second supplemental indenture and the Company paying a supplemental cash dividend. Notice of the conversion rate adjustment will be delivered to the holders of the Convertible Notes and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, in accordance with the terms of the second supplemental indenture governing the Convertible Notes.

(NYSE: RFI) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In December 2011, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 05:07 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers REIT and Preferred and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: RNP) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In December 2017, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year-end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.

Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. reported a negative net income (Loss) of $4,401,584 in 2023, with a net income (Loss) per common share of ($4.56). Negative The company's financial performance in 2023 showed a decline in net sales and a significant loss before income taxes. Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. reported a negative net income per common share, indicating financial challenges for the company. - Financial Analyst The audited results for Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. for the year 2023 indicate a significant downturn in financial performance compared to the previous year. A notable decline in net sales from approximately $33.65 million in 2022 to $31.51 million in 2023 suggests a contraction in the company's revenue streams. More concerning is the swing from a net income of $2.87 million in 2022 to a net loss of $4.40 million in 2023. This shift to a loss position could be indicative of rising costs, declining market demand, or both. Investors should be aware that a loss per common share of $4.56, contrasted with earnings of $2.97 per share in the previous year, may reflect negatively on stock valuation in the short term. Furthermore, the consistency in the number of average common shares outstanding suggests that the loss is not attributable to dilution but rather to operational factors. Stakeholders should consider the possibility of cost restructuring or strategic shifts in the company's business model as potential responses to these financial challenges. Market Research Analyst When evaluating the broader implications of Chicago Rivet & Machine Co.'s financial results, it is essential to consider the industrial manufacturing sector trends. A reduction in net sales could point to a loss of competitive edge or a slowdown in the industries served by the company. This downturn may also signal broader economic headwinds such as reduced capital spending or supply chain disruptions that could be affecting the sector as a whole. Long-term implications for stakeholders could include market share erosion if the company fails to innovate or adjust to industry shifts. It's also important to examine whether this performance is an outlier or part of a trend within the sector. If competitors are not experiencing similar declines, it could indicate company-specific issues that require internal review and action. Economist The substantial loss before income taxes reported by Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. could have broader economic implications, particularly if it reflects a downturn in the manufacturing sector. This sector is often seen as a barometer for economic health, as it is sensitive to changes in consumer demand and business investment. A contraction in manufacturing can lead to a ripple effect, potentially impacting employment, investment and GDP. From an economic standpoint, the company's performance might prompt discussions about the resilience of the U.S. manufacturing base and the need for policies that support industrial competitiveness. Additionally, the data could be used to gauge the effectiveness of current economic policies and trade agreements, especially if similar patterns are observed across the industry. 03/28/2024 - 04:45 PM NAPERVILLE, Ill., March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chicago Rivet & Machine Co.

The purchases were made at varying daily average prices, totaling a repurchase amount of SEK 4,208,206. Following the transactions, Millicom holds 705,905 treasury shares out of 172,096,305 outstanding shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share repurchase programs are a common method for companies to return value to shareholders, potentially signaling confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. The action taken by Millicom to repurchase its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) can be seen as an attempt to manage its capital structure more effectively and possibly to support the SDR price in the market. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, earnings per share (EPS) may increase, which could be viewed favorably by investors.It is also important to note that the repurchase was executed within the Safe Harbour Regulation, ensuring compliance with market abuse regulations. Investors may perceive this as a positive governance practice, reflecting the company's commitment to transparency and legal compliance. The execution of the repurchase through Citigroup Global Markets Limited indicates reliance on established financial institutions for conducting market operations, which can add a layer of trust for the stakeholders.However, it's essential to consider the opportunity cost of such repurchases; funds used for this purpose are not being invested in growth opportunities or other potentially value-adding activities. Stakeholders should weigh the immediate positive effects of share repurchases against the long-term strategic needs of the company. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Millicom's repurchase activity could be interpreted as a signal to the market regarding the management's perspective on the stock's valuation. If the leadership believes the stock is undervalued, repurchasing shares could be a strategic move to capitalize on this. Observing the daily average price paid for the SDRs, there is a slight increase over the days, which might indicate a stable or increasing demand for the shares, or reflect broader market trends.Investors often look at repurchase activities as a sign of a company's robust internal cash flow, assuming that the company would not buy back shares if it anticipated liquidity issues in the near future. This could potentially affect the stock's performance positively. Nevertheless, the market's reaction to share repurchases can vary and other factors such as industry performance, economic conditions and company fundamentals remain critical in determining the stock's future trajectory. 03/28/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, March 28, 2024 – Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 23,831 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between March 25, 2024 and March 28, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

(NASDAQ:VLCN) reported operational highlights and financial results for 2023, including the appointment of a new CEO, delivery of its first Stag to the Army Corp, and financial figures showing revenue growth and reduced net losses. Positive Appointment of John Kim as CEO and President to lead Volcon's off-road EV development. Delivery of the first Stag to the Army Corp for testing in humanitarian and military applications. Financial highlights show revenue growth to $1.1 million in Q4 2023, and reduced net losses. Plan of compliance with Nasdaq to maintain listing. Discontinuation of Volcon Youth motorcycles sales. Expectation to convert pre-orders to sales in 2024. Focus on Grunt EVO production and evaluation of new two-wheel products. 103 U.S. dealers and 9 international distributors. Potential delisting from Nasdaq if compliance plan is not accepted. Adjusted EBITDA showing losses in Q4 2023, Q3 2023, and Q2 2023. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Volcon's report indicates a strategic shift towards electric off-road vehicles, a market with growing consumer demand due to environmental concerns and evolving regulations. The discontinuation of the Volcon Youth motorcycles suggests a refocusing of resources on more promising products like the Stag and Grunt EVO, which aligns with industry trends towards specialization and niche market penetration. The delivery of the first Stag to the Army Corp is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a diversification of the customer base and a move into governmental contracts, which could provide stable, long-term revenue streams.The financial results show a concerning trend with a significant net loss and a high cost of goods sold. However, the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, combined with reduced losses, could indicate that the company's restructuring efforts are starting to bear fruit. The reduction in marketing costs and the elimination of certain sales positions suggest a leaner, more focused approach to cost management. This could be seen as a positive sign for investors looking for operational efficiency and cost control in a growth-stage company. Financial Analyst Volcon's financial performance demonstrates the volatility typical of early-stage companies in the EV sector. The reported net loss has decreased sequentially from Q2 to Q4, which may be interpreted as a sign of improving financial health and operational efficiency. The reported gains from warrant revaluation and the reduction of interest expense due to the extension of convertible notes' due dates are non-operational factors that investors should consider when assessing the company's core business performance.Investors should be cautious about the significant gross margin deficit and the high operating expenses relative to revenue. These factors could pose risks to the company's financial stability if not addressed. The potential delisting from Nasdaq is another red flag that could affect investor sentiment and the stock's liquidity, although the company's compliance plan and its evaluation by Nasdaq could mitigate this concern in the short term. Legal Expert The legal implications of a potential delisting from Nasdaq for Volcon are significant. Delisting can lead to a loss of investor confidence and a decrease in stock liquidity, which often results in a lower stock price. However, the company's proactive compliance plan submission and the ongoing evaluation by Nasdaq demonstrate a commitment to maintaining listing standards. The outcome of this process will be critical for the company's ability to attract institutional investors and maintain a favorable public perception.Another legal aspect to consider is the contractual relationship with the Army Corp, which could expose Volcon to specific performance obligations and liability risks. The initial positive feedback on the Stag's performance is promising, but the company must maintain high standards to fulfill government contracts and avoid potential legal disputes. 03/28/2024 - 04:45 PM AUSTIN, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / Volcon Inc. (NASDAQ:VLCN) (""Volcon'', the ""Company"" or ""we""), the first all-electric, off-road powersports company, today reported its operational highlights and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.Company Highlights:Completes hearing with NasdaqJohn Kim appointed as Chief Executive Officer and PresidentDelivered first Stag to the Army Corp. of Engineers on February 27, 2024Continued delivery of the Grunt EVO (1,189 pre-orders, 180 units shipped)Discontinue sales of the Volcon Youth motorcycles103 U.S. dealers and 9 international distributors covering 14 countriesVolcon presented its plan of compliance to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel on March 26, 2024 regarding ongoing compliance with the bid price and equity compliance. Nasdaq is currently evaluating the Company's plan and the timing of the decision is at the discretion of the Hearing Department. In the event that the Hearing Department does not agree with the Company's plan or if the Hearing Committee provides the Company a stay from suspension and the Company is unsuccessful in carrying out its plan, the Company's common stock would be delisted from Nasdaq and trading of the common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board.John Kim, an independent board member of the Company since July 2021, agreed to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer and President effective February 4, 2024. Mr. Kim notes ""I have a personal interest in off-road vehicles and personally own dune buggies and motorcycles. The opportunity to take the CEO role here at Volcon aligns my personal interest with the great products the Company has developed. I have taken the first couple of months to gain an understanding of where we are in product development and manufacturing of our products and have revamped the Company's marketing strategy to align with industry and consumer interest in off-road electric vehicles. I look forward to the challenge of building Volcon to be a leader in off-road EV.""The Company delivered its first Stag to the Army Corp of Engineers (Army Corp) on February 27, 2024 at its Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri facility. The Army Corp is testing the use of the Stag in humanitarian and military applications. Initial feedback from the Army Corp has indicated that so far they are pleased with how the Stag performs in relation to the Company's specifications. The Company expects to deliver additional Army Corp units (8 more) over the next 3-6 months. In addition, the Company expects to deliver Stags to its U.S. dealers who are facilitating delivery of units to consumers who placed a reservation with the Company. To date, the Company has over 900 reservations for the Stag, which does not require a cash deposit, and over 500 pre-orders for the Stag from consumers who have paid a deposit. Although reservations and pre-orders are cancelable until the customer takes delivery of the Stag, the Company expects that we will be able to convert some of these pre-orders to sales in 2024.Delivery of the Grunt EVO started in late September 2023 and our manufacturer has increased production of the Grunt EVO in the first quarter of 2024 and we expect that this will allow us to meet product demand as we move into the Spring/Summer sales seasons where we expect to see higher demand due to warmer weather in the U.S. As noted in our third quarter earnings release, we deferred the launch of the Runt LT, our smaller off-road motorcycle, to focus on distribution of the Grunt EVO as well as to start shipping the Stag. We are currently evaluating manufacturers to source components for the Runt LT as well as options for new two-wheel products that we could develop and sell over the next 9 - 12 months.To date, the Company's U.S. dealer count is 103 dealers. Although we have seen some attrition in dealers since our last earnings release, we believe the dealers we do have are strong dealer base and will continue to work to expand it in states like California where there is a large population of off-road enthusiasts. Further, California, as well as other states, are implementing regulations on off-road vehicles to limit carbon emissions, which will help the adoption of EV in the off-road industry.Financial highlights: 3 Months Ended Year Ended December 31, GAAP December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 2023 2022 Revenue $1,083,800 $487,430 $519,300 $3,260,988 $4,546,686 Cost of goods sold (6,283,944) (3,542,468) (334,647) (11,391,040) (13,412,820)Gross Margin (5,200,144) (3,055,038) 184,653 (8,130,052) (8,866,134) Sales & Marketing 1,365,186 1,870,532 2,380,617 7,405,705 5,694,556 Product Development 1,932,705 2,983,197 1,166,732 7,868,985 8,456,157 General & Administrative 1,384,872 1,544,344 1,568,700 6,388,007 9,046,778 Total Operating Expenses 4,682,763 6,398,073 5,116,049 21,662,697 23,197,491 Loss from Operations (9,882,907) (9,453,111) (4,931,396) (29,792,749) (32,063,625)Other Income (Expense) 6,467,255 (1,874,785) (18,096,798) (15,278,462) (2,171,780) Net loss $(3,415,652) $(11,327,896) $(23,028,194) $(45,071,211) $(34,235,405)Revenue: The Company's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.1 million, an increase of $0.6 million over the third and second quarters of 2023. Revenue for the fourth quarter includes Grunt EVO sales of $0.4 million compared to approximately $37,000 of sales of Grunt EVOs in the third quarter of 2023 and zero in the second quarter of 2023. Brat revenue in the fourth quarter was $0.6 compared to Brat revenue of $0.5 million and $0.5 million in the third and second quarters of 2023.Net loss: The Company's net loss was $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $11.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $23.0 million for the second quarter of 2023.Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 includes the recognition of $2.1 million in cost of goods sold to terminate the agreement with Torrot to produce the Volcon Youth motorcycles as we are discontinuing this product line and a write down of $1.2 million to reduce the inventory at December 31, 2023 to its estimated net realizable value. Sales and marketing expenses decreased as we reduced marketing costs and eliminated certain sales positions in the third quarter of 2023. Product development costs were lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the third quarter had higher prototype vehicle and parts costs. In addition, a gain of $8.4 million was recognized for warrants issued in our November 2023 public offering as these warrants were deemed to be liabilities and are recorded at fair value with changes being recorded in income. Finally, issuance costs of $1.4 million were recognized for the warrant liabilities for the allocation of issuance costs from the public offering to these financial instruments. Interest expense decreased by $0.7 million due to the extension in September 2023 of the due date of the outstanding convertible notes to January 2025.Net loss in the third quarter of 2023 includes a write-down of $1.6 million related to Volcon Youth motorcycles to reduce the inventory to its estimated net realizable value, a $0.7 million loss on the change in derivative liabilities related to the adjustable conversion features of convertible notes issued in May 2023 and the exchange of August 2022 convertible notes for convertible notes and the adjustable exercise price of warrants issued with the new notes issued in May 2023 and exchange of the warrants issued with the August 2022 convertible notes as more fully described in the Company's interim financial statements as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The conversion feature and warrants are no longer derivative liabilities as of August 3, 2023, and have been reclassified to equity as of September 30, 2023. In addition, in the third quarter of 2023, the Company incurred higher prototype vehicle and part costs of $1.6 million over the second quarter of 2023 as the Company received additional validation units in anticipation of a fourth quarter 2023 product launch.Net loss in the second quarter of 2023 includes a loss on extinguishment convertible notes of $22.3 million for the convertible notes issued in August 2022 for notes issued in May 2023 and an exchange of convertible notes for the August 2022 notes, partially offset by a gain on derivative liabilities of $5.8 million for the derivative liabilities noted above. The net loss for the second quarter of 2022 also includes the reversal of warranty expense of approximately $0.5 million due to the expiration of the one-year warranty on the Grunt as warranty claims were substantially lower than the estimated warranty cost initially recorded when Grunts sold.Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA for each quarter of 2023 represents net loss adjusted to add back stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, the loss/gain on derivative liabilities and warrant liabilities and for the second quarter of 2023, an adjustment for the loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and the add back of issuance costs in the fourth quarter. The Company's adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a loss of 9.4 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023 loss of $8.9 million and compared to the second quarter of 2023 loss of $4.2 million.

Investor information about the Company, including press releases, company SEC filings, and more can be found at http://ir.volcon.com.About VolconBased in the Austin, Texas area, Volcon was founded as the first all-electric power sports company producing high-quality and sustainable electric vehicles for the outdoor community. Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.Volcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. Volcon will also offer the Runt LT, a fun-sized version of the groundbreaking Grunt, better suited for small-statured riders, more compact properties and trails, or as a pit bike at race events, while still delivering robust off-road capabilities. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. Volcon debuted the Stag in July 2022 and entered the rapidly expanding UTV market and has shipped its first production unit in February 2024. The Stag empowers the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered UTVs cannot. The Stag offers the same thrilling performance of a standard UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.Volcon ContactsFor Media: media@volcon.comFor Dealers: dealers@volcon.comFor Investors: investors@volcon.comFor Marketing: marketing@volcon.comFor more information on Volcon or to learn more about its complete motorcycle and side-by-side line-up, visit: www.volcon.comNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONWe believe presenting adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors consistency and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effects of certain variations to overall performance.The following table reconciles net loss to adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:Adjusted EBITDA 3 Months Ended Year Ended December 31,2023 September 30,2023 June 30,2023 December 31,2023 December 31,2022 Net loss $(3,415,652) $(11,327,896) $(23,028,194) $(45,071,211) $(34,235,405)Share-based compensation expense 404,568 540,528 625,394 2,627,925 3,259,009 Depreciation and amortization expense 75,405 67,178 54,783 249,207 762,826 Interest expense 451,266 1,135,089 1,603,216 4,969,590 2,259,545 Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes - - 22,296,988 22,296,988 - Issuance costs 1,444,547 - - 1,444,547 - Loss (Gain) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities (8,365,424) 684,994 (5,792,788) (13,473,218) - Adjusted EBITDA $(9,405,290) $(8,900,107) $(4,240,601) $(26,956,172) $(27,954,025)Forward-Looking Statements:Some of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE: BYON) announces the relaunch of Overstock.com with 'crazy good deals' offering up to 30-70% discounts across various categories. The company aims to drive growth by enhancing customer experience and increasing sales conversion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The relaunch of Overstock.com signifies a strategic shift for Beyond, Inc. to reposition a well-known brand in the competitive online retail space. The focus on providing 'crazy good deals' with discounts ranging from 30-70% is a clear attempt to capture price-sensitive consumers and drive traffic to the platform. In the context of e-commerce, discounts can be a double-edged sword. While they can lead to an increase in sales volume, they also have the potential to compress margins if not executed with a well-thought-out inventory and pricing strategy.The expansion of product categories aligns with consumer trends favoring one-stop online shopping experiences. However, the success of this strategy hinges on Beyond, Inc.'s ability to manage logistics effectively, ensuring that an increase in SKUs does not lead to operational inefficiencies. In the long term, this move could help in building a stronger brand presence and customer loyalty, provided that the user experience and product quality meet customer expectations. Financial Analyst Investors will be closely monitoring the financial performance following this relaunch. The key metrics to watch would include sales conversion rates, average order value and customer acquisition costs. The announcement suggests that Beyond, Inc. anticipates the relaunch to contribute positively to growth, which would be reflected in future earnings reports. However, it's imperative to consider the costs associated with the relaunch, such as marketing expenses and potential impacts on working capital due to increased inventory levels.An important aspect for shareholders is the potential for market share increase. Should Overstock.com successfully recapture its legacy customer base while attracting new customers through expanded categories, we could see a positive shift in Beyond, Inc.'s market position. Nevertheless, this strategy must be sustainable beyond the initial relaunch hype to truly contribute to long-term shareholder value. E-commerce Strategy Expert The relaunch of Overstock.com by Beyond, Inc. represents a significant move in the e-commerce space, where differentiation is key to standing out in a saturated market. The mention of technology investment implies a focus on enhancing the online shopping experience, which is important for customer retention and reducing cart abandonment rates. The phased category rollout is a strategic approach, allowing the company to test and learn which categories resonate most with their target audience.However, the success of this relaunch will largely depend on the execution of their digital marketing campaigns and the ability to leverage data analytics to understand customer behavior. The use of a dedicated hashtag for promotion indicates an emphasis on social media engagement, which can be effective for brand awareness but needs to be coupled with strong SEO and content marketing strategies to drive organic traffic. 03/28/2024 - 04:42 PM ‘Crazy Good Deals’ across both legacy and new categories set the stage for growth MIDVALE, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Beyond, Inc.

Closed-end funds trade at a discount to net asset value. Positive None. Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DWS Strategic Municipal Income Trust (NYSE: KSM) (the “Fund”) announced today that the Board of Trustees has approved the termination of the Fund, pursuant to which the Fund will make a liquidating distribution to shareholders no later than November 30, 2024. Important Information DWS Strategic Municipal Income Trust. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Municipal securities are subject to the risk that litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions or the bankruptcy of the issuer could have a significant effect on an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds and there may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to the net asset value. The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction. Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: (i) the effects of adverse changes in market and economic conditions; (ii) legal and regulatory developments; and (iii) other additional risks and uncertainties, including public health crises (including the pandemic spread of viruses), war, terrorism, trade disputes and related geopolitical events. War, terrorism, sanctions, economic uncertainty, trade disputes, public health crises and related geopolitical events have led, and, in the future, may lead to significant disruptions in US and world economies and markets, which may lead to increased market volatility and may have significant adverse effects on the fund and its investments.

Financial Analyst The tender results of Rackspace Technology's debt exchange offer reflect a substantial participation rate, with 73.1% of the existing secured notes being tendered. This high rate indicates a level of confidence from debt holders in the company's financial strategy and future prospects. The exchange offer allows the company to manage its debt profile more effectively by extending maturities or altering interest rates, which can improve liquidity and reduce financial risk. The offer's structure, including the early and late exchange considerations, incentivizes participation and could impact Rackspace's short-term cash outflows due to the cash component of the consideration.From a market perspective, the successful execution of this offer could be perceived positively, as it demonstrates the company's proactive approach to debt management. However, investors should be mindful of the potential increase in leverage and its implications for the company's credit rating and cost of capital. The original issue discount on the new term loans suggests a competitive interest rate environment, which could be advantageous for Rackspace in terms of interest expenses. Market Research Analyst The technology solutions sector is highly competitive, with companies continually seeking to optimize their capital structures. Rackspace's exchange offer is a strategic financial maneuver that aligns with industry practices aimed at achieving cost-effective financing. The company's decision to target qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons reflects a strategic approach to engage a specific investor base, potentially diversifying its debt holder composition and tapping into international markets.Long-term, this exchange offer could signal to the market Rackspace's commitment to maintaining a balanced sheet and could influence investor sentiment. The timing and success of such financial operations are crucial, as they can affect the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities and maintain competitive edge in the hybrid, multicloud and AI technology solutions space. Legal Expert The exchange offer's reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act, specifically Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation S, is indicative of Rackspace's strategic use of securities regulations to conduct complex financial transactions without the need for a public offering. This approach is common for transactions involving sophisticated parties such as qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons.It is important for stakeholders to understand the legal framework governing such offers, as they are not subject to the same level of disclosure and regulatory scrutiny as public offerings. The conditions and restrictions placed on the exchange offer, including the prohibition of partial tenders and the setting of early participation incentives, are designed to maximize participation while minimizing administrative complexity. Stakeholders should pay attention to the company's compliance with securities laws, as any deviations could result in legal challenges or regulatory penalties, impacting the company's reputation and financial stability. 03/28/2024 - 06:44 PM SAN ANTONIO, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology® (NASDAQ: RXT) (“Rackspace” or the “Company”), a leading end-to-end hybrid, multicloud, and AI technology solutions company, today announced the early tender results of the previously announced offer by its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Finance, LLC (the “New Issuer”), to eligible holders in respect of any and all of the 3.50% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Existing Secured Notes”) issued by its indirect subsidiary Rackspace Technology Global, Inc., to (i) (A) exchange certain of those Existing Secured Notes for new 3.50% FLSO Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Exchange Notes”) issued by the New Issuer and (B) have purchased for cancellation certain of those Existing Secured Notes by the New Issuer for cash (collectively, the “Exchange Offer”), and (ii) fund (the “Funding Offer” and, together with the Exchange Offer, the “Offers”) new senior secured first lien first out term loans (the “New FLFO Term Loans”) of the New Issuer, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the offering memorandum dated March 14, 2024 (as supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Offering Memorandum”).

Positive Revenue increased to $89.6 million for 2023, a 5% rise from 2022. Net loss for 2023 was $38.2 million, a decrease of $7.0 million compared to 2022. Consolidated attributable silver production increased by 56% to approximately 2.04 million ounces in 2023. The Company is in negotiation for concentrate prepayment financing for the EC120 Project. Closed equity offerings for gross proceeds of C$7,800,000 for working capital requirements. Silver production increased significantly in 2023, with further growth expected in 2024 and 2025. Cosalá Operations and Galena Complex both saw production increases and cost changes. Positive results from exploration drilling at the Galena Complex. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Americas Gold and Silver Corporation reveal a mixed performance with a modest revenue increase of 5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher silver production. However, this was counterbalanced by a net loss of $38.2 million, including significant impairment and care and maintenance charges. The net loss improvement by $7.0 million compared to the previous year suggests cost containment measures may be in effect, but the impairment charge raises concerns about asset valuation. The company's negotiation for concentrate prepayment financing indicates a strategic move to secure capital for the EC120 Project, which could be a positive development for future production and revenue growth.Investors should note the increased cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, which could pressure profit margins, especially if metal prices fluctuate unfavorably. The projected production growth and operational improvements at the Galena Complex, including the high-grade silver-copper intercepts, could enhance future cash flow and reduce all-in sustaining costs, potentially improving the company's financial health in the medium to long term. Mining Industry Analyst The operational results highlight Americas Gold and Silver Corporation's strategic focus on higher-grade silver areas, a response to market conditions favoring silver over zinc. The 73% increase in silver production at the Cosalá Operations, despite lower base metal production and zinc prices, reflects a tactical shift that aligns with current market demand. The emphasis on silver is further evidenced by the company's anticipation of increased silver production from the EC120 Project and the Galena Complex's high-grade silver-copper mineralization.The company's ability to secure prepayment financing could be pivotal for the EC120 Project, potentially accelerating the timeline to production and revenue generation. However, the reliance on a single metal trader for financing introduces counterparty risk. The Galena Complex's rehabilitation and anticipated new stope areas coming online suggest operational efficiencies that could lead to increased production rates and improved economies of scale, a positive indicator for future profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Americas Gold and Silver Corporation's increased focus on silver production is timely, given the metal's industrial demand and investment appeal amidst economic uncertainty. The company's future growth prospects hinge on its ability to bring the EC120 Project online by the end of 2024, which could significantly impact the market's perception of its growth trajectory and stock valuation.The recent high-grade silver-copper mineralization findings near the Galena Complex infrastructure could potentially expedite production and contribute to an improved market position. However, investors should remain cautious of the risks associated with mining operations, such as volatile commodity prices and operational challenges, which could affect the company's stock performance and overall market sentiment. 03/28/2024 - 06:13 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSX: USA) (NYSE American: USAS) (“Americas” or the “Company”), a growing North American precious metals producer, reports consolidated financial and operational results for the year ended December 31, 2023. This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for the corresponding period, which have been posted on the Americas Gold and Silver Corporation SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca, and on its EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov, and which are also available on the Company’s website at www.americas-gold.com. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Revenue increased to $89.6 million for 2023 or 5% compared to $85.0 million for 2022, resulting from higher silver production, offset by lower mill throughput, lower base metal production, and lower realized zinc price during the year. A net loss of $38.2 million for 2023, or an attributable loss of $0.16 per share, including a $6.0 million impairment and $3.2 million care and maintenance charge at the Relief Canyon property. The net loss represents a decrease in net loss of $7.0 million compared to 2022. The Company previously reported that 2023 consolidated attributable silver production increased by 56% totalling approximately 2.04 million ounces compared with approximately 1.31 million ounces in 2022. Consolidated attributable cash costs of $13.21/oz silver produced[1] and all-in sustaining costs of $20.44/oz silver produced[1] during the year. The Company is in the final stages of negotiation with a global metal trader to provide concentrate prepayment financing for the capital requirements at its 100%-owned El Cajón and Zone 120 silver-copper project (""EC120 Project"") at the Cosalá Operations. The Company expects to close this financing in Q2-2024 with the goal to be producing higher-grade silver-copper concentrates by the end of 2024. On March 27, 2024, the Company closed its previously announced equity offerings for gross proceeds of C$7,800,000 with net proceeds to be used for working capital requirements at the Company’s Cosalá Operations and Galena Complex, and for general and administrative purposes. “Silver production during 2023 increased by 56% year-over-year which represents the Company’s first step in increasing its production to more silver-copper mineralization at the Company’s two producing mines,” stated Americas President and CEO Darren Blasutti. “The Company expects healthy silver production growth in 2024 and a further step change in 2025 as it brings on its silver-copper EC120 Project at the Cosalá Operations and finishes the maintenance on the Galena shaft. The Company is also encouraged by the impressive high-grade, silver-copper mineralization that it has recently drilled near infrastructure at the Galena Complex which could positively impact production both near and longer term.” Cosalá Operations The Cosalá Operations produced approximately 1.1 million ounces of silver, 11.5 million pounds of lead and 34.1 million pounds of zinc, compared with approximately 0.6 million ounces of silver, 15.3 million pounds of lead and 39.3 million pounds of zinc in 2022. Silver production for the year increased 73% as the Company focused on higher grade silver areas given the increase in silver prices and lower zinc prices. Cash costs per silver ounce increased during the year to $8.47 per ounce from $(19.03) per ounce in 2022 due primarily to the lower price of zinc combined with lower base metal production, and the devaluation of the USD relative to the Mexican peso. In late 2023 Mining began in Zone 120 in areas adjacent to the San Rafael Upper Zone with the Company expecting to realize an increase in silver production in the near term due the higher-grade silver areas in the Upper Zone and developed portions of the Zone 120 deposit. The Company is in final discussions with a metal trader to provide concentrate prepayment financing options for the capital requirements at the EC120 Project. The Company expects to close on this financing in Q2-2024 with the goal of producing higher-grade silver-copper concentrates at the EC120 Project by the end of 2024. Galena Complex The Galena Complex’s attributable silver production increased to 0.9 million silver ounces in 2023 compared to approximately 0.7 million silver ounces in 2022, or 41% higher year-over-year. Lead production for 2023 was 9.1 million pounds compared with 9.3 million pounds in 2022. All-in sustaining costs decreased to $28.64 per silver ounce in 2023 from $35.32 per silver ounce in 2022. All-in sustaining costs per silver ounce at the Galena Complex is anticipated to continue to decrease, as the benefits of economies of scale on the existing cost base are realized, the Company completes its major capital projects and realizes increased silver production from its large resource base at the Galena Complex. The Galena Shaft Repair project is expected to recommence in Q3-2024 and is contracted to be completed by Moran Mining & Tunneling. In Q4-2023, the Galena Complex undertook some critical rehab work on the Coeur Shaft to increase total skipping capacity and ensure that necessary waste development above 3700 Level is possible which will open up new high grade stope areas. During H1-2024, the Galena Complex anticipates bringing two new stope areas online which would increase the production rate resulting in critical incremental cash flow which will be directed to the Galena Shaft Repair project. The Galena Complex has been actively drilling near mine exploration targets with exciting results including an area between the 4600 Level and 4900 Level which had previously been a gap in drilling and has been consistently returning high-grade intercepts of attractive Ag-Cu veins. The current drill program is highlighted by the most recent intercept from Hole 49-703 as reported in our March 26, 2024 press release: Hole 49-703: 20,147 g/t silver and 5.9% copper (20,842 g/t silver equivalent[2]) over 2.1 m[3] This hole represents one of the highest-grade intercepts since the Company commenced the Galena Complex Recapitalization Program in 2019. The hole is less than 30 meters from existing mine infrastructure which should enable the Company to exploit this area quickly and generate additional silver production in the near term following some additional delineation drilling.

Contact information provided. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of Form 20-F by Golar LNG Limited is a significant disclosure that provides investors with a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and operational performance for the year ended December 31, 2023. From a financial analysis standpoint, the document includes vital information such as audited financial statements, risk factors and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.Investors and analysts look for trends in revenue, expenses and profitability, as well as any changes in strategic direction or market conditions that could affect future performance. The filing may also indicate how Golar LNG is navigating the volatile energy market, especially in the context of LNG (liquefied natural gas) which has seen fluctuating demand and prices due to geopolitical tensions and shifts towards renewable energy sources.It's important to examine the company's debt levels, liquidity position and cash flows to assess its financial stability. This can impact its ability to finance operations, invest in new projects, or return value to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks. Any significant deviations from industry norms or exceptional results could either raise red flags or indicate a competitive advantage. Energy Market Analyst As an energy market analyst, it is essential to understand the implications of Golar LNG's financial results within the broader context of the LNG market. The LNG industry is highly influenced by global energy prices, supply and demand dynamics and international trade flows. The Form 20-F filing could provide insights into Golar LNG's operational efficiency, asset utilization and how it is positioned relative to its peers in the industry.Moreover, the company's strategic initiatives, such as investments in new technologies or partnerships, are important in maintaining competitiveness. For instance, if Golar LNG is advancing in floating LNG (FLNG) technology, it could be a game-changer for accessing remote gas fields and reducing costs. This positions the company in a niche market with less competition and potentially higher margins.Additionally, the report may reveal how the company is managing regulatory changes and environmental considerations, which are increasingly important to investors who are focused on sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria. 03/28/2024 - 05:47 PM Golar LNG Limited announces that it has filed its Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. Form 20-F can be downloaded from the link below, is available on our website (www.golarlng.com) and shareholders may receive a hard copy free of charge upon request.

The Fund’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”) was reduced by the amount of the distribution. The Record Date, Ex-Dividend Date, Payable Date, and Cents-Per-Share are as follows: THE FAIRHOLME FOCUSED INCOME FUND Distribution Type Record Date Ex-Dividend Date Payable Date Cents-Per-Share Ordinary Income March 27, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 28, 2024 $0.09267 Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses should be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the Fund, and it may be obtained by calling Shareholder Services at (866) 202-2263 or visiting our website www.fairholmefunds.com. Read it carefully before investing. Investing in the Fund involves risk including loss of principal. The Fund is a non-diversified mutual fund, which means that the Fund invests in a smaller number of securities when compared to more diversified funds. This strategy exposes the Fund and its shareholders to greater risk of loss from adverse developments affecting portfolio companies. The Fund’s investments are also subject to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the value of a security will decline because of a change in general interest rates. Investments subject to interest rate risk will usually decrease in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates decline. Also, securities with long maturities typically experience a more pronounced change in value when interest rates change. Debt securities are subject to credit risk (potential default by the issuer). The Fund may invest without limit in lower-rated securities. Compared to higher-rated fixed income securities, lower-rated debt may entail greater risk of default and market volatility.

(""Payfare"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: PAY) (OTCQX: PYFRF) today announces that, as a result of delay by one of the Company's material vendors in completing its annual System and Organization Controls (""SOC 1"") auditor's report, which report is required in order for the Company's auditors to issue their opinion with respect to the Company's audited annual financial statements, the Company will not be able to file its audited annual financial statements, the related management's discussion and analysis, and the accompanying chief executive officer and chief financial officer certification for its financial year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Annual Filings""), within 90 days of December 31, 2023, as required under Parts 4 and 5 of National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument 52-109 – Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings. As a result, the Company will also be required to delay filing of its Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""AIF""). Payfare reaffirms its previously issued fourth quarter and full year 2023 guidance on its revenues and earnings and reiterates that the delay in receiving the SOC 1 report from the vendor has no impact on the Company's financial outlook. The Company made an application to the Ontario Securities Commission (the ""OSC""), as its principal regulator, under National Policy 12-203 – Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults (""NP 12-203"") requesting that a management cease trade order (""MCTO"") be imposed in respect of the late filing of the Annual Filings. If the MCTO is granted, the MCTO will at minimum prohibit the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer from trading in securities of the Company for so long as the Annual Filings are not filed.

The Company has the necessary financial and human resources to remedy the default and expects to remedy the default by filing the Annual Filings by April 12, 2024 and will issue a news release announcing completion of filing of the Annual Filings at such time as they are completed and filed. When the filing date is definitively determined, the Company will schedule a conference call to discuss the financial results and host a live question and answer session with analysts. Upon filing its Annual Filings, the Company will also file its AIF. The delay in the Annual Filings is due solely to the delay in receiving the SOC 1 report from a vendor. The Company confirms that there have been no material business developments or other material information relating to its affairs as of the date of this news release that have not been generally disclosed, and is not subject to any insolvency proceedings. Until the Company files the Annual Filings, it will comply with the alternative information guidelines set out in NP 12-203, including issuing bi-weekly default status reports by way of news releases, which will be filed on SEDAR+.

Breakthrough designations for cancer detection tests, positive clinical trial results, and partnerships with pharma companies were key developments. Despite revenue decreases, the company aims for breakeven in H1 2024. Positive Burning Rock Biotech reported a 14.9% decrease in Q4 2023 revenues compared to the same period in 2022. The company's central laboratory business revenue declined by 28.7% in Q4 2023. Revenue from in-hospital business decreased by 32.3% in Q4 2023, excluding one-off adjustments. Pharma research and development services revenue increased by 47.8% in Q4 2023. Gross profit decreased by 22.9% in Q4 2023, with a gross margin of 64.5%. Operating expenses decreased by 23.3% in Q4 2023 due to budget control measures. Net loss for Q4 2023 was RMB162.2 million, an improvement from the same period in 2022. Full year 2023 revenues decreased by 4.6% compared to 2022. Revenue from central laboratory business decreased by 26.0% in 2023. In-hospital business revenue increased by 7.6% in 2023. Pharma research and development services revenue increased by 58.4% in 2023. Gross profit decreased by 4.4% in 2023, with a gross margin of 67.6%. Operating expenses decreased by 24.1% in 2023, contributing to a reduced net loss compared to 2022. Burning Rock Biotech aims for breakeven in H1 2024 based on non-GAAP gross profit and SG&A expenses. The company will host a conference call on March 29, 2024, to discuss financial results and provide guidance for 2024. Negative Revenues saw declines in both Q4 2023 and full year 2023, indicating a challenging business environment. Gross profit margins decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Operating expenses reduction may impact future growth and innovation initiatives. Net loss for Q4 2023, although improved from 2022, still indicates financial challenges. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Burning Rock Biotech Limited demonstrate a complex fiscal landscape. While the company shows a decrease in quarterly revenue by 14.9% and a full-year revenue decrease of 4.6%, it's noteworthy that the pharma research and development services sector experienced a significant increase of 47.8% for the quarter and 58.4% for the year. These contrasting figures suggest that while the company's traditional central laboratory business faces challenges, possibly due to market saturation or strategic refocusing, there is substantial growth in the pharma services sector.The reported net loss reduction from RMB216.2 million to RMB162.2 million for the quarter and from RMB971.2 million to RMB653.7 million for the year indicates effective cost management and operational efficiency improvements. This is further supported by the company's optimism in achieving breakeven in the first half of 2024. However, investors should remain cautious and consider the volatility of the biotech sector, potential regulatory hurdles and the competitive landscape before making investment decisions. Medical Research Analyst The Breakthrough Device Designation for the OverC™ Multi-Cancer Detection Blood Test by both the FDA and NMPA highlights Burning Rock's potential to revolutionize early cancer detection. This dual recognition could accelerate the test's adoption and reimbursement, opening significant market opportunities. However, the true impact on the company's financials will depend on the speed of market penetration, the competitive landscape and the ongoing cost of research and development.The collaboration with AstraZeneca for companion diagnostics development in breast and prostatic cancer represents a strategic move to solidify Burning Rock's presence in precision oncology. The 24% increase in contract value during 2023 is a positive indicator of the company's growing influence and the industry's trust in its capabilities. Nonetheless, the long-term success of these partnerships hinges on the clinical outcomes and the regulatory environment, which can be unpredictable in the biotech field. Market Research Analyst Burning Rock's strategic shift towards in-hospital business, despite a short-term revenue decrease, might be a calculated move to establish a stronger foothold within hospitals. This could potentially lead to more stable, long-term revenue streams. However, the decrease in gross margin for in-hospital business from 63.5% to 44.8% (excluding one-off adjustments) could be a concern if not managed carefully.The company's focus on efficiency and cost reduction is commendable. The significant decrease in operating expenses, including R&D, selling and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, indicates a leaner operation. If sustained, this could lead to improved profitability. Investors should track the company's ability to maintain R&D innovation while managing costs, as this balance is critical in the biotech industry. 03/28/2024 - 05:16 PM GUANGZHOU, China, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Burning Rock Biotech Limited (NASDAQ: BNR and LSE: BNR, the “Company” or “Burning Rock”), a company focused on the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology in the field of precision oncology, today reported financial results for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 Business Overview and Recent Updates Corporate Updates Completed profitability-driven organizational optimization, execution towards profitability well underway Early Detection Following the Breakthrough Device Designation granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our OverC™ Multi-Cancer Detection Blood Test (MCDBT) in January 2023, our OverC™ MCDBT also received the Breakthrough Device Designation by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in October 2023, making it the only test globally that has received Breakthrough Device Designation from both the FDA and the NMPA.

(DOMA) has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Title Resources Group (TRG) for $6.29 per share in an all-cash transaction, representing a 43.0% premium over the closing share price on March 27, 2024. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. After the acquisition, Doma's divisions will operate as subsidiaries of TRG, with Doma TechCo operating independently. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Doma Holdings, Inc.'s merger with Title Resources Group (TRG) represents a significant event that could influence the real estate industry's landscape. The proposed transaction's valuation at a 43.0% premium over the closing share price indicates a positive market assessment of Doma's potential synergies with TRG. This merger could create a more robust entity capable of leveraging technology to streamline title insurance processes, which may lead to cost efficiencies and improved customer service.From a market perspective, the consolidation of these entities could alter competitive dynamics, potentially affecting other players in the title insurance and real estate technology sectors. Stakeholders should monitor the combined company's ability to integrate its operations and realize the anticipated benefits, as these factors will likely impact its market position and financial performance in the long run. The absence of a financing condition suggests confidence in the deal's completion, minimizing uncertainty for investors. Financial Analyst The all-cash transaction offer for Doma's shares implies immediate liquidity for shareholders, which could be attractive given the premium offered. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of accepting the offer versus potential long-term gains if Doma were to remain independent and successfully execute its growth strategy. The involvement of Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. and the investment by Lennar into TRG are strategic moves that could enhance the financial robustness of the deal.Additionally, the 'go-shop' period allows Doma to seek alternative proposals, which could lead to a bidding war and potentially higher offers for shareholders. The transaction's non-reliance on financing and the support from Lennar Stockholders, representing a significant voting bloc, suggest a high likelihood of the deal proceeding, barring regulatory hurdles or a superior proposal. Legal Expert The merger's complexity is evident in the multiple legal advisors involved, highlighting the need for specialized legal expertise in financial, insurance regulatory and corporate law. The transaction's success hinges on navigating regulatory approvals, which can be intricate given the insurance industry's regulatory environment. The voting agreement with Lennar Stockholders showcases the importance of securing key shareholder support in merger agreements.For Doma's shareholders, the definitive merger agreement's terms, such as the break-up fee and the conditions under which the Board can terminate the agreement for a superior proposal, are critical elements that could influence their decision-making process. The regulatory filings, particularly the Form 8-K, will provide shareholders with essential information to assess the transaction's fairness and legality. 03/28/2024 - 06:48 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Doma Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DOMA), a leading force for innovation in the real estate industry, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “transaction”) with Title Resources Group (“TRG”), one of the nation’s leading title insurance underwriters, subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals. In the transaction, TRG would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Doma for $6.29 per share of common stock in an all-cash transaction, an approximate premium of 43.0% over Doma’s closing share price on March 27, 2024, and an approximate 33.9% premium over the trailing 30-day volume weighted average closing price ending March 27, 2024. After the close of the transaction, Doma’s underwriting division, Doma Title Insurance, Inc., and its technology division, expected to be renamed Doma Technology LLC (“Doma TechCo”), are expected to operate as subsidiaries of TRG with Doma TechCo operating on a separately-capitalized basis. Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (conducting its insurance business as HSCM Bermuda or “HSCM”) would maintain an investment in Doma through Doma TechCo. Doma TechCo would continue to have access to underwriting services and continued technology deployment for Doma Title Insurance, Inc. “Today’s announcement is a win for Doma’s stockholders and for both companies’ employees and customers,” said Max Simkoff, Doma CEO. “This transaction is an important step in the growth and evolution of Doma, further strengthening us as we deploy our market-tested technology for large mortgage market participants.” “We look forward to partnering with the Doma team and providing excellent underwriting services to Doma’s many strong agents,” Scott McCall, president and CEO of TRG, said.

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 06:04 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 28, 2024) - Journey Energy Inc. (TSX: JOY) (OTCQX: JRNGF) (""Journey"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide updated guidance for 2024 with a focus on advancing its power business, and improving long-term sustainability.2024 CAPITAL PROGRAMUpon closing the previously announced convertible debenture financing on March 20, 2024, Journey used a portion of the net proceeds of $36.6 million to retire the remaining vendor-take-back debt of $11.0 million and has also repaid AIMCo $12.7 million of its term debt. This will create interest cost savings in 2024 as the new debt carries a lower average interest rate than the repaid debt. With enhanced liquidity for 2024, Journey now forecasts reducing leverage by over $20 million while maintaining production and advancing the development of two new power facilities. Journey today announces that it has expanded its capital program by $10 million to $51 million. Of the $51 million of total capital spending in 2024, $16 million is related to drilling and completions, half of which was already spent in the first quarter. Journey drilled 4.0 wells (2.9 net) in Medicine Hat in the first quarter, and also completed the two Poplar Creek wells drilled in the fourth quarter of 2023. Production from these wells is exceeding internal projections. Journey is planning to expand its exploration and development program with additional drilling in the second half of 2024, and will provide further detail on this expansion in due course.In addition to the drilling program Journey is planning to increase capital spending for facilities, waterflood and polymer flood to $9 million. This increase in spending includes facility debottlenecking in Cherhill; expanding the polymer flood in Medicine Hat to new, unflooded areas; and will also include a waterflood expansion in Matziwin. These projects are designed to increase recovery from well defined oil pools and also help flatten Journey's already low decline rates.Journey is maintaining its previously planned expenditures of $17 million, which include both the power facility currently under construction in Gilby, as well as the continued development of the Mazeppa project. Journey is preparing for an October 1 start up in Gilby but has not included any additional power revenue for 2024 into the current guidance. Journey is still awaiting results from the electricity cluster study, which is expected in late June. This will then provide more clarity around the Mazeppa start-up date. At full capacity, Journey's Countess, Gilby and Mazeppa power projects are forecast to provide cash flow of over $17 million in 2025.The ability to maintain production rates near 12,000 boe/d with limited capex is a testament to Journey's very low corporate decline rate of 13%, and our proved, developed, producing, net asset value (NPV@10%) of $5.00/share (see the February 22,2024 reserves press release). In addition to $17 million of power-related capital in 2024, approximately $18 million of capital will be devoted to land, seismic, facilities, polymer, and end-of-life costs. Most of these expenditures will add to Journey's future value and future cash flow but have only a minor impact on 2024 production volumes due to the expenditures being made later in the year. This leaves $16 million (approximately 31%) of budgeted expenditures to maintain current production volumes.In addition, $9 million will be devoted to end-of-life costs, land, and seismic.OUTLOOK & GUIDANCEThe below guidance incorporates many material underlying assumptions including but not limited to:Forecasted commodity prices;Assumptions of vendor-take-back principal payments, as these repayments are based upon realized WTI oil prices;Forecast operating costs, including forecasted prices for power;Forecast costs for the capital program; andForecast results and phasing in of production additions from the capital program.Journey is maintaining its current guidance pertaining to sales volumes and Adjusted Funds Flow ranges due to a series of offsetting factors. Increased downtime due to the extreme cold weather in January and increased downtime budgeted for turnarounds and routine maintenance has reduced initially forecasted volumes. Increased capital devoted to the polymer and waterflood expansions also reduces near term volumes (in favour of future volumes) due to injector conversions. Drilling capital will be phased-in for later in 2024 and therefore will have a minor impact on 2024 volumes. The impact of the incremental capital is to increase exit liquids (crude oil and NGL's) volumes by 500-600 bbl/d. The combined impact of the increased liquids production and the future secondary/tertiary recovery volumes positions Journey very well for an expanded capital program in 2025. The recent financing has provided Journey financial flexibility to exit 2024 without a significant working capital deficit. After the final payment for the AIMCo term debt on April 30, 2025, there will be no debt repayment obligations until 2029. This, along with the inclusion of new power generation revenue in 2025, will provide the Company the ability to significantly ramp up growth capital in 2025. This will include, but is not limited to, the drilling of two Duvernay wells. Journey has 35 net sections of largely contiguous land in the heart of the west shale basin. The land has been delineated by three basin leading wells. As an early indicator of the value of this play, on March 20 2024, two-year mineral licenses for approximately 30 sections of offsetting lands to Journey, and on trend in the oil window, were sold for over $1 million per section.Adjusted Funds Flow projections for 2024 remain unchanged from previous guidance since the reduction in the forecasted natural gas pricing is being offset by a minor increase in the pricing for oil. Journey will update its guidance in due course at regular intervals throughout the year as commodity price projections change.2024 Updated Guidance2024 Initial GuidanceAnnual average daily sales volumes11,500-12,000 boe/d (55% crude oil & NGL's)11,500-12,000 boe/d (55% crude oil & NGL's)Adjusted Funds Flow$70 - 73 million$70 - 73 millionAdjusted Funds Flow per weighted average share$1.14 - $1.19$1.14 - $1.19Capital spending$51 million$41 millionYear-end Net DebtNet Debt to Adjusted Funds Flow ratio$40 - $44 million0.6x$28 - $31 million0.4xReference commodity prices:WTI (USD $/bbl)MSW oil differentials (USD $/bbl)WCS oil differentials (USD $/bbl)AECO natural gas (CAD $/mcf)CAD/USD foreign exchange$78.00$4.50$15.50$2.25$0.74$75.00$3.75$16.50$2.75$0.74 Notes:The weighting of the corporate sales volumes guidance is as follows:Heavy crude oil: 19%Light/medium crude oil: 25%NGL's: 11%Coal-bed methane natural gas: 5%Conventional natural gas: 40%Journey has embarked on a careful and prudent expansion of its business plan to grow the Company profitably.

About the Company Journey is a Canadian exploration and production company focused on conventional, oil-weighted operations in western Canada. Journey's strategy is to grow its production base by drilling on its existing core lands, implementing water flood projects, executing on accretive acquisitions. Journey seeks to optimize its legacy oil pools on existing lands through the application of best practices in horizontal drilling and, where feasible, with water floods.For further information contact: Alex G.

While we may elect to, we are under no obligation and do not undertake to update this information at any particular time except as required by applicable securities law.Non-IFRS MeasuresThe Company uses the following non-IFRS measures in evaluating corporate performance. These terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. (1) ""Adjusted Funds Flow"" is calculated by taking ""cash flow provided by operating activities"" from the financial statements and adding or deducting: changes in non-cash working capital; non-recurring ""other"" income; transaction costs; and decommissioning costs. Adjusted Funds Flow per share is calculated as Adjusted Funds Flow divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the period. Because Adjusted Funds Flow and Adjusted Funds Flow per share are not impacted by fluctuations in non-cash working capital balances, we believe these measures are more indicative of performance than the GAAP measured ""cash flow generated from operating activities"". In addition, Journey excludes transaction costs from the definition of Adjusted Funds Flow, as these expenses are generally in respect of capital acquisition transactions. The Company considers Adjusted Funds Flow a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate funds necessary to repay debt and to fund future growth through capital investment. Journey's determination of Adjusted Funds Flow may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Journey also presents ""Adjusted Funds Flow per basic share"" where per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share, which per share amount is calculated under IFRS and is more fully described in the notes to the audited, year-end consolidated financial statements. (2) ""Netback(s)"". The Company uses netbacks to help evaluate its performance, leverage, and liquidity; comparisons with peers; as well as to assess potential acquisitions. Management considers netbacks as a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's profitability relative to current commodity prices. Management also uses them in operational and capital allocation decisions. Journey uses netbacks to assess its own performance and performance in relation to its peers. These netbacks are operating, Funds Flow and net income (loss). ""Operating netback"" is calculated as the average sales price of the commodities sold (excluding financial hedging gains and losses), less royalties, transportation costs and operating expenses. There is no GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to netbacks. (3) ""Net debt"" is calculated by taking current assets and then subtracting accounts payable and accrued liabilities; the principal amount of term debt; and other loans. Net debt is used to assess the capital efficiency, liquidity and general financial strength of the Company. In addition, net debt is used as a comparison tool to assess financial strength in relation to Journey's peers. (4) Journey uses ""Capital Expenditures"" to measure its capital investment level compared to the Company's annual budgeted capital expenditures for its organic capital program, excluding acquisitions or dispositions. The directly comparable GAAP measure to capital expenditures is cash used in investing activities. Journey then adjusts its capital expenditures for acquisition and divestiture (""A&D"") activity to give a more complete analysis for its capital spending used for finding, development and acquisition purposes. MeasurementsAll dollar figures included herein are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.Where amounts are expressed in a barrel of oil equivalent (""boe""), or barrel of oil equivalent per day (""boe/d""), natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent at nine (6) thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") to one (1) barrel. Use of the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation. The boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel (""Bbl"") of oil or natural gas liquids is based on an energy equivalency conversion methodology primarily applicable at the burner tip, and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms to the Canadian Securities Regulators' National Instrument 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities.AbbreviationsThe following abbreviations are used throughout these MD&A and have the ascribed meanings:AIMCoAlberta Investment Management CorporationAPIAmerican Petroleum InstitutebblBarrelbblsBarrelsboebarrels of oil equivalent (see conversion statement below)boe/dbarrels of oil equivalent per daygjGigajoulesGAAPGenerally Accepted Accounting PrinciplesIFRSInternational Financial Reporting StandardsMbblsthousand barrelsMboethousand boeMcfthousand cubic feetMmcfmillion cubic feetMmcf/dmillion cubic feet per dayMSWMixed sweet Alberta benchmark oil price at Edmonton AlbertaMWOne million watts of powerNGL'snatural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butane and condensate)VTBVendor-take-back term debt issued by Journey to Enerplus Corporation as partial payment of the purchase price for the asset acquisition on October 31, 2022WCSWestern Canada Select benchmark oil price.

Descartes Acquires OCR,2024-03-28T22:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Descartes Systems Group acquires OCR Services, Inc., a leading provider of global trade compliance solutions and content, for approximately $90 million. The acquisition strengthens Descartes' Global Trade Intelligence business, expands its global trade content library, and enhances its offerings for customers and partners worldwide.","Descartes Acquires OCR Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Descartes Systems Group acquires OCR Services, Inc., a leading provider of global trade compliance solutions and content, for approximately $90 million. The acquisition strengthens Descartes' Global Trade Intelligence business, expands its global trade content library, and enhances its offerings for customers and partners worldwide. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of OCR Services, Inc. by Descartes Systems Group is a strategic move that could potentially expand Descartes' market share in the global trade compliance solutions sector. From a market research perspective, the deal is notable for several reasons. Firstly, the global trade compliance market is growing due to the increasing complexity of international trade regulations, which boosts demand for efficient compliance solutions. Descartes' decision to acquire OCR, therefore, taps into this expanding niche.Secondly, OCR's GlobalEASE platform and its AI-driven content management process could enhance Descartes' product offerings, potentially leading to increased adoption by blue-chip, multinational organizations. This acquisition could also help Descartes to diversify its revenue streams by strengthening its presence in Europe and Asia, markets that are becoming increasingly important in the logistics industry.Lastly, the financial aspect of the acquisition, with Descartes using cash on hand for the $US 90 million transaction, indicates a strong cash position and a strategic use of capital. This could be seen favorably by investors as an indication of prudent financial management and confidence in the strategic direction of the company. Financial Analyst From a financial viewpoint, the acquisition of OCR by Descartes Systems Group represents a significant investment in the company's future growth potential. The price tag of $US 90 million is a substantial outlay and the immediate impact on Descartes' financials will be closely scrutinized by investors. The key metrics to watch post-acquisition will be the return on investment (ROI) and how quickly Descartes can integrate OCR's offerings to realize synergies.Investors will also be interested in the acquisition's impact on Descartes' earnings per share (EPS). If the acquisition leads to an increase in EPS, it could be viewed as accretive and thus positive for shareholder value. Conversely, if the acquisition dilutes EPS, it may raise concerns about the cost of the deal relative to the benefits. Long-term, the success of the acquisition will hinge on Descartes' ability to leverage OCR's technology and market presence to drive growth and improve margins. Legal Expert In terms of legal and regulatory implications, the acquisition of OCR by Descartes Systems Group could have several effects. The global trade compliance landscape is fraught with complexities and the integration of OCR's compliance solutions could provide Descartes with a competitive edge in navigating this terrain. The expertise OCR brings in export compliance, license procurement and product classification is critical as businesses face an ever-evolving regulatory environment.Furthermore, the use of AI in managing trade data content libraries is an innovative approach that could set a precedent in the industry. However, it also raises questions about data privacy and security, areas that are under increasing scrutiny by regulators worldwide. Descartes will need to ensure that the integration of OCR's AI technology aligns with global data protection regulations to avoid potential legal pitfalls. 03/28/2024 - 06:00 PM Strengthens Descartes’ Global Trade Intelligence Content Solutions WATERLOO, Ontario and ATLANTA, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Descartes Systems Group (TSX:DSG) (Nasdaq:DSGX), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, announced that it has acquired OCR Services, Inc.

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 05:20 PM TORONTO, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five years after the transformational Merger with Randgold Resources, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)(TSX:ABX) has been restructured and repurposed as a modern mining business with a constantly replenished, global asset base of peerless quality, managed by a team with an unparalleled record of recognizing and realizing opportunities, says chairman John Thornton in the company’s 2024 Information Circular published today and available now at www.barrick.com/agm and also filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov). “This Barrick is guided by a long-term, future-facing strategy, finely attuned to the demands and expectations of a rapidly changing world. Its aim is not only to secure the company’s sustainable profitability but also to make sustainability, in every sense, the core of its activities. Barrick’s pioneering partnership philosophy, a key component of its commitment to sustainability, has already transformed the once-derelict Tanzanian mines into a complex with Tier One1 potential; reconstituted the Reko Diq project in Pakistan and is now developing it into one of the world’s largest copper-gold producers; and after three years of negotiation, achieved an agreement for the re-opening of the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, where mining and processing have restarted and will be ramping up over the next two quarters,” he says. “It is clear to me that we have achieved all the initial objectives we set for ourselves. The renewed emphasis on exploration has placed Barrick in the unique position of more than replenishing the reserves depleted by mining year after year. Major organic growth projects, such as Reko Diq, the current extension of Pueblo Viejo’s Tier One mine life by more than 20 years2, and the transformation of Lumwana into one of the world’s major copper mines, will secure Barrick’s production profile well into the future. Expanding the copper portfolio was one of Barrick’s key strategic aims, and when the new Lumwana and Reko Diq are commissioned in 2028, Barrick will become a major-league producer. In the meantime, we continue to pursue opportunities for growing our copper portfolio.” Thornton says Barrick’s balance sheet, once burdened by heavy debt, is now one of the industry’s most robust and its strong operational cash flows ensure that it has the capacity to fund existing and new organic growth projects, as well as to take advantage of any fresh opportunities that meet the company’s stringent investment criteria. “Barrick’s footprint is being expanded and currently comprises mines, projects and exploration programs in 18 countries across four continents, covering the main prospective regions for gold and copper,” he says. Also in the Information Circular, lead director Brett Harvey says Barrick’s Board prioritizes renewal and diversity in its own ranks in order to enhance its already high level of global business experience and to make its membership more fully representative of the societies in which the company operates. “Since the Merger, seven new members have been appointed and women now account for 40% of our directors standing for election, while 40% identify as racially or ethnically diverse,” Harvey says. Barrick is pleased to host a virtual meeting format for this year’s Annual Meeting that shareholders may attend virtually by way of a live webcast regardless of their geographic location. The meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) at https://web.lumiagm.com/406457272.

The managed distribution policy aims to deliver long-term total return potential through fixed-rate monthly distributions. Distributions may include capital gains, investment income, and return of capital. Shareholders' tax basis may be reduced by return of capital. Final tax characteristics are provided after the calendar year. The current distribution breakdown includes net investment income, return of capital, and long-term capital gains. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The distribution policy of Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund, Inc. reflects a strategic approach to providing shareholder value. The managed distribution policy allows the Fund to realize and distribute capital gains regularly, which may appeal to income-focused investors seeking consistent payouts. However, the reliance on return of capital indicates that a significant portion of the distribution is not from earned income but rather from the capital base of the Fund itself.This approach could potentially erode the asset base over time if not managed correctly, especially if the Fund's investments do not generate sufficient returns. Shareholders might see a reduction in their tax basis, which could have implications for future capital gains taxes. It's important for investors to consider the sustainability of these distributions and the impact on the Fund's long-term capital growth potential. Tax Advisor The tax implications of the Fund's distributions are noteworthy. While return of capital is not immediately taxable, it does reduce the shareholder's cost basis in the investment, which could result in higher capital gains taxes upon the sale of shares. The recharacterization of distributions from REITs after year-end also adds a layer of complexity to shareholder tax planning.Investors should be aware that the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions can only be confirmed at year-end, necessitating a careful review of the Form 1099-DIV for accurate reporting. This underscores the importance of understanding the tax consequences of investment strategies in managed funds and the need for tax planning in relation to investment income. Market Research Analyst The Fund's distribution strategy and its effect on market price can be influenced by several external factors, such as market volatility and changes in the real estate sector. The current distribution composition, with a high percentage attributed to return of capital, suggests that the Fund may be prioritizing yield over growth. While this may attract short-term investors looking for immediate income, it could deter growth-oriented investors who might be concerned about the long-term appreciation potential of their investment.Furthermore, the announcement that the Board may amend, terminate, or suspend the distribution policy at any time adds an element of uncertainty that could affect investor sentiment. Market participants typically favor consistency and transparency in distribution policies and any potential changes could impact the Fund's attractiveness and, consequently, its share price. 03/28/2024 - 05:12 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund, Inc. (NYSE: RQI) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In December 2012, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share. DISTRIBUTION ESTIMATES March 2024 YEAR-TO-DATE (YTD) March 31, 2024* Source Per Share Amount % of Current Distribution Per Share Amount % of 2024 Distributions Net Investment Income $0.0681 85.13 % $0.0958 39.92 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0000 0.00 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0037 1.54 % Return of Capital (or other Capital Source) $0.0119 14.87 % $0.1405 58.54 % Total Current Distribution $0.0800 100.00 % $0.2400 100.00 % You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments. *THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

Key highlights include progress with FluGen collaboration, AI-driven study of ovarian cancer, and reduction in net loss per share. The company plans to host an investor call and webcast on April 1st. Positive None. Negative The company reported a significant net loss of approximately $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, despite only generating total revenue of approximately $1.8 million. Although there was a 50% reduction in basic and diluted net loss per common share for the full year 2023 compared to 2022, the overall financial performance remains a concern. Predictive Oncology's cash and cash equivalents decreased from $22.1 million as of December 31, 2022, to $8.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, raising liquidity issues. Cost of sales increased in 2023, primarily due to costs associated with Pittsburgh contracted services, which could impact the company's profit margins. While general and administrative expenses decreased in 2023, the decrease was mainly due to lower staff-related expenses and amortization, which might affect operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2023, primarily driven by higher staff-related expenses, potentially impacting the company's bottom line. Financial Analyst The financial results of Predictive Oncology indicate a significant net loss of approximately $14 million against a total revenue of $1.8 million for the fiscal year. This figure is a key indicator of the company's current financial health and operational efficiency. The reported 50% reduction in net loss per share from the previous year suggests an improvement in cost management or operational restructuring. However, the cash and cash equivalents have seen a substantial decrease from $22.1 million to $8.7 million, which could raise concerns about the company's liquidity and its ability to sustain operations without additional funding.From an investment standpoint, the revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, though modest, might be seen as a positive signal, especially when considering the company's focus on AI and machine learning in drug discovery—a sector with high growth potential. However, investors would need to weigh this against the high operational costs and the current cash burn rate, which could impact the company's ability to finance its projects in the short term. Medical Research Analyst The collaborations and studies highlighted by Predictive Oncology, such as the partnership with FluGen and the AI-driven study on ovarian cancer, underscore the company's strategic emphasis on AI-driven oncology research. The application of AI in clinical decision-making and drug discovery is a burgeoning field with the potential to revolutionize patient outcomes and treatment efficacy.Moreover, the successful delivery of results from the collaboration with Cancer Research Horizons on glutaminase inhibitors represents a significant milestone in the company's pursuit of personalized medicine. The ability to predict patient response to treatments could lead to more targeted and effective therapies, potentially opening up new revenue streams through development and commercialization milestones. Long-term, this could position the company at the forefront of precision oncology, provided they continue to validate and improve their AI and ML models. Market Research Analyst The involvement of Predictive Oncology in high-profile conferences and the engagement with key opinion leaders in the industry is a strategic move to enhance its brand visibility and attract potential collaborators and investors. The biopharmaceutical industry's growing interest in AI for drug discovery presents a substantial market opportunity for companies like Predictive Oncology. Their proprietary technology and biorepository assets could give them a competitive edge.However, the biopharma sector's adoption of AI is still in nascent stages and the market's response to Predictive Oncology's offerings will be important in determining their long-term success. The company's ability to convert scientific advancements into commercially viable products will be a key factor for potential investors to monitor. 03/28/2024 - 05:28 PM Company to host investor call and webcast on Monday, April 1st, at 8:30am EDTPITTSBURGH, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Predictive Oncology (Nasdaq: POAI), a science driven company leveraging its proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, extensive biorepository of tumor samples, CLIA laboratory and GMP facility, to accelerate oncologic drug discovery and enable drug development, today reported financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. The company reported a net loss of approximately $14 million on total revenue of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Q4 2023 and Recent Highlights: Reported meaningful progress with FluGen collaboration designed to bring a first-of-its-kind intranasal flu vaccine to market, as part of a multi-million-dollar project funded by the Department of Defense. Per the terms of the collaboration, Predictive Oncology will play a critical role in helping to make FluGen’s M2SR flu vaccine more stable and sustainable as it advances through clinical trials.Continued to engage with Cancer Research Horizons (CRH) on next steps following delivery of preliminary results from its first campaign with CRH, in which Predictive Oncology determined, with a high degree of accuracy, which cancer types and patient populations are most likely to respond to pre-clinical glutaminase inhibitors, informing future clinical development pathways.Completed an AI-driven multi-year study of ovarian cancer with UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. The study demonstrated that Predictive Oncology’s AI capabilities could be used to successfully build multi-omic machine learning (ML) models capable of learning relationships between the various datasets and ovarian cancer patient survival. Predictive Oncology sees potential to incorporate these models into clinical practice as a decision support tool to guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes and develop biomarker leads, digital pathology applications, and new predictive models for other cancer types for purposes of drug rescue, drug repurposing and drug combinations.Invited speaker and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) at several investor conferences aimed at raising awareness of the company among high-quality institutional investors and potential collaborators, including Biotech Showcase, the BIO CEO & Investor Conference, the 2024 NeauxCancer Oncology Conference, and the H.C. Wainwright 1st Annual Artificial Intelligence Based Drug Discovery & Development Virtual Conference.Reported a 50% reduction in basic and diluted net loss per common share for the full year 2023, to $3.48 per share, from $6.98 per share for the full year 2022. “While it has been just a little over twelve months since we implemented our new strategic vision for the company, I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made to date introducing our unique blend of assets and capabilities to leading oncologic drug developers globally, while in parallel continuing to incorporate learnings from this first year to further refine our business development efforts,” said Raymond F. Vennare, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Predictive Oncology. “By leveraging our PEDAL AI and machine learning capabilities, vast biobank of tumor samples, repository of decades of drug response data and CLIA wet lab, we are able to introduce patient and tumor heterogeneity into the earliest phases of pre-clinical development, enabling drug developers to gain insight into the future, increasing the likelihood of commercial success. “Perhaps most notably, we announced last quarter that we successfully delivered the results of our first campaign with Cancer Research Horizons. We were able to determine, in just a matter of weeks, which cancer types and patient populations would be most likely to respond to CRH’s glutaminase inhibitor candidates. With the actionable output from this campaign, CRH can now better prioritize the development of these compounds. We continue to engage with CRH not only on next steps related to this campaign, but on future projects that offer us the opportunity to earn potential development and commercialization milestones. Our work with CRH provided critical validation of our technology, and, as the leading private funder of cancer research in the world, is an important reference account for us. “We were also very pleased to announce last quarter the completion of a molecular characterization study in collaboration with UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh to AI models to identify the key molecular features that drive overall survival in ovarian cancer in stratified patient subpopulations. We are working with Magee on next steps, which could potentially include implementation of these models into daily clinical practice as a decision support tool to guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. “We remain in the very early stages of the biopharma industry embracing AI to increase the speed and accuracy of drug discovery, and I believe we are ideally positioned to be a leader in this rapidly evolving sector.” Mr. Vennare concluded. FY 2023 Financial Summary: Concluded the fourth quarter of 2023 with $8.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $22.1 million as of December 31, 2022, and $8.3 million in Stockholder’s Equity, compared to $21.8 million as of December 31, 2022.Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the yead ended December 31, 2023, decreased 50% to $3.48, as compared to $6.98 for the year ended December 31, 2022. FY 2023 Financial results The company recorded revenue of $1,780,093 in 2023, compared to $1,505,459 in 2022. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were primarily derived from its Eagan operating segment. The Eagan operating segment contributed $1,135,101 and $1,063,493 for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, while the Pittsburgh operating segment contributed $492,596 and $358,776, respectively.Cost of sales was $634,796 and $505,107 for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cost of sales increased primarily due to costs associated with Pittsburgh contracted services.General and administrative expenses decreased by $1,682,239 to $9,428,496 in 2023 from $11,110,735 in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in staff-related expenses of approximately $1,980,000. Additional decreases included lower amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets impaired in the prior year. These decreases were offset by higher professional fees including consultants supporting our management team and investor relations as well as other G&A expenses.Operations expenses increased by $328,843 to $4,127,268 in 2023 compared to $3,798,425 in 2022.

Financial Analyst Rail Vision Ltd.'s financial results indicate a pivotal phase in their growth trajectory. The company's cash position has been bolstered by recent fundraisings, which is a positive sign for liquidity and operational funding. However, the reported net loss for both the quarter and fiscal year, along with an increase in R&D expenses, suggest a strategic reinvestment back into the company's core technology and product development. This is a common pattern for development-stage tech companies where upfront costs are high before achieving economies of scale.Investors should note the revenue generation from the sale of the company's first systems. This is a key milestone that demonstrates market validation of Rail Vision's technology. The strategic partnerships and expansion in the U.S. market could pave the way for future revenue streams and market penetration. However, it's important to assess the sustainability of these revenues and whether they can offset the R&D investments in the long run. Market Research Analyst The partnership with industry giants like Nvidia and the expansion into the North American market are strategic moves that could significantly enhance Rail Vision's competitive edge. The affiliation with Nvidia's Metropolis program is particularly noteworthy as it connects Rail Vision to a broader ecosystem of AI and machine learning applications, potentially opening up new avenues for innovation and collaboration.Furthermore, the supply contract with a leading U.S.-based rail and leasing services company, potentially worth up to $5 million, is a strong indicator of customer confidence and could be a bellwether for Rail Vision's future performance. It is essential to monitor how these partnerships and contracts translate into long-term financial success and market share growth, especially in a niche market like railway safety technology where adoption rates and regulatory hurdles can significantly impact scalability. Technology Industry Analyst Rail Vision's focus on AI-based systems for railway safety positions it in a niche but increasingly important sector. The next generation of their AI-based system could represent a substantial technological advancement in the railway industry, which is traditionally slow to adopt new technologies due to stringent safety and regulatory requirements.However, the technology's adoption is contingent on not just innovation, but also on regulatory approvals, customer acceptance and integration with existing railway infrastructure. The successful delivery and evaluation of their systems by prominent railway companies in the U.S. and Latin America suggest that Rail Vision is making headway in overcoming these barriers. For stakeholders, the key will be to track the rate of adoption and the potential impact of Rail Vision's technology on improving safety and efficiency in railway operations, which could be a catalyst for growth in the sector. 03/28/2024 - 06:04 PM RA’ANANA, Israel, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rail Vision Ltd.

Allocation breakdown includes net investment income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, and return of capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notice from Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund regarding the sources of their monthly distribution is a key piece of information for current and prospective shareholders. The distribution breakdown indicates a significant portion of the payment is classified as return of capital (ROC), which exceeds the net investment income. This can signal that the fund is not generating enough income from its investments to cover the distributions and may be returning capital to shareholders instead.ROC is not inherently negative but can impact the fund's future growth prospects as it may lead to a reduction in the fund's assets under management. This could potentially affect the fund's ability to generate income in the long term. Shareholders might be concerned if this trend continues, as it could affect the sustainability of future distributions. Tax Specialist Understanding the tax implications of the distribution components is important for shareholders. The classification of the distribution between net investment income and return of capital has significant tax consequences. Net investment income is typically taxed at ordinary income rates, whereas return of capital is not immediately taxable. Instead, it reduces the shareholder's cost basis in the investment and can lead to a higher capital gain when the shares are eventually sold.Investors should be aware that a high return of capital percentage may require them to adjust their investment strategies, especially if they are relying on the fund for income. It is advisable for investors to consult with a tax professional to understand the specific impacts on their individual tax situation. 03/28/2024 - 05:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (NYSE: BRW) (the “Fund”), a registered closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is notifying shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties of the sources of distributions pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”).

Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act, the Fund is providing its shareholders with an estimate of the source of the Fund's monthly distribution as required by current securities laws. The Fund’s estimated sources of the distribution paid on March 28, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2024 year-to-date are as follows: Estimated Allocations for the distribution paid on March 28, 2024 (estimated as of March 21, 2024): Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.08500 $0.03873 (45.56%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.04627 (54.44%) Cumulative Estimated Allocations fiscal year-to-date as of February 29, 2024, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024: Distribution Per Share Net Investment Income Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Short- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Net Realized Long- Term Capital Gains Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount Return of Capital Per Share and Percentage of Such Distribution Amount $0.45400 $0.12337 (27.17%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.00000 (0.00%) $0.33063 (72.83%) Shareholders, prospective shareholders, and third parties should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan (as defined below). The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund’s distributions for federal income tax purposes. The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund’s annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund’s distributions as shown on shareholders’ statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2024 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2025. Since each shareholder’s tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions. Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust). Performance of the Fund prior to the close of business on June 4, 2021 is not attributable to Saba Capital Management, L.P.

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. 2The Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period’s distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV through February 29, 2024. 3Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV from October 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid. 4The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the fiscal period October 31, 2023 through February 29, 2024, as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of February 29, 2024. Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund’s currently effective managed distribution plan (the “Plan”), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.085 per share. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan. The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made. Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund’s most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=826020&owner=exclude. Certain Risk Factors: The Fund’s investment objective is to provide investors with a high level of current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investing in closed‐end funds, reinsurance, public and private debt instruments, as well as derivatives, including, but not limited to, total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including but not limited to index options) and futures, where the Fund seeks to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk. From time to time, in pursuit of its investment objective, the Fund may also invest up to 15% of its total assets in private funds on a discretionary basis. The value of equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund’s investment manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund’s investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund’s investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund’s ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. The Fund’s use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund’s common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund’s portfolio, and the fact that the Fund’s portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund’s website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The performance of NaaS Technology Inc. is indicative of a robust uptrend in the EV charging sector, especially within the Chinese market. The reported 245% year-over-year revenue growth and a 14.4-fold increase in gross profit are metrics that significantly outpace average industry growth rates. This suggests that NaaS has effectively capitalized on market opportunities and has possibly gained a competitive edge.The gross margin improvement from 6.6% to 27.7% is particularly noteworthy. It reflects not only an increase in sales but also improved operational efficiency or pricing power. Investors should consider the sustainability of these margins in the face of potential future competition and market saturation. Additionally, the expansion of the charging network and transacted charging volume implies a growing customer base and increased utilization of NaaS' services.However, one must consider the risks associated with rapid expansion, such as capital expenditure requirements and the potential for regulatory changes in the evolving Chinese EV market. The company's future performance will be contingent upon its continued strategic execution and ability to navigate these challenges. Market Research Analyst The data from NaaS Technology Inc. reflects a broader trend of increasing demand for EV infrastructure. The holistic increase in charging volume and gross transaction value growth are consistent with the global shift towards electric vehicles. NaaS' reported figures suggest the company is not only growing but also capturing a significant share of the market.With the company's reported focus on upgrading to a global energy assets operator and improving the stability and efficiency of the global energy transportation network, they are positioning themselves as a key player in the energy transition. This strategic positioning, coupled with their expanding partnerships with key national operators and automobile manufacturers, indicates a forward-thinking approach to market expansion and technology application.While these developments are promising, it is important to monitor how the company scales its business model in diverse markets and how it manages the integration of digital analytics into its service offerings. The ability to provide optimized energy supply solutions will be critical in maintaining their market position and continuing their growth trajectory. Energy Sector Analyst The emphasis on NaaS Technology Inc.'s Net Take Rate (NTR) and Gross Take Rate (GTR) improvements signals a focus on profitability metrics that are important for investors assessing the company's revenue quality. The consecutive month-to-month uplift in these rates suggests that NaaS is not only increasing its volume of transactions but also enhancing the profitability of each transaction.The company's evolution into a global energy assets operator with a pluralistic service model indicates a strategic pivot towards diversified revenue streams, which can reduce reliance on any single market or service. This diversification strategy is particularly relevant in the energy sector where technological advancements and regulatory environments are rapidly evolving.Moreover, the company's role as a 'connecting force' in the new energy sector and its integration with the real economy are reflective of a trend where digital technology plays a central role in energy services. This integration can potentially lead to more efficient energy consumption patterns and contribute to the broader goals of energy sustainability and carbon neutrality. 03/28/2024 - 05:26 PM BEIJING, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NaaS Technology(NASDAQ:NAAS), the first U.S. listed EV charging service company in China, announced remarkable financial growth and operational highlights in its newly-released unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

The company achieved a 74.8% increase in Bitcoin mining, launched a new ASIC chip, and expanded its global mining operations. Despite revenue growth, the net loss was impacted by share-based payment expenses and listing fees. Positive Revenue increased to US$368.6 million in 2023 compared to US$333.3 million in 2022. Net loss was US$56.7 million in 2023, compared to US$60.4 million in 2022. Adjusted profit was US$22.0 million in 2023, down from US$30.3 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA reached US$100.3 million in 2023, up from US$93.2 million in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents stood at US$144.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Bitdeer mined 3,694 Bitcoins in 2023, a 74.8% increase from 2022. The company tested its first Bitcoin mining chip, SEAL01, for improved efficiency. Bitdeer completed deployment of NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD H100 system ahead of schedule. A hash rate expansion plan of 3.4 EH/s was announced for self-mining expansion in 2024. Negative Net loss in 2023 was impacted by share-based payment expenses and listing fees. Cloud Hash Rate revenue decreased in 2023 compared to 2022. Gross profit margin decreased to 21.1% in 2023 from 25.0% in 2022. Cost of revenue increased to US$290.7 million in 2023 from US$250.1 million in 2022. Market Research Analyst Examining Bitdeer Technologies Group's financial results, a key takeaway is the 10.6% revenue growth year-over-year, indicating the company's resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market. Despite the net loss, the reduced magnitude compared to the previous year and the increase in adjusted EBITDA suggest improved operational efficiency. The strategic move into ASIC production with the SEAL01 chip could disrupt the competitive landscape by potentially reducing costs and dependency on third-party suppliers.However, the decrease in adjusted profit raises questions about the sustainability of growth and the effectiveness of current strategies. The expansion of datacenter operations and the deployment of the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD H100 system indicate a diversification strategy that could hedge against cryptocurrency market fluctuations. Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage the high operational costs associated with their expansion and technological advancements. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reported net loss and the decline in adjusted profit highlight the challenges Bitdeer faces in balancing growth investments with profitability. The significant share-based payment expenses and listing fee are noteworthy as they represent non-recurring costs that could skew the interpretation of the company's true operational performance. The increase in gross margin is commendable, but the drop in cash reserves from the previous year signals heavy investment and potential liquidity constraints.The company's debt level, with total borrowings of US$22.6 million, appears manageable given the current cash position. However, the future cash flow implications of the ongoing datacenter construction and mining machine purchases warrant close scrutiny. The company's future financial health will hinge on its ability to convert its technological advancements and operational expansions into profitable growth post-halving. Cryptocurrency Analyst Bitdeer's foray into ASIC chip production and the significant increase in Bitcoin mined reflect a strategic pivot towards vertical integration and operational control. The ASIC market is highly specialized and the successful development of the SEAL01 chip could provide Bitdeer with a competitive edge in cost and performance. The anticipated hash rate under management growth to 46 EH/s by 2025 is an ambitious target that, if achieved, could substantially increase the company's market share in Bitcoin mining.The company's proactive approach to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, thereby reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are generated, is important for maintaining profitability. By diversifying into high-performance computing services with the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD H100 system, Bitdeer is also tapping into the growing demand for AI and machine learning capabilities, potentially opening up new revenue streams. 03/28/2024 - 04:45 PM SINGAPORE, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitdeer Technologies Group (NASDAQ: BTDR) (“Bitdeer” or the “Company”), a world-leading technology company for blockchain and high-performance computing, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Total revenue was US$368.6 million, compared to US$333.3 million in 2022.Net loss was US$56.7 million, compared to US$60.4 million in 2022.Adjusted profit was US$22.0 million, compared to US$30.3 million in 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was US$100.3 million, compared to US$93.2 million in 2022.Cash and cash equivalents were US$144.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Linghui Kong, Chief Business Officer of Bitdeer, commented, “We continued to successfully execute on our operational strategies during 2023, as we mined 3,694 Bitcoins, representing a 74.8% year-over-year increase. We grew our revenues by 10.6% year over year to $368.6 million, and recorded adjusted EBITDA of US$100.3 million, a 7.6% increase from 2022. At the same time, we remained focused on laying the strategic groundwork for our diversified, long-term growth. Advancing our technology vertical-integration strategy, we successfully tested our first Bitcoin mining chip, the 4nm SEAL01. Designed for integration into our new SEALMINER A1 mining machines, the chip marks our entry into the ASIC production space, promising significant cost and supply chain advantages and setting the stage to reach at least 46 EH/s hash rate under management by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, we made strides in diversifying and scaling our global mining business as our Gedu Datacenter commenced full operations, while progress continued on our infrastructure expansion initiatives in Norway and Ohio. We also achieved a significant milestone by completing deployment and testing of our NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD H100 system, positioning us as one of the first cloud service platforms in Asia to offer NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD H100 service. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well-positioned for the upcoming halving, thanks to our diversified business model and access to low-cost power. As we move further into 2024, we will build on our achievements from our first year as a listed company to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.” The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from its three distinct business lines: Self-mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for the Company’s own account, which allows it to directly capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency.Hash Rate Sharing currently primarily includes Cloud Hash Rate, in which the Company offers hash rate subscription plans and shares mining income with customers under certain arrangements.Hosting encompasses a one-stop mining machine hosting solution including deployment, maintenance, and management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. Financial Highlights Total revenue was US$368.6 million in 2023, compared to US$333.3 million in 2022, primarily due to the increase in revenue generated from the Company’s self-mining business as a result of the increased self-mining hash rate and increased Bitcoin production. The Company’s increased hosting capacity also led to an increase in revenue generated from hosting services. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate.Net loss was US$56.7 million in 2023, compared to a net loss of US$60.4 million in 2022. Net loss in the full year of 2023 was primarily caused by share-based payment expenses of US$45.5 million and the listing fee of US$33.2M related to the completed transaction with Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.Adjusted profit was US$22.0 million in 2023, compared to US$30.3 million in 2022. Adjusted profit/(loss) is a non-IFRS financial measure and is used by the Company as a supplemental measure to review and assess the Company’s operating performance and is defined as profit/(loss) adjusted to exclude the listing fee and share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2.Adjusted EBITDA was US$100.3 million in 2023, compared to US$93.2 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is used by the Company as a supplemental measure to review and assess the Company’s operating performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude the listing fee and share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2.Cash and cash equivalents were US$144.7 million as of December 31, 2023.Total Borrowings were US$22.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

Forward-Looking Statements Statements in this press release about future expectations, plans, and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “look forward to,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Bitdeer’s annual report on Form 20-F, as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in Bitdeer’s subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof.

Readers should not rely upon the information on this page as current or accurate after its publication date. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating the Company’s business, the Company considers and uses non-IFRS measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit/(loss), as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude the listing fee and share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2, and defines adjusted profit/(loss) as profit/(loss) adjusted to exclude the listing fee and share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2. The Company presents these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of these non-IFRS measures facilitate investors’ assessment of its operating performance. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, investors should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the Company’s loss for the periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest IFRS performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating its performance. The Company encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of loss for the relevant years to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 05:03 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Closed-End Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NYSE: FOF) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on March 28, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In December 2021, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share. DISTRIBUTION ESTIMATES March 2024 YEAR-TO-DATE (YTD) March 31, 2024* Source Per Share Amount % of Current Distribution Per Share Amount % of 2024 Distributions Net Investment Income $0.0146 16.78 % $0.1029 39.43 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0000 0.00 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0000 0.00 % Return of Capital (or other Capital Source) $0.0724 83.22 % $0.1581 60.57 % Total Current Distribution $0.0870 100.00 % $0.2610 100.00 % You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments. *THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES The Fund's Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2024 (January 1, 2024 through February 29, 2024) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2024. In addition, the Fund's Average Annual Total Return for the five-year period ending February 29, 2024 is set forth below. Shareholders should note the relationship between the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate for 2024. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending February 29, 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. Data Integration Specialist Business intelligence and data integration are critical components of modern business strategies. The recent enhancements to Domo's Cloud Amplifier signify a considerable advancement in the field of data integration and management. The introduction of Magic ETL, with its drag-and-drop functionality, represents a significant shift towards user-friendly data transformation tools. This allows for a more streamlined process when handling data from various cloud sources, potentially reducing the time and complexity involved in data preparation.By enabling direct query and transformation of data within its native environment, Domo is addressing a common pain point for many businesses: the need to extract data before processing. This not only minimizes the risk of data corruption during transfer but also enhances efficiency by leveraging the computational power of third-party clouds. Consequently, decision-makers can access and utilize their data more rapidly, which is essential for timely business insights and actions.The ability to customize refresh rates and control cloud communication frequency is another notable feature that reflects an understanding of cost management in cloud operations. This granular control could lead to significant cost savings for organizations by avoiding unnecessary data transmission and processing charges. Cloud Computing Analyst The integration with leading cloud platforms such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery and Amazon Redshift, is a testament to Domo's commitment to versatility and wide-ranging compatibility in the cloud ecosystem. By providing native and bi-directional data access, Domo is facilitating a seamless flow of data, which is important for organizations that rely on multiple cloud services for their operations.From a scalability perspective, the ability to read and write data across various platforms without the need for significant infrastructure investment is a game-changer. It allows businesses to scale their data analytics capabilities as they grow, without being hindered by their current system's limitations. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for businesses operating in dynamic markets that require agility and the ability to pivot quickly in response to changing conditions.Furthermore, the emphasis on security and governance in Domo's announcement aligns with the growing concern for data privacy and regulatory compliance. The added governance features provide organizations with the assurance that their data is managed securely, which is a non-negotiable requirement for many businesses today. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Domo's enhancements to Cloud Amplifier are likely to resonate well with businesses that are increasingly data-driven. The emphasis on ease of use, coupled with powerful integration capabilities, addresses a common market need for tools that can simplify complex data processes. This can be particularly attractive to small and medium-sized businesses that may lack the resources for extensive data management infrastructures.As businesses continue to seek out competitive advantages through data analytics, the demand for solutions like Domo's Cloud Amplifier is expected to grow. The ability to quickly access and analyze data can directly impact a company's agility and responsiveness to market trends. By reducing the barriers to effective data utilization, Domo is positioning itself as a facilitator of data democratization, where more stakeholders within an organization can leverage data insights for decision-making.Moreover, the endorsements from industry experts and customer testimonials add to the credibility and potential market impact of Domo's offering.

Domo simplifies and streamlines this process so people can start taking action and make an impact on the business.” As part of its effort to make data more efficient, Domo introduced new functionality to customize Cloud Amplifier settings so that users can easily control their data refresh rate in Domo. Given that cloud costs are a key consideration for any modern business, these new Cloud Amplifier settings allow you to control how often Domo communicates with your data cloud, ensuring data meets the needs of the user or organization but is managed in an efficient way to avoid unnecessary costs. “Cloud Amplifier makes it easy to access even the largest BigQuery data sources we need, and the added governance provides peace of mind that our data is safely shared internally or even securely published externally via Domo Everywhere,” said Chris Haleua, VP of Product at GUIDEcx. “Our employees and customers have both been able to access data at speeds that increase productivity when compiling embedded analytics used to be the thing that slowed us down.

The ex-dividend date is April 5, 2024.","Chimera Declares First Quarter 2024 Common Stock Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Chimera Investment declares a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock, payable on April 30, 2024. The ex-dividend date is April 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend is a direct indication of a company's financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow. In the case of Chimera Investment Corporation, a dividend of $0.11 per common share suggests a stable return to shareholders, which is a critical factor for investors seeking regular income. It is important to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. This provides insight into the attractiveness of the stock compared to others, especially in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector where Chimera operates.Furthermore, the consistency of dividend payments can signal confidence from the board in the company's future earnings. However, investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A high payout ratio could indicate limited room for future growth or potential cash flow issues. By comparing this payout ratio to industry standards, stakeholders can better gauge the sustainability of Chimera's dividends. Market Research Analyst Investors often view dividend announcements as a reflection of a company's market position and stability. Chimera's declaration may be perceived positively, indicating a reliable income stream for investors. This could potentially increase the stock's desirability amongst income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where alternative income sources are less lucrative.However, it's essential to consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends, which can significantly impact REITs. Higher interest rates typically increase borrowing costs, potentially reducing profitability for REITs like Chimera. Thus, while the dividend declaration is a sign of strength, it should be weighed against macroeconomic factors that might affect future dividend sustainability and growth. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM Board Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend of $0.11 Per Share of Common Stock NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Chimera Investment Corporation announced the declaration of its first quarter cash dividend of $0.11 per common share.

President Dwight Erdbruegger emphasizes the flexibility and expertise of the new division, ensuring quick approvals and efficient solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of an Equipment Finance Division by Cass Commercial Bank represents a strategic move to diversify its service offerings and tap into the market of asset financing. This move can be seen as a response to the growing demand for operational flexibility among businesses, especially in the wake of economic fluctuations. By providing tailored leasing solutions, the bank not only generates a new stream of interest income but also potentially increases its customer base. The impact on the bank's financials will largely depend on the adoption rate of this service and how well it manages the risks associated with equipment financing, such as default rates and the residual value of the leased assets.The competitive rates and customer-centric approach highlighted may improve the bank's positioning in the market. However, it's important to monitor the bank's cost of capital and compare it with the returns from this new division to assess its profitability. Furthermore, the bank's ability to manage the lifecycle of leased equipment and navigate technological obsolescence will be critical in ensuring long-term sustainability of this division. Market Research Analyst Entering the equipment financing sector, Cass Commercial Bank is capitalizing on a market with significant growth potential. Equipment leasing allows businesses to avoid obsolescence and manage cash flow more effectively, which is particularly appealing in industries with rapid technological advancements. The bank's emphasis on customized solutions could be a differentiator in a market where one-size-fits-all approaches are common. By leveraging a customer-centric approach, the bank may build stronger relationships and enhance customer loyalty, which can lead to cross-selling opportunities.It's imperative to analyze how this division aligns with the bank's overall strategy and the current economic landscape. Factors such as interest rate trends, business investment levels and sector-specific growth will influence the division's success. The bank's ability to navigate these factors and provide competitive yet profitable rates will be important in maintaining a competitive edge. Risk Management Expert The establishment of an Equipment Finance Division introduces a new risk profile for Cass Commercial Bank. The bank will need to develop expertise in assessing the creditworthiness of businesses in diverse industries and in appraising the value of a wide range of capital assets. Effective risk management strategies will be essential to mitigate the potential for non-performing loans and to handle the depreciation of assets over time.Assessing the residual value of equipment and the potential impact of economic downturns on equipment leasing demand are key considerations. The bank must also ensure regulatory compliance, particularly in the evaluation and reporting of leased assets on their balance sheet. The ability to swiftly adapt to changing market conditions and to manage these risks will determine the resilience and profitability of this new venture. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM ST.

(NASDAQ: SHPW) reports a 23% increase in gross profit in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year, with gross margins expanding to 46%. The company continues to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Positive 23% increase in gross profit in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year Gross margins expanded to 46% in the fourth quarter Focus on expanding enterprise and software businesses Increased sales among top customers, particularly in the automotive vertical Dedication to meeting evolving customer needs and digital manufacturing solutions Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported expansion of Shapeways' gross margins to 46% and the 23% increase in gross profit for Q4 2023 are significant indicators of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. An increase in gross margins often reflects a successful strategy in managing production costs or shifting to higher-margin products or services. In this case, the higher contribution from software and enterprise sales suggests that Shapeways is effectively capitalizing on the higher margins these segments typically offer compared to traditional manufacturing.The focus on the automotive vertical and the ability to support dynamic production demands with a mix of additive and traditional manufacturing capabilities could indicate a strategic positioning that allows Shapeways to benefit from the automotive industry's shift toward more flexible and innovative production methods. This could potentially open up new revenue streams and strengthen customer relationships in a high-value sector. Market Research Analyst The digital manufacturing industry is rapidly growing and Shapeways' position as a leader in this space suggests that they are well-placed to capitalize on industry trends. The increase in sales among top customers and traction in the automotive vertical demonstrate that the company is not only expanding its customer base but also deepening its penetration in key markets. This bodes well for future revenue growth and could be a positive signal for investors looking at the long-term prospects of the company.Furthermore, the commitment to exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value indicates that the management is proactive about considering various avenues for growth or partnerships. This could include mergers, acquisitions, or other strategic initiatives that could potentially enhance the company's market position and drive shareholder returns. Economist The reported financial results from Shapeways provide insight into broader economic trends, particularly the increasing importance of digital manufacturing in the global economy. A 23% increase in gross profit, coupled with significant margin expansion, often reflects not only company-specific improvements but also favorable market conditions that could indicate a rising demand for digital manufacturing solutions.As the economy continues to integrate digital solutions across various sectors, companies like Shapeways that are at the forefront of this transformation could experience sustained growth. However, it is important to monitor how macroeconomic factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor costs and technological advancements could impact Shapeways' cost structures and margins in the long term. 03/28/2024 - 04:29 PM - Expands Q4 2023 Gross Margins to 46% and Increases Gross Profit by 23% vs the same quarter in the prior year -- Continues to Explore Strategic Alternatives to Maximize Shareholder Value - NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shapeways Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: SHPW) (“Shapeways” or the “Company”), a leader in the large and fast-growing digital manufacturing industry, announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “Throughout 2023 we focused on executing our key strategic objectives of expanding our enterprise and software businesses,” said Greg Kress, Shapeways’ Chief Executive Officer. “We are pleased to have delivered revenue and gross profit improvements in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year over year, including a 23% increase in gross profit from the same period last year. This increase in gross profit was due in part to an expansion of gross margin to 46% in the fourth quarter as we had a higher contribution from software and enterprise sales, including increased sales among our top customers. In particular, we have seen additional traction in the target automotive vertical where we support dynamic production demands with both additive and traditional manufacturing capabilities.” “We remain dedicated to meeting evolving customer needs and the ongoing shift towards digital manufacturing solutions. Even as we are seeing these improvements and remain encouraged about our opportunity over time, the current environment remains challenging, sales cycles are elongated, and our business has not scaled as quickly as anticipated. To align with this backdrop, we have implemented a number of cost-reduction initiatives, including reductions in force completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, a reduction of new hires, and a reduction in non-critical capital and discretionary operating expenditures. We are also continuing to work with advisors to explore strategic alternatives for the business to maximize shareholder value.” Business Updates Enterprise manufacturing growth – Shapeways continues to increase its customer focus towards middle market and enterprise opportunities with high-quality, high-precision enterprise-level manufacturing solutions geared towards automotive customers, as well as those in medical, robotics, and other industries. Shapeways continues to secure Tier 1 supplier and OEM direct multi-year production volume, including a recently expanded $1.5M contract with an industry-leading American automotive manufacturer that leverages Shapeways’ expansive additive and traditional manufacturing capabilities.The Company continues to increase its share of wallet with existing customers on multi-year revenue projects and saw revenues for the full year from its top 250 customers grow 29% compared to last year. Expansion into the global CNC market – Shapeways is committed to its enterprise go-to-market strategy of supporting companies across the globe with their supply chain challenges through unprecedented flexibility in production. This includes both additive and traditional manufacturing. Subsequent to year-end, Shapeways launched its new computer numerical control (""CNC"") Instant Quote feature, which provides an opportunity for further expansion into the global CNC market. This online quoting portal allows seamless access for CNC customers and enhances Shapeways’ robust suite of enterprise manufacturing solutions. Software tools and services growth – Throughout 2023, Shapeways grew revenues in its software offering which provides improved customer accessibility, increased productivity, and expanded manufacturing capabilities for its customers. During the year, the Company launched several key features to create a more comprehensive software offering. These included an enhancement to the ordering service and the ability for customers to source discounted materials using the MFG Materials platform. Cost alignment initiatives and strategic alternatives – While the Company remains encouraged by its momentum, in light of the elongated sales cycle and near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed reductions in force as part of the Company's initiatives initiated in the third quarter intended to reduce operating expenses. These cost-reduction initiatives also included a reduction in new hires and a reduction in non-critical capital and discretionary operating expenditures. As a result of the cost reduction initiatives, the Company reduced its total global workforce by approximately 15%. In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company has been working with advisors in considering its strategic alternatives, including, without limitation, a sale of a material portion of the Company’s assets, merger, business combination, liquidation of certain assets, or other strategic transaction to maximize shareholder value. Based on market checks conducted by the Company's advisors, as well as preliminary discussions with and feedback from potential purchasers, and in light of continued macroeconomic and industry pressures, the Company is actively taking steps to sell a material portion of the Company’s assets. In the course of these preliminary discussions, potential purchasers have indicated an interest in acquiring either the Company’s manufacturing business or its software business, but not both. The Company is continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives with regard to its core manufacturing and software businesses, including ongoing discussions with potential acquirers.

Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""plan,"" ""predict,"" ""potential,"" ""seem,"" ""seek,"" ""future,"" ""outlook,"" and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. All statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included in this press release, regarding the Company's strategy, future operations, outlook, prospects, expectations regarding revenue, customer uptake of new offerings, objectives of management and ability to implement additional cost-reduction measures or consummate capital raises or strategic alternatives, including a sale or liquidation of some or all of the Company's assets via merger, business combination, or other strategic transaction to maximize shareholder value, and the timing and/or impact of any such divestiture, liquidation or other potential transactions or cost-reduction measures, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction, or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of the Company. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk that exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in any definitive transaction or enhance stockholder value and may create a distraction or uncertainty that may adversely affect our operating results, business, or investor perceptions; changes in domestic and foreign business, financial, geopolitical, legal, and market conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary or recessionary pressures; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions; difficulties integrating acquired companies; ability to retain customers of acquired companies or otherwise expand its customer base; the risk that Shapeways has a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future; the risk that the Company faces significant competition and expects to face increasing competition in many aspects; the risk that the digital manufacturing industry is a relatively new and emerging market and it is uncertain whether it will gain widespread acceptance; the risk that the Company's new and existing solutions and software do not achieve sufficient market acceptance; the loss of key personnel; the inability to timely and effectively scale the Company's platform; and those factors discussed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Shapeways’ most recent Form 10-K, most recent Form 10-Q, and other documents Shapeways has filed, or will file, with the SEC. If any of these risks materialize or the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that the Company does not presently know, or that the Company currently believes are immaterial, that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect the Company's expectations, plans, or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's assessments of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to Shapeways’ results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), Shapeways believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating its operational performance. Shapeways uses this non-U.S. GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Shapeways believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, when reviewed collectively with its U.S. GAAP results, may be helpful to investors in assessing its operating performance. Shapeways defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense, net of interest income, impairment costs, write-offs, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in fair value of earnout liability, income tax expense, acquisition costs, restructuring costs and other (which includes other income and non-operating gains and losses). Shapeways believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends because it eliminates the effect of financing and capital expenditures and provides investors with a means to compare its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA Shapeways may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Shapeways’ presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Shapeways compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Shapeways’ business. SHAPEWAYS HOLDINGS, INC.

(Nasdaq: APLT) announces FDA extension for govorestat NDA for Classic Galactosemia treatment, with new PDUFA target date of November 28, 2024. Govorestat shows promise in reducing galactitol levels and improving clinical outcomes. FDA requested additional time for review due to supplemental analyses. Company remains confident in approval potential. Positive None. Negative None. Biopharmaceutical Industry Analyst The extension of the FDA review period for Applied Therapeutics' New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, a treatment for Classic Galactosemia, can be seen as a mixed signal in the biopharmaceutical sector. On one hand, the delay could potentially impact the company's short-term financials due to the postponement of market entry and revenue generation. On the other hand, the FDA's request for additional analyses indicates a thorough review process, which could ultimately enhance the drug's credibility and market acceptance if approved.Investors should note that govorestat's designation as a Pediatric Rare Disease treatment and the potential for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval are significant. The PRV can be highly valuable, as it can be sold or transferred to other entities, providing a potential financial windfall independent of the drug's own market performance. However, the market for PRVs can be volatile and their value is subject to fluctuations based on regulatory trends and supply.Long-term implications for stakeholders hinge on the drug's approval and commercial success. Given that govorestat would be the first medication indicated for the treatment of Galactosemia, its approval could position Applied Therapeutics as a pioneer in this therapeutic area, potentially leading to market exclusivity benefits and establishing the company's reputation in rare disease treatment. Financial Analyst Applied Therapeutics' announcement regarding the FDA's extension for govorestat's review period may lead to a cautious reaction from the stock market. Typically, such delays can trigger a short-term decline in stock prices due to investor concerns over the uncertainty of the drug's approval. It is important for investors to assess the company's cash flow and burn rate, as the delay could extend the time before the company starts generating revenue from this product.Furthermore, the potential market size for govorestat needs to be evaluated. Considering that Classic Galactosemia is a rare condition, the total addressable market is likely small, which means that the revenue impact could be limited when compared to drugs targeting more common diseases. However, the rarity of the condition also allows for premium pricing strategies, which can result in significant profit margins if the drug is approved and adopted in the market.Investors should also consider the company's pipeline diversity and the status of other drug candidates, as reliance on a single product for near-term revenue can be risky. Diversification of the pipeline can mitigate the impact of any single drug's approval delays or failures. Medical Research Analyst The clinical significance of govorestat as a novel Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of Classic Galactosemia should not be understated. The drug's mechanism of action, targeting the reduction of galactitol, addresses a fundamental problem in Galactosemia patients. The favorable safety profile and meaningful clinical outcomes reported from the ACTION-Galactosemia studies bolster the drug's profile.From a medical research perspective, the approval of govorestat would be a landmark event, as it would be the first treatment indicated for Classic Galactosemia, a condition that currently lacks specific pharmacological interventions. This would not only be a significant advancement for patient care but could also open avenues for further research into related metabolic disorders.The extended review period by the FDA, while causing a delay, may also reflect the complexity and novelty of the treatment. The need for additional analysis could indicate that the FDA is carefully considering the long-term implications of the drug's approval, which is particularly important for treatments targeting pediatric populations and rare diseases. 03/28/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: APLT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in indications of high unmet medical need, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the review period for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat (AT-007) for the treatment of Classic Galactosemia by three months. The FDA has set a new Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of November 28, 2024. The FDA notified Applied Therapeutics that it required additional time to review supplemental analyses of previously submitted data that had been provided by Applied in response to the FDA’s routine information requests and determined that the additional information constitutes a Major Amendment to the NDA. In February 2024, the Company announced that the FDA accepted and granted Priority Review to the NDA. Govorestat was previously granted Pediatric Rare Disease designation, and will qualify for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval. “While the PDUFA action date extension represents a delay, we remain confident in the potential for govorestat approval for Galactosemia and we will continue to work closely with the FDA throughout the review process,” said Shoshana Shendelman, PhD, Founder and CEO of Applied Therapeutics. “During this time, we are committed to maintaining the expanded access program for govorestat to ensure patients with Galactosemia have the opportunity to receive this important treatment.” Govorestat is an investigational, novel Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) being developed for the treatment of several rare diseases. The NDA filing of govorestat is supported by rapid and sustained reduction in galactitol, which resulted in a meaningful benefit on clinical outcomes across pediatric patients, alongside a favorable safety profile. The submission package included clinical outcomes data from the Phase 3 registrational ACTION-Galactosemia Kids study in children aged 2-17 with Galactosemia, the Phase 1/2 ACTION-Galactosemia study in adult patients with Galactosemia, and preclinical data. If approved, govorestat would be the first medication indicated for the treatment of Galactosemia and would be Applied Therapeutics’ first commercial product. The Company has also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for govorestat for the treatment of Classic Galactosemia to the EMA, which was validated in December 2023 and is under review by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The Company expects a decision by the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2024. About Galactosemia Galactosemia is a rare genetic metabolic disease resulting in an inability to metabolize the simple sugar galactose. Galactose is found in foods, but is also produced endogenously by the body. When not metabolized properly, galactose is converted to the toxic metabolite, galactitol, which causes neurological complications, including deficiencies in speech, cognition, behavior, and motor skills, and also results in juvenile cataracts and ovarian insufficiency (in women). There are approximately 3,000 patients with Galactosemia in the US and 80 new births per year, and approximately 4,000 patients with Galactosemia in the EU and 120 new births per year. Newborn screening for Galactosemia is mandatory in the US and most EU countries, leading to rapid identification of affected patients. About Govorestat (AT-007) Govorestat is a central nervous system (CNS) penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) in development for the treatment of several rare neurological diseases, including Galactosemia, SORD Deficiency, and PMM2-CDG. In a study in children with Galactosemia aged 2-17, treatment with govorestat demonstrated clinical benefit on activities of daily living, behavioral symptoms, cognition, fine motor skills and tremor. Govorestat also significantly reduced plasma galactitol levels in both adults and children with Galactosemia. Galactitol is a toxic metabolite responsible for tissue damage and long-term complications in Galactosemia. Govorestat is also being studied in the ongoing Phase 3 INSPIRE trial, which is evaluating the effect of AT-007 vs. placebo in patients with SORD Deficiency on sorbitol reduction as well as clinical outcomes in approximately 50 patients aged 16-55 in the U.S. and Europe. In an interim analysis at 12 months, govorestat achieved statistical significance on the prespecified primary endpoint of correlation of sorbitol with the clinical outcome composite and demonstrated sustained, statistically significant reduction in sorbitol level vs. placebo. Govorestat also demonstrated highly statistically significant effects on the CMT Health Index (CMT-HI) patient reported outcome measure, with benefit of govorestat on categories of lower limb function, mobility, fatigue, pain, sensory function, and upper limb function. Govorestat has received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for both Galactosemia and SORD Deficiency. Govorestat has also received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Galactosemia, PMM2-CDG, and SORD Deficiency; Pediatric Rare Disease designation for Galactosemia and PMM2-CDG; and Fast Track designation for Galactosemia. About Applied Therapeutics Applied Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of novel drug candidates against validated molecular targets in indications of high unmet medical need. The Company’s lead drug candidate, govorestat, is a novel central nervous system penetrant Aldose Reductase Inhibitor (ARI) for the treatment of CNS rare metabolic diseases, including Galactosemia, SORD Deficiency, and PMM2-CDG. The Company is also developing AT-001, a novel potent ARI, for the treatment of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy, or DbCM, a fatal fibrosis of the heart.

(NYSE: MLP) reported financial results for 2023, highlighting a debt-free status, new leadership, and strategic plans for growth. Although facing revenue declines due to reduced land sales and wildfire impacts, MLP aims to enhance housing supply and community development. Positive MLP achieved debt-free status in 2024 after a focus on financial stabilization. New leadership team and strategic plans aim to improve housing supply and community development. Revenue decreased due to reduced land sales and wildfire impacts. Operating costs increased, driven by one-time expenses related to leadership transition. Net loss in 2023 was impacted by economic fallout from wildfires and additional expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was negative in 2023, affected by one-time cash-based expenses. Cash and investments convertible to cash decreased in 2023, partly due to one-time expenses. Non-GAAP financial measures like Adjusted EBITDA and Cash and Investments Convertible to Cash were used to provide insights into the company's financial performance. Negative Revenue decline from reduced land sales and wildfire impacts. Increased operating costs due to one-time expenses related to leadership transition. Net loss in 2023 driven by economic and financial impacts of wildfires and additional expenses. Negative Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 influenced by one-time cash-based expenses. Decrease in cash and investments convertible to cash in 2023, partly due to one-time expenses. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. (MLP) highlight a strategic transition from selling unimproved land to adding value through master planning and development partnerships. This shift is significant as it suggests a move towards more sustainable revenue streams. However, the reported net loss and decrease in operating revenues, partly attributed to the Maui wildfires, indicate short-term challenges.From a financial perspective, the increased operating costs, including one-time leadership transition costs and stock option valuations, are noteworthy. While these are not expected to recur, they have contributed to the current financial position. The decline in cash and investments convertible to cash is a concern for liquidity, but it is essential to consider the context of the one-time expenses and the company's debt-free status entering 2024.Long-term, the company's strategic pivot could benefit shareholders if the development of their land portfolio successfully meets community needs and drives lease revenue growth. However, the ability to navigate the aftermath of the wildfires and actualize the strategic plan will be critical in determining future financial performance. Real Estate Development Analyst MLP's strategic plan to improve housing supply and revitalize local town centers in Maui represents a significant investment in community development. The focus on creating authentic local experiences and places for makers can potentially attract tourism and enhance the value of MLP's commercial assets. The company's involvement in the aftermath of the wildfires demonstrates a commitment to community resilience, which can positively impact brand reputation and stakeholder trust.However, the real estate development process is complex and often subject to regulatory hurdles, market fluctuations and community support. The success of MLP's developments will largely depend on effective execution and market reception. The potential increase in lease revenue from these developments could be substantial, but it is contingent upon the timely and successful completion of the master plan.Given the company's focus on long-term value creation, stakeholders should monitor progress on these development projects closely as they are likely to be key drivers of MLP's future financial health and stock performance. Sustainability Expert MLP's efforts to transition away from selling unimproved land towards sustainable development is indicative of a broader industry trend towards responsible land use and environmental stewardship. The company's response to the Maui wildfires and its commitment to community support align with increasing investor interest in companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.Investors are increasingly looking at ESG factors as indicators of a company's long-term viability and risk management. MLP's debt-free status and strategic focus on community resilience in the face of natural disasters could position it favorably in the eyes of ESG-focused investors. However, the execution of these strategies and the actual environmental impact of the new developments will be critical in evaluating the company's sustainability performance.Lastly, MLP's ability to balance growth opportunities with the need for environmental conservation and community support will be essential in maintaining its social license to operate and could influence investor confidence and market perception. 03/28/2024 - 04:29 PM KAPALUA, Hawaii, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. (NYSE: MLP) today reported financial results covering the year ended December 31, 2023 and the date and time of their Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will be held virtually on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., Hawai‘i Standard Time, via conference call. “After more than a century in operation and a multi-year focus on financial stabilization, Maui Land and Pineapple Company entered 2024 debt-free, with a new leadership team and a renewed vision guiding the company’s next chapter,” said CEO Race Randle. “In 2023, we completed a holistic review of MLP’s premier portfolio of land and commercial assets and crafted a strategic plan to improve Maui’s housing supply, revitalize Kapalua Village and Hali‘imaile Town Centers, and capitalize on exciting growth opportunities.” “As a long-term shareholder who was born and raised in Hawai‘i, it is thrilling to see the tremendous progress the new MLP leadership team has made over the past year,” said MLP majority shareholder Steve Case. “MLP is now well-positioned to realize its potential in delivering new value to shareholders while playing a pivotal role in supporting the Maui community as it seeks to recover from the tragic wildfires to create a stronger, more resilient future.” Fiscal 2023 Highlights “As expected, the company had reduced revenues from land sales, which were paused as we identified opportunities to unlock the potential of the company’s developable land to create value for shareholders and meet current and future community needs,” said Randle. “MLP was also intensely focused on assisting in the aftermath of the August 2023 wildfires, and while MLP’s assets were not directly affected, the fires resulted in significant loss of life and property across Maui and contributed to a short-term decline in the lease revenue from tenants temporarily impacted by road closures and reduced visitor arrivals. We expect lease revenue to rebound and reach new heights due to strong demand we are seeing from our efforts to elevate Kapalua Village and create an authentic place for makers and local experiences in Hali‘imaile.” Operating Revenues – In 2023, MLP began its shift from selling unimproved land, and has focused efforts to master plan and add value to the land directly and through working with proven partners. Land sale revenue of $1,626,000 in 2023 includes recognition of a land contribution to our first development joint venture in many years, on 31 acres in Hali‘imaile. Including land sales, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the total operating revenues decreased by $10,045,000 compared to the same period last year as a direct result of two unimproved land sales closed in 2022 in the amount of $11,600,000. Excluding land sales, the total operating revenues decreased by $71,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a reduction in percentage rent as a result of the Maui wildfires on August 8, 2023. Although percentage rents and land licensing from eco-tourism activities were trending toward an increase from the prior year, estimated losses of these revenues due to the wildfires was approximately $700,000. Costs and expenses – Operating costs and expenses totaled $14,260,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $2,907,000 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, included $1,622,000 of the operating costs and expenses related to one-time costs of the leadership transition due to $1,372,000 for severance, accelerated vesting of incentive stock for departing executives and related legal and consulting fees, and $250,000 for onboarding costs of new executive team. These costs are not anticipated to recur in the upcoming quarters with the exception of the monthly severance paid to the former CEO monthly through March 31, 2025. Other costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2023 that were not incurred previously included $1,354,000 due to stock option valuation recognized for issued options for the Board of Directors.Net loss – Net loss was ($3,080,000), or ($0.15) per common share, in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $1,787,000 or $0.09 per common share, in 2022. The net loss in 2023 was driven by the negative economic and financial impacts of the Maui wildfires and the one time and additional first-time expenses incurred. In 2022, although realizing $11,600,000 in land sales this was offset by a ($7,885,000) GAAP expense due to partial annuitization of the Company’s qualified pension plan.Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) – For the year ended December 31, 2023, after adjusting for non-cash income and expenses of $2,551,000, Adjusted EBITDA was ($529,000). If the Company had not incurred the one-time cash-based expenses of ($892,000) in 2023 due to the leadership transition an Adjusted EBITDA of $363,000 would have been realized.Cash and Investments Convertible to Cash (Non-GAAP) – Cash and investments convertible to cash totaled $8,835,000 on December 31, 2023, a decrease of ($2,657,000) compared to $11,492,000 at December 31, 2022. $892,000 of the decrease in cash is attributable to one-time expenses due to employment separations of the former CEO and Vice President and onboarding transition of the new CEO and Board Chairman realized in the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Certain non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA and Cash and Investments Convertible to Cash, to provide information that may assist investors in understanding the Company's financial results and financial condition and assessing its prospects for future performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of our operating performance because it excludes items that are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, our core operating results. We believe cash and investments convertible to cash are important indicators of liquidity because it includes items that are convertible into cash in the short term. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance or liquidity as determined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent we utilize such non-GAAP financial measures in the future, we expect to calculate them using a consistent method from period to period. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and pension and post-retirement expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by the Company to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions for the allocation of capital. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA to provide information that may assist investors in understanding its financial results. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for net income (loss). A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided further below. Cash and investments convertible to cash is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash and investments. Cash and cash investments convertible to cash is a key measure used by the Company to evaluate internal liquidity.

Financial Analyst The substantial revenue growth and gross margin improvement reported by NaaS Technology Inc. are indicative of the company's successful expansion and operational efficiency in the EV charging sector. The year-over-year revenue increase of 245% and the gross margin expansion from 6.6% to 27.7% reflect a strategic execution that has outpaced the growth of the underlying market, suggesting a gain in market share and improved cost management. However, the reported net loss widening from RMB126.9 million to RMB495.7 million raises concerns about the sustainability of the company's current growth trajectory without corresponding improvements in net profitability. Investors should note the operating expense ratio, which has risen substantially, indicating that the company is investing heavily in market expansion and professional services. While this can be expected in a growth phase, it warrants close monitoring to ensure these expenditures translate into long-term profitability. The improvements in NTR and GTR are positive signs of the company's ability to monetize its services, but the high operating expenses and net losses reflect a cost structure that may need further optimization. Market Research Analyst The EV charging industry is experiencing rapid growth due to global electrification trends in the transportation sector and NaaS' operational highlights, such as the 81% increase in charging volume and the expansion of its charging network, position the company well within this burgeoning market. Strategic partnerships with Sangao New Energy and collaborations with major automobile companies are likely to enhance the company's ecosystem and improve the EV charging experience, potentially driving user engagement and network utilization. However, the competitive landscape in China's EV charging market is intensifying and NaaS' ability to maintain its growth rate and improve its net take rate will be critical for its long-term success. The company's efforts in digital energy integration and infrastructure expansion through strategic partnerships could be a differentiator, but the effectiveness of these initiatives in driving profitability remains to be seen. Energy Sector Analyst The transition to renewable energy sources, including the adoption of EVs, is a global trend with significant implications for energy management and storage solutions. NaaS' focus on photovoltaic projects and charging infrastructure, as evidenced by its strategic partnerships, aligns with this transition. The company's growth in energy solutions revenues, increasing by 23.1 times year over year, demonstrates its potential to capitalize on the shift toward sustainable energy. However, the large-scale deployment and management of charging infrastructure require substantial capital and operational excellence. The reported increase in finance costs suggests that the company is leveraging debt to fuel its growth, which could be a concern if the revenue growth does not translate into net profits. Moreover, the company's role in the “Zhejiang Province Charging Infrastructure Governance and Supervision Service Platform Construction Project” indicates government support, which can be advantageous but also introduces regulatory risks that need to be managed carefully. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM BEIJING, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NaaS Technology Inc. (“NaaS” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: NAAS), the first U.S. listed EV charging service company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Appointment of Chief Strategy Officer The Company today announced the appointment of Ms. Ye Wu as the Chief Strategy Officer, effective immediately. Prior to joining NaaS, Ms. Wu served as management partner, head of financial business and integrated solution business at Newlinks Technology Limited (“Newlink”), the Company’s controlling shareholder. Before joining Newlink in April 2020, Ms. Wu worked at Toyota Group, where she gained extensive experience in finance. Ms. Wu holds a bachelor's degree in finance from ISG Business School and a master's degree in financial economics from Oxford University. “Our outstanding results for the 2023 fiscal year, highlighted by a 245% increase in revenue, demonstrate our exponential growth and expanding prowess in energy management and storage solutions,” said Ms. Yang Wang, CEO of NaaS. “Our focus on profitability and effective strategic execution resulted in five consecutive months of improvement in our NTR, positioning us for future growth. We are becoming a pivotal connecting force in the new energy sector, seamlessly linking industries, services and users with digital technology. By deeply integrating with the real economy and uniting the diverse strengths of our ecosystem, we aim to significantly enhance the charging experience and drive the industry’s high-quality development.” Mr. Alex Wu, president and chief financial officer of NaaS, added, “We drove a remarkable twenty-one-point jump in our gross margin from 6.6% in 2022 to 27.7% in 2023, as well as an approximately fourteen-fold increase in gross profit from RMB6.2 million to RMB88.8 million, marking significant milestones in our financial journey. All business units are experiencing substantial growth in gross profit. Notably, the unit with higher gross profitability is contributing a larger share to our total revenue.” 1 NTR is calculated by taking NaaS’ gross receipts from transactions, deducting transaction outgoings and incentives, and adding income from membership programs. This total is then expressed as a percentage of the total transaction value. 2 GTR is calculated as the percentage of NaaS's commission income from the gross transaction value at charging stations.3 NaaS offers incentives to end-users through its partnered platform in the form of discounts and promotions to boost the use of its network. 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Results: Revenues Total revenues reached RMB64.4 million (US$9.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 119% year over year. The increase was mainly attributable to strong execution in the ramping up of charging services and stable delivery in the Company’s energy solution projects throughout the fourth quarter of 2023. Charging services revenues contributed RMB47.6 million (US$6.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, with a growth rate of 114% year over year. The increase was primarily attributable to an overall increase in charging volume completed through NaaS’ EV charging network. The Company offered platform-based incentives to end-users to boost the use of its network, and charging services revenues are recorded net of end-user incentives. Costs associated with end-user incentives and recorded as reductions to total revenues totaled RMB90.7 million (US$12.8 million) and RMB61.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Energy solutions revenues increased by 144% year over year to RMB16.2 million (US$2.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from the delivery of on-going energy solution projects, especially photovoltaic projects and engineering procurement construction projects, that provide renewable energy generation, energy management and energy storage solutions. New initiatives revenues were RMB0.6 million (US$0.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, as the Company continued to launch new initiatives to expand its market offerings. Cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin Total cost of revenues increased 114% from RMB22.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB47.7 million (US$6.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. The change was largely in line with revenue growth. Total gross profit grew 2.3 times year over year from RMB7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB16.7 million (US$2.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, benefiting from solid revenue growth and a year-over-year improvement in gross margin from 24.4% to 26.0%. Gross margin improvement was mainly attributable to an increased number of profitable orders in charging services and benefited from the Company’s growing know-how and capabilities in delivering and executing energy solution projects of different scales. Operating expenses Total operating expenses increased from RMB128.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB415.5 million (US$58.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased year over year from 437% to 646%. The increase was mainly due to professional fees to initiate market expansion and increase in asset impairment estimates. Selling and marketing expenses increased year over year from RMB71.3 million to RMB134.0 million (US$18.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in selling and marketing expenses was mainly attributable to incentives given to an increasing number of end-users and the growth of transaction volume, as well as the expanded sales and marketing efforts relating to the energy solutions business. Costs associated with excess incentives to end-users included in selling and marketing expenses were RMB54.9 million (US$7.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, accounting for 1.2 times charging services revenues, compared with RMB46.9 million and 2.1 times, respectively, for the same period of 2022. Administrative expenses increased year over year from RMB46.3 million to RMB254.9 million (US$35.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to professional fees to initiate market expansion as well as increased expected credit losses that reflected market conditions. Research and development expenses increased year over year from RMB11.2 million to RMB26.6 million (US$3.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the Company’s continued dedication of resources to innovations to improve the Company’s business. Finance costs Finance costs were RMB10.1 million (US$1.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with finance costs of RMB193 thousand for the same period of 2022.

Net margin decreased from negative 431% for the fourth quarter of 2022 to negative 770% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and non-IFRS net margin decreased from negative 380% for the fourth quarter of 2022 to negative 494% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Please refer to the section titled “Unaudited reconciliations of IFRS and non-IFRS measures” for details. 2023 Full Year Financial Results: Revenues Total revenues reached RMB320.1 million (US$45.1 million) for the full year of 2023, representing an increase of 245% year over year. The increase was mainly attributable to the expansion of our charging network and strong delivery in the Company’s energy solution projects throughout 2023. Charging services revenues contributed RMB129.1 million (US$18.2 million) for 2023, with a growth rate of 56% year over year. The increase was primarily attributable to an expansion of NaaS’ EV charging network. The Company offered platform-based incentives to end-users to boost the use of its network, and charging services revenues are recorded net of end-user incentives. Costs associated with end-user incentives and recorded as reductions to total revenues totaled RMB323.8 million (US$45.6 million) and RMB206.6 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. Energy solutions revenues increased by 23.1 times year over year to RMB187.3 million (US$26.4 million) for 2023. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from the delivery of ongoing energy solution projects which provide renewable energy generation, energy management and storage solutions. New initiatives revenues were RMB3.7 million (US$0.5 million) for 2023, as the Company continued to launch new initiatives to expand its market offerings. 4 Non-IFRS net loss was arrived at after excluding share-based compensation expenses, equity-settled listing costs, fair value changes of convertible instruments, and fair value changes of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Non-IFRS net margin was calculated by dividing non-IFRS net loss by total revenue. Please refer to the section titled “Unaudited reconciliations of IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures” for details. Cost of revenues, gross profit and margin Total cost of revenues increased 167% year over year to RMB231.3 million (US$32.6 million) for 2023, accompanying the Company’s significant progress in delivering various energy solution projects in mainland China and international markets. Total gross profit grew 14.4 times year over year from RMB6.2 million to RMB88.8 million (US$12.5 million) for 2023, benefiting from solid revenue growth and significant year-over-year improvement in gross margin from 6.6% to 27.7%. Gross margin improved because the Company started to reap benefits from its growing know-how and capabilities in delivering and executing energy solution projects of different scales. Operating expenses Total operating expenses decreased from RMB2.5 billion for 2022 to RMB1.2 billion (US$166.1 million) for 2023. Selling and marketing expenses increased from RMB241.4 million for 2022 to RMB446.7 million (US$62.9 million) for 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to higher incentives given to end-users and expanded sales and marketing efforts relating to the energy solutions business. Costs associated with excess incentives to end-users included in selling and marketing expenses were RMB224.5 million (US$31.6 million) for 2023, compared with RMB140.8 million for 2022. Administrative expenses decreased from RMB2.2 billion for 2022 to RMB669.8 million (US$94.3 million) for 2023. This was largely due to the Company’s recording of an equity-settled listing cost of RMB1.9 billion in 2022, which was incurred as a result of the merger transaction in 2022. Excluding the impact of that listing cost, administrative expenses increased 136% from RMB283.3 million to RMB669.8 million (US$94.3 million) mainly due to professional fees to initiate market expansion as well as increased expected credit losses that reflected market conditions. Research and development expenses increased from RMB36.6 million for 2022 to RMB63.1 million (US$8.9 million) for 2023. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s research and development team to enhance the Company’s charging services and energy solutions business. Finance costs Finance costs were RMB33.0 million (US$4.6 million) for 2023, compared with finance costs of RMB10.3 million for 2022. Such increase was due to an increase in bank borrowings during the year. Income tax expenses Income tax expenses were RMB3.8 million (US$0.5 million) for 2023, compared with income tax expenses of RMB9.9 million for 2022.

Announces Closing of $1.0 Billion of 6.500% Senior Notes Due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. completes a private placement of $1.0 billion senior notes due 2032, with expected net proceeds of approximately $983 million. The funds will be used to prepay debts and expenses, benefiting the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a $1.0 billion private placement of senior notes by Ryman Hospitality Properties is a significant financial event that warrants a detailed examination of its impact on the company's capital structure and liquidity. The 6.500% interest rate on these notes is notably higher than the rates on their existing notes due in 2027, 2028 and 2029, which could suggest a strategic move to lock in long-term financing in anticipation of rising interest rates or a reflection of the current credit market conditions.From a liquidity perspective, the net proceeds of approximately $983 million will be used to prepay existing debt and reduce the company's leverage. This deleveraging could potentially improve the company's credit ratings and reduce future interest expenses, although it may also reduce financial flexibility. The decision to pay off the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and a portion of the term loan B indicates a strategic preference for fixed-rate debt over variable-rate debt, which could protect the company against future interest rate volatility. Market Research Analyst In the context of the hospitality industry, the use of proceeds to contribute to subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center demonstrates Ryman Hospitality's commitment to its core assets. This move can be seen as a vote of confidence in the long-term viability of the hospitality and convention sectors, which have been recovering from the downturn caused by the pandemic. However, the substantial investment in a single asset also concentrates the company's risk profile.Assessing the market's response to this placement is important for understanding investor sentiment. The private nature of the offering, directed at qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, indicates that the company is seeking sophisticated investors who are comfortable with the associated risks. The exclusion of general public participation might be due to the regulatory complexities and the desire to expedite the process without the broader market scrutiny that public offerings entail. Debt Capital Markets Expert The issuance of unregistered securities under Rule 144A and Regulation S suggests Ryman Hospitality is leveraging exemptions to streamline the capital-raising process. The use of these exemptions can be faster and less costly than a public offering, but it limits the pool of potential investors to those who meet specific criteria. It's important to note that these notes are senior unsecured obligations, which means they rank higher in the event of liquidation compared to subordinated debt but do not have collateral backing, potentially increasing the risk for investors.The fact that the notes are guaranteed by the company and its subsidiaries that guarantee other existing credit facilities is a double-edged sword. It provides an additional layer of security for investors but also ties the financial health of the entire enterprise to these notes. This interconnectedness of obligations requires careful monitoring of the company's overall debt profile and the performance of the guarantors. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (NYSE: RHP) (the “Company”) announced today that its subsidiaries, RHP Hotel Properties, LP (the “Operating Partnership”) and RHP Finance Corporation (together with the Operating Partnership, the “Issuers”), completed the previously announced private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and are guaranteed by the Company and the Company’s and the Operating Partnership’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Operating Partnership’s existing credit facility, the 4.750% senior unsecured notes due 2027, the 7.250% senior unsecured notes due 2028 and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2029. The aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are expected to be approximately $983 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Operating Partnership intends to contribute a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to its subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center, and such subsidiaries intend to use such net proceeds to prepay the indebtedness outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2019, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended from time to time, and to pay related fees and expenses. The Operating Partnership intends to use the remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay, as soon as practicable, approximately $200 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s term loan B pursuant to its existing credit facility. The Notes were offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Management Commentary “I am proud of our team’s hard work in 2023 as they executed on our strategic initiatives to consistently lower input costs and optimize our cost structure, resulting in more than $6 million of expense reductions and a material improvement to our bottom line,” said Norman E. Snyder, Jr., CEO of Reed’s. “We experienced solid order volume across our retail network during the year, however we were unable to fulfill the entire demand due to inflated short order shipments, which we believe offset net sales by approximately $5 million in 2023. We have taken the appropriate steps to increase production capacity and are actively building our finished goods inventory. With an improving inventory position, we are well on track to dramatically reduce short shipments and capitalize on the demand for our fan-favorite products. “Looking ahead, we have several key initiatives to drive growth and profitability. As we build our inventory levels, we will sharpen our focus on returning to growth through our key product categories: Reed’s Ginger Ale, Ginger Beer, Virgil’s Zero Sugar and our ready-to-drink alcohol portfolio. We also plan to uncover additional cost-saving opportunities throughout our business to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible. We expect these initiatives will enable us to deliver on our growth and profitability objectives in 2024.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results During the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales were $11.7 million compared to $15.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was primarily driven by short order shipments and lower sales from seasonal programs due to timing of customer orders and a third-party manufacturing deficiency, both related to the Company’s swing-lid products. Reed’s expects to receive an insurance claim to cover the cost of these products. The Company also implemented a one-time change to policy for discounts that offset net sales by approximately $0.8 million this quarter. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.5 million compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2022. Gross margin was 4.0% compared to 22.9% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a one-time, non-cash packaging inventory valuation adjustment of $1.8 million, a one-time provision for product hold related to the Company’s swing-lid program of $1.3 million, as well as the aforementioned one-time change to policy for discounts. Adjusted gross profit, which excludes these non-cash items, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.3 million or 34.9% of revenue. Delivery and handling costs were reduced by 32% to $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by continued reductions in freight rates, as well as improved throughput and efficiencies related to the Company’s streamlined distribution model. Delivery and handling costs were reduced to 16% of net sales or $2.82 per case, compared to 18% of net sales or $3.44 per case during the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative costs declined by 23% to $3.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $3.9 million in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative costs remained flat at 26%. Operating loss during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.0 million or $(1.55) per share, compared to $3.7 million or $(1.54) per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Modified EBITDA improved to $43,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $(2.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Update on Recent Financing During the first quarter of 2024, Reed’s closed on a $4.1 million SAFE (“Simple Agreement for Future Equity”) agreement as part of a planned $6.0 million financing. Reed’s plans to utilize the funds to build its finished goods inventory reserves to reduce short shipments in 2024. Liquidity and Cash Flow For the fourth quarter of 2023, cash used in operations was $0.2 million compared to cash flow from operations of $1.0 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher inventory purchases compared to the year-ago period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $0.6 million of cash and $27.4 million of total debt net of capitalized financing fees. This cash balance does not include the aforementioned $4.1 million of SAFE proceeds from the Company’s recent financing. The debt includes $17.6 million from a convertible note and $9.8 million from the Company’s revolving line of credit, which has $3.0 million of additional borrowing capacity. FY 2024 Financial Outlook The Company projects net sales growth, gross margin expansion, and to achieve modified EBITDA profitability for the full year 2024. Reed’s also expects to generate positive cash flow from operations for the full year 2024.

However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, changes in fair value of warrant expense, legal and insurance settlements, inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes, one-time changes to policy, impact of changes to accounting methodology and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset impairment. Management considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 (unaudited; in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net loss $(15,523) $(20,057) Modified EBITDA adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 281 225 Interest expense 6,106 5,223 Tax expense 251 Stock option and other noncash compensation 493 859 Provision for product hold 1,267 Provision for receivable with former related party 585 538 Inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes 1,848 One time change to policy for discounts 756 Legal settlement 12 Severance costs 256 66 Total EBITDA adjustments $11,855 $6,911 Modified EBITDA $(3,668) $(13,146) Three months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net loss $(6,596) $(6,769) Modified EBITDA adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 67 60 Interest expense 1,647 3,104 Tax expense 251 0 Stock option and other noncash compensation 139 274 Provision for product hold 1,267 Provision for receivable with former related party 585 538 Inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes 1,848 One time change to policy for discounts 756 Legal settlement 0 Severance costs 79 Total EBITDA adjustments $6,639 $3,976 Modified EBITDA $43 $(2,793) We present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; andAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Positive Semtech (SMTC) reported strong net sales of $192.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, exceeding guidance. The company achieved positive operating cash flow of $13.9 million and free cash flow of $12.2 million in the fourth quarter. GAAP gross margin was 34.1% for the fiscal year 2024, while Non-GAAP gross margin stood at 49.5%. Semtech remains well-positioned to benefit from near-term growth trends, particularly in the infrastructure end market. The company completed an optional credit facility prepayment of $5.0 million, showcasing financial stability and prudent management. Semtech's executive vice president and CFO highlighted working capital improvements and the implementation of a new ERP system to enhance operational efficiencies. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges impacted GAAP gross margin and diluted loss per share for fiscal year 2024. Negative GAAP diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter was $9.98, signaling financial challenges for Semtech. The company reported a negative GAAP gross margin of (0.2)% for the fourth quarter, indicating potential operational inefficiencies. Goodwill impairment of $755.6 million and intangible impairments of $131.4 million for fiscal year 2024 could impact future financial performance. Operating costs and expenses significantly increased in fiscal year 2024, affecting overall profitability. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Semtech Corporation for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 exhibit a notable disparity between GAAP and non-GAAP measures, particularly in terms of gross margins and earnings per share. The GAAP gross margin for the fiscal year shows a substantial decline to 34.1% from the previous year's 63.3%, which can be attributed to significant goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. The company's decision to make an optional credit facility prepayment indicates a strategic move to reduce leverage, which could be perceived positively by investors looking for prudent financial management.However, the GAAP diluted loss per share of $17.03 for the fiscal year, compared to the prior year's earnings of $0.96 per share, raises concerns about the company's profitability and the impact of the non-recurring impairment charges. The non-GAAP metrics, which exclude these charges, suggest a more stable operational performance with a diluted earnings per share of $0.14. This discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP results could lead to a mixed reception in the stock market, with investors weighing the one-time impacts against the company's core operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the reported increase in net sales to $868.8 million for the fiscal year, up from $756.5 million the previous year, indicates a healthy demand for Semtech's products, especially in the semiconductor business. The statement by the CEO about the transition from stable to growing end market demand, particularly in the infrastructure end market, suggests optimism about the company's growth prospects.Additionally, the mention of operational and free cash flow improvements reflects positively on the company's liquidity and ability to generate cash from its operations. These factors are critical in assessing a company's financial health and can influence investor confidence. The implementation of a single ERP system is expected to streamline operations, which could lead to cost savings and improved margins in the long term, potentially benefiting the stock's valuation. Economist Assessing the broader economic context, Semtech's financial performance must be considered against the backdrop of current macroeconomic conditions, including an elevated interest rate environment. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments are indicative of the challenges faced by the company in the acquisition of Sierra Wireless and its integration into the business model. It is important to understand that such impairments reflect not only on past investment decisions but also on expectations of future earnings potential, which have been revised downwards.Investors should consider the potential impact of persistent high interest rates on the company's cost of capital and the valuation of future cash flows. While the company has demonstrated a capacity to generate positive cash flows in the short term, long-term growth will hinge on its ability to adapt to economic headwinds and maintain competitive advantages in its markets. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Net sales of $192.9 million, above the midpoint of guidance GAAP gross margin of (0.2)% and Non-GAAP gross margin of 48.9%, above the midpoint of guidance GAAP diluted loss per share of $9.98 and Non-GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.06 Positive operating cash flow of $13.9 million and free cash flow of $12.2 million Completed optional credit facility prepayment of $5.0 million Fiscal Year 2024 Net sales of $868.8 million GAAP gross margin of 34.1% and Non-GAAP gross margin of 49.5% GAAP diluted loss per share of $17.03 and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 GAAP gross margin and diluted loss per share are reflective of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, this release includes a presentation of select non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP measures of gross margin, SG&A expense, R&D expense, operating costs and expenses, net, operating income or loss, operating margin, interest expense, net, diluted (loss) earnings per share and normalized tax rate exclude the following items, if any, as set forth in the reconciliations in the tables below under ""Supplemental Information: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results:"" Share-based compensation Intangible amortization Transaction and integration related costs or recoveries (including costs associated with the acquisition of Sierra Wireless) Restructuring and other reserves, including cumulative other reserves associated with historical activity including environmental, pension, deferred compensation and right-of-use asset impairments Share-based compensation acceleration expense related to the acquisition of Sierra Wireless Litigation costs or dispute settlement charges or recoveries Gain on sale of business Equity method income or loss Investment gains, losses, reserves and impairments, including interest income from debt investments Write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs Debt commitment fee Goodwill and intangible impairment Amortization of inventory step-up Effective as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company's non-GAAP measures have been adjusted to exclude amortization of deferred financing costs, which had the impact of decreasing non-GAAP interest expense, net and increasing non-GAAP net income or loss attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP earnings or loss per diluted share. This adjustment was applied retrospectively and all prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation. To provide additional insight into the Company's first quarter outlook, this release also includes a presentation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. In the financial statements provided with this release, the Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income plus interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, and adjusted to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core results over time. The Company considers free cash flow, which may be positive or negative, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the items identified above because such items are either operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by the Company in the normal course of the Company's business operations, or are not reflective of the Company's core results over time. These excluded items may include recurring as well as non-recurring items, and no inference should be made that all of these adjustments, charges, costs or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For example: certain restructuring and integration-related expenses (which consist of employee termination costs, facility closure or lease termination costs, and contract termination costs) may be considered recurring given the Company's ongoing efforts to be more cost effective and efficient; certain acquisition and disposition-related adjustments or expenses may be deemed recurring given the Company's regular evaluation of potential transactions and investments; and certain litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains (which may include estimated losses for which the Company may have established a reserve, as well as any actual settlements, judgments, or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, disputes or similar matters, and insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters) may be viewed as recurring given that the Company may from time to time be involved in, and may resolve, litigation, arbitration, disputes, and similar matters. Notwithstanding that certain adjustments, charges, costs or expenses may be considered recurring, in order to provide meaningful comparisons, the Company believes that it is appropriate to exclude such items because they are not reflective of the Company's core results and tend to vary based on timing, frequency and magnitude. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's comparable financial performance between periods. In addition, the Company's management generally excludes the items noted above when managing and evaluating the performance of the business. The financial statements provided with this release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024, and the full-year fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 periods. The Company adopted a full-year, normalized tax rate for the computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision in order to provide better comparability across the interim reporting periods by reducing the quarterly variability in non-GAAP tax rates that can occur throughout the year. In estimating the full-year non-GAAP normalized tax rate, the Company utilized a full-year financial projection that considers multiple factors such as changes to the Company's current operating structure, existing positions in various tax jurisdictions, the effect of key tax law changes, and other significant tax matters to the extent they are applicable to the full fiscal year financial projection. In addition to the adjustments described above, this normalized tax rate excludes the impact of share-based awards and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For fiscal year 2024, the Company's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate was 12% and was applied to each quarter of fiscal year 2024. For fiscal year 2025, the Company's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate is 12% and will be applied to each quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company's non-GAAP normalized tax rate on non-GAAP net income may be adjusted during the year to account for events or trends that the Company believes materially impact the original annual non-GAAP normalized tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, acquisitions, entity structures or operational changes and other significant events. These additional non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies.

This refinancing, particularly at a 2.00% interest rate over the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, suggests a favorable credit environment and a strong company credit profile, as reflected by the BB+ and Ba1 ratings from S&P and Moody's, respectively.The use of the net proceeds to refinance a previous $490 million Term Loan B facility may have a positive impact on the company's interest expense, potentially improving net income margins in the long term. Moreover, the extension of the expiration date by over two years provides a longer horizon for debt repayment, which could be beneficial for the company's cash flow management and investment opportunities.Investors should note that such strategic refinancing activities often signal a company's proactive stance in optimizing its capital structure, which can lead to improved financial health and potentially enhance shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The building products industry can be capital intensive, requiring firms like Installed Building Products to maintain sufficient liquidity for operations and growth initiatives. The successful closure of a sizable term loan like this often reflects broader market conditions. Currently, the construction sector is experiencing a mix of challenges and growth opportunities, with insulation and building products remaining essential components in both residential and commercial construction.IBP's ability to refinance on more favorable terms could be an indicator of strong market confidence in the company's sector and its operational stability. It's important for stakeholders to recognize that such financial maneuvers can affect the company's competitiveness, as it may now have more resources to invest in growth or improve operational efficiencies.Additionally, the involvement of reputable financial institutions as joint lead arrangers and bookrunning managers underscores the transaction's credibility and the company's standing within the financial community. Credit Analyst From a credit perspective, the refinancing of Installed Building Products' debt with a new $500 million term loan is a notable event. The credit ratings assigned by S&P and Moody's, which are in the BB+/Ba1 range, suggest a lower investment grade or high non-investment grade status. This indicates a moderate level of credit risk but also implies a degree of confidence in the company's ability to meet its financial obligations.The absence of financial maintenance covenants in the new agreement provides IBP with more leeway to operate without stringent restrictions that could limit its operational agility. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with such flexibility, as it could potentially lead to more aggressive financial policies that may increase the company's risk profile over time.It's also worth noting that the alternative base rate option provides a hedge against potential rises in the secured overnight financing rate, which could be a strategic move in a fluctuating interest rate environment. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Installed Building Products, Inc. (the “Company” or “IBP”) (NYSE: IBP), an industry-leading installer of insulation and complementary building products, today announced that the Company has successfully closed its previously announced new 7-year $500 million term loan (the “New Term Loan”). The New Term Loan matures on March 28, 2031, has no financial maintenance covenants, and is rated BB+ by S&P Global Ratings and Ba1 by Moody's Investors Service. The pricing of the New Term Loan bears interest at the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate plus 2.00% per annum, or an alternative base rate plus 1.00%. Net proceeds of the New Term Loan were used to refinance the Company’s prior $490 million Term Loan B facility and pay fees. ""Our ability to successfully refinance the New Term Loan on more favorable financial terms to our previous term loan, while extending the expiration date by more than 2 years, is the result of IBP's continued strong operating and financial performance, conservative capital structure, and current market conditions.

Both mines show positive cash flow projections and NPV at current metal prices.,"Hecla Files NI43-101 Technical Reports for Keno Hill and Casa Berardi Mines Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hecla Mining Company (HL) filed NI43-101 Technical Reports for Casa Berardi and Keno Hill mines. Keno Hill Silver reserves increased by 45% to 55M ounces with a 10% rise over 2022. Casa Berardi Gold reserves decreased by 21% to 1.3M ounces due to operational changes. Both mines show positive cash flow projections and NPV at current metal prices. Positive None. Negative None. Mining Industry Analyst The recent filing of NI43-101 Technical Reports by Hecla Mining Company for its Casa Berardi and Keno Hill mines presents significant data for stakeholders. Notably, the 45% increase in proven and probable silver reserves at Keno Hill since the acquisition indicates a substantial enhancement of the mine's asset value. This reserve expansion, coupled with an 11-year reserve mine plan forecasting production of 52.9 million ounces of silver, suggests a robust operational outlook for Hecla.Furthermore, the projected $420 million of free cash flow from current reserves at Keno Hill, with an after-tax NPV of $305 million, provides a tangible measure of the mine's potential profitability. However, it is important to note that these figures are predicated on a silver price of $22 per ounce, which is volatile and subject to market fluctuations. Hence, the actual financial performance could deviate from these projections. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Hecla's strategic decision to transition Casa Berardi to an open-pit only operation, resulting in a 21% decrease in gold reserves, reflects a shift towards more cost-effective mining methods. Such a move could potentially lower operational costs and improve profit margins, despite the reduction in reserves. The anticipated $602 million in free cash flow over the life of mine (LOM) and an after-tax NPV of $356 million at a gold price of $1,950 per ounce indicate a healthy financial outlook for the Casa Berardi operation.Investors should, however, approach these figures with caution, as they are based on current gold and silver price assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. The sensitivity of mining operations to commodity prices means that Hecla's financial health is closely tied to market conditions, which can change rapidly and influence the company's stock performance. Resource Estimation Expert The disclosure of measured, indicated and inferred resources provides a comprehensive view of the mines' geological potential. The increase in inferred resources at Keno Hill by 25% is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates the presence of additional mineralization that could potentially be upgraded to higher confidence categories with further exploration. The NI43-101 reports serve as a critical tool for assessing the economic viability of mining projects and offer a basis for future investment and operational planning.It's important for stakeholders to understand that 'proven and probable reserves' refer to the economically mineable part of a mineral deposit, while 'measured and indicated resources' are quantities that are discovered but not yet proven to be economically viable. The distinction between these categories is essential for evaluating a mining company's assets and growth potential. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) today announced it has filed NI43-101 Technical Reports for the Casa Berardi mine in Quebec and Keno Hill mine in Yukon, Canada. REPORT HIGHLIGHTS Keno Hill Silver Proven and Probable reserves of 55 million silver ounces, an increase of 45% over the reserves identified at the time of the acquisition in September 2022, and an increase of 10% over year-end 2022.

Mineral resources are exclusive of reserves. (8) The term ""mineral resources"" means a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled. (9) The term ""measured resources"" means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than the level of confidence of either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource, a measured mineral resource may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve. (10) The term ""indicated resources"" means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than the level of confidence of a measured mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve. (11) The term ""inferred resources"" means that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Because an inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability, an inferred mineral resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project and may not be converted to a mineral reserve.

Par Pacific Announces Expected Term Loan Repricing,2024-03-28T20:29:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Par Pacific Holdings, Inc.

The amendment will reduce the Applicable Margin by 50 basis points, leading to annual cash savings of over $3 million. Positive Par Pacific expects to save over $3 million annually due to the repricing of its term loan credit agreement. Moody's upgraded Par Pacific's corporate family rating to Ba3 from B1. The amendment will reduce the Applicable Margin by 50 basis points, benefiting the company financially. Further ratings upgrade from S&P could lead to an additional 0.25% reduction in annual interest rates under the Term Loan Facility. Negative None. Financial Analyst Par Pacific Holdings' decision to reprice its existing term loan credit agreement is a strategic financial move that is likely to resonate positively with investors and stakeholders. The reduction of the Applicable Margin by 50 basis points for both Base Rate and SOFR loans signifies a lowering of borrowing costs. This is a direct benefit to the company's bottom line, as it implies a decrease in interest expenses, thus potentially increasing net income and cash flows.The removal of the Term SOFR Adjustment further simplifies the interest calculation and can be seen as a response to the recent upgrade in the corporate family rating by Moody's. This upgrade typically reflects improved creditworthiness, which can reduce the perceived risk for lenders and justify lower interest rates. The potential for an additional interest rate reduction with a further ratings upgrade creates an incentive for Par Pacific to maintain or improve its financial health.From a financial perspective, the anticipated $3 million in annual cash savings, along with the $10 million from other financial restructuring activities, suggests a substantial improvement in financial flexibility. This could lead to reinvestment in the business, debt reduction, or other shareholder-friendly activities. However, it's important to monitor if these savings translate to tangible value creation over time. Credit Risk Analyst Looking at Par Pacific's amendment from a credit risk perspective, the reduction in interest rates following a credit rating upgrade indicates a lower risk profile for the company. Credit rating agencies like Moody's assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its obligations and an upgrade suggests enhanced confidence in the company's ability to meet its financial commitments.The link between Par Pacific's interest rates and its credit ratings underscores the importance of credit risk management. It suggests that the company's management is actively working to improve its standing with rating agencies, which can lead to more favorable borrowing terms. This dynamic can create a virtuous cycle, where improved creditworthiness leads to lower costs of debt, which in turn can further strengthen the company's financial position.Investors should consider the implications of these changes on the company's risk profile. While lower interest expenses are beneficial, they should also assess whether the company's operational performance can sustain the improved credit ratings in the long run. Any future downgrade could reverse the favorable terms obtained, impacting the company's cost structure and profitability. Energy Sector Analyst In the context of the energy sector, Par Pacific Holdings' amendment to its term loan facility must be viewed against the backdrop of the industry's cyclical nature and volatility in commodity prices. The company's ability to secure lower interest rates may provide a competitive edge by freeing up cash that could be used for strategic investments or to weather downturns in the market.Energy companies like Par Pacific often face significant capital expenditure requirements and regulatory challenges. The financial flexibility gained from reduced interest payments could enable the company to navigate these challenges more effectively. It's also worth noting that the energy sector is undergoing a transition towards more sustainable sources and companies are under pressure to adapt their business models accordingly.The savings reported by Par Pacific could potentially be redirected towards investments in renewable energy or other initiatives to future-proof the business. However, it's critical for investors to watch how these savings are allocated, as the long-term success of the company will depend on strategic decisions that align with industry trends and regulatory developments. 03/28/2024 - 04:29 PM HOUSTON, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PARR) (“Par Pacific”) today announced it expects to reprice and allocate its existing term loan credit agreement due 2030 (the “Term Loan Facility”). The repricing amendment, which is subject to execution of definitive documentation and customary closing conditions, will reduce the Applicable Margin under the Term Loan Facility by 50 basis points, such that Base Rate loans and SOFR loans will bear interest at the applicable base rate plus 2.75% and 3.75%, respectively. In addition, the amendment will eliminate the Term SOFR Adjustment of 10 basis points with respect to loans under the Term Loan Facility. On March 22, 2024, Par Pacific announced that Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the company’s corporate family rating to Ba3 from B1. The amendment provides that if Par Pacific receives a further ratings upgrade from S&P, the annual interest rates under the Term Loan Facility will be reduced by an additional 0.25%. “Our strong operating performance and record financial results over the past year have enabled us to reprice our term loan facility on improved terms,” said Shawn Flores, Chief Financial Officer of Par Pacific. “This amendment is expected to provide over $3 million in annual cash savings and is in addition to the estimated $10 million in annual savings associated with the recently announced increase to the asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL”) and replacement of the Hawaii intermediation facility.” Forward-Looking Statements This news release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to qualify for the “safe harbor” from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As further described below under “Update on Estimated Asset Retirement Obligations,” based on information from PCEC, any monthly payments that PCEC may make to the Trust may not be sufficient to cover the Trust’s administrative expenses and outstanding debt to PCEC, and therefore the likelihood of distributions to the unitholders in the foreseeable future is extremely remote. As further described below under “Status of the Dissolution of the Trust,” because the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust from its net profits interests (the “Net Profits Interests”) and 7.5% overriding royalty interest (the “Royalty Interest”) totaled less than $2.0 million for each of 2020 and 2021, the amended and restated trust agreement governing the Trust (the “Trust Agreement”) provides that the Trust is to be dissolved and wound‑up. All financial and operational information in this press release has been provided to the Trustee by PCEC. The Current Month’s distribution calculation for the Developed Properties reflected operating income of approximately $1.3 million, as revenues from the Developed Properties were approximately $3.2 million, lease operating expenses including property taxes were approximately $1.9 million, and development costs (including adjustments from prior periods) were approximately $30,000. The average realized price for the Developed Properties was $71.85 per Boe for the Current Month, as compared to $68.20 per Boe in December 2023. Net profits were approximately $1.1 million. As a result, the cumulative net profits deficit amount for the Developed Properties decreased to approximately $18.1 million, as further discussed below under “Update on Estimated Asset Retirement Obligations”. The Current Month’s calculation included approximately $63,000 generated from the 7.5% overriding royalty interest on the Remaining Properties from Orcutt Diatomite and Orcutt Field. Average realized prices for the Remaining Properties were $71.40 per Boe in the Current Month, as compared to $63.10 per Boe in December 2023. The cumulative net profits deficit for the Remaining Properties remained at approximately $0.8 million, as further discussed below under “Update on Estimated Asset Retirement Obligations”. The monthly operating and services fee of approximately $108,000 payable to PCEC, together with Trust general and administrative expenses of approximately $100,000, exceeded the payment of approximately $63,000 received from PCEC from the 7.5% overriding royalty interest on the Remaining Properties, creating a shortfall of approximately $145,000. Sales Volumes and Prices The following table displays PCEC’s underlying sales volumes and average prices for the Current Month: Underlying Properties Sales Volumes Average Price (Boe) (Boe/day) (per Boe) Developed Properties (a) 45,055 1,453 $71.85 Remaining Properties (b) 12,307 397 $71.40 (a) Crude oil sales represented 98% of sales volumes (b) Crude oil sales represented 100% of sales volumes Update on Amounts Owed to PCEC by the Trust PCEC has provided the Trust with a $1 million letter of credit to be used by the Trust if its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due. As of March 31, 2021, the letter of credit has been fully drawn down. Further, the Trust Agreement provides that if the Trust requires more than the $1 million under the letter of credit to pay administrative expenses, PCEC will, upon written request of the Trustee, loan funds to the Trust in such amount as necessary to pay such expenses. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trust may only use funds provided under the letter of credit or loaned by PCEC or another source to pay the Trust’s current accounts or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or for the payment of other accrued current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust’s business. As the Trust has fully drawn down the letter of credit, PCEC has loaned funds to the Trust pursuant to a promissory note to pay shortfalls related to previous months and will be loaning funds to the Trust to pay the expected shortfall of approximately $145,000 related to the Current Month. As of the end of the Current Month, the Trust owed PCEC approximately $5.8 million (which includes the amount drawn from the letter of credit, amounts borrowed under the promissory note, and in each case, accrued interest). Loans made to the Trust and amounts drawn from the letter of credit, together with interest thereon, will be repaid from proceeds, if any, payable to the Trust pursuant to the Net Profits Interests and the Royalty Interest, and from any proceeds from a sale of the Trust’s assets in connection with the dissolution of the Trust. Consequently, no further distributions may be made until the Trust’s indebtedness created by such amounts drawn or borrowed, including interest thereon, has been paid in full. Given the outstanding amount borrowed by the Trust to date, there may not be any net proceeds from a sale of the Trust’s assets to be distributed to the Trust unitholders. Update on Estimated Asset Retirement Obligations As previously disclosed, in November 2019, PCEC informed the Trustee that, as permitted by the Conveyance, PCEC intended to begin deducting its estimated asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with the West Pico, Orcutt Hill, Orcutt Hill Diatomite, East Coyote and Sawtelle fields, thereby reducing the amounts payable to the Trust under its Net Profits Interests. ARO is the recognition related to net present value of future plugging and abandonment costs that all oil and gas operators face. PCEC engaged an accounting firm, Moss Adams LLP (“Moss Adams”), acting as third-party consultants, to assist PCEC in determining its estimated ARO, and on February 27, 2020, PCEC informed the Trustee that based on the analysis performed by Moss Adams, PCEC’s estimated ARO, as of December 31, 2019, was $45,695,643, which is approximately $10.0 million less than the undiscounted amount that was originally estimated before Moss Adams completed its analysis, as previously disclosed in the Trust’s Current Report on Form 8‑K filed on November 13, 2019. According to PCEC and its third-party consultants, its estimated ARO, which reflected PCEC’s assessment of current market conditions as of December 31, 2019 and changes in California law, was determined to be approximately $33.2 million for the Developed Properties and approximately $12.5 million for the Remaining Properties, or approximately $26.5 million and approximately $3.1 million net to the Trust, respectively, and PCEC has reflected these amounts beginning with the calculation of the net profits generated during January 2020. PCEC has informed the Trustee that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, PCEC will evaluate the ARO on a quarterly basis. As a result of that re-evaluation, the actual ARO incurred in the future may be greater or less than the estimated amounts provided by PCEC. As previously disclosed, PCEC has informed the Trustee that at year-end 2020, and following the end of each of the first, second and third quarters of 2021, in light of the accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 410-20-35-3, which requires the recognition of changes in the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time and revision of the timing or amount of the originally estimated undiscounted cash flows, PCEC re-evaluated the estimated ARO, which resulted in an aggregate increase to the ARO accrual for the Developed Properties by approximately $5.1 million, net to the Trust’s interest, and an aggregate increase to the ARO accrual for the Remaining Properties by approximately $288,000, net to the Trust’s interest. PCEC previously informed the Trustee that PCEC has recognized additional asset retirement obligations for the year ended December 31, 2021, in the amount of approximately $1.2 million, of which approximately $0.4 million relates to the Developed Properties, while approximately $0.8 million relates to the Remaining Properties. Net to the Trust’s interests, this represents an upward ARO revision of approximately $0.3 million and approximately $0.2 million for the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties, respectively. In June 2023, PCEC engaged Cornerstone Engineering, Inc. (“Cornerstone”) to perform an ARO evaluation for the West Pico and Orcutt Hill fields. Based on Cornerstone’s report, Moss Adams has provided PCEC with an updated ARO valuation that reflects an upward adjustment in the ARO values as of December 31, 2022, of approximately $13.7 million discounted to December 31, 2022, with a cumulative increase in the accretion for the first three quarters of 2023 of approximately $1.0 million net to the Trust’s interests. The adjustment in the ARO values as of December 31, 2022, and accretion was recorded as a single adjustment during September for the calculated difference between the previously recorded ARO values and the new value including accretion through September 2023. These adjustments were reflected in the net profits interest calculations for September 2023. After reflecting the deduction of PCEC’s legal fees for the Current Month as discussed below in “Status of the Dissolution of the Trust—PCEC Arbitration,” the net profits deficit for the Developed Properties decreased from approximately $19.1 million for the prior month to approximately $18.1 million, while the net profits deficit for the Remaining Properties remained at approximately $0.8 million. The net profits deficit must be recouped from proceeds otherwise payable to the Trust from the Net Profits Interests. The Trust is not responsible for the payment of the deficit, which will continue to be repaid out of the proceeds from the Net Profits Interests following the sale thereof in connection with the dissolution of the Trust. Proceeds from such sale would be used to repay amounts drawn from the letter of credit and borrowed from PCEC and to pay the expenses of the Trust, including any estimated future remaining expenses, with any remaining net proceeds to be distributed to the Trust unitholders; sale proceeds will not be reflected in any monthly net profits interest calculation and therefore would not be applied to repayment of any net profits deficit in existence at the time of such sale. Based on PCEC’s estimate of its ARO attributable to the Net Profits Interests, deductions relating to estimated ARO are likely to eliminate the likelihood of any distributions to Trust unitholders for the foreseeable future, as previously disclosed in the Trust’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 13, 2019. As previously disclosed, the Trust engaged Martindale Consultants, Inc. (“Martindale”), a provider of analysis and compliance review services to the oil and gas industry, to perform an independent review of the estimated ARO in the Moss Adams report that PCEC provided to the Trustee. The Trustee also has engaged an accounting expert to advise the Trustee regarding the accruals that PCEC has booked relating to its estimated ARO. As disclosed in the Trust’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 29, 2020, Martindale has completed its review of the estimated ARO and on December 21, 2020, provided its analysis and recommendations to the Trustee. Based on Martindale’s recommendations provided in its report to the Trust, as disclosed in the Trust’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 29, 2020, the Trustee requested that PCEC promptly make several adjustments to its calculations and methods of deducting ARO from the proceeds to which the Trust is otherwise entitled pursuant to its Net Profits Interests. PCEC has responded to the Trustee, indicating PCEC’s view that the adjustments would violate applicable contracts and accounting standards, and has therefore declined to make any adjustments to the estimated ARO calculation based on those requests and the recommendations of the Martindale report. The Trustee has concluded that it has taken all actions reasonably available to it under the Trust’s governing documents in connection with PCEC’s ARO calculation and therefore has determined not to take further action at this time. Status of the Dissolution of the Trust As described in more detail in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, the Trust Agreement provides that the Trust will terminate if the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust from the Net Profits Interests and the Royalty Interest total less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive calendar years. Because of the cumulative net profits deficit—which PCEC contends is the result of the substantial reduction in commodity prices during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and PCEC’s deduction of estimated ARO beginning in the first quarter of 2020—the only cash proceeds the Trust has received from March 2020 has been attributable to the Royalty Interest, other than the period from August 2022 through February 2023, when the net profits deficit with respect to the Remaining Properties had been eliminated. As a result, the total proceeds received by the Trust in each of 2020 and 2021 were less than $2.0 million. Therefore, the Trust had been expected to terminate by its terms at the end of 2021. Evergreen Arbitration As previously disclosed in the Trust’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 23, 2021, on December 8, 2021, Evergreen Capital Management LLC (“Evergreen”) filed an Amended Class Action and Shareholder Derivative Complaint alleging a derivative action on behalf of the Trust and against PCEC in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (the “Court”). On December 10, 2021, Evergreen filed a motion for temporary restraining order and for preliminary injunction, seeking to (1) enjoin the Trustee from dissolving the Trust, (2) enjoin PCEC from dissolving the Trust, (3) direct PCEC to account for all monies withheld from the Trust on the basis of ARO costs since September 2019, and (4) direct PCEC to place such monies in escrow. On December 16, 2021, the Court granted Evergreen’s application for a temporary restraining order only to the extent of enjoining the dissolution of the Trust. Accordingly, the Trust did not dissolve at the end of 2021 and commence the process of selling its assets and winding up its affairs. On January 11, 2022, PCEC and Evergreen filed an agreed stipulation to stay the prosecution of Evergreen’s derivative claims pending an arbitration of such claims. On January 13, 2022, the Court signed an Order dissolving the December 16, 2021, temporary restraining order and entering a new temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo until a tribunal of three arbitrators appointed pursuant to the Trust Agreement could rule on any request by Evergreen for injunctive relief. On April 11, 2022, PCEC notified the Court, at the arbitrators’ request, that the arbitration panel had issued an order on April 7, 2022, denying Evergreen’s request for injunctive relief. On April 13, 2022, Evergreen notified the Court that Evergreen had filed a motion for reconsideration with the arbitration panel that same day, which was denied on May 26, 2022. On August 30, 2022, the arbitration Panel issued a Partial Final Award dismissing with prejudice Evergreen’s derivative claims against PCEC, including Evergreen’s application for an injunction. On December 5, 2023, the California Superior Court confirmed that Partial Final Award. On June 20, 2022, Evergreen filed an amended pleading in the arbitration, adding the Trustee as a party to that proceeding. In early September 2022, Evergreen informed the Trustee that it was going to seek a preliminary injunction while its claims against the Trustee were pending. At the request of the arbitration panel, the Trustee agreed to take no steps toward the sale of the Trust corpus until the Panel decided Evergreen’s application for a preliminary injunction. On September 12, 2022, the Trustee filed a motion to dismiss Evergreen’s claims against the Trustee. On September 22, 2022, Evergreen filed an opposition to the Trustee’s motion to dismiss. On September 15, 2022, Evergreen filed a motion to enjoin the Trustee from selling the Trust assets or dissolving the Trust during the pendency of the arbitration. The Trustee and PCEC filed a response in opposition to Evergreen’s motion on September 22, 2022. Both motions were heard by the Panel on October 24, 2022. On October 31, 2022, the Panel granted the Trustee’s motion and dismissed Evergreen’s claims against the Trustee with prejudice, which mooted Evergreen’s request for injunctive relief. As a result, the Trustee plans to move forward with the winding up of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement, which will include selling all of the Trust’s assets and distributing the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders after payment, or reasonable provision for payment, of all Trust liabilities, including the establishment of cash reserves in such amounts as the Trustee in its discretion deems appropriate for the purpose of making reasonable provision for all claims and obligations of the Trust, including any contingent, conditional or unmatured claims and obligations, in accordance with the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. PCEC Arbitration On March 31, 2023, PCEC submitted a demand for arbitration against the Trustee, as trustee of the Trust, seeking, among other things, (1) an order compelling the Trustee to commence the process of dissolving the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, (2) a declaration that the Conveyance permits the legal fees and costs that PCEC, as operator, incurred in defending the Evergreen litigation and arbitration proceedings described above to be deducted from the proceeds from the Net Profits Interests, and (3) a declaration that the Trust must repay, with interest, the legal fees and costs that PCEC paid on behalf of the Trust to defend claims against the Trustee in the Evergreen proceedings or, alternatively, that PCEC may deduct such legal fees and costs from the proceeds from the Net Profits Interests. The hearing before the arbitration panel was concluded on August 2, 2023, and on September 28, 2023, as previously disclosed, the arbitration panel issued its Partial Final Award, in which the panel found as follows: The Trustee is not required to immediately commence the marketing and sale of the Trust’s assets; PCEC is entitled to deduct from the net profits its own legal fees and the Trustee’s legal fees paid by PCEC in connection with the Evergreen proceedings; and PCEC is not entitled to reimbursement of such legal fees from the proceeds of the sale of the Trust’s assets. In light of the arbitration panel’s finding that the Trustee is not required to immediately commence the marketing of the Trust’s assets, the Trustee plans to continue to work with PCEC and the Trust’s independent auditor to complete the Trust’s financial statements and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will make them available to unitholders as soon as possible, at which point the Trustee expects to commence the marketing and sale process. In the meantime, the Trustee will continue to communicate material information to unitholders via press releases and Forms 8-K. Meanwhile, because the Partial Final Award confirmed PCEC’s right to deduct from the net profits its own legal fees and the Trustee’s legal fees paid by PCEC in connection with the Evergreen proceedings, PCEC deducted approximately $4.0 million (including approximately $0.4 million in interest) under the net profits interest calculation for September 2023. This amount reflected all such legal fees paid through September 30, 2023, and resulted in an increase of approximately $3.5 million to the net profits deficit for the Developed Properties and approximately $0.5 million to the net profits deficit for the Remaining Properties, as reflected in the cumulative net profits deficit amount reported above in “Update on Estimated Asset Retirement Obligations.” PCEC has deducted approximately $63,000 and approximately $6,000 from the Current Month’s net profits interest calculations for the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties, respectively. PCEC has indicated to the Trustee that PCEC continues to incur fees and expenses related to Evergreen’s appeal of its loss in the litigation and arbitration and will continue to deduct those amounts under the monthly net profits interest calculation as provided in the Conveyance, which could result in further increases to the net profits deficit. Meanwhile, the Trust expects to borrow funds from PCEC sufficient to pay the legal fees of the Trustee incurred in connection with the PCEC arbitration. Replacement of the Trustee As previously disclosed, at a special meeting of the unitholders of the Trust held on July 12, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”), a majority of the unitholders voted to remove The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee of the Trust. A successor trustee was not nominated for approval at the Special Meeting. Under Section 6.05 of the Trust Agreement, if a new trustee has not been approved within 60 days after a vote of unitholders removing a trustee, a successor trustee may be appointed by any State or Federal District Court having jurisdiction in New Castle County, Delaware, upon the application of PCEC, any Trust unitholder, or the Trustee. On September 11, 2023, PCEC filed a petition with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) seeking to appoint Province, LLC as successor trustee. On September 12, 2023, unitholders Evergreen Capital Management LLC, Shipyard Capital LP, Shipyard Capital Management LLC, Cedar Creek Partners LP, Eriksen Capital Management LLC and Walter Keenan (collectively, the “Unitholder Petitioners”) jointly filed a petition with the Court seeking to appoint Barclay Leib as temporary trustee and as successor trustee as of January 1, 2024. As Section 6.05 of the Trust Agreement requires that any successor trustee must be a bank or trust company having combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $100,000,000, the Unitholder Petitioners requested that the Court modify the Trust Agreement to remove that requirement. Subsequently, the Unitholder Petitioners elected not to proceed and filed a stipulated dismissal of their petition on October 17, 2023, which was signed by the Court that day. On October 31, 2023, PCEC filed a motion for summary judgment with regard to the appointment of a successor or temporary trustee, and the Trustee filed a response in opposition to that motion on November 14, 2023. The Court denied PCEC’s motion at a hearing held on November 28, 2023. PCEC elected not to proceed at this time and filed a stipulated dismissal of its petition, without prejudice, on February 27, 2024, which was signed by the Court that day. The Trustee is unable to predict when a successor trustee will be appointed. Until that time, the Trustee will remain as trustee of the Trust and will continue to have the rights and obligations as trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust expects to borrow funds from PCEC sufficient to pay the legal fees of the Trustee incurred in connection with the proceedings initiated by the Unitholder Petitioners. Production Update PCEC has informed the Trustee that PCEC continues to strategically deploy capital to maintain production within export and transportation constraints resulting from the previously disclosed termination of the Phillips 66 pipeline Connection Agreement described in greater detail below. These constraints have led to a curtailment of production at Orcutt, resulting in a decrease of 7,985 Bbls or (15%) for Orcutt in January 2024, as compared to December 2022, the last full month of production prior to the termination of the Connection Agreement. Cancellation of Connection Agreement with Phillips 66 As previously disclosed, PCEC has informed the Trustee that on September 22, 2022, PCEC received notice from Phillips 66 of the cancellation of the Connection Agreement between PCEC and Phillips 66 with respect to the three leases located south of Orcutt in Santa Barbara, California, effective upon completion of PCEC’s deliveries in December 2022. As a result of the cancellation, and the subsequent shutdown of the Santa Maria Refinery on January 4, 2023, PCEC no longer has a pipeline interconnection between the Orcutt properties and the Santa Maria Refinery. This pipeline was the sole means by which PCEC transported its crude oil from the Orcutt properties, which relates to approximately 86% and 91% of the production attributable to the Trust’s interests in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The shutdown of the refinery and the pipeline will adversely affect PCEC’s financial performance, and the revenues that may be payable to the Trust. PCEC previously informed the Trustee that it was able to secure a short-term contract to transport oil from the Orcutt properties commencing on January 4, 2023, albeit at reduced volumes and with a higher differential compared to the terms previously achievable through the Phillips 66 Connection Agreement. PCEC has confirmed to the Trustee that the short-term contract, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2023, has been extended to April 30, 2024 and on a month-to-month basis thereafter. Termination of this contract would adversely affect PCEC’s ability to transport oil from the Orcutt properties, as well as PCEC’s financial performance and the revenues that may be payable to the Trust. PCEC continues to explore alternative options for long-term transportation of oil from the Orcutt properties by other means. Overview of Trust Structure Pacific Coast Oil Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by PCEC to own interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Santa Maria Basin and the Los Angeles Basin in California (the “Underlying Properties”). The Underlying Properties and the Trust’s net profits and royalty interests are described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC. As described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, the amount of any periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, development expenses, and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release contains statements that are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical facts, are ""forward-looking statements"" for the purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking statements include estimates of future asset retirement obligations, expectations regarding the impact of deductions for such obligations on future distributions to unitholders, estimates of future total distributions to unitholders, the outcome of the proceedings relating to the appointment of a successor trustee, statements regarding the impact of returning shut-in wells to production, uncertainties regarding transportation of oil from the Orcutt properties and the impact of an inability to transport such oil on PCEC’s financial condition and future payments to the Trust, expectations regarding PCEC’s ability to loan funds to the Trust, expectations regarding future borrowing by the Trust and the impact such borrowing may have on any net proceeds available for distribution following a sale of the Trust’s assets, future legal fees that may be deducted under the monthly net profits interest calculation, statements regarding the expected winding down of the Trust, and the amount and date of any anticipated distribution to unitholders. In any case, PCEC’s deductions of its estimated asset retirement obligations will have a material adverse effect on distributions to the unitholders and on the trading price of the Trust units and may result in the termination of the Trust. Any anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from PCEC with respect to the relevant period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively affected by low commodity prices, which declined significantly during 2020, could decline again and could remain low for an extended period of time as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Trust and PCEC. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses related to the operation of the Underlying Properties, including lease operating expenses, expenses of the Trust, and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in this press release. Neither PCEC nor the Trustee intends, and neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included in this press release.

Reports 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. reported a full-year 2023 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.45). The company focuses on converting syngas into gasoline using proprietary technology. Verde announced a Joint Development Agreement with Cottonmouth Ventures for a facility in the Permian Basin, aiming to produce 3,000 barrels per day of gasoline. The company is in discussions for offtake arrangements for carbon credits and gasoline. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The financial results presented by Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. show a significant net loss of $(10,501,276) for the year ended December 31, 2023. This loss is primarily attributed to increased general and administrative expenses, which have more than doubled from the previous year. The loss per share of $(0.45) indicates a negative impact on shareholders' value. However, it's important to note the company's strategic partnership through the Joint Development Agreement with Cottonmouth Ventures, which could be a pivotal step towards commercializing their STG+ technology. The potential of the STG+ technology to convert syngas into gasoline using stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks aligns with the growing demand for cleaner fuel alternatives. Additionally, the proposed project's capacity to mitigate natural gas flaring in the Permian Basin by converting it into a salable product offers both environmental and economic incentives. The ability to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of gasoline could position Verde as a key player in the renewable energy sector if the technology proves to be commercially viable.Investors may also be interested in the company's ongoing discussions for offtake arrangements, which could provide revenue predictability and support project financing. The financial stability is further supported by the company's current assets, including a significant increase in cash and cash equivalents from $463,475 in 2022 to $28,779,177 in 2023. This liquidity is critical for the company's ability to continue operations and fund its research and development activities. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Verde Clean Fuels' increased operating loss and net loss year-over-year raise concerns about the company's short-term profitability. The shift from a net income in 2022 to a net loss in 2023 could be indicative of the high costs associated with the development phase of their proprietary technology. The jump in general and administrative expenses reflects the company's scaling efforts but also underscores the need for effective cost management going forward.Despite the losses, the company's balance sheet shows a strong cash position, which is important for its continued investment in the STG+ technology and for securing the necessary FEED/EPC services for the upcoming project. The presence of noncontrolling interest with a significant equity stake suggests confidence from external parties in the company's long-term prospects. The rise in additional paid-in capital, from zero to over $35 million, indicates successful capital-raising efforts, which are essential for funding capital-intensive projects.The contingent consideration reversal of $(1,299,000) compared to $(7,551,000) in the previous year could reflect changes in the estimated fair value of expected payouts related to acquisitions or performance targets, which is a non-cash adjustment but impacts reported earnings. Investors should closely monitor the final investment decision and the progress towards definitive agreements, as these will be critical milestones that can significantly influence the company's future financial performance. Environmental Economist The environmental implications of Verde Clean Fuels' STG+ technology are noteworthy. By converting stranded natural gas into gasoline, the technology addresses the issue of gas flaring, which is a significant source of carbon emissions in oil-rich regions like the Permian Basin. The environmental benefits of reducing flaring could be quantified in terms of carbon credits, which the company is currently in discussions to offload. This could provide an additional revenue stream and enhance the project's economic viability.The potential production of 3,000 barrels per day of gasoline also suggests a substantial displacement of traditional fossil fuels, aligning with global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. The company's ability to capitalize on low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credits and D3 RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers) could offer competitive advantages in markets with strong incentives for renewable energy adoption.Long-term, the success of such projects could stimulate further investment in renewable energy technologies, potentially leading to economies of scale and lower production costs. However, the commercial success of the STG+ technology will depend on its operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness and the market's willingness to adopt alternative fuels. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. (“Verde” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: VGAS), a renewable energy company focused on the development of commercial production plants to convert syngas derived from diverse feedstocks into gasoline, today reported full year 2023 GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.45). The full year net loss consists of ongoing general and administrative and research and development expenses related to the Company’s continuing focus on development of its first commercial facility based on Verde’s proprietary STG+® technology which is designed to produce gasoline utilizing either stranded natural gas or waste feedstocks. Business Update Highlights Through March 28, 2024 Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures announced the execution of a Joint Development Agreement for the first deployment of Verde’s STG+ technology in the Permian Basin. On February 13, 2024, Verde and Cottonmouth Ventures, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), announced the execution of a joint development agreement (“JDA”) for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility to produce commodity-grade gasoline utilizing associated natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback’s operations in the Permian Basin. The expectation for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde’s patented STG+ process. By consuming natural gas in the pipeline-constrained Permian Basin as feedstock, the proposed project could demonstrate the ability to mitigate the flaring of up to 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, while also producing a high-value, salable product. The JDA provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and final investment decision (“FID”). The JDA frames the contracts contemplated to be entered into between the parties, including an operating agreement, ground lease agreement, construction agreement, license agreement and financing agreements as well as conditions precedent to close such FID. Verde is continuing the selection process for FEED/EPC services for the Cottonmouth Ventures Permian Basin project. Verde is proceeding with selection of a front end engineering and design (“FEED”) partner and an engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) partner. With the execution of the Cottonmouth Ventures JDA, Verde expects to finalize its partner selections soon. Verde is in preliminary discussions with various potential offtake parties of carbon credits and gasoline. Verde is in preliminary discussions with various parties with respect to long-term offtake arrangements for the purchase of D3 RINs, LCFS Credits, and gasoline produced by our facilities. Such a potential arrangement would help manage price risk associated with these commodities and would support project finance requirements. VERDE CLEAN FUELS, INC.

(NASDAQ: IBACU) successfully closed its initial public offering of 11,500,000 units, including the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, at $10.00 per unit. The units now trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol 'IBACU'. Each unit comprises one share of common stock and one right, with the rights expected to be traded separately under symbols 'IBAC' and 'IBACR'. I-Bankers Securities, Inc. and IB Capital served as joint book-running managers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent IPO of IB Acquisition Corp. represents a notable entry into the public market, particularly for investors interested in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). The successful exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option signals strong investor interest, which can be indicative of the market's appetite for new investment vehicles. The pricing at $10.00 per unit is standard for SPAC IPOs, providing a uniform entry point for investors. The structure of the units, which includes common stock and rights, is also typical of SPAC offerings.From a market perspective, the performance of IBACU's stock post-IPO will be closely monitored as it may reflect broader market sentiment towards SPACs. The separation of the units into individual securities allows for differentiated investment strategies, with the rights offering a potential additional incentive for early investors upon a successful business combination. However, the inherent risk in SPAC investments, which hinges on the successful identification and merger with a target company, remains a critical factor for stakeholders to consider. Financial Analyst The closing of IB Acquisition Corp.'s IPO and the commencement of trading is a liquidity event that provides the company with capital to pursue its business objectives. The involvement of I-Bankers Securities, Inc. and IB Capital LLC as joint book-running managers suggests a well-orchestrated offering and the legal counsel of ArentFox Schiff LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP indicates thorough legal compliance and due diligence.Analyzing the financial implications, the capital raised could be leveraged to fund the company's initial business combination, which is the primary goal of any SPAC. Investors will be looking at the management's expertise and track record in selecting a profitable acquisition target. The timeline for the initial business combination will be a key factor in evaluating the potential return on investment, as prolonged periods of uncertainty can lead to market volatility for the stock. Securities Law Expert The effective registration statement by the SEC is a critical step in the IPO process, ensuring that all necessary disclosures are made to protect investors. The mention of the prospectus is significant as it provides detailed information regarding the offering, the company's strategy and potential risks involved. It is a important document for investors to review before making investment decisions.Furthermore, the legal stipulation that the securities cannot be sold in jurisdictions where they are not registered or qualified under local securities laws is an important reminder of the regulatory complexities associated with public offerings. The role of legal counsel in navigating these regulations cannot be understated, as non-compliance can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions for the company. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM Boca Raton, Florida, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IB Acquisition Corp.

The units began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “IBACU” on March 26, 2024. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one right. Each right entitles the holder to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock and rights are expected to be traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols “IBAC” and “IBACR,” respectively.

Negative Voluntarily paused Phase 3 enrollment in the Epetraborole Pivotal Phase 2/3 Clinical Study due to potentially lower than expected efficacy based on aggregate data from ongoing Phase 2 study. Financial Analyst The financial health of AN2 Therapeutics, Inc. is a pivotal aspect for current and potential investors. With a reported cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $134.5 million at the end of 2023, the company appears to have a robust runway to fund its operations and clinical trials. This is particularly significant considering the increase in Research and Development (R&D) expenses to $54.9 million for the year, up from $29.5 million in the previous year. The uptick in R&D expenses is indicative of the company's aggressive investment in its pipeline, especially in clinical trial activities. However, it's important to note the net loss widened to $64.7 million for the year 2023 from $41.0 million in the prior year. This could be a point of concern for investors as it may indicate a longer path to profitability. The increase in General and Administrative (G&A) expenses, although not as steep as R&D, also reflects the growing operational scale of the company. On the other hand, the rise in other income, net to $4.9 million for the year, benefited from higher interest rates and suggests prudent financial management of the company's cash reserves. Looking forward, the anticipated Phase 2 topline results in summer 2024 will be a critical milestone that could significantly influence the company's stock performance. The data will not only impact the clinical development pathway but also investor confidence in the company's ability to bring epetraborole to market. Medical Research Analyst The clinical development of epetraborole for treatment-refractory Mycobacterium avium Complex (TR-MAC) lung disease is at the heart of AN2 Therapeutics' value proposition. The Phase 2/3 trial's progress is a key indicator of the potential for epetraborole to meet a high unmet medical need. The voluntary pause in Phase 3 enrollment, while not due to safety concerns, suggests the company is taking a cautious approach in response to potentially lower than expected efficacy in the ongoing Phase 2 study. This decision underscores the complexity of treating TR-MAC, especially given the patient population's characteristics, which include complex comorbidities and refractory to the only FDA-approved drug, Arikayce. From a medical research perspective, the continuation of dosing in the current trial participants and the planned discussions with the FDA are positive steps towards optimizing the development strategy. The company's expansion into other infectious diseases, such as Chagas disease and melioidosis, through its boron chemistry pipeline, diversifies its portfolio and could mitigate risk associated with the TR-MAC program. The grant received from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to discover novel treatments for tuberculosis and malaria further validates the potential of AN2's boron-based technology platform. This external support not only provides financial assistance but also adds credibility to the company's research initiatives. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM Phase 2/3 trial (EBO-301) in treatment-refractory Mycobacterium avium Complex (TR-MAC) continues with Phase 2 topline results expected in summer 2024 and Phase 3 enrollment pause in place during continued analysis of incoming data; plan to discuss with FDA Cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $134.5 million at December 31, 2023 MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AN2 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for rare, chronic, and serious infectious diseases with high unmet needs, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “AN2’s cash position remains strong as we advance our innovative boron-based pipeline. Following the recent meeting of the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, we continue to believe in the potential of epetraborole to become an important component of the backbone therapy for NTM lung disease,” said Eric Easom, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Patients enrolled in the epetraborole Phase 2/3 trial in treatment refractory lung disease caused by MAC continue to be dosed while new enrollment in the Phase 3 part of the trial remains paused. Patients in the Phase 2 trial have reached the six-month mark, and we plan to report topline results this summer. Analysis of the baseline patient demographics from the trial show a highly complex and refractory patient population, which we plan to discuss with the FDA in the coming months.” Easom continued, “We are pleased with the momentum across our boron chemistry pipeline. We signed a licensing agreement last fall with the University of Georgia Research Foundation to develop a novel therapy for chronic Chagas disease, which is in late preclinical development and we are also progressing an IV formulation of epetraborole for melioidosis, in addition to advancing other research programs. We believe epetraborole, along with these other promising boron therapy candidates, has the opportunity to help address significant unmet patient need.” Fourth Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Epetraborole Pivotal Phase 2/3 Clinical Study in TR-MAC Lung Disease This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is comparing epetraborole plus a background regimen versus placebo plus background regimen in patients with TR-MAC lung disease. In February 2024, the Company announced that it had voluntarily paused Phase 3 enrollment in the seamless Phase 2/3 clinical trial, pending further data review. The voluntary pause was instituted following an analysis of blinded aggregate data from the ongoing Phase 2 study, which showed potentially lower than expected efficacy. The aggregate baseline characteristics reveal patients with complex comorbidities, prolonged NTM lung disease, and high levels of cavitary disease, as well as patients who are refractory to Arikayce, the only FDA-approved drug for refractory NTM caused by MAC, as part of their background regimen. The decision to pause Phase 3 enrollment was not due to safety concerns. While the Phase 3 part of the trial is paused for new enrollment (n=97), the Company is continuing to dose existing patients enrolled in the Phase 2/3 trial under the existing protocol. The Company plans to provide further details on the epetraborole development strategy after discussion with FDA and continued review of the accumulated blinded data. The Company expects to announce topline data from the Phase 2 part of the trial in summer 2024. Presented New Epetraborole Data at Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) IDWeek 2023 Conference. In October 2023, three poster presentations and two oral presentations were presented at the IDWeek 2023 conference that detailed the potential of epetraborole in treating NTM (nontuberculous mycobacteria) lung disease caused by MAC and Mycobacterium abscessus. The Company also presented data on its melioidosis program. Executed License from University of Georgia Research Foundation to Develop Boron-Containing Product Candidates for Chagas Disease. In October 2023, AN2 announced that it had executed an exclusive license from the University of Georgia Research Foundation to advance the development of a boron-containing small molecule, AN2-502998 (formerly AN15368), for Chagas disease. This boron-based molecule was originally discovered by researchers at Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer), which included some of the current AN2 team, and the University of Georgia, with grant funding from the Wellcome Trust. AN2-502998 has advanced into late preclinical development for chronic Chagas disease. Received Grant from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In September 2023, AN2 announced that it received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to discover novel, boron containing small molecules for the treatment of tuberculosis and malaria. Selected Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the full year 2023 were $54.9 million, compared to $29.5 million in the prior year. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $14.9 million compared to $8.8 million for the same period during 2022 due to increased clinical trial expenses, personnel-related expenses, consulting and outside services, and other expenses, partially offset by lower chemistry manufacturing and controls expenses.

Financially, Centessa has $256.5 million in cash, research & development expenses of $29.7 million, general & administrative expenses of $12.3 million, and a net loss of $36.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Biotech Industry Analyst The ongoing clinical studies for SerpinPC represent a pivotal phase in Centessa Pharmaceuticals' development pipeline. The hemophilia B market, although niche, is characterized by a high unmet need for treatments that offer both efficacy and safety. SerpinPC's potential to reduce bleeding rates without causing thrombosis could position it as a significant advancement in hemophilia therapy. The interim analysis in 2024 will be a key indicator of the drug's performance and could impact Centessa's market valuation significantly.From a financial perspective, the cash reserves are adequate to fund operations into 2026, which provides a cushion for the company to complete its ongoing studies without immediate fundraising pressure. However, the slight increase in R&D expenses year-over-year could indicate escalating costs as the company progresses through later-stage trials, which is typical in the biotech industry. Investors should monitor the burn rate and the outcomes of the clinical trials, as these will be critical factors in the company's ability to bring these products to market and achieve profitability. Pharmaceutical Development Expert The novel mechanism of action of SerpinPC, which involves the inhibition of activated protein C, is an innovative approach in the treatment of hemophilia. The reported 96% reduction in median all-bleed ABR is impressive and could indicate a transformative therapy for patients if the results are replicated in the registrational studies. For the orexin agonist program, the clinical proof-of-concept data for ORX750 will be important to validate the preclinical findings and establish the drug's potential in treating sleep-wake disorders.The LockBody technology platform is another area of interest, with LB101's ongoing study potentially offering a new therapeutic angle for solid tumors. The dual targeting mechanism could enhance the immune response against tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity, a common issue with cancer immunotherapies. The performance of this platform in clinical settings could have broad implications for Centessa's oncology pipeline and future partnerships. Financial Market Analyst Centessa's financial results show a net loss, which is expected for a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on R&D. The decrease in net loss year-over-year may reflect a tighter control on expenses or improved operational efficiencies. The company's ability to extend its cash runway through ATM sales without heavily diluting existing shareholders is a positive sign for investors. This strategic financial management could provide stability to the stock price in the short term.However, the true test will come with the interim analysis results for the hemophilia program and the proof-of-concept data for the orexin agonist program. Positive outcomes could lead to significant stock appreciation, while any setbacks might negatively impact investor sentiment. The biotech sector is highly volatile and news-driven and Centessa's stock will likely react to these milestones. Long-term investors should weigh the potential of the company's pipeline against the inherent risks of clinical development. 03/28/2024 - 04:28 PM Hemophilia Program: Ongoing registrational PRESent-2 and PRESent-3 studies of SerpinPC for the treatment of hemophilia B; PRESent-2 advancing toward interim analysis planned in 2024Orexin Agonist Program: Clinical proof-of-concept data for ORX750 in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers planned in 2024LockBody® Technology Platform: Ongoing Phase 1/2a study of LB101 (PD-L1xCD47) for the treatment of solid tumors BOSTON and LONDON, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: CNTA), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, today reported recent business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. “This is an exciting and pivotal time for Centessa,” said Saurabh Saha MD PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Centessa. “We are laser focused on executing the PRESent registrational studies for SerpinPC, a potential first-in-class subcutaneously administered therapy with a differentiated safety profile for individuals with hemophilia B, and advancing our orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) agonist development program into the clinic for the treatment of narcolepsy and other sleep-wake disorders.” Dr. Saha continued, “SerpinPC’s novel mechanism of action is designed to prevent or reduce bleeding in persons with hemophilia without depleting natural anticoagulants that help prevent blood clots. The most recent clinical data from our ongoing Phase 2a study showed that an additional 52-weeks of continuous treatment with SerpinPC reduced the median all-bleed ABR by 96% relative to baseline, and no thrombosis has been observed across the study to date. Within the PRESent registrational studies for SerpinPC, we are looking to replicate this safety profile and meaningfully reduce bleeding rates for subjects with hemophilia B, with or without inhibitors. We look forward to confirming a dose and advancing to Part 2 of the PRESent-2 study this year.” “We are very excited with progress within our OX2R agonist development program, and more specifically, ORX750, an orally administered, highly potent and selective OX2R agonist,” said Dr. Saha. “In late 2023, we shared preclinical data that we believe support ORX750’s potential to be a best-in-class oral OX2R agonist for the treatment of narcolepsy and other sleep-wake disorders. We remain on track with our goal to share clinical proof-of-concept data for ORX750 in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers this year.” “In parallel, we continue to evaluate our proprietary LockBody technology platform in a first-in-human clinical study of LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to selectively drive CD47 into the tumor microenvironment while avoiding systemic toxicity, in solid tumors. We look to this study to provide valuable insights regarding the safety and tolerability of LB101, as well as the performance of our LockBody platform in a clinical setting.” Recent Highlights In December 2023 and February 2024, the Company presented data from an additional 52-weeks of continuous treatment from the third year (Part 5) of the ongoing Phase 2a study of SerpinPC, an investigational subcutaneously administered novel inhibitor of activated protein C (APC) for the treatment of hemophilia, during presentations at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and the 17th Annual Congress of the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD). Part 5 data from the Phase 2a study showed a continued favorable safety and tolerability profile for SerpinPC, as well as sustained long-term efficacy results, as measured by a 96% reduction in the median all-bleed annualized bleeding rate (ABR) from the prospective baseline measured during the pre-exposure observation period. To date, there have been no thromboembolic events and no treatment-related sustained elevations of D-dimer observed throughout the Phase 2a study.In October 2023, the Company announced the dosing of the first subject in its registrational PRESent-3 clinical study of SerpinPC for the treatment of hemophilia B with inhibitors. The Company initiated dosing in its registrational PRESent-2 clinical study of SerpinPC for the treatment of hemophilia B without inhibitors in July 2023.In October 2023, the Company announced preclinical data from in vivo and in vitro studies of its investigational, novel OX2R agonist, ORX750, that we believe support a potential best-in-class profile for the treatment of narcolepsy and other sleep-wake disorders. Anticipated Upcoming Program Milestones Hemophilia Program - The registrational PRESent-2 (hemophilia B without inhibitors) and PRESent-3 (hemophilia B with inhibitors) studies of SerpinPC are ongoing. For PRESent-2, the Company plans to confirm a dose and advance to Part 2 of the study based on a review of Part 1 (dose justification) data in 2024 (interim analysis). The primary endpoint of the PRESent-2 study is the rate of treated bleeds (expressed as ABR) during the first 24 weeks of treatment with SerpinPC (Part 2) compared to the observation period. The Company plans to share Part 1 data at a medical conference in late 2024 or early 2025.Orexin Agonist Program - Upon Investigational New Drug (“IND”) clearance, the Company plans to rapidly advance ORX750 into clinical development with the goal of sharing clinical proof-of-concept data in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers in 2024.LockBody Technology Platform - The Phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical study of LB101 (PD-L1xCD47 LockBody) is ongoing. Where applicable, the Company plans to provide updates on preclinical programs including follow-up orexin agonists and LB206, a PD-L1xCD3 LockBody, when they advance toward clinical studies.

PRESent-5 is an observational feeder study to collect prospective observational data for minimum defined periods before switching to dosing subjects in the interventional studies. The interventional studies include PRESent-2 (moderately severe to severe hemophilia B without inhibitors, and severe hemophilia A with or without inhibitors) and PRESent-3 (hemophilia B with inhibitors). Additional information on the trials can be accessed at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05605678, NCT05789524, NCT05789537). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to SerpinPC for the treatment of hemophilia B, with or without inhibitors. SerpinPC has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for any use. About ORX750 ORX750 is an investigational, orally administered, highly potent and selective orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) agonist designed to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of orexin neuron loss in narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). ORX750 has been shown in preclinical studies to potently activate the OX2R with an in vitro EC50 of 0.11 nM and 9,800-fold selectivity over the human orexin receptor (hOX1R). ORX750 is Centessa’s first orexin product candidate being developed for the treatment of narcolepsy with potential expansion into other sleep-wake disorders. ORX750 has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority. About the LockBody Technology Platform and LB101 Centessa’s proprietary LockBody technology platform aims to redefine immuno-oncology treatment for patients with cancer. LockBody drug candidates are designed to selectively drive potent effector function activity, such as CD47 or CD3, to the tumor micro-environment (TME) while avoiding systemic toxicity. The first LockBody candidate is LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bispecific monoclonal antibody which has two anti-CD47 domains blocked by two anti-PD-L1 domains, with proprietary human IgG-derived hinges linking the anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1 domains. The cell-killing mechanism of action, CD47, is designed to be blocked by the PD-L1 tumor targeting domain until the IgG-derived hinges are naturally degraded in the TME, thus unlocking and activating the CD47 effector function activity in the tumor. LB101 is in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial. Additional information on the trial can be accessed at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05821777). LB101 is an investigational agent that has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.

The initiative offers preferential terms for acquiring next-generation sustainable equipment from CNH brands, focusing on bio-methane tractors, methanisation units, precision technology kits, and electric machines. CNH Capital aims to support customers' transition to sustainable practices and drive the adoption of environmentally friendly solutions through innovative financial services. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the initiative by CNH Capital to offer preferential financing terms for sustainable agricultural and construction equipment is a strategic move that aligns with current market trends towards sustainability. The European market has been showing an increasing demand for eco-friendly solutions, driven by regulatory pressures, environmental awareness and the competitive advantage that sustainability can provide to businesses.The focus on bio-methane tractors, methanisation units, precision technology kits and electric machines suggests a targeted approach to support the adoption of technologies that can reduce carbon footprints. This could potentially increase market share for CNH in the sustainable equipment sector, as cost is often a barrier for the adoption of new technologies. By reducing the financing costs, CNH Capital is not only fostering customer loyalty but also potentially expanding its customer base to those who are now incentivized to make the transition to greener technologies. Environmental Economist Examining the economic implications, CNH Capital's campaign could stimulate investment in sustainable technology within the agricultural and construction industries. The reduced cost of financing can lower the threshold for entry into sustainable practices, which might lead to a ripple effect of increased productivity and reduced environmental impact. In the long term, this could contribute to the overall reduction of the carbon footprint of these industries.However, it's important to consider that the upfront cost is just one aspect of adopting new technologies. Operational costs, maintenance and the total cost of ownership are also important factors that affect the decision-making process of businesses. The success of such financial incentives will largely depend on how they stack up against these long-term costs and the perceived value of the investment in sustainable technologies. Sustainability Analyst From a sustainability standpoint, CNH Capital's campaign is a significant step towards promoting environmentally responsible business practices. By making sustainable equipment more financially accessible, CNH is contributing to the broader goal of reducing the environmental impact of the agriculture and construction sectors. This initiative also reflects positively on CNH's corporate social responsibility profile and can enhance its reputation as a leader in sustainability.It's essential to scrutinize the actual environmental benefits of the equipment being financed. The life cycle analysis, including production, operation and disposal impacts, should be favorable. If the sustainable equipment offerings are indeed effective in reducing emissions and environmental degradation, this initiative can be a model for how financial services can play a pivotal role in driving sustainability in industry. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / CNH Capital, CNH's financial services engine specialized in the financing and leasing of agricultural and construction equipment, announced the launch of a special campaign across key European markets.The aim is to reduce the cost of financing sustainable equipment for end customers in 2024.This initiative, spanning Italy, France, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, Benelux, Poland, and Austria, offers preferential financing terms for acquiring or accessing next-generation sustainable equipment from CNH brands.

JOHN HANCOCK HEDGED EQUITY & INCOME FUND REQUIRED NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS - SOURCES OF DISTRIBUTION UNDER SECTION 19(a),2024-03-28T20:10:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"John Hancock Hedged Equity & Income Fund (HEQ) announced sources of its quarterly distribution of $0.2500 per share. The distribution includes net investment income, short-term, and long-term capital gains. The fund's average annual total return for the past 5 years was 4.88%, with an annualized current distribution rate of 8.53% of NAV. The cumulative total return for the fiscal year through February 29, 2024, was 0.95%.","JOHN HANCOCK HEDGED EQUITY & INCOME FUND REQUIRED NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS - SOURCES OF DISTRIBUTION UNDER SECTION 19(a) Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary John Hancock Hedged Equity & Income Fund (HEQ) announced sources of its quarterly distribution of $0.2500 per share. The distribution includes net investment income, short-term, and long-term capital gains. The fund's average annual total return for the past 5 years was 4.88%, with an annualized current distribution rate of 8.53% of NAV. The cumulative total return for the fiscal year through February 29, 2024, was 0.95%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by John Hancock Hedged Equity & Income Fund regarding its quarterly distribution breakdown offers a snapshot into the fund's current income-generating capabilities. With approximately 49% of the distribution sourced from net investment income, the fund demonstrates a capacity to pay out earnings derived from its investment holdings, which could be indicative of a stable or robust portfolio performance. The significant portion, 44%, coming from net realized short-term capital gains, suggests active trading strategies or the realization of gains from investments held for less than a year.It is noteworthy that the annualized current distribution rate of 8.53% relative to the Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the end of February stands out when compared to the average annual total return of 4.88% over the past five years. This discrepancy could potentially signal a higher payout ratio that might not be sustainable in the long run without capital appreciation or additional income sources. Investors would benefit from monitoring subsequent distributions to assess the consistency of these payouts and the fund's underlying performance. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the composition of the fund's distribution is important information for shareholders. The distinction between net investment income and realized capital gains has different tax implications. The latter, split into short-term and long-term categories, could influence an investor's tax liability depending on their individual tax bracket and the holding period of the fund's securities. No part of the distribution is classified as a return of capital, which can be beneficial as it typically reduces an investor's cost basis and defers tax liability until the sale of the fund shares.However, the high percentage of the distribution coming from short-term capital gains, taxed at ordinary income rates, could lead to a higher tax bill for investors in the current year. It's important for shareholders to consult with tax professionals to understand the impact of these distributions on their personal tax situation and to plan accordingly for any potential tax liabilities that may arise from holding this investment. Market Research Analyst Examining the fund's distribution components in relation to industry benchmarks provides valuable context. The fund's distribution rate is quite high when compared to the average yield of other closed-end funds, which could make it attractive to income-focused investors. However, the sustainability of such distributions is a key factor to consider. The fund's reliance on short-term capital gains could be reflective of a more aggressive or opportunistic investment approach, which may carry higher risk and volatility.Furthermore, the fund's performance relative to its NAV is an essential metric for investors to consider. While the cumulative total return for the fiscal year is modest at 0.95%, the distribution rate is over twice the total return for the same period. This could suggest that the fund is distributing more than what it earns, a practice that, if continued, could potentially erode the fund's NAV over time. Investors should keep an eye on the fund's investment strategy and market conditions, as these will influence future distributions and the overall health of the fund. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM BOSTON, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - John Hancock Hedged Equity & Income Fund (NYSE: HEQ) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund managed by John Hancock Investment Management LLC (the ""Adviser"") and subadvised by Wellington Management Company LLP (the ""Subadviser""), announced today sources of its quarterly distribution of $0.2500 per share paid to all shareholders of record as of March 11, 2024, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan.

The Fund has declared a distribution payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 25, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of March 22, 2024. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your Fund’s distributions. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan. The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income (""NII""); net realized short-term capital gains (""STCG""); net realized long-term capital gains (""LTCG""); and return of capital (""ROC"").

(2) The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should not use this Notice as a substitute for your Form 1099-DIV. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor.

Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. The Fund may write (sell) covered call options on all or a portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio. The use of options may require the Fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold an equity security that it might otherwise sell. Premiums from writing (selling) call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in the Fund's portfolio can vary widely over time. An adverse event affecting an issuer of equity securities, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value of a particular equity security held by the Fund. Also, the prices of equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the prices of equity securities to which the Fund has exposure. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the equity securities in which the Fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. The Fund may not invest 25% or more of its total assets in securities of issuers in any single industry. If the Fund is focused in an industry, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries of the economy. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder report and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework. Financial professionals are responsible for evaluating investment risks independently and for exercising independent judgment in determining whether investments are appropriate for their clients. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this press release that are not historical facts are referred to as ""forward‑looking statements"" under the U.S. federal securities laws. Actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward‑looking statements due to numerous factors. Generally, the words ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""estimate,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""will"" and similar expressions identify forward‑looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.

The Company's Executive Chairman has expressed support for the offering. The rights offering will be registered with the SEC via Form S-3. Negative None. Financial Analyst Pulse Biosciences' decision to initiate a rights offering is a strategic move aimed at raising capital. From a financial perspective, this is a significant event because it directly impacts the company's capital structure and liquidity. The offering could potentially infuse up to $60 million initially, with an additional $66 million if all warrants are exercised. This influx of capital could be used to accelerate the development of their CellFX® technology, fund research and development, or expand market reach.The structure of the rights offering, providing current shareholders with the ability to purchase additional shares at a potentially discounted rate, is designed to incentivize participation and reward loyalty. However, it is important to note that such offerings can dilute existing shareholders' stakes. Investors should pay attention to the final terms, including the subscription price, which hinges on the volume-weighted average price prior to the offering's expiration. The over-subscription right is another aspect to monitor, as it could lead to further dilution if heavily utilized.Robert Duggan's commitment as a majority stockholder is a positive signal to the market, potentially stabilizing the stock price during the offering period. The outcome of this rights offering will be a key indicator of investor confidence in Pulse Biosciences' future and its current valuation. Market Research Analyst The medical technology industry, where Pulse Biosciences operates, is highly competitive and capital intensive. The company's proprietary CellFX® Nanosecond Pulsed Field Ablation™ technology suggests a niche market position, which could be advantageous. However, the success of such technology is highly dependent on market acceptance and regulatory approvals.Investors should consider the broader industry trends, such as the increasing demand for non-invasive treatments, which could drive the adoption of Pulse Biosciences' offerings. The rights offering could signal the company's readiness to scale operations or advance towards commercialization. Nevertheless, it's important to assess the company's past financial performance and R&D success rates to gauge whether the potential capital raised will likely lead to a favorable return on investment.Moreover, the market's response to the rights offering will reflect perceptions of the company's growth prospects. A successful offering, particularly one with significant over-subscription, could indicate strong market belief in the company's strategic direction and technology. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM HAYWARD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pulse Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLSE), a company leveraging its novel and proprietary CellFX® Nanosecond Pulsed Field Ablation™ (nsPFA™) technology, today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved plans to initiate a rights offering. The rights offering of up to $60 million worth of units (“Units”) will be available to all holders of record of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Common Stock”) as of the close of the market on a record date in April to be announced as soon as practicable (the “Record Date”). Each Unit will consist of one share of Common Stock and warrants to purchase a total of one share of Common Stock, with each warrant having different redemption provisions. The subscription price per Unit shall be equal to the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Unit (the “Initial Price”) or (ii) the volume weighted average price of the Company’s Common Stock over the 10 trading days prior to the expiration date of the offering. The subscription price will determine the final number of Units issuable, and subsequently the pro rata number of Units to which stockholders can subscribe. Each warrant will have a per share exercise price equal to 110% of the subscription price for the Units. The Company intends to distribute to all holders of Common Stock as of the Record Date non-transferable subscription rights to purchase Units at the price provided above. Assuming that the rights offering is fully subscribed at the Initial Price, the Company will receive gross proceeds of up to $60 million, less expenses related to the rights offering, and upon exercise of all of the warrants, would receive additional proceeds of up to $66 million. The rights offering will include an over-subscription right to permit each rights holder that exercises its basic subscription rights in full to purchase additional Units that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the offering. The availability of the over-subscription right will be subject to certain terms and conditions to be set forth in the offering documents. Robert Duggan, the Company’s Executive Chairman and majority stockholder, has indicated his support for the rights offering and his intent to participate in the rights offering on the same terms as all other investors.

Revenue increased by 76% YoY to $13.1 million. However, they reported a net loss of $48.5 million for the full year. Positive Cepton is expanding its OEM project experience to commercialize automotive grade lidars. Partnership with Koito for potential acquisition. Showcased Cepton Ultra, a next-gen long-range lidar product, at CES 2024. Revenue for full year 2023 increased by 76% to $13.1 million. Fourth quarter 2023 product revenue increased by 152% YoY. Full year gross margin was 27%, and fourth quarter 2023 gross margin was 54%. Developed MagnoSteer™, a proprietary scanning and imaging technology. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 was $(41.2) million. Cepton will host a conference call to discuss the results. Cepton's revenue increased significantly in 2023, showing strong growth. The company is actively engaged in partnerships and new product development. The financial results indicate a positive trend in revenue growth. The launch of Cepton Ultra and MagnoSteer™ demonstrates technological advancement. The conference call provides an opportunity for investors to gain insights into the company's performance. Negative Net loss for the full year 2023 was $48.5 million. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net loss was $8.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was negative at $(41.2) million. Sequentially, there was a decrease in product revenue in the fourth quarter. Development revenue was minimal in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net loss for full year 2023 was $38.9 million. Investors need to be cautious about the company's high net losses. The negative adjusted EBITDA raises concerns about the company's profitability. The decrease in product revenue sequentially may indicate potential challenges. The minimal development revenue in the third quarter could impact future growth prospects. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of 76% for Cepton in 2023, surpassing their guidance, indicates a strong market demand for their lidar solutions. The increase in product revenue by 152% in Q4, despite a sequential decrease, suggests a volatile but growing interest in their offerings. However, the significant net loss reported both quarterly and yearly, alongside a negative adjusted EBITDA, raises concerns about the company's current profitability and cost management strategies.Investors should note the gross margin improvement to 54% in Q4, indicating better cost efficiency or higher-margin product mix. This could be a positive sign for future profitability if sustained. The potential acquisition by Koito Manufacturing could also lead to strategic advantages and financial backing, but the non-binding nature of the offer means it's still uncertain. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Cepton's partnership with Koito and the ongoing discussions with top automotive OEMs are indicative of the company's competitive positioning in the lidar industry. The launch of the Cepton Ultra product at CES 2024, along with the proprietary MagnoSteer™ technology, positions Cepton as an innovator in a market that is critical for autonomous driving and smart infrastructure development.Their involvement in smart infrastructure, such as airport systems and autonomous industrial vehicles, broadens their application scope beyond automotive, potentially opening up new revenue streams. This diversification is essential as the lidar market becomes increasingly competitive with new entrants and technological advancements.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. The statements included above as well as any other statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “objective,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “milestone,” “designed to,” “proposed” or other similar expressions that predict or imply future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the indication of interest received from Koito and uncertainty as to the pricing, timing or terms of any transaction with Koito, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, potential benefits and the commercial attractiveness to its customers of Cepton’s products and services, the potential success of Cepton’s marketing and expansion strategies, and the potential for Cepton to achieve design awards. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Cepton’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including (1) the conditions affecting the markets in which Cepton operates; (2) the success of Cepton’s strategic relationships, including with Koito, which is not exclusive; (3) fluctuations in sales by Cepton’s major customers; (4) fluctuations in capital spending in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets; (5) negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, the effects of public health crises, and the potential impact of geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; (6) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (7) the possibility that Cepton’s business may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors; (8) the risk that current trends in the automotive and smart infrastructure markets decelerate or do not continue; (9) errors or material differences in Cepton’s estimates and expectations for its financial performance and growth, including when Cepton will generate positive cash flow from operations; (10) risks relating to the uncertainty of projected financial and operating information, including whether Cepton will be able to achieve its target milestones, its pricing and sales volume targets, and win the engagements contemplated in its projected pipeline, and the ability of OEMs and other strategic partners to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs; (11) risks related to future market adoption of Cepton’s offerings; (12) risks related to Cepton’s marketing and growth strategies; (13) the effects of competition on Cepton’s future business; (14) Cepton’s ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future; (15) Cepton’s ability to raise funding on reasonable terms as necessary to develop its products in the timeframe contemplated by its business plan, and to comply with the terms of any restrictive, financial or other covenants in the agreements governing such funding, including the consent and other rights granted to Koito as part of Koito’s convertible preferred stock investment; (16) Cepton’s ability to execute its business plans and strategy; (17) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Cepton, including any related to the business combination with Growth Capital Acquisition Corp.; and (18) the other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the reports and documents Cepton files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks materialize or any of Cepton’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Cepton does not presently know or that Cepton currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Cepton’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Cepton anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Cepton’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. Cepton undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. Actual results, performance or achievements may, and are likely to, differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements were based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Cepton’s control. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as non-GAAP net loss and adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP net loss is defined as GAAP net (loss) income excluding stock-based compensation, non-recurring transaction expenses, gain or loss on changes in fair value of earnout liability and warrants, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on impairment of property and equipment, and foreign currency transaction loss, net. As a result of the cancellation of the GM series production award in December 2023, Cepton recognized an impairment loss of $0.4 million associated with long-lived assets acquired specifically for production of ADAS lidar sensors. This loss is excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP net loss. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as non-GAAP net loss before interest income or expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Cepton believes these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Cepton’s financial condition and results of operations. Cepton believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating actual and projected operating results and trends in comparing Cepton’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Cepton also believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and analysts in assessing our operating performance during the periods these charges were incurred on a consistent basis with the periods during which these charges were not incurred. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an inference that our future results and financial position will be unaffected by unusual items. Cepton does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and other amounts that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Cepton’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and other amounts are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.

(UNCY) announces financial results for 2023, highlights progress in clinical development programs OLC and UNI-494. OLC topline data expected in Q2 2024, UNI-494 granted orphan drug designation for delayed graft function in acute kidney injury. Positive None. Negative Net loss increased due to change in fair value of warrant liability. Licensing revenues decreased from 2022. Increase in R&D and G&A expenses. Cash position at $9.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Biotech Industry Analyst The recent update from Unicycive Therapeutics, Inc. regarding its clinical trials and financial results presents a multifaceted picture for stakeholders. The completion of enrollment for the OLC clinical trial marks a significant milestone in the drug's development pathway. If OLC shows positive results for treating hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis, it could address a substantial unmet medical need. Given the proprietary nature of the nanoparticle technology, if approved, OLC could potentially capture a sizeable market share within the phosphate binder market, which is projected to grow in the coming years.The designation of UNI-494 as an orphan drug for preventing DGF post-kidney transplantation is another positive development. Orphan drug status not only provides tax advantages and fee waivers but also market exclusivity, which could significantly enhance Unicycive's competitive positioning. However, it is important to note that the path from orphan drug designation to market approval is fraught with clinical and regulatory challenges and the market exclusivity is contingent upon eventual FDA approval.From a financial perspective, the increase in R&D expenses reflects ongoing investment in their pipeline, which is expected for a clinical-stage biotech firm. The private placement leading to $50 million in gross proceeds boosts the company's cash runway, which is important for sustaining operations during the capital-intensive drug development phase. However, investors should monitor the burn rate and subsequent funding needs, as biotech firms often require substantial capital infusions before reaching profitability. Financial Analyst Unicycive's financial results indicate a net loss increase year-over-year, which is not uncommon in the biotech industry where upfront investments are substantial and returns may not be realized for several years. The reported increase in net loss is primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's warrant liability, which is a non-cash item and can be volatile. This accounting measure does not directly affect the company's cash flow, but it does impact the reported earnings and could influence investor perception.The cash position, bolstered by a recent private placement, is a critical factor for Unicycive. The reported $9.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023, supplemented by an additional $50 million from the private placement, is a strong indicator that the company can sustain its current development plans without immediate financial distress. This extended cash runway into 2026 provides a cushion for the company to complete its ongoing trials and pursue FDA approval processes.Investors should consider the potential dilutive effects of the private placement on existing shares. Additionally, licensing revenue fluctuations, though relatively minor in the context of the company's overall financials, should be tracked as they can provide insights into the company's ability to monetize its intellectual property through partnerships. Healthcare Market Analyst The pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the area of chronic diseases like CKD, is highly competitive and subject to rapid advancements. Unicycive's focus on kidney disease treatments places it in a niche yet growing market. The global burden of CKD and the associated complications like hyperphosphatemia are on the rise, indicating a growing market for effective treatments. OLC's potential as a next-generation treatment could position Unicycive favorably in the market if clinical outcomes are positive and the FDA approval is secured.UNI-494's progress in clinical trials and its orphan drug status for DGF prevention is a strategic advantage. However, it is important to assess the size of the addressable market and the competitive landscape, as these factors will ultimately determine the commercial potential of the drug. Orphan drugs often command premium pricing due to their specialized nature, but the actual market impact will depend on the drug's efficacy, safety profile and the company's marketing strategy post-approval.Investors should also be aware of the broader industry trends, such as regulatory changes or shifts in healthcare policy, which could affect the market dynamics for CKD treatments. As the company progresses towards potential commercialization, understanding payer dynamics and reimbursement scenarios will be essential for evaluating the long-term revenue potential of Unicycive's product candidates. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM – Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC) Topline Data Expected in Q2 2024 – – UNI-494 Granted Orphan Drug Designation in Delayed Graft Function of Acute Kidney Injury – – UNI-494 Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose Portion of Clinical Trial Complete – LOS ALTOS, Calif., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unicycive Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: UNCY) (the “Company” or “Unicycive”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies for patients with kidney disease, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “The last several months have been extremely productive for Unicycive as we advanced both of our clinical development programs and secured new funding from several leading healthcare institutional investors,” said Shalabh Gupta, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Unicycive. “The completion of enrollment in our pivotal OLC clinical trial was a critical achievement as we believe the novel characteristics of oxylanthanum carbonate (OLC) will show its potential as a best-in-class product to treat hyperphosphatemia for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. Positive results from the trial will provide the basis to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and we remain on track with topline data expected from the trial towards the latter part of the second quarter of this year and plan to file the NDA shortly thereafter.” Dr. Gupta added, “We also made meaningful progress with our second clinical development program, UNI-494, targeting prevention of delayed graft function (DGF) and other conditions related to acute kidney injury. Earlier this month, UNI-494 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the prevention of DGF after kidney transplantation, and we presented new data showing statistically significant results for UNI-494 in a preclinical model of DGF. We successfully completed the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial, and the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study is currently ongoing. We expect to complete the Phase 1 trial and report the full results in the second half of this year.” “As we close out National Kidney Awareness Month, we remain inspired to continue our research and development efforts to provide improved therapies for individuals living with kidney disease,” concluded Dr. Gupta. Key Highlights Completed enrollment in the open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multidose pivotal clinical trial with OLC, a next-generation lanthanum-based phosphate binding agent utilizing proprietary nanoparticle technology being developed to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis.Completed a private placement with new and existing healthcare institutional investors that generated $50 million in gross proceeds to Unicycive.Granted orphan drug designation (ODD) by the FDA to UNI-494 for the prevention of DGF in kidney transplant patients. ODD may provide certain tax credits for qualified clinical trials, exemption of user fees, and the potential for seven years of market exclusivity after approval. UNI-494 is a cytoprotective agent that elicits an ischemic preconditioning effect by activating KATP channels in mitochondria to restore mitochondrial function.Presented new data demonstrating statistically significant results for UNI-494 in a preclinical model of DGF at the 29th International Conference on Advances in Critical Care Nephrology AKI and CRRT 2024. The data provides additional evidence that UNI-494 may be a valuable asset for prevention of DGF and other conditions related to acute kidney injury.Successfully completed the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the Company’s ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in UNI-494. UNI-494 was well-tolerated up to 160 mg administered as a single dose and was chosen as the go-forward dose based on promising safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data. In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study, 80 mg is now being administered twice-a-day to trial participants.Announced that two posters related to OLC will be presented at the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meeting taking place May 14-18, 2024, in Long Beach, California.Announced that multiple presentations will be delivered on OLC and UNI-494 at the 61st European Renal Association (ERA) Congress taking place May 23-26, 2024, in Stockholm, Sweden. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Licensing Revenues: Licensing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $0.7 million compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2022, due to an upfront payment for a licensing agreement entered into with Lotus International PTE Ltd in February 2023. We received an upfront payment of approximately $1.0 million associated with a licensing agreement entered into with Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Limited in July 2022. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the full year were $12.9 million, compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in labor costs. Non-cash stock compensation increased $0.5 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in drug development costs of $0.7 million. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $8.5 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.4 million in professional services costs. Labor costs increased $0.5 million, and other administrative costs increased $0.3 million. Non-cash stock compensation costs increased $0.3 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense of $0.5 million. Other Income (Expenses): Other income (expenses) increased $9.8 million due primarily to a $10.3 million change in fair value of our warrant liability. The Company earned interest income of $0.6 million on its cash balance during the year that was partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in interest expense. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $31.4 million, or $1.28 per share of common stock, compared to a net loss of $18.1 million, or $1.20 per share of common stock, for the same period in 2022. This increase was attributable primarily to the $10.3 million change in fair value of our warrant liability. Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.7 million. Subsequent to year end, in March 2024, Unicycive completed a private placement of preferred stock which generated $50 million in gross proceeds. The Company believes that with the inclusion of the net proceeds from this offering, it will have sufficient resources to fund planned operations into 2026.

Empire Petroleum Announces Modification of Terms of Previously Announced Rights Offering,2024-03-28T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Empire Petroleum  (EP) announces modified terms for its subscription rights offering, allowing holders of common stock to purchase shares at $5.00 per share, with gross proceeds of up to $20.66 million.

The Rights Offering has been extended to April 10, 2024, with over-subscription rights available. Chairman and largest shareholders intend to participate fully. Holders of subscription rights must review provided materials and deliver full payment to the subscription agent. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The modification of the subscription rights offering by Empire Petroleum Corporation represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at raising capital. The decision to allow shareholders to purchase additional shares at a set price can be seen as a confidence booster, signaling that the company's management believes in the long-term value of their stock. Moreover, the participation of major shareholders like Phil E. Mulacek and Energy Evolution Fund, Ltd. suggests a strong internal endorsement of the company's direction.From a financial perspective, the gross proceeds of approximately $20.66 million could provide Empire with the necessary liquidity to fund ongoing operations or to invest in strategic initiatives. It's important to note that the rights are non-transferable and will not be listed for trading, which could limit the liquidity options for shareholders but also minimizes the dilution of share value. The ability to over-subscribe may be attractive to investors seeking a larger stake in the company.Considering the oil and gas sector's volatility, especially with fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes, this capital infusion could be pivotal in maintaining Empire's competitive edge. However, investors must weigh the potential for share dilution against the benefits of the capital raise. Market Research Analyst Empire Petroleum's Rights Offering must be assessed within the broader context of the energy market. The oil and gas industry is capital-intensive, with companies often requiring substantial funds to manage exploration, production and operational expenses. The offering's timing suggests Empire is seeking to strengthen its financial position amidst a landscape where many energy companies are reassessing their capital structures to navigate environmental challenges and investment shifts towards renewable energies.Investor response to the Rights Offering will be indicative of the market's confidence in Empire's asset portfolio and growth strategy. The fixed subscription price of $5.00 per share provides a tangible benchmark for investors to evaluate the company's valuation against current market conditions. Additionally, the extension of the expiration date may reflect an effort to maximize participation, possibly due to initial tepid interest or to accommodate logistical challenges faced by interested shareholders.As the Rights Offering is not open to the general public and is non-transferable, its direct impact on the stock market may be limited. However, the outcome of this offering could influence Empire's stock performance in the long term, depending on how the raised capital is deployed and how effectively the company communicates the use of proceeds to its shareholders and the wider market. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the Rights Offering is important for ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting shareholder interests. The distribution of the prospectus and subsequent supplements ensures transparency, a key component of SEC regulations. The structured approach to the Rights Offering, with detailed documentation and a defined expiration date, demonstrates Empire's adherence to securities law.It is important for shareholders to understand the legal implications of their participation in the Rights Offering. The non-transferability of the subscription rights means that shareholders cannot sell these rights on the open market, which could affect their decision-making process. Furthermore, the indication by the company's largest shareholders of their intent to fully exercise their rights and over-subscription privileges could signal to the market that the offering is less about attracting new investment and more about consolidating existing ownership.It is also worth noting that the news release disclaims the communication as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. This is a standard legal precaution to avoid unintentional violations of securities law, especially in jurisdictions where the offering has not been registered or qualified under state securities laws. 03/28/2024 - 04:15 PM TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire Petroleum Corporation (NYSE American: EP) (""Empire"" or the ""Company""), an oil and gas company with current producing assets in New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Louisiana, announced today that it has modified the terms of its previously announced subscription rights offering (“Rights Offering”).

Negative Increase in GAAP costs and expenses due to non-cash stock-based compensation Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $44.4 million in Dec 2023 Full-year GAAP net loss was ($42.2) million Non-GAAP net loss for 2023 was ($33.8) million Financial Analyst The financial results released by Pulse Biosciences, Inc. indicate a significant increase in GAAP costs and expenses year-over-year for the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense. This uptick in expenses underscores the need to examine the company's compensation strategy and its alignment with shareholder interests. While the non-GAAP figures are less alarming, they still reflect an increase in costs, suggesting that the company's investment in research and development is intensifying. A closer look at the liquidity position reveals a decrease in cash and cash equivalents over the year, which could raise concerns about the company's runway and its ability to sustain operations without additional financing. The rights offering and shelf registration, aimed at raising up to $50 million, are critical moves to bolster the company's financial stability. Investors should monitor the execution of these financial strategies and their potential dilutive effects on existing shareholdings. Medical Research Analyst The FDA clearance of Pulse Biosciences' CellFX nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode for non-cardiac soft tissue ablation is a notable milestone, potentially expanding the company's addressable market. The positive clinical data from the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and the exceptional results from the 60-day post-procedure evaluations in the cardiac catheter feasibility study signal a promising future for the technology. However, the real-world efficacy and adoption rate of these innovations remain to be seen. Stakeholders should consider the regulatory pathway and market acceptance when evaluating the company's long-term growth prospects. As the CellFX nsPFA Cardiac Clamp awaits FDA clearance, the outcome will be pivotal in determining the company's trajectory in the cardiac ablation market. Market Research Analyst Pulse Biosciences' strategic focus on developing its portfolio of CellFX nsPFA devices is reflective of the growing demand for minimally invasive medical procedures. The recent FDA clearances and positive clinical trial outcomes are likely to enhance the company's competitive edge in the medical device sector. However, the market's reception of the rights offering and the potential impact on the stock price due to the introduction of new securities are factors that investors must weigh. The company's ability to effectively manage its operational costs while scaling its product offerings will be important in maintaining investor confidence and market share amidst a landscape of rapid technological advancements and regulatory changes. 03/28/2024 - 04:12 PM HAYWARD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pulse Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLSE), a company leveraging its novel and proprietary CellFX® Nanosecond Pulsed Field Ablation™ (nsPFA™) technology, today announced business updates and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Business Highlights CellFX nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode (End-effector of the proprietary designed and engineered CellFX nsPFA energy delivery system) Received U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance for use in non-cardiac soft tissue ablation. Completed enrollment in the 30-patient first-in-human clinical trial on the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and principal investigator Dr. Stefano Spiezia presented the groundbreaking positive clinical data at the North American Society for Interventional Thyroidology 2024. CellFX nsPFA 360° Cardiac Catheter (End-effector of the proprietary designed and engineered CellFX nsPFA energy delivery system) Completed 60-Day post-procedure evaluations of the initial patients treated in the catheter first-in-human feasibility study; the remaps demonstrated exceptional lesion quality, exceeding clinicians’ expectations. Dr. Vivek Reddy showcased the first-in-human cases in a podium presentation at the 29th Annual AF Symposium which was well received by colleagues in the audience. CellFX nsPFA Cardiac Clamp (End-effector of the proprietary designed and engineered CellFX nsPFA energy delivery system) Filed FDA 510(k) submission in December 2023, and is continuing discussions with FDA. Announcement of Rights Offering & Universal Shelf Filing The Company’s Board of Directors has approved plans to initiate a rights offering, pending U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of a registration statement that is expected to be filed next week, as detailed in the Company’s press release issued earlier today titled, Pulse Biosciences Announces Plans to Initiate a Rights Offering Consistent with the Company’s prior rights offerings, the units of stock and warrants will only be offered to existing stockholders as of a predetermined and to be announced record date, to be announced once the registration statement becomes effective. Additional details on the rights offering can be found in the Company’s press release issued earlier today. To fund its future operations, the Company has filed a preliminary registration statement with the SEC to establish a universal shelf pursuant to which, once it is effective, the Company may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $50 million worth of its common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, debt securities, or units over the three year life of the universal shelf. “In 2023 the Pulse Biosciences team executed on the development of our portfolio of CellFX nsPFA devices. This progress has led to significant milestones like the FDA clearance of the CellFX nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode System, exceptional clinical results in the 60 day remaps of our first patients treated in the CellFX nsPFA 360° Cardiac Catheter first-in-human feasibility study, and the 510(k) submission of our CellFX nsPFA Cardiac Clamp,” said Kevin Danahy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pulse Biosciences. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total GAAP costs and expenses, representing cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $12.5 million compared to $8.7 million for the prior year period. The increase in GAAP costs and expenses was primarily driven by an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense which was $3.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.7 million for the prior year period. The remaining increase in costs and expenses compared to the prior year was driven by an increase in research and development expenses to support the development of the CellFX nsPFA product portfolio. Non-GAAP costs and expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $8.9 million compared to $7.7 million for the prior year period. GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was ($11.9) million compared to ($9.2) million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Non-GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was ($8.3) million compared to ($8.1) million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total GAAP costs and expenses, representing cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, for the full year of 2023 were $43.6 million, compared to $58.8 million in 2022. Non-GAAP costs and expenses for the full year of 2023 were $35.1 million compared to $51.3 million in the prior year. The decrease in costs and expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by optimizing headcount and streamlining and focusing resources on advancing the development of the CellFX nsPFA product portfolio. GAAP net loss for the full year of 2023 was ($42.2) million compared to ($58.5) million for 2022. Non-GAAP net loss for 2023 was ($33.8) million compared to ($51.1) million in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $44.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $61.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and $50.4 million as of September 30, 2023. Cash used in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.9 million compared to $8.0 million in the same period in the prior year and $8.7 million used in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding net proceeds from financing, cash used in the full year of 2023 totaled $32.8 compared to $47.3 million used in 2022. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP cost and expenses and net loss have been provided in the tables following the financial statements in this press release.

About Pulse Biosciences® Pulse Biosciences is a novel bioelectric medicine company committed to health innovation that has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients. The Company’s proprietary CellFX® nsPFA™ technology delivers nanosecond pulses of electrical energy to non-thermally clear cells while sparing adjacent noncellular tissue. The Company is actively pursuing the development of its CellFX nsPFA technology for use in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and in a select few other markets where it could have a profound positive impact on healthcare for both patients and providers. Pulse Biosciences, CellFX, Nano-Pulse Stimulation, NPS, nsPFA, CellFX nsPFA and the stylized logos are among the trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Pulse Biosciences, Inc. in the United States and other countries. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, in order to supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, management has disclosed certain non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations. The Company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company is disclosing certain non-GAAP results in order to supplement investors’ and other readers’ understanding and assessment of the Company’s financial performance. Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, on a regular basis and for financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP adjustments include stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if the Company believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to management and investors. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which could reduce the usefulness of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release exclude the following: Non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation. The Company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating the Company’s non-GAAP cost and expenses and net loss measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. The Company records stock-based compensation expense related to grants of time-based and performance-based options, such as options that vest as a result of the Company’s market capitalization. Depending upon the size, timing and terms of the grants, as well as the probability of achievement of performance-based awards, this expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. The Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons from period to period. Depreciation and amortization. The Company has excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating its non-GAAP cost and expenses and net loss measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations. Restructuring charges. The Company has excluded restructuring charges in calculating its non-GAAP cost and expenses and net loss measures. Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies and include employee termination, contract termination, and other exit costs associated with the restructuring program. The Company believes that excluding discrete restructuring charges allows for better comparisons from period to period.

The company's OnePlatform in the Platform Business is expanding rapidly, offering a wide range of insurance and investment products. AGBA aims to become Asia's leading medical care institution by 2025 through innovative solutions and data analytics. The successful private placement at a premium to the market price indicates confidence in the company's future growth and financial stability amidst macroeconomic challenges. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported doubling of commissions in AGBA's Distribution Business is a robust indicator of growth, particularly in the context of a recovering Hong Kong economy. This performance suggests a successful expansion of the company's salesforce and an effective strategy in capturing market share. The financial sector in Hong Hong has been competitive and such a significant increase in commissions could imply that AGBA has managed to outperform competitors and attract a larger customer base.Investors should also note the successful private placement at a premium, which signals strong investor confidence in AGBA's business model and future prospects. The infusion of capital is likely to bolster the company's financial position, providing the means to pursue growth initiatives more aggressively. However, the long-term value of these initiatives will depend on the company's ability to execute its strategy and maintain its growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst AGBA's expansion of its OnePlatform to include a wider array of insurance and investment products is indicative of its commitment to diversify offerings and meet evolving customer needs. The platform's growth reflects a strategic response to the increasing demand for financial products in the region. This approach not only enhances customer engagement but also positions AGBA to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities, which can lead to higher customer retention and increased revenue streams.Furthermore, the planned transformation of the JFA brand into a leading medical institution in Asia by 2025 underscores AGBA's ambition to integrate healthcare services with its financial offerings. The synergy between healthcare and financial services is a growing trend and AGBA's initiative could set a new industry benchmark if executed effectively. The use of data analytics to support this initiative could lead to more personalized services and improved customer experiences, potentially creating a competitive edge for AGBA. Economist The economic rebound in Hong Kong, as indicated by increased spending during the Chinese New Year, presents a favorable backdrop for AGBA's growth. The company's optimistic outlook and strategic positioning in the Greater Bay Area and upcoming presence in Singapore suggest a clear regional expansion strategy. This geographical diversification is a prudent move, potentially mitigating risks associated with economic fluctuations in any single market.However, investors should remain cognizant of the broader macroeconomic conditions that could impact AGBA's performance. While the company has shown resilience, external factors such as interest rate changes, regulatory shifts and geopolitical tensions could pose challenges. AGBA's ability to adapt to these conditions, as it has in the past, will be critical to sustaining its growth momentum. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM HONG KONG, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NASDAQ-listed, AGBA Group Holding Limited (“AGBA” or “the Company”) the leading one-stop financial supermarket in Hong Kong released its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023.

The company is a pioneer in rare earth elements and critical battery elements production, with patented technology and innovative partnerships. Strong financials support growth plans and collaborations. Key highlights include partnerships with major auto manufacturers and wind energy producers, as well as advancements in critical mineral refining technology. The company aims to spin off ReElement Technologies and American Carbon as standalone businesses in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of a $150 million tax-exempt bond offering for a lithium refining facility is a significant financial move for American Resources Corporation (AREC). It demonstrates the company's ability to secure funding for capital-intensive projects, which is critical for its growth strategy in the rare earth and critical elements sector. The bond offering, being tax-exempt, suggests a cost-effective approach to financing, likely reducing the interest burden and enhancing the project's overall financial viability.From an investor's perspective, the successful bond offering may indicate confidence in the company's future prospects, particularly in the burgeoning electric vehicle and renewable energy markets, where demand for lithium and rare earth elements is expected to grow. However, it is important to consider the long-term debt obligations that come with such financing and how they may affect the company's financial flexibility and profitability in the future. This bond offering could be a double-edged sword if the lithium market faces unforeseen headwinds or if the company's technology does not maintain its competitive edge. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on American Resources Corporation's patented chromatographic separation and purification process positions the company at the forefront of critical mineral refining technology. This is particularly pertinent as the global supply chain is increasingly seeking to reduce reliance on Chinese-dominated rare earth element production. A domestic supplier with a purportedly more efficient and environmentally safe process could capture significant market share and contribute to supply chain resilience.However, the market for rare earth elements and high-purity battery materials is highly competitive and sensitive to technological advancements. The company's ability to establish first-of-their-kind partnerships and its strong balance sheet are promising, but the real test will be its execution capability and the market's reception of its refined products. The long-term success of AREC hinges on its ability to maintain technological leadership and secure stable off-take agreements, ensuring consistent revenue streams. Environmental Policy Analyst The focus on environmentally safe commercial-scale production of critical minerals is a vital aspect of AREC's operations, aligning with increasing regulatory and consumer demands for sustainable practices. The company's partnerships aimed at recycling rare-earth elements from decommissioned wind turbines and EV motors underscore a commitment to a circular economy. This is not only beneficial from an environmental standpoint but also serves as a hedge against resource scarcity and geopolitical risks associated with raw material sourcing.However, the environmental impact of mining and refining operations is complex and the promise of a low-cost, environmentally safe process will be scrutinized by stakeholders and regulators. It will be important for AREC to transparently demonstrate its environmental performance and compliance with regulations to maintain its social license to operate and appeal to environmentally conscious investors. 03/28/2024 - 04:08 PM Company successfully executed and closed $150 million tax exempt bond offering for the Company's Kentucky Lithium refining facilityThe first domestic, commercial producer of separated and high-purity REEs from recycled permanent magnets and high-purity battery elements from both ores and recycled feedstocksCompany's patented chromatographic separation and purification process defining itself as the world-leading critical mineral refining technologyEstablishing first-of-their-kind partnerships pioneering full circular solutions for both rare earth elements and critical battery elementsStrong balance sheet provides financial strength and flexibility to execute on its innovation, collaboration and growth plansCompany to host update conference call today at 4:30 PM ETFISHERS, IN / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / American Resources Corporation (NASDAQ:AREC ) (""American Resources"" or the ""Company""), a next generation and socially responsible supplier of rare earth and critical elements, carbon and advanced carbon materials to the new infrastructure and electrification marketplace, today announced financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023. The Company will host a conference call and webcast, today, March 28, 2024, at 4:30 PM ET (details below).Mark Jensen, Chairman and CEO of American Resources Corporation commented, ""Over the past year, we continued to see tremendous success in establishing our strategic positioning within the value chain of our addressable markets. Our strategic focus has been to position and prepare our business for growth as separate, standalone companies, and we have been putting the pieces in place to execute on that plan as we have previously discussed, and which is consistent with our Strategic Committee's plan of action to better unlock the value of American Resources. These steps include securing the appropriate growth capital to scale operations while also building word-class teams around each business. Our growth capital for American Carbon is largely supported by the closing of the previously announced tax-exempt bond offering for Wyoming County Coal (WCC), and we believe that complex will be a first class facility producing premium mid vol carbon for the global steel markets. Development of the WCC complex continues to progress and we are confident we will be producing from its first deep mine later this year as we continue to assess longer term options for our carbon platform, such as sales, leases, production and joint venture partnerships. Nonetheless, advancing WCC's development put the entire carbon platform is a much stronger position as one of the last U.S.-based metallurgical carbon growth platforms. Additionally, we very recently closed on a successful $150 million tax-exempt bond offering to fund the development of our Kentucky Lithium refining facility. It is becoming more evident that ReElement Technologies continues to separate itself as the most efficient critical mineral refining platform in the world. The critical and rare earth elements we refine today are imperative to operate our modern-day technology including electric vehicles, clean energy and defense applications. Our ability to produce a variety of ultra-pure, critical mineral products in a low-cost and environmentally safe commercial scale has put us in a unique position across several supply chains. As we continue to aggressively advance our platform technology and collaborate with partners, it is becoming more evident that we are the most efficient solution for the deployment of sustainable critical mineral refining outside of China. We continue to quietly position American Metals as an aggregator and processor of recycled feedstocks to feed into ReElement. American Metals is in a unique position to leverage ReElements advanced refining capabilities to handle the preprocessing step of end-of-life or off-spec batteries and magnets which also will enhance ReElements long-term margin profile. Lastly, as we continue to execute on our strategic plan, American Resource will continue to evolve by leveraging the unique capabilities and positioning of our current operating companies to diversify into other critical mineral and infrastructure resources to support energy transition and national security interests, similar to American Carbon's recent acquisition of a 51% interest in an iron ore and titanium resource deposit.""Key Division HighlightsThe Company continues to aggressively drive innovative, efficient and solution-based steps to strengthen its position within its respective end-markets while strategically evolving to enhance shareholder value. Recent divisional milestones include:ReElement TechnologiesSuccessfully executed and closed a Bond Purchase Agreement with Hilltop Securities Inc. for $150,000,000 principal amount of Kentucky Industrial Building Revenue Bonds, Series 2024, for the Company's Kentucky Lithium LLC (""KYL"") complex which will be used for the development and operation commissioning of the United States' first-of-its-kind critical mineral refining facility.Established commercial partnership with a major U.S. auto manufacturer showcasing its low cost and environmentally friendly process to fully recycle and refine the high value rare-earth elements within EV motors back to ultra-pure magnet-grade rare-earth oxides, pioneering a sustainable and truly circular life-cycle solution to ensure that the rare earth elements remain within the domestic supply chain to build in America and stay in America.Established commercial partnership with EDP Renewables North America (""EDPR NA""), the world's fourth-largest wind energy producer and a top five owner and operator of renewables in North America, to advance sustainable practices in the wind energy sector with an initial focus on the efficient and sustainable recycling of neodymium-based permanent magnets from decommissioned wind turbines into magnet-grade rare earth elements, contributing to the development of a truly circular supply chain for renewable energy equipment and inputs.Executed MOU's with two German-based battery recycling platforms ( Duesenfeld GmbH , and Battery Damage Service GmbH ) to source recycled black mass battery material to be refined back to battery-grade lithium products such as lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) and/or lithium hydroxide (LiOH) at its Marion, Indiana and Noblesville, Indiana refining facilities.Took a controlling interest in the former RCA Thomson manufacturing plant in Marion, Indiana, comprising approximately 425,000 square feet of manufacturing and refining capacity space on a 42-acre campus for ReElement Technologies' critical mineral refining facility, and subsequently closed on $44.9 million of local incentives from the City of Marion, Indiana to support the buildout of a state-of-the-art, commercial-scale lithium, critical minerals, and rare earth elements refining facility with a primary focus on recycled feedstocks.Continued to buildout its best-in-class team to drive operational expertise and strategic vision with the appointments of:Ben Wrightsman, a well-established leader in the battery sector, as President;Shane Tragethon, an operations and strategy expert with a large portion of his career supporting the United States Department of State's foreign assistance objectives and cooperation in Africa, as Vice President of International Strategy;Ben Kincaid, a former U.S. Diplomat serving and leading teams in multiple countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia as CEO of ReElement Africa Ltd.;Former U.S. Ambassador, Mark Gilbert and former Vice Chairman of UBS Private Wealth Management as an Independent Director;Kevin Higgins, a national security expert and former intelligence community senior executive who retired from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after 30 years of distinguished service as an Independent Director; andHis Excellency Baba Kamara, former Ghanaian National Security Advisor and former Ghanaian Ambassador to Nigeria and current high-level official for Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) who will act in his individual capacity as an independent director of ReElement Africa Ltd.Achieved ultra-pure (99.96%) lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) from its exclusively licensed and patented multi-modal chromatography technology from hard-rock, spodumene bearing pegmatite ore. This achievement comes after significant milestones of achieving 99.9978% pure Li 2 CO 3 from LFP battery manufacturing scrap at commercial scale; the first-known to achieve this worldwide, and 99.986% pure Li 2 CO 3 produced from recycled, end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, as well as achieving groundbreaking success as the first in the United States to produce greater than 99.5% pure magnet rare earth elements [dysprosium (Dy), neodymium (Nd) and praseodymium (Pr)] at commercial scale.American CarbonSuccessfully closed its $45 million Tax-Exempt Industrial Development Bond offering through the West Virginia Economic Development Authority which will fund the expansion and technological improvements to the existing metallurgical carbon processing facility at its Wyoming County Coal (WCC) complex. This non-dilutive capital positions WCC as its next driver of growth which will support the development of two underground deep mines to produce premium, mid-vol metallurgical carbon, upgrade to the existing processing facility and development of its patented electrolysis technology to process associated waste streams into critical mineral concentrates.Acquired a 51% ownership interest in a Jamaica-based, diversified mineral asset with a focus on iron ore, titanium and vanadium to further establishes American Carbon's foothold in the steelmaking supply chain.CorporateRecently distribute a majority of the shares it held in Novusterra Inc., via a special dividend, to the underlying shareholders of American Resources in conjunction with the Company's Special Committee's directive to better unlock value.Closed the merger between its sponsored, special purpose acquisition vehicle, American Acquisition Opportunity Inc., and Royalty Management Corporation (Nasdaq: RMCO) a next-generation royalty company targeting high value assets, cash flow and royalty streams by identifying undervalued assets while constructively supporting communities. The transaction positions RMCO to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities within the electrification and energy transition industry, natural resources, intellectual properties and ag-tech investments.Converted its wholly owned subsidiary, ReElement Technologies, from a LLC (limited liability company) to a corporation in preparation of its spinoff into a standalone public company under the name ReElement Technologies Corporation with a reserved ticker of RLMT.""Looking forward to the remainder of 2024, our belief in and the excitement over the opportunities we have in front of us continues to reach an all-time high. Our goal is to successfully spin-off both ReElement Technologies and American Carbon this year with the appropriate value, capital structures and teams to execute as standalone businesses, and we feel confident we will accomplish that goal,"" continued Mr. Jensen.""The opportunity for ReElement Technologies continues to manifest at a very rapid pace both domestically and internationally and continue to be bolstered by our tremendous team and growing partnerships. The unique attributes of our technology puts us in a lead position to successfully deploy meaningful critical mineral refining capacity outside of China. It has always been our approach that utilizing the similar, solvent-based separation and purification technologies, as used in China, will be a challenge for most of the developed world and we are starting to see those challenges manifest from an operational, cost and environmental perspective. As such, we believe we stand alone in our ability to produce ultra-pure products at large scale, and in an environmentally-safe and cost competitive process. This has enabled us to advanced our focus on customer qualifications across multiple supply chains, procuring appropriate feedstocks to feed our large-scale projects, securing offtake agreements with both planned magnet, cathode / battery manufacturers and designing and engineering our planned large-scale, commercial facilities. Our rapid execution of this tremendous growth opportunity is evidenced by the technical expertise at our Noblesville, Indiana Commercial Qualification Plant, the acquisition of our Marion, Indiana super-site, the procurement of approximately $45 million in tax incentives from the municipality of Marion, and the successful execution of a bond purchase agreement for $150 million of Kentucky Industrial Building Revenue Bonds for our first-of-its-kind Kentucky Lithium refinery, to name a few. Additionally, our international growth plans are substantial, especially with unlocking the value of certain African regions, to support a massive shift in global trade and manufacturing. ReElement sits in a very opportunistic position at the intersection of energy transition and national security and we remain steadfast on executing smartly yet swiftly to build substantial value for our Company, shareholders and stakeholders a like.""Expected Near-Term CatalystsAdditional ReElement Technologies upstream and downstream partnerships to bolster feedstocks of end-of-life products, manufacturing scrap and ores for critical and REEs and offtake customers of sustainable and domestic sources of high-purity battery and magnet materials.Broader international expansion of ReElement Technologies' world-leading critical mineral platform for both critical mineral-based ores and recycling partnerships.Continue to scale critical mineral refining capacity at its next two large-scale facilities in Marion, Indiana and Knott County, Kentucky and through co-located facilities with supply chain partners.Continue to add best-in-class talent to drive the execution of each division.Monetization of American Carbon through its spin-off, increase in carbon production to meet market demand, leases, joint ventures and/or divestitures.Conference Call InformationAmerican Resources management will host a conference call for investors, analysts and other interested parties today, Thursday, March 28, 2024 at 4:30 PM ET.Interested participants and investors may access the conference call by dialing 877-407-4019 and referencing American Resources Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2023 Conference Call, or by the webcast link: here .Financial Results for the Year-Ending December 31, 2023For the full year of 2023, American Resources reported a net income loss of $11.2 million or a loss of $0.15 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, as compared with a net income loss $1.45 million or loss of $0.02 per share for the full year of 2022.

Development costs during 2023 were $11.7 million compared to $28.1 million during 2022 and better positions the Company within the markets in which it serves and to meet growing demand.The Company did not incur any income tax expense in 2023 as it was able to utilize its available net operating losses (""NOL"") carried forward from prior periods of approximately $25.7 million as of December 31, 2023.AMERICAN RESOURCES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Revenue Coal sales $16,120,841 $39,103,995 Metal recovery and sales 66,552 48,199 Royalty income 556,682 322,075 Total revenue 16,744,075 39,474,269 Operating expenses (income) Cost of coal sales and processing 11,611,886 21,687,656 Accretion 993,165 1,344,047 Depreciation 46,953 2,157,763 Amortization of mining rights 1,240,914 1,238,449 General and administrative 7,013,833 4,020,464 Professional fees 1,340,745 1,103,322 Production taxes and royalties 2,647,655 3,785,049 Gain on sale of equipment (8,475,468) (4,510,043)Development 11,746,725 28,134,883 Total operating expenses 28,166,408 58,961,590 Net loss from operations (11,422,333) (19,487,321) Other income (expense) Other income and (expense) 677,045 317,045 Unrealized gain on short-term investments 499,639 - Gain on cancelation of debt - 3,119,775 Gain on sales of patents - 16,000,000 Interest income 381,324 30,982 Interest expense (1,336,997) (1,426,153)Total other income (expenses) 221,011 18,041,649 Net loss $(11,201,322) $(1,445,672) Net loss per share - basic $(0.15) $(0.02) Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 75,422,390 66,777,620 AMERICAN RESOURCES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Assets Current assets: Cash $2,494,048 $10,873,432 Accounts receivable 253,764 660,755 Short-term investments 28,039,497 - Inventories 54,000 446,690 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,867,651 786,576 Total Current Assets 32,708,960 12,767,453 Cash - restricted 6,798,029 2,122,263 Property and Equipment, net 15,337,004 9,113,722 Right-of-use assets, net 18,276,913 13,033,889 Investment in LLC- Related Party 18,780,000 18,780,000 Notes receivables 99,022 99,022 Total Assets $91,999,928 $55,916,349 Liabilities And Equity Current liabilities: Trade payables $6,709,224 $4,916,243 Non-trade payables 2,607,942 2,524,243 Accounts payable - related party 2,371,697 4,295,232 Accrued interest 512,558 106,886 Other Liabilities 200,000 - Current portion of long term debt 804,656 1,917,506 Current portion of convertible debt - 9,787,423 Operating lease liabilities 57,663 82,669 Finance lease liabilities 4,806,822 3,803,175 Total current liabilities 18,070,562 27,433,377 Remediation liability 21,288,799 20,295,634 Bond payable, net 44,152,500 - Operating lease liabilities, non-current 495,611 547,667 Finance lease liabilities, non-current 7,514,848 7,354,975 Total liabilities 91,522,320 55,631,653 Commitments and contingencies (Note 8) Stockholders' deficit: Common stock, $0.0001 par value;

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flow from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity, or performance under GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, similar measures are used by analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by others.About American Resources CorporationAmerican Resources Corporation is a next-generation, environmentally and socially responsible supplier of high-quality raw materials to the new infrastructure market.

The company may receive up to four regulatory decisions on NDAs and BLAs in the next 18 months. The FDA accepted the New Drug Application filing for DFD-29 to treat inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in adults, with a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acceptance of Fortress Biotech's New Drug Application for DFD-29 by the FDA is a significant milestone that could potentially open up a new revenue stream for the company. The rosacea treatment market is a niche but growing segment and the approval of an oral, systemic therapy like DFD-29 could disrupt the current treatment paradigm which largely relies on topical agents and antibiotics. The market opportunity for DFD-29 hinges on its clinical differentiation, specifically its ability to treat both inflammatory lesions and erythema, which are key symptoms of rosacea that affect patient quality of life. If DFD-29 is approved, Fortress's partnership with Journey Medical could leverage existing dermatology sales channels to accelerate market penetration.However, the issuance of a Complete Response Letter for cosibelimab's BLA indicates regulatory hurdles that could delay market entry. It is important for investors to monitor Fortress's ability to effectively address the FDA's concerns, as delays in approval can significantly affect projected revenues and market positioning, especially in competitive oncology markets like cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma treatments. Financial Analyst Fortress Biotech's record net revenue of $84.5 million for the full year of 2023 suggests a strong financial performance, primarily driven by its dermatology and rare disease businesses. This performance is a positive indicator of the company's revenue-generating capabilities and its strategic focus on these areas. The anticipation of up to four regulatory decisions within the next 18 months could serve as catalysts for the company's stock, contingent upon favorable outcomes. Such events often lead to increased investor interest and stock volatility.On the flip side, the FDA's Complete Response Letter for cosibelimab is a setback that may require additional capital and time to resolve, potentially impacting the company's financial projections and investor confidence. It is essential for investors to consider the balance between Fortress's current revenue streams and its pipeline's potential to sustain long-term growth. Legal Expert The regulatory pathway for drug approval is fraught with complexities and Fortress Biotech's experiences exemplify this. The FDA's acceptance of the NDA for DFD-29 is a positive step, but it is merely one phase in a multi-step process. The set PDUFA goal date gives a timeline for when a decision is expected, but it is not a guarantee of approval. Investors should be aware of the legal and regulatory risks associated with the drug approval process, including potential delays and the need for additional data or studies.The CRL received for cosibelimab underscores the importance of third-party manufacturers in meeting regulatory standards. Any shortcomings in the manufacturing process, even by external partners, can have significant legal and financial repercussions for the sponsor company. As such, Fortress's ability to navigate these regulatory challenges will be critical in determining its future business prospects. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Record consolidated net revenue of $84.5 million for full-year 2023 Fortress may receive up to four regulatory decisions on NDAs and BLAs in the next 18 months FDA accepted New Drug Application filing for DFD-29 to treat inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in adults; PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024 MIAMI, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”), an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and advancing assets to enhance long-term value for shareholders through product revenue, equity holdings and dividend and royalty revenue, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the full-year ended December 31, 2023. Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “In 2023, we built a significant amount of momentum to position our Company to achieve multiple milestones in 2024. We also generated record consolidated net revenues of $84.5 million in 2023, the majority of which came from the sales and milestone payments from our dermatology and rare disease businesses.” Dr. Rosenwald continued, “We are pleased that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted the New Drug Application (“NDA”) filing for DFD-29 earlier this month and look forward to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of November 4, 2024. Across our portfolio, we could receive up to four NDA and Biologics License Application (“BLA”) regulatory approvals over the next 18 months, while we continue to advance our 25 development stage programs in 2024.” 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights1: Regulatory Milestones and Updates In January 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA seeking approval for DFD-29 (Minocycline Hydrochloride Modified Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in adults. In March 2024, the FDA accepted the NDA and has set a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024. If approved, DFD-29 has the potential to become the only oral, systemic therapy to address both inflammatory lesions and erythema (redness) from rosacea, as demonstrated in clinical trials. DFD-29 is currently in development at our partner company, Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical”).We submitted a BLA to the FDA for cosibelimab, our investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, as a treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, in January 2023. In December 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for the cosibelimab BLA. The CRL only cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization as approvability issues to address in a resubmission. The CRL did not state any concerns about the clinical data package, safety or labeling for the approvability of cosibelimab. We believe we can address the feedback in a resubmission to enable marketing approval in 2024. We also secured additional U.S. patent protection for cosibelimab through at least May 2038. Cosibelimab is currently in development at our partner company, Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CKPT) (“Checkpoint”).Based on its public statements, AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”) has estimated that it expects the FDA to accept its BLA submission of CAEL-101 (anselamimab) to treat AL amyloidosis for review in 2025. In 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (founded by Fortress) for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of which approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders, including approximately $148 million to Fortress, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones.In December 2023, we completed the asset transfer of CUTX-101 (copper histidinate for Menkes disease) to Sentynl, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. The CUTX-101 rolling NDA submission is ongoing and is expected to be completed by Sentynl in 2024. Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”), our subsidiary company that developed CUTX-101, will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101.In October 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug application to initiate a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-109, a novel combination of MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy) and MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus), for the treatment of IL13Rα2+ recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytoma. MB-109 is currently in development at our partner company, Mustang Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: MBIO) (“Mustang Bio”).

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary CEA Industries Inc. reports financial results for Q4 and FY 2023. Revenue declined in Q4, with net loss improving. The company focuses on cost reduction and strategic alternatives. Positive Revenue decreased in Q4 2023 to $0.3 million from $1.5 million in Q4 2022. Net loss improved to $1.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to $1.3 million in Q4 2022. The company is focused on expense reduction and capital preservation. CEA Industries is exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger. Cash and cash equivalents were $12.5 million at the end of 2023, with no debt. The company enacted headcount reductions to achieve annualized cost savings of ~$230,000. Negative Revenue decline in Q4 2023 due to lower bookings and reduced sales efforts. Gross margin decreased to (113.8%) in Q4 2023 from 10.3% in Q4 2022. Operating expenses decreased mainly due to reduced personnel and marketing costs. Working capital decreased by $2.6 million from December 2022 to December 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of CEA Industries reflect a significant downturn in revenue year-over-year, with a marked decrease from $1.5 million in Q4 2022 to just $0.3 million in Q4 2023. This steep decline is indicative of underlying challenges in the company's operations and market conditions. The gross margin has turned negative, which is highly unusual and suggests that the fixed costs are not being covered by the revenue generated. This is a red flag for investors, as it points to a lack of scalability in the business model.The company's efforts to reduce operating expenses by 51% and the subsequent improvement in net loss from $(1.3) million to $(0.9) million show management's commitment to cost control. However, the effectiveness of these measures is yet to be seen, especially since the revenue continues to decline. The cash position has also decreased significantly, which could impact the company's ability to invest in growth or weather further market downturns.Investors should be cautious about the company's future prospects, particularly given the shrinking backlog from $5.6 million to $0.4 million, which could signal a drying up of future revenue streams. The exploration of strategic alternatives by the Board may offer some hope for a turnaround or an exit, but this also introduces uncertainty regarding the company's future direction. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in net bookings and backlog suggests a contraction in the market demand, particularly in the cannabis sector that CEA Industries serves. A reduced sales effort and lower capital expenditures by cannabis operators are likely contributing factors. This industry-specific context is important for understanding the company's performance. The cannabis market has been volatile, with regulatory changes and oversupply issues impacting operators' investment decisions.For stakeholders, the company's current position might represent an opportunity to reassess the market strategy and possibly pivot towards more sustainable revenue streams. The industry's challenges are not unique to CEA Industries and a broader market analysis could help identify new growth areas or innovative product offerings that could differentiate the company from its competitors.It's also worth noting that the cannabis industry is still relatively young and may face further regulatory changes that could either hinder or boost CEA Industries' growth. Investors should keep an eye on such developments as they can have a significant impact on the company's performance. 03/28/2024 - 04:10 PM Louisville, Colorado, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CEA Industries Inc. (NASDAQ: CEAD, CEADW) (“CEA Industries” or the “Company”), is reporting results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

We will provide updates on any material developments that result from this process.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.3 million compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower bookings over the last twelve months. Net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the year-ago period. The Company’s quarter-end backlog was $0.4 million compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the Company’s net bookings and backlog for the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by fewer capital expenditures by cannabis operators in the markets served by the Company, in addition to a reduced sales effort. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(0.3) million compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2022. Gross margin was (113.8%) compared to 10.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower revenue and fixed costs becoming a larger percentage of revenue. Fixed costs include the cost of services, engineering, manufacturing, and project management. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 51% to $0.7 million compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced personnel and marketing costs and lower product development expenses. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 improved to $1.0 million or $(0.12) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million or $(0.18) per share for the same period in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents were $12.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $18.6 million on December 31, 2022, while working capital decreased by $2.6 million during this period.

Net loss of $9.6 million in Q4 2023, with various nonrecurring expenses impacting the bottom line. Loss per share of $0.54 in Q4 2023, based on weighted average shares outstanding. Cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Market Research Analyst The expansion into new verticals by Dolphin Entertainment suggests strategic diversification, which could potentially hedge against volatility in their core markets. The acquisition of Special Projects and the introduction of new divisions within The Digital Dept. indicate an attempt to capture additional market share and create new revenue streams. This is consistent with industry trends where companies seek to leverage synergies between different segments of their business.However, the reported net loss of $9.6 million for Q4 2023, despite an increase in revenue, raises concerns about the company's cost management and profitability. The substantial nonrecurring expenses, including write-offs and impairments, suggest that Dolphin may be in a transitional phase, cleaning up its balance sheet to set the stage for future growth. While these one-time costs can explain the net loss, it's important for investors to monitor whether such expenses are truly nonrecurring or indicative of deeper issues. Financial Analyst Dolphin Entertainment's reported 8% year-over-year revenue growth is modest and reflects some resilience in the face of industry strikes. However, the Adjusted Operating Income of $0.3 million, while positive, is relatively small compared to the total revenue, indicating slim operating margins. Investors should be cautious about the company's ability to scale its profitability, especially given the significant operating expenses of $20.0 million for the quarter.The company's strategy of not requiring cash investment for ownership stakes in various ventures could be a double-edged sword. It minimizes cash outlays but could also result in diluted returns or increased risk exposure if these ventures do not perform as expected. The mention of sustained growth in revenue and Adjusted Operating Income is promising, but investors will need concrete evidence of this trajectory in future financial statements. Entertainment Industry Analyst The strategic moves by Dolphin Entertainment to diversify into skin care and beauty within influencer marketing, as well as establishing a young adult division, reflect an understanding of current market trends where cross-industry collaboration and targeted demographics are key. The entertainment industry increasingly relies on such cross-sector initiatives to drive growth and engagement, particularly with younger audiences who gravitate towards digital content and influencers.The success of their PR firms at major award events like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, along with the Grammy-winning clients of Shore Fire Media, demonstrates Dolphin's strong position in the entertainment PR space. This reputation could bolster their ability to successfully market new ventures. However, the true test will be their ability to translate these successes into profitable ventures without incurring additional financial strain. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Expands TAM by entering multiple new verticals in Q4 2023, and 2024, highlighted by:October 2023 Acquisition of Premiere Talent Booking, Creative Content, and Event Agency, SPECIAL PROJECTSJanuary 2024 Introduction of Skin Care & Beauty Division within Influencer Marketing and Talent Management subsidiary The Digital Dept.February 2024 Launch of Young Adult Division within The Digital Dept.MIAMI, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLPN), a leading entertainment marketing and premium content production company, announces its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.Bill O'Dowd, CEO of Dolphin Entertainment commented:""In Q4 2023 Dolphin achieved record revenue of $12.0 million, an increase of 8% year over year, despite the impact of two lengthy industry-wide strikes. Even more impressively, the team delivered positive Adjusted Operating Income of $0.3 Million in the face of such headwinds. Moving forward, following the industry's return to normalcy post-strikes, we foresee positive Adjusted Operating Income on a continuous annual basis, which marks Dolphin's next stage of evolution after the completion of our acquisition strategy and the formation of our Entertainment Marketing Super Group (with Special Projects joining Dolphin in Q4).Now we turn our attention to delivering synergy and organic growth between our companies, and to marketing the Ventures in which we have ownership stakes. This work has already started, and some big milestones will be achieved in the next few weeks.Our ""Blue Angels"" documentary, produced under our multi-year partnership with IMAX, will debut in IMAX theaters on May 17 and on Amazon Prime on May 23, just in time for Memorial Day Weekend.Q2 will also see the launch of the first product ideated by Dolphin that is in partnership with one of the A-list celebrities on our talent rosters.Later in the year, we expect to make the announcement of the first of Dolphin's owned or co-owned live events, to occur in late 2024 or in 2025.Content, consumer products and live events will be the cornerstones of our Ventures, and with Special Projects' expertise in curated, celebrity-inclusive live events, we now have the capability to launch Ventures across all 3 categories of focus. Importantly, we expect Dolphin will receive ownership stakes in the majority of these Ventures without the requirement of a cash investment.Thus, with a focus on organic growth amongst our best-in-class marketing companies, and the launch of exciting Ventures in a steady cadence, we believe we're poised for sustained growth in both revenue and Adjusted Operating Income (the financial metric by which we measure ourselves).""Q4 2023 and Recent HighlightsTotal revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31 2023 was $12.0 million, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2022.Adjusted operating income(1) of $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $0.1 million of adjusted operating income(1) for the same period in 2022.Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $20.0 million, including depreciation and amortization of $0.6 million and nonrecurring expenses of (i) $4.1 million to write off notes receivable, (ii) $3.0 million impairment of goodwill, (iii) $0.1 million of acquisition related costs and (iv) $0.1 million impairment of capitalized production costs.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain income and/or expense items that management deems are not directly attributable to the Company's core operating results and/or certain items that are inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current or past operating performance.Adjusted operating income or loss is defined by Dolphin as (loss) income from operations before: (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) write-off of assets, (iii) impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, (iv) acquisition costs, (v) employee stock compensation, (vi) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (vii) bad debt expense and (viii) and impairment of capitalized production costs.Management believes that the presentation of operating results using this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information for investors by providing them with the non-GAAP financial measure used by management for financial and operational decision making, planning and forecasting and in managing the business. This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP financial results, should not be considered a measure of liquidity and is unlikely to be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies.Reconciliation of GAAP loss from operations to non-GAAP income from operations(unaudited) For the three months ended December 31, 2023 2022 Revenues (GAAP) $12,022,208 $11,138,810 Expenses: Direct costs 325,513 625,292 Payroll and benefits 8,915,376 8,000,199 Selling, general and administrative 2,410,595 1,927,756 Acquisition costs 107,328 165,139 Impairment of goodwill 2,966,815 906,337 Write-off of notes receivables 4,108,080 - Change in fair value of contingent consideration - 1,392,493 Depreciation and amortization 640,843 502,590 Legal and professional 530,059 585,612 Total expenses (GAAP) 20,004,609 14,105,418 Loss from operations (GAAP) $(7,982,401) $(2,966,608)Adjustments to GAAP measure: Acquisition costs 107,328 165,139 Impairment of goodwill 2,966,815 906,337 Write-off of notes receivables 4,108,080 - Change in fair value of contingent consideration - 1,392,493 Depreciation and amortization 640,843 502,590 Bad debt expense 353,062 64,840 Impairment of capitalized production costs 25,000 - Stock compensation 86,788 48,946 Income from operations (non-GAAP) $305,515 $113,737 SOURCE: Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What was Dolphin Entertainment's revenue in Q4 2023?

Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 04:09 PM WOOD DALE, Ill., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Power Solutions International, Inc. (the “Company” or “PSI”) amended its $130 million uncommitted senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), with Standard Chartered Bank, as administrative agent (“Standard Chartered”), and the lenders party thereto from time to time. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extends the maturity date of loans outstanding under its previous credit facility to the earlier of March 21, 2025 or the demand of Standard Chartered. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an outstanding principal balance of $50 million with no principal payments scheduled as of the date of this release. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is subject to customary events of default and covenants, including minimum consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio covenants for the second and third quarters of 2024. Borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will incur interest at either the alternate base rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 3.45% per annum. The obligations under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain wholly-owned, existing and subsequently acquired or formed direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. In connection with the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, on March 22, 2024, the Company also amended one of its existing shareholder’s loan agreements with its majority stockholder, Weichai America Corp. (“Weichai”), to among other things, extend the maturity date thereof. The Company and Weichai agreed not to renew the first shareholder’s loan agreement, which expired on March 24, 2024, providing the Company with a $130.0 million subordinated loan under which Weichai was obligated to advance funds solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of March 24, 2023 among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, Standard Chartered, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time if the Company was unable to pay such borrowings. The shareholder’s loan agreement providing the Company with a $30 million subordinated loan at the discretion of Weichai at an annual interest rate equal to SOFR plus 4.05% per annum (the “$30 Million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement”) was amended to extend the maturity date from March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025. Further, if the applicable term SOFR is negative, the interest rate per annum shall be deemed to be 4.05% per annum. If the interest rate for any loan is lower than Weichai’s borrowing cost, the interest rate for such loan shall be equal to Weichai’s borrowing cost plus 1%. The $30 Million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement is subject to customary events of default and covenants. The Company has covenanted to secure any amounts borrowed under the $30 Million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement upon payment in full of all amounts outstanding under the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of March 22, 2024, the Company had borrowed approximately $19.8 million under the $30 Million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement. The Company also previously entered into two other loan agreements with Weichai, including the $25 million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement (the “$25 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement”) and the $50 Million Second Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement (the “$50 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement”). The $25 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement will mature on May 20, 2024 and the $50 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement will mature on November 30, 2024. The Company intends to work with Weichai to extend both the $25 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement and the $50 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement as the maturity date of each agreement approaches. As of March 22, 2024, both the $25 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement and the $50 Million Second Amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement have been fully drawn.

Despite challenges in the market, Getaround restructured operations, acquired HyreCar assets, and launched AI-based TrustScore model. However, the decision to suspend operations in New York due to high insurance costs poses a setback. Positive Appointment of new leadership including Chairperson, CEO, and COO to drive strategic growth and profitability Financial results for 2023 show improvement in Adjusted EBITDA loss and revenue growth driven by HyreCar acquisition Restructured operations to reduce Total Operating Expenses by over $25 million annually and acquired HyreCar assets to strengthen gig carsharing business Launched next generation AI-based TrustScore model and new partnership with TransUnion to enhance trust and reduce costs Decided to suspend consumer car sharing operations in New York State due to high insurance costs under the New York Peer-to-Peer Carsharing Act Negative Suspension of operations in New York State due to insurance costs may impact market presence and revenue Decrease in Trip Contribution Margin from 47% to 40% in 2023 raises concerns about profitability GAAP Net Loss of $113.9 million in 2023 indicates financial challenges despite improvements in Adjusted EBITDA loss Market Research Analyst The strategic changes at Getaround, including the leadership transition and the capital infusion from Mudrick Capital, indicate a pivotal moment for the company. The appointment of Jason Mudrick as Chairperson and Eduardo Iniguez as CEO, combined with the recent restructuring efforts, aims to pivot the company towards profitability. The focus on cost reduction, such as the $25 million cut in operating expenses and the acquisition of HyreCar assets to bolster the gig carsharing segment, are moves likely to be welcomed by investors seeking operational efficiency and growth potential.However, the decision to suspend operations in New York due to prohibitive insurance costs under the P2P Carsharing Act presents a dual-edged sword. On one hand, it exemplifies the company's commitment to financial discipline by avoiding unsustainable costs. On the other hand, it signals a retreat from a potentially lucrative market, which could have implications for future growth and market share. The short-term benefits of cost savings must be weighed against the long-term impact on brand presence and expansion opportunities.The 22% year-over-year revenue increase and the 16% improvement in GAAP Net Loss are positive signs, yet the decrease in Trip Contribution Margin from 47% to 40% raises questions about the sustainability of the revenue quality. Investors will need to monitor how the changes in the TrustScore model and the discontinuation of high-risk revenue streams will affect the company's financial health moving forward. Financial Analyst Getaround's financial highlights for the year reflect a company in transition, with efforts to streamline operations and improve its bottom line. The 22% increase in total revenues and the 20% improvement in Adjusted EBITDA loss are indicative of successful cost optimization strategies. However, the decrease in Trip Contribution Margin suggests that while the company is reducing costs, it may also be facing challenges in maintaining profitability per trip.The strategic acquisition of HyreCar assets is a noteworthy development, potentially enhancing Getaround's position in the gig economy and its partnership with Uber. This move could be a significant driver of future revenue growth, especially as the gig economy continues to expand. However, the integration of these assets and the management of associated insurance liabilities will be a critical factor in determining the success of this acquisition.Investors should also consider the impact of the suspended operations in New York on the company's valuation. While this decision may improve short-term financial metrics by reducing liabilities, it could limit Getaround's long-term growth prospects in a major urban market. The trade-off between immediate financial stability and future expansion is a key consideration for stakeholders. Legal Expert The regulatory environment, as evidenced by the New York Peer-to-Peer Carsharing Act, has a significant impact on Getaround's operational strategy. The requirement for carsharing providers to maintain insurance limits fifty times greater than those for rental car companies poses a formidable barrier to entry and sustainability in the market. Getaround's suspension of services in New York highlights the influence of local regulations on the sharing economy and raises concerns about potential future legislative challenges in other jurisdictions.For investors, this regulatory hurdle in New York may serve as a cautionary tale of the legal complexities that sharing economy companies like Getaround face. The ability to navigate these complexities will be important for Getaround's expansion and profitability. The company's proactive approach to managing these challenges may be seen as a positive indicator of its risk management capabilities, but it also underscores the need for a robust legal strategy to mitigate such risks.Understanding the legal landscape will be essential for Getaround as it seeks to grow in a highly regulated industry. Stakeholders should monitor regulatory developments closely, as they can have substantial implications for the company's operational freedom and profitability. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM New leadership focused on strategic path to profitability supported by recent capital raise and organizational streamlining SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Getaround (NYSE: GETR) (“Getaround'' or “the Company”), the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Early 2024 Leadership Transition In January 2024, Getaround’s Board appointed Jason Mudrick, Chief Investment Officer of Mudrick Capital Management, to the position of Chairperson of the board. This appointment follows Mudrick Capital’s agreement to provide $20 million in financing to support the Company’s 2024 operating plan. Subsequently, in February 2024 the board appointed Eduardo Iniguez as Chief Executive Officer and board member of Getaround. AJ Lee was promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer in March 2024. “I believe there is tremendous potential in Getaround’s business model,” said Mudrick. “With proper leadership, adequate funding and thoughtful capital allocation, we should be able to scale the platform Getaround built over the past decade exponentially. The near term focus is to stabilize the business to reduce losses, and once stabilized to grow the business thoughtfully. I want to thank Sam Zaid, Getaround’s co-founder and former CEO, for his years of service getting Getaround to where it is today. I’m very excited Eduardo has taken on the role of CEO – his financial and operating discipline is exactly what Getaround needs today.” “I joined Getaround at a time when the Company is undergoing a transformative journey. The leadership transition includes several other senior management appointments and notably, Jason Mudrick’s appointment to the position of Chairperson of the board,” said Iniguez. “I have been working closely with the board and management team to set near-term priorities that - broadly speaking - include strategic expansion in profitable markets globally, product development that maximizes ROI and improving our financial discipline across the company.” 2023 Full Year Business Highlights Iniguez went on to say, “Getaround has a tremendous opportunity ahead to increase its market share and deliver a truly differentiated service offering. At the same time, there are multiple challenges to achieving our full potential – some are specific to our company, and some relate to evolving macro trends. The company has taken critical steps to address these challenges head on which we expect to accelerate our path to profitability.” Restructured operations to reduce Total Operating Expenses by more than $25 million on an annualized basis as of the fourth quarter 2023, excluding the HyreCar assets acquired in May Acquired HyreCar assets to build on our expanding Uber relationship and solidify our leadership position in gig carsharing Launched the next generation of our proprietary AI-based TrustScore model and announced a new relationship with TransUnion to reduce cost of claims and insurance On March 23, 2024, Getaround decided to suspend its consumer car sharing operations in New York State as of April 1, 2024, due to the extremely high cost of maintaining the insurance coverage required under the New York Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Carsharing Act enacted in 2022. The Act requires Getaround and other carsharing providers to maintain insurance limits that are fifty times greater than the insurance limits required for rental car companies and private vehicle ownership. The Company is disappointed that New Yorkers will not have access to its affordable, on demand car ownership alternative that is shown to reduce congestion in cities and reduce carbon emissions. 2023 Full Year Financial Highlights “In May, 2023 we completed the acquisition of HyreCar assets to expand our gig carsharing business. This acquisition was the primary driver of our 2023 revenue growth,” said Tom Alderman, Getaround’s Chief Financial Officer. “In December 2022, we deployed a new version of our Getaround TrustScore to improve the trust and safety of our marketplace. This improved risk model with dynamic pricing resulted in a reduction in high-risk revenue and Gross Booking Value while simultaneously improving our profitability. The benefit of the risk improvements were offset in 2023 by an increase in trip support costs related to our operations in New York State as well as insurance liabilities related to the acquisition of the HyreCar assets. This resulted in a decrease to our Trip Contribution Margin in 2023, however we do not expect these additional trip support costs to recur in 2024.” Alderman went on to say, “In 2023 we showed significant improvement in our Adjusted EBITDA loss driven by our continued focus on cost optimization measures. Throughout the year we also recognized significant benefits from the business restructuring announced in February 2023.” Total Revenues of $72.7 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year Gross Booking Value of $204 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year Gross margin from Service revenue was 85%, consistent with the prior year Trip Contribution Margin was 40%, down from 47% the prior year GAAP Net Loss of $113.9 million, a 16% improvement from the same period last year Adjusted EBITDA loss of $72.0 million, a 20% improvement from the same period last year About Getaround Offering a digital experience, Getaround (NYSE: GETR) makes sharing cars and trucks simple through its proprietary cloud and in-car Connect® technology.

Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar financial measures. Furthermore, these financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view the non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin Trip Contribution Profit is defined as our gross profit from Service revenue adjusted for: (i) cost of Service revenue, amortization and depreciation; and (ii) trip support costs, which consist of auto insurance expenses, claims support and customer relations costs. We define Trip Contribution Margin as Trip Contribution Profit divided by Service revenue recognized during the period presented. We believe these measures are leading indicators of our ability to achieve profitability and sustain or increase it over time. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin are measures we use to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin have generally increased over the periods as Service revenue increased while costs considered in the calculation of Trip Contribution Profit decreased as a percentage of Total Revenues. The following tables present a reconciliation of Trip Contribution Profit from the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit from Service revenue, for the periods presented: (In thousands, except percentages) Year EndedDecember 31,2023 Year EndedDecember 31,2022 Gross profit from Service revenue $ 60,640 $ 49,679 Gross margin from Service revenue 85% 85% Plus: Cost of Service revenue, amortization and depreciation 3,852 2,984 Less: Trip support costs (36,173) (25,259) Trip Contribution Profit $ 28,319 $ 27,404 Trip Contribution Margin 40% 47% (In thousands, except percentages) Year EndedDecember 31,2023 Year EndedDecember 31,2022 Service revenue $ 71,152 $ 58,108 Less: Cost of Service revenue, net of amortization and depreciation (6,660) (5,445) Less: Cost of Service revenue, amortization and depreciation (3,852) (2,984) Gross profit from Service revenue $ 60,640 $ 49,679 Gross margin from Service revenue 85% 85% Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) fair value adjustment of instruments carried at fair value; (ii) interest income (expense) and other income (expense); (iii) income tax provision/benefit; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) stock-based compensation expense; (vi) contingent compensation; (vii) transaction costs; (viii) impairment loss on goodwill and (ix) certain expenses determined to be incurred outside of the regular course of business which includes: certain restructuring costs, certain legal settlements and 2022 Business Combination-related legal fees, and investments in preparation of going public, initial implementation projects and transaction costs associated with proposed 2022 Business Combinations that are not subject to deferral. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that we use to assess operating performance and operating leverage of our business. As Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. The items excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA calculation are either non-cash in nature, or not driven by core results of recurring operations and therefore not predictable or recurring, rendering comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.

(BTBD) reports financial results for 2023 with a 15.1% revenue increase but a net loss of $887,368. The company's equity in the loss of Bagger Dave’s was $347,081, affecting restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA. Despite challenges, plans for rebranding and profitability improvements are underway. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net loss of $887,368, which translates to a loss of $0.14 per share, is a significant figure that requires attention. The decline in restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA to 6.2% indicates a potential concern regarding operational efficiency and profitability. The equity loss from Bagger Dave's, although a non-cash charge, still represents a substantial portion of the total loss, which could signal underlying issues with this investment. The cash and short-term investments position of $6.9 million provides some liquidity cushion, but the company's ability to manage expenses and achieve economies of scale, as mentioned by the CEO, will be important in mitigating the impact of general and administrative costs.The mention of inflationary pressures and increased labor costs reflects broader economic challenges that many businesses are facing. The company's proactive stance on rebranding and aiming for profitability with minimal investment is a strategic move that could benefit the company if executed effectively. However, the decision not to provide a financial forecast due to uncertainties is a conservative approach that may be seen as a lack of confidence by some investors. Market Research Analyst The 15.1% increase in total revenues is a positive development, indicating that the company is experiencing growth in sales. This growth, however, must be weighed against the net loss reported, suggesting that the company is selling more but not necessarily translating that into bottom-line profitability. The rebranding efforts for Bagger Dave's and the focus on improving the profitability of Florida locations show that the company is attempting to revitalize its brand and operations. These initiatives may be well-received by the market if they lead to a turnaround in performance.It's also worth noting the company's mention of recent moderation in inflationary pressures which could be a positive signal for future cost management. The lack of a financial forecast, while prudent in uncertain times, may affect investor sentiment as it introduces ambiguity regarding future performance. Investors typically seek transparency and guidance to gauge potential risks and returns. Economist The company's situation reflects the broader economic conditions, such as inflation and labor cost increases, which are impacting the restaurant industry as a whole. The ability to manage these costs effectively will be key to the company's success moving forward. The non-recurring expenses related to investment activities, such as the contested proxy solicitation, are a reminder of the additional costs public companies may incur. These costs can have a material impact on financials, particularly for smaller companies like BT Brands.From an economic perspective, the company's strategy to expand its revenue base to offset compliance and administrative expenses is sound. However, the execution of this strategy in the current economic climate will be challenging. The company's decision not to provide a financial forecast suggests caution in an unpredictable market, which may be a rational approach but also indicates the potential volatility and uncertainty the company faces. 03/28/2024 - 04:08 PM Earnings Conference Call at 4:15 Eastern Today WEST FARGO, N.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BT Brands, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBD and BTBDW), today reported its financial results for the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2023, and for the 13 weeks then ended. The results include our 40% share of Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern results with its six locations. BT Brands currently operates a total of seventeen restaurants comprising the following: Seven Burger Time locations and one Dairy Queen franchise are in the North Central region of the United States, collectively (“BTND”). Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern, Inc., a 40%- %-owned affiliate operating six Bagger Dave’s restaurants in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana (“Bagger Dave’s”). Keegan’s Seafood Grille in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida (“Keegan’s”). Pie In The Sky Coffee and Bakery in Woods Hole, Massachusetts (“PIE”). Village Bier Garten, in Cocoa, Florida (“VBG”). Highlights and recent activities include: Total revenues for 2023 increased 15.1% over 2022 to $11.1 million. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $887,368, or $.14 per share in 2023. For the year, restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) declined to 6.2%. Our equity in the loss of Bagger Dave’s was $347,081. On December 31, 2023, we had $6.9 million in cash and short-term investments. Gary Copperud, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Certainly, the loss for the year was disappointing. Our share of the Bagger Dave loss of $347,081 is a noncash charge representing 35% of our total loss for the year. Our two Florida locations continued to perform below our expectations; however, recent results have been more encouraging. We are in the midst of a significant effort to rebrand the Bagger locations with a different concept, and we are confident that we can achieve profitability in this entity with minimal investment. Improving the profitability of our Florida businesses continues to be a significant focus of our current activity. We also incurred approximately $100,000 in non-recurring expenses related to our investment activities, including the contested proxy solicitation at Noble Roman. As a public company, we bear the burden of general and administrative costs related to compliance and other public company activities; our goal is to spread these expenses over a larger revenue base in the future. We are seeing some moderation of inflationary pressure on our cost of sales inputs; however, we continue to face challenges, and the hourly cost of labor has increased significantly. As we consider the balance of 2024, we are focused on achieving profitability consistent with our expectations. We are in the early stages of reviewing several opportunities that could contribute significantly to improved results."" Fiscal 2024 Outlook: Because of the evolving character of our Company and because of continuing uncertainty surrounding public health concerns, impacts of supply chain constraints, and the current inflationary environment, the Company is not providing a financial forecast for fiscal 2023 and 2024.

JOHN HANCOCK FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FUND NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS - SOURCES OF DISTRIBUTION UNDER SECTION 19(a),2024-03-28T20:08:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO) announced a quarterly distribution of $0.6500 per share to shareholders.

The distribution sources include net investment income, net realized short and long-term capital gains, and return of capital. The average annual total return for the past 5 years was 3.91%, with a current distribution rate of 9.09% of NAV. However, the cumulative total return for the fiscal year through February 29, 2024, was -6.41%. Positive None. Negative The cumulative total return for the fiscal year through February 29, 2024, was -6.41%, indicating a negative performance for shareholders. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund regarding its quarterly distribution reveals a significant portion of the payout is classified as a return of capital or other capital source, accounting for 69% of the total distribution. This is an area of interest for investors as it indicates the fund's income and capital gains are not sufficient to cover the distribution, potentially eroding the capital base over time.While a return of capital can boost a shareholder's immediate cash flow, it does not represent income generated from the fund's investments. This could suggest that the fund's underlying assets are not yielding returns at a rate that aligns with the distribution policy. The long-term sustainability of such distributions could be questioned if the trend continues, potentially affecting the fund's net asset value (NAV) and, by extension, its share price. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the composition of the distribution is relevant for shareholders. The fact that the distribution includes a return of capital means that part of the payment received is not subject to immediate taxation. Instead, it reduces the cost basis of the investment, which could result in higher capital gains taxes when shares are eventually sold.Investors should consider their individual tax situations and the implications of these distributions on their long-term tax liabilities. The absence of net realized short-term capital gains in the distribution also plays a role in the tax characterization, as short-term gains are typically taxed at higher rates than long-term gains or qualified dividends. Investment Advisor When assessing the fund's performance, the average annual total return of 3.91% over the past five years juxtaposed with the annualized current distribution rate of 9.09% presents a discrepancy that investors should evaluate. The current distribution rate substantially exceeds the average return, which could be a red flag regarding the fund's ability to maintain its distribution levels without depleting capital.Furthermore, the negative cumulative total return of -6.41% for the fiscal year to date suggests that the fund's market performance has been underwhelming. Investors should be cautious of the potential for a reduction in future distributions or a decline in NAV if the fund's market performance does not improve. Additionally, the high distribution rate relative to NAV may be attractive to income-focused investors, but it's important to assess the sustainability of such payouts. 03/28/2024 - 04:08 PM BOSTON, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (NYSE: BTO) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund managed by John Hancock Investment Management LLC and subadvised by Manulife Investment Management (US) LLC, announced today sources of its quarterly distribution of $0.6500 per share paid to all shareholders of record as of March 11, 2024, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan.

You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution plan. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The Fund has declared the March 2024 distribution pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan (the ""Plan""). Under the Plan, the Fund makes fixed quarterly distributions in the amount of $0.6500 per share.

Intellinetics expects revenue and EBITDA growth for 2024, driven by the IPAS offering. Negative None. Financial Analyst Intellinetics, Inc.'s recent financial disclosure indicates a robust year-over-year growth, especially in its SaaS offerings. A 28% increase in SaaS revenue is significant as it suggests a successful shift towards a recurring revenue model, which is generally favored for its predictability and potential for higher valuation multiples. The prepayment of $500,000 in debt is a positive signal of financial health and prudent capital management.The company's focus on the IPAS offering, assuming it scales as projected, could indeed be transformative. However, investors should monitor the execution of sales and marketing initiatives closely to ensure that the growth trajectory is maintained. The expectation of no net debt by the end of 2024 is ambitious and would markedly strengthen the company's balance sheet if achieved. Market Research Analyst The digital transformation solutions sector is experiencing heightened demand and Intellinetics' growth aligns with this trend. The introduction and early adoption of IPAS may position the company well within the payables automation space. It is worth noting, however, that the market is competitive, with several established players. The company's ability to secure a unique value proposition through IPAS will be critical to its sustained growth and market penetration.While the company's outlook for 2024 is optimistic, it is essential to evaluate the broader economic conditions that may affect client budgets and, consequently, the adoption of new SaaS solutions. The focus on making early IPAS adopters happy is a sound strategy for long-term success, as customer satisfaction can lead to referrals and a strong market reputation. Debt Market Analyst The proactive approach to debt management, as evidenced by the prepayment plans, is commendable and will likely be viewed positively by the debt markets. The reduction in leverage can improve credit ratings and reduce future borrowing costs. However, the company must balance debt reduction with the need to invest in product development and market expansion. The expectation to eliminate net debt may also hinge on the company's ability to maintain its revenue growth and manage operating expenses effectively. 03/28/2024 - 04:06 PM Full-Year SaaS Revenue Grows 28%; Initial IPAS Revenue Expanding SaaS Opportunity; Company to make $500,000 debt prepayment COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intellinetics, Inc.

DeSocio, President & CEO of Intellinetics, stated, “This was a milestone year for Intellinetics, as we expanded our base of recurring SaaS revenue, making our business more predictable and increasingly profitable. Our SaaS revenue continues to grow faster than our consolidated revenue. From this position of strength, we enter 2024 with increasing confidence that our new payables automation offering, IPAS, will become a more meaningful contributor to our results, adding another SaaS revenue stream to our profile.” “For the year, we delivered double-digit increases in revenue, net income, and Adjusted EBITDA, with only a modest contribution from IPAS,” continued Mr. DeSocio. “This progress enabled us to pay down debt, strengthen our balance sheet and invest in sales and marketing initiatives to support IPAS and YellowFolder.” Summary – 2023 Fourth Quarter Results Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $4,192,689, an increase of 3.8%, as compared with $4,038,146 for the same period in 2022. This organic increase was driven by an 8.8% increase in SaaS revenue, and a 4.7% increase in professional services fees, partially offset by lower sales of licensed software as the Company continued to shift its focus to recurring revenue. Total operating expenses increased 17.0% to $2,540,565, compared to $2,171,576 driven by increases in stock expense of $194,541 and depreciation and amortization of $66,614 (all non-cash expenses). Income from operations was $181,527 compared to $410,542 in the fourth quarter last year. Intellinetics reported net income of $61,638, down 69% compared to $200,784 for the same period in 2022. Basic and diluted net income per share for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $0.02 and $0.01, respectively, compared to $0.05 per basic and $0.04 per fully diluted share for the period ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $754,375 compared to $670,321 in 2022. “Importantly, our first two IPAS customers were both live and successfully running in the fourth quarter,” added Mr. DeSocio. Summary – 2023 Full-Year Results Yellow Folder, acquired April 1, 2022, contributed $3,613,764 in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2,460,474 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Inclusive of the contribution from Yellow Folder, revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $16,886,381, an increase of 20.5% as compared with $14,016,928 for the same period in 2022. Total operating expenses increased 17.0% to $9,456,486, compared to $8,081,837.

Intellinetics reported net income of $519,266, or $0.13 per basic and $0.11 per diluted share, compared to net income of $24,027, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $2,744,649 compared to $2,413,901. 2024 Outlook Based on management's current plans and assumptions, the Company reiterated expectations that it will grow revenues and EBITDA on a year-over-year basis for the fiscal year 2024. “Our IPAS offering provides customers with an almost instant positive return, and offers our company an organic growth opportunity to more than double our SaaS revenue over the next four to five years,” continued Mr. DeSocio. “We view IPAS as a transformative opportunity for our company, and we plan to make investments to position the product for as rapid an adoption as we can drive. Even with these investments, 2024 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow on a year-over-year basis, as we focus on making all the early adopters of IPAS happy, we round out its capabilities and set the stage for wholesale adoption in select ERP ecosystems over the next 4-5 years.” We will be prepaying $500,000 of our long term debt shortly, and expect to have no net debt at the end of 2024.

Expanded and historical information is made available to the public by Intellinetics on its website at www.intellinetics.com or at www.sec.gov. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Intellinetics uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. Intellinetics urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Income, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Intellinetics’ financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, any income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation, note conversion and note or equity offer warrant or stock expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and transaction costs. Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net income - GAAP $ 61,638 $ 200,784 Interest expense, net 119,889 209,758 Depreciation and amortization 259,268 198,127 Stock-based compensation 313,580 118,999 Change in fair value of earnout liabilities - (57,347 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 754,375 $ 670,321 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net income - GAAP $ 519,266 $ 24,027 Interest expense, net 588,203 803,294 Depreciation and amortization 974,527 722,197 Stock-based compensation 662,653 421,450 Change in fair value of earnout liabilities - 355,281 Transaction costs - 87,652 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,744,649 $ 2,413,901 Recurring Revenue: Recognized revenue for any applicable period that we characterize as being recurring in nature, without regard to contract start or end dates or renewal rates. It includes the following revenue types: SaaS subscription agreements, maintenance contracts related to perpetual software licenses, storage and retrieval services, and professional services revenues in the nature of business process outsourcing. It excludes revenues of a type that are not expected to recur, primarily perpetual licenses, most document conversion services, and other professional services that are project based. Recurring revenue is not determined by reference to deferred revenue, unbilled revenue, or any other GAAP financial measure over any period, so the Company has not reconciled the Recurring Revenues to any GAAP measure. Recurring revenue should not be extrapolated into a precise prediction of future revenues, because it does not take into account our contract start and end dates and our renewal rates. Management believes that reviewing this metric, in addition to GAAP results, helps investors and financial analysts understand the value of Intellinetics’ recurring revenue streams versus prior periods. Reconciliation of revenues to recurring revenues: For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Revenues as reported: Sale of software $ 11,899 $ 65,098 Software as a service 1,323,120 1,216,325 Software maintenance services 355,373 354,510 Professional services 2,236,733 2,136,611 Storage and retrieval 265,564 265,602 $ 4,192,689 $ 4,038,146 Revenues - recurring only: Sale of software - recurring $ - $ - Software as a service - recurring 1,267,202 1,144,832 Software maintenance services - recurring 355,373 354,510 Professional services - recurring 798,444 675,026 Storage and retrieval - recurring 225,561 239,379 $ 2,646,580 $ 2,413,747 Revenues - non-recurring only: Sale of software - non-recurring $ 11,899 $ 65,098 Software as a service - non-recurring 55,918 71,493 Software maintenance services - non-recurring - - Professional services - non-recurring 1,438,289 1,461,585 Storage and retrieval - non-recurring 40,003 26,223 $ 1,546,109 $ 1,624,399 Total recurring and non-recurring revenues $ 4,192,689 $ 4,038,146 Note 1 – Software as a service non-recurring revenue is comprised of professional services setup fees which are recognized ratably over the initial contract period. They do not renew, and are therefore non-recurring. Under ASC 606, they are deemed essential to the functionality of the subscription Software as a service, and are therefore recognized together with the subscription Software as a service revenue. Total Contract Value: Estimated total future revenues from contracts signed during the period. This refers to contracts or projects that have been awarded by our customers, and it presumes the provision of all software, subscription services, and/or professional services, with no termination of any awarded contracts. There can be no guarantee that all work will be completed during any fiscal period, or that the contracts will not be terminated before all the estimated future revenues are earned, received, and/or recognized. Total Contract Value is a performance measure that the Company believes provides useful information to its management and investors as it allows the Company to better track the Company’s current sales performance, without any adjustment to exclude revenues that will not be earned, received, or recognized until future periods. Total Contract Value includes new sales in all our revenue categories, including SaaS, perpetual software licenses, maintenance, storage and retrieval, and professional services, to new or existing customers. It excludes renewals (and price increases on renewals if any). Total Contract Value is not a substitute for total revenue. There is no GAAP measure that is comparable to Total Contract Value, so the Company has not reconciled the Total Contract Value to any GAAP measure.

The company also surpasses one thousand customers in the fourth quarter of FY'24. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Planet Labs' announcement of a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue to $220.7 million is a significant indicator of the company's growth trajectory. This performance exceeds typical market growth rates for the geospatial industry, which often hovers around the single digits. For investors, this could signal a robust business model and potential for continued expansion, particularly as the company has surpassed the one thousand customer mark in the fourth quarter. It's important to consider the scalability of their operations and how that might affect profit margins going forward.Furthermore, such an uptick in revenue might be reflective of an expanding application of geospatial data across various industries, from agriculture to defense. Investors should monitor whether Planet can maintain this growth rate as they scale and how effectively they can manage the costs associated with customer acquisition and technology development. The long-term sustainability of this growth will depend on the company's ability to innovate and penetrate new markets. Market Research Analyst Surpassing a customer base of one thousand in a niche market like daily data and insights from satellite imagery is a testament to Planet Labs' market penetration strategies. This milestone may represent a diversified customer portfolio, which can reduce reliance on any single industry or customer, thereby mitigating risk. The growth in their customer base is also a potential indicator of the increasing value placed on geospatial data for decision-making processes in businesses.It's important for stakeholders to understand the competitive landscape in which Planet operates. The entry of new competitors or the development of substitute technologies could impact Planet's market share. Additionally, the retention rate of these customers and the average revenue per user (ARPU) are key metrics that would provide a deeper understanding of the company's performance and future revenue potential. Economist The reported revenue growth is an encouraging sign not just for Planet Labs, but also for the broader economy, as it suggests a rising demand for data-driven solutions. The ability to surpass one thousand customers indicates a healthy demand elasticity for Planet's offerings. However, it's essential to consider the macroeconomic factors that could influence this demand. Economic downturns or budget cuts in key sectors like government and defense, which are significant consumers of satellite imagery, could affect future revenues.Additionally, as an economist, one would look at the potential for international expansion, considering global economic conditions. The company's performance must be contextualized within the larger economic framework, including trade policies, currency fluctuations and geopolitical events that could influence operational costs and international sales. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Delivers Record Full Year Revenue of $220.7 Million, up 15% Year-over-Year Surpasses One Thousand Customers in Fourth Quarter FY’24 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL) (“Planet” or the “Company”), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth, today announced financial results for the period ended January 31, 2024. “Planet delivered a solid fourth quarter to cap off the year. We saw strong demand in the government sector and an evolution toward selling solutions alongside our data, enabled by the revolution happening in AI. We are prioritizing investment behind these trends to capture the opportunity,” said Will Marshall, Planet’s Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson. “Additionally, our next generation satellite systems are taking flight. The Pelican tech demo satellite is performing well in orbit and the first Tanager satellite is planned to launch later this year.” Ashley Johnson, Planet’s Chief Financial and Operating Officer, added, “We continue to progress on our journey to building a high margin, sustainable, cash flow generating business. We expect growth for fiscal year ‘25 will be driven by large opportunities in the government sector and delivering solutions for customers. We remain committed to achieving Adjusted EBITDA profitability by Q4 of this fiscal year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $299 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of the end of the quarter, and we continue to have no debt.” Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial and Key Metric Highlights: Fourth quarter revenue increased 11% year-over-year to a record $58.9 million. Full year revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $220.7 million. Percent of Recurring Annual Contract Value (ACV) for the fourth quarter was 93%. End of Period (EoP) Customer Count increased 15% year-over-year to 1,018 customers. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55%, compared to 55% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Fourth quarter Non-GAAP Gross Margin(1) was 58%, compared to 58% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Full year gross margin was 51%, compared to 49% in fiscal year 2023. Full year Non-GAAP Gross Margin(1) was 54%, compared to 53% in fiscal year 2023. Ended the quarter with $298.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. (1) Please see “Planet’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion on how Planet calculates the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein. In addition, reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables at the end of this release. Recent Business Highlights: Growing Customer and Partner Relationships Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific: Planet was awarded a seven-figure annual contract value (ACV) contract by the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific for vessel detection and monitoring over key areas of interest throughout the Pacific Ocean. NIWC Pacific will integrate Planet data and AI capabilities from SynMax, a Houston-based satellite analytics and intelligence company, into their SeaVision platform to help improve maritime domain awareness throughout the region. Planet recently expanded its strategic partnership with SynMax, enabling Planet to sell an advanced analytics tool leveraging SynMax’s proprietary artificial intelligence, for vessel monitoring and classification. Carbon Mapper: Planet signed an eight-figure, multi-year data-license agreement with Carbon Mapper, Inc. to provide hyperspectral core imagery to the non-profit and its partners until 2030. The contract marks an extension to an existing data-license agreement between Planet and Carbon Mapper. The extension covers the 2026 to 2030 period. Carbon Mapper, Inc. has been a key partner to Planet in developing the Tanager hyperspectral constellation, and this contract extension marks an important step in the continuation of the coalition’s shared mission to help improve understanding of and accelerate reductions in global methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Swiss Re Expansion: Planet recently closed a three-year partnership expansion with Swiss Re, one of the world’s leading reinsurance companies. The contract adds Planet’s Land Surface Temperature data to Soil Water Content data, which allows Swiss Re to build innovative parametric insurance products by feeding pricing models, validating claims and credit, forecasting potential risk, and identifying opportunities within new markets. Canadian Insurance Company: Planet closed a multi-year deal with an agriculture-focused insurance company, who is leveraging Planet’s broad area monitoring solutions and Planetary Variables to modernize their drought insurance program and for crop insurance claim validation. Bolivia (INRA) Expansion: Bolivia’s Institute of National Agrarian Reform (INRA) and Planet are expanding their multi-year partnership. The expansion includes new products and support, such as Planetary Variables, Sentinel Hub, and Planet's Professional Services. INRA continues to leverage Planet’s solutions to manage public land and enforce property titling regulations. Google: Planet announced that through our partnership with Google, PlanetScope satellite data is available on Google Cloud Marketplace, enabling Google Cloud customers to analyze, process, and derive meaningful insights from Planet data at scale. New Technologies and Products Pelican On-Orbit Performance: The first Pelican tech demo, which Planet launched in November 2023, continues to perform well. The team is gaining valuable on orbit learnings and making solid progress towards operationalizing the Pelican platform. Planet expects to launch additional Pelicans, including the first production satellites, during the next 12 months. Field Boundaries Analytics: Planet announced the release of Field Boundaries, the latest add in our suite of advanced data feeds known as Planetary Variables. This dataset allows for high-level analytics at scale for multiple use cases, including food security, sustainable agricultural monitoring, commodities trading, and supply chain monitoring. Field Boundaries can provide the spatial context necessary to understand planted acres for different crop types and growth throughout the season, enabling accurate yield estimation on a regional and global level. This can help support benchmarking, the tracking of farming activities, and compliance with regulations, leading to improved agricultural products, services, practices, and policies. First Quarter Financial Outlook For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending April 30, 2024, Planet expects revenue to be in the range of approximately $58 million to $61 million, representing approximately 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Non-GAAP Gross Margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 50% to 52%. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of approximately ($11) million and ($9) million for the quarter. Capital Expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately $14 million and $17 million for the quarter. Planet has not reconciled its Non-GAAP financial outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain reconciling items, such as stock-based compensation expenses and depreciation and amortization are uncertain or out of Planet’s control and cannot be reasonably predicted. The actual amount of these expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 will have a significant impact on Planet’s future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of Planet’s Non-GAAP outlook to the most comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts. The foregoing forward-looking statements reflect Planet’s expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially.

Planet’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, certain Non-GAAP Expenses described further below, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Loss, Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Backlog, which are non-GAAP measures the Company uses to supplement its results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate the Company’s core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets classified as cost of revenue, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination. The Company defines Non-GAAP Gross Margin as Non-GAAP Gross Profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP Expenses: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP cost of revenue, Non-GAAP research and development expenses, Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, and Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses as, in each case, the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure (cost of revenue, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses) adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination, that are classified within each of the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP Loss from Operations: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Loss from Operations as loss from operations adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination. Non-GAAP Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share: The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Net Loss as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination, and the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments. The Company defines and calculates Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share as Non-GAAP Net Loss divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA: The Company defines and calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before the impact of interest income and expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the following items: stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, non-operating income and expenses such as foreign currency exchange gain or loss, restructuring costs, and employee transaction bonuses in connection with the Sinergise business combination. The Company presents Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, certain Non-GAAP Expenses described above, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Loss, Non-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share and Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in Planet’s industry and facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, the Company believes these measures are helpful in highlighting trends in its operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. Backlog: The Company defines and calculates Backlog as remaining performance obligations plus the cancellable portion of the contract value for contracts that provide the customer with a right to terminate for convenience without incurring a substantive termination penalty and written orders where funding has not been appropriated. Backlog does not include unexercised contract options. Remaining performance obligations represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes both deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted revenue that will be invoiced and recognized in revenue in future periods. Remaining performance obligations do not include contracts which provide the customer with a right to terminate for convenience without incurring a substantive termination penalty, written orders where funding has not been appropriated and unexercised contract options. An increasing and meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with the U.S. government and other government customers. Cancellation provisions, such as termination for convenience clauses, are common in contracts with the U.S. government and certain other government customers. The Company presents Backlog because the portion of its customer contracts with such cancellation provisions represents a meaningful amount of the Company’s expected future revenues. Management uses backlog to more effectively forecast the Company’s future business and results, which supports decisions around capital allocation. It also helps the Company identify future growth or operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. The Company also believes Backlog is useful for investors in forecasting the Company’s future results and understanding the growth of its business. Customer cancellation provisions relating to termination for convenience clauses and funding appropriation requirements are outside of the Company’s control, and as a result, the Company may fail to realize the full value of such contracts. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies, which may have different definitions from the Company’s. Further, certain of the non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude stock-based compensation expenses, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for the Company and an important part of its compensation strategy. Other Key Metrics ACV and EoP ACV Book of Business: In connection with the calculation of several of the key operational and business metrics we utilize, the Company calculates Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) for contracts of one year or greater as the total amount of value that a customer has contracted to pay for the most recent 12 month period for the contract, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. For short-term contracts (contracts less than 12 months), ACV is equal to total contract value. The Company also calculates EoP ACV Book of Business in connection with the calculation of several of the key operational and business metrics we utilize. The Company defines EoP ACV Book of Business as the sum of the ACV of all contracts that are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of such contracts, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. Active contracts exclude any contract that has been canceled, expired prior to the last day of the period without renewing, or for any other reason is not expected to generate revenue in the subsequent period. For contracts ending on the last day of the period, the ACV is either updated to reflect the ACV of the renewed contract or, if the contract has not yet renewed or extended, the ACV is excluded from the EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company does not annualize short-term contracts in calculating its EoP ACV Book of Business. The Company calculates the ACV of usage-based contracts based on the committed contracted revenue or the revenue achieved on the usage-based contract in the prior 12-month period. Percent of Recurring ACV: Percent of Recurring ACV is the portion of the total EoP ACV Book of Business that is recurring in nature. The Company defines ACV Book of Business as the sum of the ACV of all contracts that are active on the last day of the period pursuant to the effective dates and end dates of such contracts, excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. The Company defines Percent of Recurring ACV as the dollar value of all data subscription contracts and the committed portion of usage-based contracts (excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users) divided by the total dollar value of all contracts in our ACV Book of Business at a specific point in time. The Company believes Percent of Recurring ACV is useful to investors to better understand how much of the Company’s revenue is from customers that have the potential to renew their contracts over multiple years rather than being one-time in nature. The Company tracks Percent of Recurring ACV to inform estimates for the future revenue growth potential of our business and improve the predictability of our financial results. There are no significant estimates underlying management’s calculation of Percent of Recurring ACV, but management applies judgment as to which customers have an active contract at a period end for the purpose of determining ACV Book of Business, which is used as part of the calculation of Percent of Recurring ACV. EoP Customer Count: The Company defines EoP Customer Count as the total count of all existing customers at the end of the period excluding customers that are exclusively Sentinel Hub self-service paying users. For EoP Customer Count, the Company defines existing customers as customers with an active contract with the Company at the end of the reported period. For the purpose of this metric, the Company defines a customer as a distinct entity that uses the Company’s data or services. The Company sells directly to customers, as well as indirectly through its partner network. If a partner does not provide the end customer’s name, then the partner is reported as the customer. Each customer, regardless of the number of active opportunities with the Company, is counted only once. For example, if a customer utilizes multiple products of Planet, the Company only counts that customer once for purposes of EoP Customer Count. A customer with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries are also counted as a single unique customer based on the parent organization or parent account. For EoP Customer Count, the Company does not include users that only utilize the Company’s self-service Sentinel Hub web based ordering system, which the Company acquired in August 2023, and which offers standard starter packages on a monthly or annual basis. The Company believes excluding these users from EoP Customer Count creates a more useful metric, as the Company views the Sentinel Hub starter packages as entry points for smaller accounts, leading to broader awareness of the Company’s solutions throughout their networks and organizations. The Company believes EoP Customer Count is a useful metric for investors and management to track as it is an important indicator of the broader adoption of the Company’s platform and is a measure of the Company’s success in growing its market presence and penetration. Management applies judgment as to which customers are deemed to have an active contract in a period, as well as whether a customer is a distinct entity that uses the Company’s data or services. Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue: The Company defines capital expenditures as purchases of property and equipment plus capitalized internally developed software development costs, which are included in our statements of cash flows from investing activities. The Company defines Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue as the total amount of capital expenditures divided by total revenue in the reported period. Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue is a performance measure that we use to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support demand for the Company’s data services and related revenue, and to provide a comparable view of the Company’s performance relative to other earth observation companies, which may invest significantly greater amounts in their satellites to deliver their data to customers. The Company uses an agile space systems strategy, which means we invest in a larger number of significantly lower cost satellites and software infrastructure to automate the management of the satellites and to deliver the Company’s data to clients. As a result of the Company’s strategy and business model, the Company’s capital expenditures may be more similar to software companies with large data center infrastructure costs. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to look at the level of capital expenditure investments relative to revenue when evaluating the Company’s performance relative to other earth observation companies or to other software and data companies with significant data center infrastructure investment requirements. The Company believes Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Revenue is a useful metric for investors because it provides visibility to the level of capital expenditures required to operate the Company and the Company’s relative capital efficiency.

The company divested BioTrack, focusing on healthcare and life sciences, achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA ahead of schedule. Forian also expanded data sources, repurchased shares, and provided a positive outlook for 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Forian Inc.'s announcement of a 25% revenue growth and a positive Adjusted EBITDA turnaround from a negative figure in the previous year signifies a substantial improvement in the company's financial health. The successful divestiture and strategic refocus on the healthcare and life sciences sectors likely contributed to this performance. The company's ability to meet guidance in a challenging economic climate indicates a robust business model and effective management execution.The shift from a significant net loss to a net income position, particularly in continuing operations, suggests enhanced operational efficiency and potentially reduced costs or improved profit margins. Investors should note the positive trajectory in earnings per share, which reflects a direct impact on shareholder value. The repurchase of common stock and convertible notes may indicate management's confidence in the company's prospects and could be a signal of undervaluation to the market.Looking ahead, the projected revenue growth of 5% to 15% for the full year 2024, along with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8% to 12%, sets a conservative yet optimistic tone. This guidance may reflect management's confidence in sustained growth while acknowledging the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. Market Research Analyst The expansion and enhancement of Forian's data sources, including open and closed claims data, new lab data and physician reference data, indicate a strategic move to strengthen its analytics capabilities. This development is likely to improve the company's competitive edge by increasing the value proposition to its clients in the healthcare and life sciences industries.Forian's focus on innovation could lead to the development of new products or services, potentially opening up additional revenue streams. The company's performance should be monitored for how effectively it can leverage its expanded data assets to drive top-line growth and further margin improvements. Healthcare Industry Analyst The divestiture of BioTrack suggests a strategic decision to streamline operations and concentrate resources on core areas where Forian has a competitive advantage. This move could result in more focused research and development efforts and better alignment with industry trends in healthcare and life sciences analytics.Forian's reference to 'transformational year' may be indicative of significant operational changes that have the potential to reshape the company's market positioning. The healthcare and life sciences sectors are known for rapid innovation and data-driven decision-making and Forian's performance in these areas will be critical to its long-term success. 03/28/2024 - 04:06 PM Full Year 2023 Revenue Grew 25% Full Year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.3MM NEWTOWN, PA, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Forian Inc.

The non-GAAP financial measure provided herein is earnings before interest, taxes, non-cash and other items (“Adjusted EBITDA”), which should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for, net income or loss calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP (referred to below as “net loss”). Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as an additional measure of our Company’s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets, managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our management identify additional trends in our Company’s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our Company’s performance. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. In order to compensate for those limitations, management also reviews the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, but included in net income, as well as trends in those items. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions. In addition, as more fully described below, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our Company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes, different capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net loss. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. The following is an explanation of the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA but included in net loss from continuing operations: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is a non-cash expense relating to capital expenditures and intangible assets arising from acquisitions that are expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expense from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of the business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets. Accordingly, management believes that this exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that the use of tangible and intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expense will recur in future periods.Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. Management believes that excluding the effect of stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons in the Company’s operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense includes certain separation expenses related to the vesting of stock options. Effective February 10, 2023, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Class II member of the Board of Directors resigned. In connection with the resignation, the Company entered into a separation agreement providing for, among other things, accelerated vesting of 106,656 unvested restricted shares of the Company common stock. Stock based compensation expense for 2023 includes $349,832 related to the accelerated vesting of stock, which is recognized in separation expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. On March 2, 2022, the Company and the former chief executive officer and the former chief financial officer of Helix mutually agreed not to renew special advisor agreements. Per the terms of the agreements, options to purchase 366,166 shares of common stock continued to vest according to their original terms through March 2, 2023, and unvested stock options to purchase 732,332 shares of common stock were forfeited. The advisors were not required to perform services to the Company beyond the non-renewal date of March 2, 2022. As a result, management recorded $5,417,043 of stock compensation expenses during March 2022 related to the options that vested through the twelve months ending March 2, 2023, which is recognized in separation expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Management believes that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between the Company’s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future.Interest Expense. Interest expense is associated with the convertible notes entered into on September 1, 2021 in the amount of $24,000,000 (the “Notes”). The Notes are due on September 1, 2025, and accrue interest at an annual rate of 3.5%. Management excludes interest expense from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because it is not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, its exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that interest expense associated with the Notes will recur in future periods.Investment Income. Investment income is associated with the level of marketable debt securities and other interest-bearing accounts in which we invest. Interest and investment income can vary over time due to changes in interest rates and level of investments. Management excludes interest and investment income from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that interest income will recur in future periods.Other Items. The Company engages in other activities and transactions that can impact net income (loss). In the periods reported, these other items included (i) change in fair value of warrant liability relating to warrants assumed in the acquisition of Helix; (ii) gain on sale of investment relating to the sale of a minority equity interest; (iii) gain on debt redemption, which relates to a gain on the early retirement of a portion of the convertible notes and (iv) litigation related expenses, which relate to certain litigation related to entities acquired in the acquisition of Helix. Management excludes these other items from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes these activities or transactions are not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that some of these other items may recur in future periods.Severance expenses. Effective February 10, 2023, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Class II member of the Board of Directors resigned. In connection with the resignation, the Company entered into a separation agreement providing for, among other things, (i) salary continuation for twelve months and (ii) accelerated vesting of 106,656 unvested restricted shares of the Company common stock. Severance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $250,000 related to the salary continuation. Managements excludes these other items from Adjusted EBITDA because management believes these costs are not recurring and not directly attributable to the performance of business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. In addition, the Company records normal course of business severance expenses in the operating expense line item related to our employees’ activities.Income tax expense. Management excludes the income tax expense from Adjusted EBITDA (i) because management believes that the income tax expense is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of business operations and, accordingly, its exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different tax attributes. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing U.S. GAAP measures in our public disclosures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The following table reconciles the specific items excluded from U.S. GAAP metrics in the calculation of non-GAAP metrics for the periods shown below: FORIAN INC.

The company's shares continue to trade under the symbol 'GAME'. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The delisting of GameSquare Holdings, Inc. from the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) is a strategic move that can have various implications for the company's market perception and capital raising strategies. Delisting from a smaller exchange like the TSXV could suggest a consolidation of trading venues, potentially aimed at focusing investor attention on a more prominent platform such as the NASDAQ. This could improve liquidity and reduce the complexity associated with being listed on multiple exchanges.However, it's important to note that the TSXV often serves as a growth platform for smaller or emerging companies. By delisting from TSXV, GameSquare may be signaling confidence in its growth prospects and financial stability. For current and potential investors, the simplification of the trading platform could be seen as a positive sign, indicating that the company is streamlining operations and may be positioning itself for future growth initiatives. Financial Analyst GameSquare's decision to delist from the TSX Venture Exchange and retain its NASDAQ listing is a financial strategy that could have cost implications. Maintaining a listing on multiple exchanges incurs additional regulatory compliance costs and administrative burdens. By delisting from TSXV, GameSquare may be looking to optimize its financial resources, reallocating funds that would have been spent on dual-listing expenses towards other areas of the business.From an investment perspective, the delisting should be scrutinized in the context of the company's overall financial health. Investors should examine GameSquare's recent financial statements and performance indicators to assess whether this move aligns with a broader cost-saving strategy and if it could potentially enhance shareholder value in the long term. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Shares remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital MarketFRISCO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2024 / GameSquare Holdings, Inc.

(OXM) reported an 11% increase in full-year sales to $1.57 billion for fiscal 2023. GAAP EPS of $3.82 was impacted by noncash impairment charges of $5.32 per share. Adjusted EPS of $10.15 fell within guidance range. Fiscal 2024 guidance includes revenues of $1.630 billion to $1.670 billion, GAAP EPS of $8.80 to $9.20, and adjusted EPS of $9.30 to $9.70. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in full-year sales for Oxford Industries is a positive indicator of the company's revenue growth, especially noteworthy in a period that has seen various businesses struggle with economic challenges. However, the reported noncash impairment charges of $5.32 per share, primarily related to the Johnny Was unit, suggest a significant write-down in the value of these assets. This is indicative of a strategic reassessment of the Johnny Was acquisition, which may have underperformed relative to expectations amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.Looking forward, the company's initiated fiscal 2024 guidance suggests confidence in continued revenue growth, although the projected decrease in GAAP and adjusted EPS could be a cause for concern among investors. This forecasted decline may reflect anticipated challenges, such as a cautious consumer environment and potential pressure on margins from the planned investments in physical and distribution capabilities. The dividend increase is a positive signal of confidence in the company's financial health and its ability to generate cash flow, which is often a key factor in attracting income-focused investors.It's important to note that the effective tax rate is expected to normalize in fiscal 2024, which could impact net income and EPS figures when compared to the previous fiscal year that benefitted from certain discrete items. Investors should carefully consider how these tax changes might affect their valuation of the company. Market Research Analyst The reported sales growth in Oxford Industries' full-price direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce channels is particularly encouraging, as these channels typically offer higher margins than wholesale. The 12% increase in full-price DTC sales and 16% increase in full-price e-commerce sales for the year reflect a strong consumer demand for the company's products and an effective channel strategy. This trend aligns with broader industry shifts towards DTC models, which allow brands to better control customer experience and gather valuable data.The planned expansion of the company's bricks-and-mortar footprint, including 5 Marlin Bars, aligns with the experiential retail trend, where consumers are seeking more than just transactions. These initiatives could enhance brand visibility and customer engagement, potentially driving future revenue growth.However, the anticipated decline in wholesale sales for fiscal 2024 and the shift in promotional activities at Lilly Pulitzer from the first to the second quarter could impact quarterly performance and should be monitored closely by stakeholders. These changes could result in fluctuations in revenue and earnings, affecting stock performance in the short term. Economist The financial performance of Oxford Industries provides a microcosmic view of the broader retail sector's adaptation to a changing economic landscape. The company's ability to generate $244 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, despite a challenging environment, demonstrates operational resilience and effective cash management. The paydown of outstanding debt is a prudent move that strengthens the company's balance sheet and reduces financial risk, which is particularly important in a period of elevated interest rates.The significant capital expenditure of approximately $200 million planned for fiscal 2024, largely allocated to a distribution center enhancement project, is a long-term strategic investment. While this will likely increase operational efficiency and capacity, the associated costs may weigh on short-term earnings. Stakeholders should assess whether the benefits of these investments, such as improved direct-to-consumer throughput capabilities, justify the potential impact on near-term financial performance.Finally, the reduction in inventory levels across the company's operating groups is a positive development, as it suggests a focus on inventory management and may lead to higher inventory turns. This efficiency can be a buffer against the risk of overstocking and markdowns, which can erode margins. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Full-year sales increased 11% to $1.57 billionFiscal 2023 GAAP EPS of $3.82 impacted by noncash impairment charges of $5.32 per share. Adjusted EPS of $10.15, within guidance rangeInitiates fiscal 2024 guidance of revenues of $1.630 billion to $1.670 billion, GAAP EPS of $8.80 to $9.20 and adjusted EPS of $9.30 to $9.70 ATLANTA, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 ended February 3, 2024. Consolidated net sales for the full 53-week fiscal 2023 year increased 11% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.41 billion in the 52-week fiscal 2022 year. Earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP basis decreased 63% to $3.82 compared to $10.19 in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 results include noncash impairment charges totaling $114 million, or $5.32 per share, which are primarily associated with the Johnny Was reporting unit. On an adjusted basis, EPS decreased 7% to $10.15 compared to $10.88 in fiscal 2022. Consolidated net sales in the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 6% to $404 million compared to $382 million in the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Inclusive of the aforementioned noncash impairment charges which were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023, loss per share on a GAAP basis was $3.85 compared to earnings per share of $2.00 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On an adjusted basis, EPS decreased to $1.90 compared to $2.28 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Tom Chubb, Chairman and CEO, commented, “Fiscal 2023 was highlighted by the second strongest earnings year in our 82-year history and concluded a five-year period during which we delivered compound annual adjusted EPS growth exceeding 18 percent. This strong performance included generating $244 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, allowing us to invest in both organic growth and acquisitions, return capital to our shareholders via our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, and pay down almost all our outstanding debt. Looking forward to 2024, our strong balance sheet and cash flows have us well positioned to invest further in future growth, which includes expansion of our bricks-and-mortar footprint, including 5 Marlin Bars, and enhancing the efficiency and capacity of our east coast distribution capabilities. While these investments combined with the persistence of a cautious consumer environment will put pressure on near-term EPS, we are excited to continue executing the initiatives that we have in place to bring more consumers into the beautiful universes our brands represent. We are equally as excited to be in a position to announce a 3% increase in our quarterly dividend for 2024.” Mr. Chubb concluded, “We are very proud of the portfolio of brands we have built and the strong connections we have forged with our customers. Most of all, we are incredibly proud of the amazing team of people that bring our brands to life every day. As always, we are committed to delivering on our near-term targets while staying focused on the initiatives that will strengthen our brands and business fundamentals over the long-term.” Fiscal 2023 versus Fiscal 2022 Net Sales by Operating GroupFourth QuarterFiscal Year($ in millions) 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % Change Tommy Bahama$243.8 $229.6 6% $898.8 $880.2 2% Lilly Pulitzer 78.4 74.5 5% 343.5 339.3 1% Emerging Brands 30.1 27.9 8% 126.8 116.5 9% Other (0.1) 0.6 nm (0.5) 3.0 nm Subtotal 352.2 332.6 6% 1,368.6 1,338.9 2% Johnny Was (1) 52.2 49.9 5% 202.9 72.6 nm Total Company$404.4 $382.5 6% $1,571.5 $1,411.5 11% (1) Johnny Was was acquired on September 19, 2022, and results presented reflect Johnny Was operations subsequent to the acquisition date. For the full 2023 fiscal year, consolidated net sales increased 11% to $1.57 billion from $1.41 billion in the prior year, which included an increase in net sales of $130 million for Johnny Was which we owned for 19 weeks in fiscal 2022. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales increased 6% over the prior year to $404 million. These net sales increases include the following growth in each of our distribution channels. For the full 2023 fiscal year, full-price DTC sales increased $112 million, or 12%, to $1.0 billion versus fiscal 2022, which included an increase of $100 million of DTC sales for Johnny Was. For the fourth quarter, full-price DTC sales were $265 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $258 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Full-price retail sales of $533 million increased $46 million, or 9% for the year, including a $47 million increase for Johnny Was. For the fourth quarter, full-price retail sales of $138 million increased $4 million, or 3%.Full-price e-commerce sales of $478 million increased $66 million, or 16% for the year, including a $53 million increase for Johnny Was. For the fourth quarter, full-price e-commerce sales of $127 million increased $3 million, or 3%. Sales from Lilly Pulitzer flash sales were $61 million for the year and $20 million for the fourth quarter versus $54 million and $18 million in the same periods of fiscal 2022.Outlet sales of $73 million increased $7 million, or 10% for the year, including a $3 million increase for Johnny Was. For the fourth quarter, outlet sales of $18 million increased $2 million, or 10%. Restaurant sales grew 6% to $116 million for the year and 14% to $32 million for the fourth quarter versus fiscal 2022.Wholesale sales of $312 million increased $30 million, or 11% for the year, including a $26 million increase for Johnny Was. For the fourth quarter, wholesale sales of $70 million increased $9 million, or 14%. Gross margin increased to 63.4% on a GAAP basis and 64.0% on an adjusted basis for the full 2023 fiscal year compared to 63.0% on a GAAP basis and 63.5% on an adjusted basis in the prior year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, gross margin increased to 60.9% on a GAAP basis and 61.7% on an adjusted basis compared to 60.8% on a GAAP basis and 61.5% on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. SG&A was $821 million in fiscal 2023 compared to SG&A of $692 million in fiscal 2022 with approximately $85 million, or 66%, of the increase due to the SG&A of Johnny Was. The 19% increase was primarily due to increases in employment costs, advertising costs, variable expenses and other expenses to support sales growth and occupancy, among other items. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $807 million for the full 2023 fiscal year compared to $684 million in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, SG&A was $218 million on a GAAP basis and $214 million on an adjusted basis compared to SG&A of $196 million on a GAAP basis and $193 million on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. As a result of the annual impairment assessments performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recognized noncash impairment charges totaling $114 million, primarily related to goodwill and intangible assets in the Johnny Was reporting unit. The impairment charges for Johnny Was reflect the current challenging macroeconomic environment that has resulted in a more cautious consumer and elevated interest rates for prolonged periods. Following these impairment charges, there is no goodwill remaining within the Johnny Was reporting unit.Royalties and other operating income decreased by $2 million to $20 million for the full year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower royalties in Tommy Bahama as well as the Company’s share of the start-up losses related to a minority investment in the Tommy Bahama Miramonte Resort.Full-year operating income was $81 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $219 million in fiscal 2022. On an adjusted basis, full-year operating income was $216 million compared to $234 million in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, operating loss on a GAAP basis was $81 million compared to $40 million of operating income in the prior year, while adjusted operating income was $39 million in fiscal 2023 and $46 million in fiscal 2022. Interest expense was $6 million for the year and $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. In fiscal 2022, interest expense for the full year was $3 million and $2 million for the fourth quarter. The reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 reflects substantial repayment in fiscal 2023 of debt incurred in connection with the Johnny Was acquisition. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 19% compared to 23% for fiscal 2022, both of which are lower than a typical effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was 27% compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The effective tax rates for each period included certain favorable discrete items that are not expected to occur in future periods. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Inventory decreased $61 million on a LIFO basis and $51 million, or 18%, on a FIFO basis compared to the end of fiscal 2022. Inventories decreased in our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Emerging Brands operating groups primarily due to continuing initiatives to focus on closely managing inventory purchases and reducing on-hand inventory levels. The Company believes that inventory levels in all operating groups are appropriate to support anticipated sales plans and anticipated higher inventory turns. As of February 3, 2024, the Company had $29 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement, compared to $119 million of borrowings outstanding at the end of the prior year. Also, the Company had $8 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $9 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per share, a 3% increase above the previous dividend payment. The dividend is payable on May 3, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 19, 2024. The Company has paid dividends every quarter since it became publicly owned in 1960. Outlook For fiscal 2024 the Company initiated sales and EPS guidance. The Company expects net sales in a range of $1.630 billion to $1.670 billion as compared to net sales of $1.57 billion in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, GAAP EPS is expected to be between $8.80 and $9.20 compared to fiscal 2023 GAAP EPS of $3.82. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $9.30 and $9.70, compared to fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $10.15. Fiscal 2024 EPS figures include a return to a normalized effective tax rate in 2024 after certain favorable discrete items lowered the tax rate in fiscal 2023. The decrease in both GAAP and adjusted EPS reflects a decline in wholesale sales of approximately $10 million for fiscal 2024 with a decline between $15 and $20 million in the first quarter partially offset by modest growth in the remainder of the year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company expects net sales to be between $395 million and $415 million compared to net sales of $420 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.47 to $2.67 in the first quarter compared to GAAP EPS of $3.64 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.60 and $2.80 compared to adjusted EPS of $3.78 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company anticipates interest expense of approximately $3 million in fiscal 2024. This compares to $6 million in the full year of 2023. The Company’s effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%. In addition to the decline in wholesale sales referenced above, guidance for the first quarter reflects a shift in certain promotional activities at Lilly Pulitzer from events that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $200 million compared to $74 million in fiscal 2023. The increase is primarily related to a multi-year Southeastern United States distribution center enhancement project to build a new facility to ensure best-in-class direct-to-consumer throughput capabilities for Oxford’s brands. The new facility will provide direct-to-consumer support for all of the Company’s brands, including the East Coast operations of Tommy Bahama. The Company anticipates total capital expenditures of $130 million over the life of the project, with the majority of the spend occurring in fiscal 2024 and expect completion of the new facility in fiscal 2025. Conference Call The Company will hold a conference call with senior management to discuss its financial results at 4:30 p.m. ET today. A live web cast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s website at www.oxfordinc.com. A replay of the call will be available through April 11, 2024 by dialing (412) 317-6671 access code 13745047.

Basis of Presentation All per share information is presented on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP Financial Information The Company reports its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement these consolidated financial results, management believes that a presentation and discussion of certain financial measures on an adjusted basis, which exclude certain non-operating or discrete gains, charges or other items, may provide a more meaningful basis on which investors may compare the Company’s ongoing results of operations between periods. These measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG&A, and adjusted operating income, among others. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational, and planning decisions to evaluate the Company’s ongoing performance. Management also uses these adjusted financial measures to discuss its business with investment and other financial institutions, its board of directors and others. Reconciliations of these adjusted measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented in tables included at the end of this release. Noncash Impairment Charges The Company is required to assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. In the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the annual budget and planning process for 2024, which drives certain assumptions used in annual goodwill impairment testing, the Company determined the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the Johnny Was reporting unit was greater than its estimated fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $111 million for fiscal 2023, which represents $5.21 per share. The impairment charges for Johnny Was reflect the current challenging macroeconomic environment that has resulted in a more cautious consumer and elevated interest rates for prolonged periods. Additional noncash impairment charges of $2 million, representing $0.12 per share, were recorded for fiscal 2023 related to an equity method investment within the Emerging Brands Group.

Announces Closing of $15 Million Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Ideal Power Inc. (NASDAQ:IPWR) closed an underwritten public offering, raising approximately $15 million through the sale of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at $7.50 per share. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The offering was made under a shelf registration statement and managed by Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Ideal Power Inc.'s public offering is a significant financial event that merits careful analysis. The company has successfully raised $15 million in capital, which, before expenses, adds a substantial amount to its working capital. This influx of funds is essential for the company's growth and development, particularly as it continues to innovate with its B-TRAN semiconductor power switch technology.Investors should note the price point of the offering at $7.50 per share, which indicates the value the underwriters have placed on the company's stock. This price, in conjunction with the total amount raised, provides a snapshot of the company's market valuation at the time of the offering. The involvement of Titan Partners Group as the sole book-running manager also suggests a level of confidence in the company's prospects.It's important to consider how the market will interpret this capital raise. On one hand, it could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company's potential, particularly if the stock price remains stable or increases post-offering. On the other hand, the dilution of existing shares could have a negative impact on the stock price. Investors would do well to monitor the stock's performance in the wake of this news. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Ideal Power's strategic decision to raise capital through a public offering could be indicative of its positioning within the semiconductor industry. The B-TRAN technology they are developing has the potential to disrupt traditional power switch technologies, leading to increased efficiency and reduced costs in various applications.The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and capital-intensive, requiring continuous investment in research and development. Ideal Power's move to secure additional funds suggests a proactive approach to maintaining a competitive edge. The success of this offering could signal to competitors and investors alike that Ideal Power is on a solid trajectory, with sufficient capital to pursue its strategic goals.However, it's also important to monitor how the company allocates the proceeds. The stated use of funds for 'general corporate and working capital purposes' is fairly broad. Stakeholders should look for more detailed plans regarding the deployment of this capital, as it could significantly affect the company's future performance and stock market position. Legal Expert In terms of regulatory compliance, Ideal Power's use of a 'shelf' registration statement for this public offering is a common strategy that allows for more timely and efficient capital raising when market conditions are favorable. This approach is compliant with SEC regulations and the effectiveness of the registration statement indicates that the necessary legal and financial disclosures have been met.The company's adherence to SEC guidelines, including the filing of a final prospectus supplement, is critical for investor protection and transparency. Potential investors have access to all the relevant information needed to make an informed decision.

(NYSE: FNA) introduces the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System for ankle ligament stability. The system offers dynamic anchors for better tissue replication, compatibility with existing products, and sterile packed configurations. CEO Albert DaCosta highlights the importance of syndesmotic stabilization, aiming to enhance patient recoveries. Surgeon Designer Mark Davies praises the system's innovation and anatomical reconstruction capabilities. The new system expands Paragon 28's soft tissue solutions, providing a comprehensive portfolio for foot and ankle injuries. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Device Analyst The introduction of Paragon 28's Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System represents a significant advancement in the field of orthopedic medical devices, specifically those used in the treatment of ankle injuries. The system's focus on restoring stability to ligaments surrounding the ankle addresses a clear clinical need, as a considerable proportion of ankle fractures and high ankle sprains require surgical intervention for proper healing.From a market perspective, the compatibility of the new system with existing Grappler® products may streamline surgical procedures and reduce the need for multiple devices, which could potentially lead to cost savings for healthcare providers and improved outcomes for patients. The emphasis on reducing waste and intraoperative complexity could also enhance operating room efficiency, a factor that is increasingly valued in the healthcare industry. Moreover, the sterile packaging and inclusion of necessary instrumentation further simplify the surgical process, potentially leading to quicker adoption rates among surgeons.Considering the global orthopedic devices market, innovations like the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ System may contribute to the company's market share growth. However, it is essential to monitor the system's clinical outcomes and adoption rate post-launch to gauge its impact on the company's financial performance. Orthopedic Surgeon The Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System appears to offer a unique approach to the treatment of syndesmotic injuries, which are often challenging to manage due to the complex anatomy and biomechanics of the ankle. The Dynamic Anchor's allowance for micromotion could potentially provide a more physiological repair by mimicking the natural movement of the ankle, which may improve patient outcomes.The system's design for multiple configurations offers surgeons the flexibility to tailor the repair to individual patient needs, which is a critical aspect of personalized medicine. While the system's benefits are clear, long-term studies would be necessary to validate its efficacy compared to traditional methods of syndesmotic stabilization.As an orthopedic surgeon, it's exciting to see innovation that could enhance the standard of care for ankle injuries, but the true test will be in the clinical results and the system's ability to facilitate quicker, more effective patient recoveries. Healthcare Market Research Analyst Paragon 28's launch of the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ system could potentially capture a significant niche in the orthopedic device segment. The focus on addressing up to 25% of all ankle fractures and unstable high ankle sprains presents a targeted approach to a common medical issue. The company's strategy to build a comprehensive suite of products for foot and ankle soft tissue injuries aligns with current healthcare trends towards specialization and complete solutions.However, the success of the product will largely depend on its clinical adoption. Factors such as ease of use, cost-effectiveness and integration into existing surgical workflows will be critical in determining its market penetration. Additionally, the company's ability to effectively communicate the benefits of the system to both surgeons and hospital procurement departments will be essential.The long-term impact on Paragon 28's business will be contingent upon the system's ability to displace existing solutions and become a preferred method for syndesmotic injury repair. Market reception, surgeon training and patient outcomes will be key indicators to watch in the coming quarters. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Paragon 28, Inc. (NYSE: FNA), is pleased to announce the launch of the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System designed to restore stability to the anterior and posterior ligaments surrounding the ankle during fibula fracture repairs and high ankle sprains. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240328312304/en/Figure 1: Anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (“AITFL”) Repair Showing the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Dynamic Anchor (left) and Grappler® Knotless Anchor (center). Complete Extraosseous Repair with Grappler® R3INFORCE™ System shown on right. (Graphic: Business Wire) Upon determination of syndesmotic instability, the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Anchors are placed in plate holes or other anatomic locations where pre-loaded suture tape can be routed and tensioned to address the injured ligament or ligaments. The Dynamic Anchor allows for micromotion in the repair to better replicate the mechanics of the native tissue. This system is highly synergistic with Paragon 28’s existing offerings and can utilize the recently launched Grappler® Knotless Sutures. This compatibility allows for multiple configurations for surgeons to cater their syndesmotic repair to their own treatment philosophies. The Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System is sterile packed and includes all instrumentation needed to complete the case in multiple configurations, reducing waste and intraoperative complexity. Paragon 28’s CEO, Albert DaCosta, commented, “With up to 25% of all ankle fractures as well as unstable high ankle sprains requiring implants to facilitate soft tissue healing, syndesmotic stabilization is a major priority for Paragon 28 and an opportunity for us to improve patients’ recoveries. In launching the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ System and Dynamic Knotless Anchor, we are adding to our comprehensive and growing suite of novel solutions designed specifically to treat injuries to the highly complex syndesmosis.” Surgeon Designer Mark Davies, MD, commented, “Congratulations to the blue sky thinking and creativity of the Paragon 28 team in manufacturing the Grappler® R3INFORCE™ Extraosseous Repair System.

Full year 2023 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $(50.9) million, meeting 2023 guidance. Successful direct listing on NYSE and merger completion with Southern Airways. Partnerships with Palantir for software development and AeroTEC for electrification initiatives. MOUs with Azul, REGENT, and several African Caravan fleet operators for electric powertrain conversions. Expansion into new service routes and collaboration with Electra.aero for eSTOL Aircraft delivery positions. Appointment of Oliver Reeves as Chief Financial Officer. Q1 2024 revenue outlook of $28.5-29.5 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $(17.0)-$(14.0) million. Focus on growth, profitability, expense reduction, and disciplined capital allocation in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Surf Air Mobility's full year revenue surpassing the guidance reflects a positive trajectory in sales, which is a critical performance indicator for investors. The 12% year-over-year increase in Pro Forma revenue suggests effective market penetration and potential scaling of operations. However, the substantial GAAP Net Loss of $(250.7) million and Pro Forma Net Loss of $(185.0) million, raise concerns about the company's current profitability and cost management strategies. The losses incorporate significant investments in R&D, which could be viewed as a strategic move for long-term growth, specifically in the electrification and software technology sectors. Nevertheless, the scale of the net loss compared to the previous year indicates a need for a careful review of the company's expenditure and the sustainability of its growth model.Furthermore, the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $(50.9) million, although in line with guidance, still indicates that the company is operating at a loss. The emphasis on achieving EBITDA guidance might be seen as a positive sign of management meeting its targets, but the underlying net losses could overshadow this achievement. The forward-looking statements regarding balancing growth with profitability in 2024 highlight the management's awareness of the need for a more sustainable financial approach. The market will likely monitor these developments closely, as they could significantly influence investor confidence and the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The partnerships and MOUs announced by Surf Air Mobility with entities like Palantir, Azul and various African carriers, represent strategic moves to expand its network and technological edge. These collaborations could potentially open new markets and customer segments, enhancing the company's competitive position in the regional air mobility space. The focus on electrification of the Cessna Caravan and the development of AI-enhanced crew scheduling software indicates a commitment to innovation and operational efficiency.However, the market will be keen on understanding how these initiatives translate into tangible financial improvements. The market's reception of these developments will depend on the perceived viability and scalability of electric aviation, which is still an emerging field. The MOUs, while promising, are not definitive contracts and thus may not yet fully reassure investors about future revenue streams. The appointment of Oliver Reeves as CFO could be seen as a strengthening of the financial leadership, which might be necessary to navigate the complex financial challenges the company faces. Sustainability Analyst Surf Air Mobility's investment in electrification technology aligns with the growing trend of sustainable aviation, which is increasingly important to environmentally conscious investors and consumers. The transition towards electric aircraft is part of a broader industry shift towards reducing carbon emissions and could position the company as a leader in sustainable regional air travel. However, the financial viability of such a transition is yet to be proven at scale and the significant R&D costs could impact short-term financial performance.Investors with a focus on sustainability will be interested in the long-term benefits and potential government incentives that could arise from such green initiatives. The partnership with REGENT for all-electric seagliders and the MOU with Electra.aero for eSTOL aircraft also highlight the company's commitment to diversifying its eco-friendly transportation options. These developments could enhance the company's reputation and appeal in the market, but stakeholders will be looking for clear paths to profitability amidst these environmentally progressive ventures. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Full year 2023 GAAP revenue of $60.5 million and Pro Forma revenue of $112.9 million, up 12% year-over-year, beating 2023 guidance.

Footnotes: Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Surf Air Mobility uses Adjusted EBITDA to identify and target operational results which is beneficial to management and investors in evaluating operational effectiveness. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of Surf Air Mobility’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of Surf Air Mobility’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Surf Air Mobility’s calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Surf Air Mobility presents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA because it considers this measure to be an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of Surf Air Mobility’s performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing its ongoing results of operations.

FDA approval granted in the U.S., with positive results in Phase 2 trials for other cancers. Positive KRYSTAL-12 confirmatory trial for KRAZATI in KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC met primary endpoint of progression-free survival Overall response rate (ORR) also showed positive results compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy No new safety signals reported, with safety data consistent with known profile FDA granted accelerated approval for KRAZATI in the U.S. for targeted treatment of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC Positive results in Phase 2 trials for other cancers like colorectal and pancreatic cancer FDA accepted supplemental new drug application for KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab for previously treated colorectal cancer Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent announcement by Bristol Myers Squibb regarding the KRYSTAL-12 study is a significant advancement in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a specific mutation, KRASG12C. As a clinician, the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) is noteworthy because it suggests patients are experiencing a delay in disease progression and a higher likelihood of tumor size reduction. This is particularly relevant for those who have already undergone a line of systemic therapy.From a medical perspective, the absence of new safety signals reinforces the tolerability of KRAZATI, which is important for patient compliance and quality of life. The potential for KRAZATI to become a standard second-line treatment could shift current therapeutic strategies and warrants close attention to the final overall survival data, which could further solidify its position in treatment protocols. Medical Research Analyst The positive outcome of the KRYSTAL-12 trial is a milestone in precision medicine, emphasizing the importance of targeted therapies in oncology. The successful meeting of endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial typically precedes a transition from accelerated to full approval by regulatory bodies, which could lead to broader market penetration and impact on Bristol Myers Squibb's financial performance.Furthermore, the potential expansion into other solid tumors and the ongoing review for combination treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC) opens additional revenue streams. The market for KRASG12C inhibitors is competitive and the trial's results could position KRAZATI favorably against rivals, potentially influencing the company's market share and stock valuation. Market Research Analyst In analyzing the impact on the business landscape, the success of KRAZATI in the KRYSTAL-12 study is poised to enhance Bristol Myers Squibb's portfolio in the oncology market. The drug's efficacy in treating KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC positions it as a significant player in a niche yet growing segment. This trial outcome may lead to increased adoption rates and could influence prescribing patterns, bolstering the company's competitive edge.The stock market often reacts favorably to positive clinical trial results, especially when they involve treatments for conditions with high unmet medical needs. Given the potential for expanded indications and the upcoming PDUFA date for the CRC combination therapy, investor sentiment may be positively influenced, reflecting in the company's stock performance. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb Announces Pivotal KRYSTAL-12 Confirmatory Trial Evaluating KRAZATI (adagrasib) Meets Primary Endpoint of Progression-Free Survival for Patients with Pretreated KRASG12C-Mutated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 KRYSTAL-12 study, evaluating KRAZATI® (adagrasib) as a monotherapy in patients with pretreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a KRASG12C mutation, met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) and the key secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) at final analysis for these endpoints. The study remains ongoing to assess the additional key secondary endpoint of overall survival. Results of the confirmatory trial showed that KRAZATI demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in PFS and ORR compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy as a second-line or later treatment for these patients. KRAZATI had no new safety signals and the safety data was consistent with the known safety profile. “Today’s news is an important reinforcement of the power of a targeted therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRASG12C-mutated lung cancer. FDA approval of KRAZATI in the U.S. has allowed us to provide a new treatment option for these patients, and topline results of the KRYSTAL-12 confirmatory study will build greater trust in the medical and patient community,” said Abderrahim Oukessou, M.D., vice president, global program lead, KRAZATI, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We are encouraged by the results from KRYSTAL-12 and look forward to helping more patients with KRASG12C-mutated lung cancer.” The company will complete a full evaluation of the available data and looks forward to sharing the results with the scientific community at an upcoming medical conference as well as discussing the results with health authorities. The U.S. FDA granted accelerated approval for KRAZATI as a targeted treatment for patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy in December 2022. In 2023, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted conditional marketing authorization for KRAZATI as a targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC and disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy followed by the European Commission (EC) in 2024. In addition to KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, KRAZATI and KRAZATI-based combinations have shown encouraging meaningful benefit in Phase 2 clinical trials across several tumors, including advanced colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors. In February, the U.S. FDA accepted for priority review the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of patients with previously treated KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of June 21, 2024. Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the KRYSTAL-12 clinical trial. ABOUT KRAZATI® (adagrasib) KRAZATI (adagrasib) is highly selective and potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of KRASG12C that is optimized to sustain target inhibition, an attribute that could be important to treat KRASG12C-mutated cancers, as the KRAS protein regenerates every 24-48 hours. KRASG12C mutations act as oncogenic drivers and occur in approximately 14% of non-small cell lung cancer, 3-4% of colorectal cancer, and 1-2% of several other cancers. In 2022, KRAZATI was granted accelerated approval for treatment of adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In 2023, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted conditional marketing authorization for KRAZATI as a targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer and disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy followed by the European Commission (EC) in 2024. KRAZATI continues to be evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutated solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. In 2022, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced colorectal cancer whose cancer has progressed following prior treatment with chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF therapy.

About KRYSTAL-12 KRYSTAL-12 is an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study evaluating KRAZATI compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy alone, in patients with KRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS as assessed by BICR. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and safety. INDICATION KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION GASTROINTESTINAL ADVERSE REACTIONS In the pooled safety population, serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions observed were gastrointestinal obstruction in 1.6%, including 1.4% grade 3 or 4, gastrointestinal bleeding in 0.5% of patients, including 0.5% grade 3, and colitis in 0.3%, including 0.3% grade 3. In addition, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting occurred in 89% of 366 patients, including 9% grade 3.

Net sales decreased by 23.9% in Q4 and 26.3% for the full year. Gross profit margin declined significantly, with a net loss of $7.5 million in Q4 and $34.2 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA also saw a decline. The company closed on a $55 million asset sale to clear debt, aiming for sustainable earnings growth in 2024. Positive Debt elimination through asset sales and new leadership focus on profitable growth and value maximization. Net sales decreased by 23.9% in Q4 and 26.3% for the full year. Gross profit margin declined significantly, with a net loss of $7.5 million in Q4 and $34.2 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined in both Q4 and the full year. A $55 million asset sale was used to clear remaining debt, positioning the company favorably for 2024. Negative Significant decline in gross profit margin and net sales. Net loss of $34.2 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decline in both Q4 and the full year. Financial Analyst The financial results disclosed by Ascent Industries Co. reflect a significant downturn in performance year-over-year. The reported net loss and decrease in gross profit margins are indicative of operational challenges and market pressures. Specifically, the contraction in Adjusted EBITDA margins from 9.8% to (8.2)% suggests a substantial impact on the company's operational efficiency and profitability.In analyzing these results, it's important to consider the broader industry context. The decline in net sales could be reflective of macroeconomic conditions such as decreased demand or increased competition. The sale of Specialty Pipe & Tube and the subsequent debt elimination can be seen as a strategic move to improve liquidity and reduce financial risk. However, this also raises questions about the company's future revenue streams and its ability to generate profit from its remaining operations.Investors may view the repurchase of shares as a signal of management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value, despite the poor financial performance. However, it's important to monitor whether this confidence translates into a turnaround strategy that can reverse the negative trends observed in the reported financials. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in net sales and gross profit margin is a clear indicator of market headwinds faced by Ascent Industries. The industry-wide destocking trends mentioned in the report could be a result of shifts in the supply chain, potentially caused by overproduction or a reduction in end-user demand. Such trends can have a cascading effect on companies like Ascent, which operate in the specialty chemicals and industrial tubular products sectors, both of which are sensitive to industrial demand cycles.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape and how Ascent's product mix is positioned within it. The unfavorable product mix mentioned could suggest that Ascent's offerings are not aligning with current market demands or that there are pricing pressures from competitors. The operating losses in both the chemicals and tubular segments raise concerns about the company's market competitiveness and the effectiveness of its current business model.From a market perspective, the efforts to onboard new customers and improve operational efficiencies will be key to watch. The extent to which these initiatives can offset the negative trends will be critical in assessing Ascent's potential for recovery and growth. Industrial Analyst The cessation of operations at the Munhall facility and the sale of Specialty Pipe & Tube are strategic decisions that likely aim to streamline operations and focus on more profitable segments. However, these moves also suggest a significant reorganization within Ascent's operational structure. The impact on production capabilities and the potential loss of customer base associated with these facilities must be carefully evaluated.Moreover, the industrial tubular products and specialty chemicals sectors are heavily influenced by global economic trends, regulatory changes and technological advancements. The company's ability to adapt to these changes while managing costs will be important in determining its long-term viability.Investors and stakeholders should consider the company's strategic plan to drive sustainable earnings growth. The management's focus on operational efficiencies and the drive to maximize value from its tubular segment could be positive if executed effectively. However, the substantial net losses and negative margins reported raise questions about the immediate feasibility of these plans. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Eliminated All Outstanding Debt with Cash Proceeds from the Sale of Specialty Pipe & Tube New Leadership Focused on Accelerating Profitable Growth and Maximizing Value OAK BROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ascent Industries Co. (Nasdaq: ACNT) (“Ascent” or the “Company”), an industrials company focused on the production of specialty chemicals and industrial tubular products, is reporting its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary1 (in millions, except per share and margin) Q4 2023 Q4 2022 Change Net Sales $41.2 $54.2 (23.9)% Gross Profit $(2.1) $4.9 (143.9)% Gross Profit Margin (5.2)% 9.0% (1,420)bps Net (Loss) Income $(7.5) $4.5 (267.4)% Diluted (Loss) Earnings per Share $(0.73) $0.43 (269.8)% Adjusted EBITDA $(5.9) $1.7 (460.5)% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (14.4)% 3.0% (1,740)bps Full Year 2023 Summary1 (in millions, except per share and margin) 2023 2022 Change Net Sales $193.2 $262.0 (26.3)% Gross Profit $1.5 $43.3 (96.5)% Gross Profit Margin 0.8% 16.5% (1,570)bps Net (Loss) Income $(34.2) $17.6 (294.3)% Diluted (Loss) Earnings per share $(3.37) $1.69 (299.4)% Adjusted EBITDA $(15.9) $25.6 (162.3)% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (8.2)% 9.8% (1,800)bps ____________________________ 1 On June 2, 2023, the Board of Directors of Ascent made the decision to permanently cease operations at the Company’s welded pipe and tube facility located in Munhall, PA (“Munhall”) effective on August 31, 2023. On December 22, 2023, the Company closed on a transaction to sell substantially all of the assets of Specialty Pipe & Tube (“SPT”). As a result, financial results from Munhall & SPT have been categorized into discontinued operations. Management Commentary “The Ascent team made notable progress towards our long-term strategic goals in 2023, despite continued market headwinds,” said Ascent CEO Bryan Kitchen. “This progress was driven by meaningful initiatives to onboard new customers and unlock operational efficiencies that we expect to bear fruit next year. However, our momentum in the fourth quarter was not sufficient to fully mitigate the adverse effects of industry-wide destocking trends that impacted both business segments. Prior to year-end, Ascent closed on a sale of substantially all of the assets of Specialty Pipe and Tube, generating $55 million in an all-cash transaction. These proceeds were utilized to clear remaining debt, positioning the Company favorably as it entered 2024. “We moved into 2024 with a healthy financial position and a commitment to driving sustainable earnings-growth across the enterprise. This commitment is underscored by purposeful initiatives to recapitalize talent and capabilities, aimed to maximize the value derived from the unique strengths within our tubular segment while simultaneously investing in the growth potential of the specialty chemicals segment. We believe our newly-assembled management team has already begun to make progress towards our long-term goals focused on creating durable shareholder value.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net sales from continuing operations were $41.2 million compared to $54.2 million in the prior year period, primarily attributable to decreased end-market demand and de-stocking trends across both segments. Gross profit from continuing operations was $(2.1) million, or (5.2%) of net sales, compared to $4.9 million, or 9.0% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to elevated costs and unfavorable product mix.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Financial statement information included in this earnings release includes non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors in evaluating its results to determine the value of a company. An item is excluded in the measure if its periodic value is inconsistent and sufficiently material that not identifying the item would render period comparability less meaningful to the reader or if including the item provides a clearer representation of normalized periodic earnings. The Company excludes in Adjusted EBITDA two categories of items: 1) Base EBITDA components, including: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 2) Material transaction costs including: goodwill impairment, asset impairment, gain on lease modification, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease cost, acquisition costs and other fees, , shelf registration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, earn-out adjustments, , retention costs and restructuring & severance costs from net income. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they are key measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions as well as allow readers to compare the financial results between periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

(PIII) reports a 21% year-over-year revenue growth, exceeding 2023 guidance, with affirmations for 2024. The company anticipates achieving Adjusted EBITDA positive in 2024. Financial results for Q4 2023 show strong performance with total revenue up by 34% and capitated revenue up by 35%. Full-year 2023 results indicate total revenue growth of 21% compared to the previous year, with positive increases in key financial metrics. Despite a net loss, P3 remains optimistic about future growth prospects. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth and the affirmation of the 2024 guidance by P3 Health Partners Inc. signal a robust financial performance that is likely to influence investor sentiment. The company's ability to exceed its revenue guidance suggests operational efficiency and market demand for its services. The growth in capitated revenue, which refers to the fixed amount per member per month paid to a physician or group of physicians by a managed care organization, is particularly noteworthy as it indicates a sustainable revenue stream. This growth, coupled with a significant reduction in net loss from the previous year, may be seen as a positive indicator of the company's turnaround efforts.However, the report also indicates a negative gross profit and an increase in the adjusted EBITDA loss on a PMPM basis, which raises concerns about the company's cost management strategies. While the medical margin has improved, the negative gross profit suggests that the company's direct costs still exceed its revenue, which could be a red flag for investors concerned with profitability. The anticipated achievement of Adjusted EBITDA positivity in 2024 will be a critical milestone for the company's long-term financial health. Healthcare Industry Analyst The healthcare sector, especially value-based care models like those employed by P3, is increasingly competitive and subject to regulatory changes. P3's model, which emphasizes physician-led population health management, is aligned with industry trends towards value-based care, which focuses on patient outcomes rather than volume of services. This approach is gaining traction as it has the potential to reduce healthcare costs while improving quality of care.The company's increase in at-risk membership, which indicates the number of individuals for whom the company assumes financial risk in terms of healthcare costs, is a sign of growing market penetration and trust in P3's healthcare model. However, the reported higher medical expenses due to increased hospital admissions highlight the inherent risks of the capitation model, where unexpected spikes in healthcare utilization can impact profitability.Investors should be aware that P3's performance is likely to be influenced by factors such as policy changes in healthcare reimbursement, the competitive landscape and the company's ability to manage medical costs effectively. The company's guidance for 2024, including the expected increase in medical margin PMPM, suggests confidence in its ability to manage these factors, but the lack of forward-looking guidance for net income due to uncertainties underscores the volatile nature of the healthcare industry. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market implications of P3 Health Partners Inc.'s financial results requires analyzing the company's performance within the context of the population health management market. The company's growth in membership and revenue indicates a favorable response to its services, which can be attributed to the increasing demand for cost-effective healthcare solutions. The market for such services is expanding, with an emphasis on preventative care and chronic disease management, which are key components of population health management.However, the company's negative gross profit and adjusted EBITDA loss indicate that despite revenue growth, profitability remains a challenge. This suggests that while the market opportunity is significant, P3 must continue to optimize its operational efficiency and cost management to capitalize on this potential. The company's anticipation of reaching Adjusted EBITDA positivity in 2024 is an optimistic projection that will require close monitoring by investors, as it will be a important indicator of the company's ability to leverage market growth into sustainable profitability. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Total revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, beating our 2023 guidance Affirming 2024 guidance Anticipates reaching Adjusted EBITDA positive in 2024 Management to Host Conference Call and Webcast March 28, 2024 at 4:30 PM ET HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- P3 Health Partners Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC rules, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA PMPM, medical margin and medical margin PMPM. EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before (i) interest, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the effect of certain expenses, such as (i) mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency reserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense and (iv) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA PMPM is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the number of at-risk members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other similar companies. Medical margin represents the amount earned from capitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted and medical margin PMPM is defined as medical margin divided by the number of at-risk members each month divided by the number of months in the period. Medical claims expenses represent costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. We do not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. The tables at the end of this press release present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA PMPM to net income (loss) PMPM, medical margin to gross profit and medical margin PMPM to gross profit PMPM, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Key Performance Metrics In addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information, the Company also monitors “at-risk members” to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. At-risk membership represents the approximate number of Medicare members for whom we receive a fixed percentage of premium under capitation arrangements as of the end of a particular period.

Despite a net loss of $13.0 million for Q4 and $61.6 million for the year, the company saw positive achievements in the Wave program and customer base expansion. Positive Successful completion of Wave system integration and advancement in antibiotic susceptibility testing. Net sales of $3.0 million for Q4 and $12.1 million for the year, with a decline in instrument sales offset by consumable product revenue increase. Gross margin of 21% for Q4 and the year, impacted by manufacturing costs inflation. Reduction in SG&A and R&D costs for Q4 and the year due to lower employee-related expenses. Net loss of $13.0 million for Q4 and $61.6 million for the year. Cash used in Q4 was $7.9 million, reflecting reduced operating cash use. Secured 65% of U.S. Pheno customers to multi-year contracts for rapid susceptibility testing. GAAP net loss of $61.6 million for the year, resulting in $4.94 net loss per share. Cash used for the year was $46.3 million, including debt restructuring expenses. Use of non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and trends. Negative Net loss of $13.0 million for Q4 and $61.6 million for the year. Decline in gross margin to 21% for the year, impacted by inventory write-down and inflation in manufacturing costs.

Cash used for the year was $46.3 million, including debt restructuring expenses. Market Research Analyst The report by Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. highlights a year of strategic advancements despite a static net sales figure for the quarter and a slight decline in annual revenue. The company's focus on developing the Accelerate Wave™ system and securing customer contracts for their Pheno product shows a commitment to innovation and customer retention in the medical diagnostics field.From a market perspective, the unchanged quarterly sales coupled with a decrease in annual revenue could raise concerns about growth potential. However, the increase in consumables revenue suggests a steady demand for the company's products, which is a positive indicator. The market will likely monitor the company's ability to convert interest in the Accelerate Wave system into tangible sales upon its launch.The reported decrease in SG&A and R&D costs due to lower employee-related expenses may be seen as a cost optimization effort, which could improve the company's bottom line in the long run. However, investors might view the reduction in gross margin, primarily due to inflation and inventory write-downs, as a challenge that needs to be managed carefully to maintain profitability. Financial Analyst Accelerate Diagnostics' financials reveal a strategic reduction in operating expenses, which includes a significant cut in SG&A costs. This is likely a response to the flat sales figures and is indicative of a company actively managing its cash flow in a challenging sales environment. The decline in gross margin points to external pressures such as inflation, which is a concern shared across various sectors.Investors should note the company's net loss figures, which remain substantial. While the net loss per share has decreased, reflecting a tighter control on expenses, the company's continued investments in R&D for the Accelerate Wave system suggest a focus on long-term growth over immediate profitability. The cash position at year-end, although impacted by debt restructuring, provides a cushion for ongoing operations and development activities.The non-GAAP financial measures, excluding stock-based compensation, offer an alternative view of the company's financial health. While these measures are not a substitute for GAAP figures, they can provide insights into the company's core operational efficiency and should be considered alongside standard financial metrics. Medical Research Analyst The development of the Accelerate Wave system represents a significant advancement in the field of rapid Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST). The company's progress towards FDA submission for the Accelerate Arc™ system and the initiation of clinical trials for Accelerate Wave in the second quarter of 2024 are key milestones that could have a substantial impact on the industry.The medical diagnostics sector is highly competitive and the successful implementation of new technologies like Accelerate Wave can potentially disrupt current standards. The ability to deliver results in under 4.5 hours for a wide range of bug-drug combinations is noteworthy and could lead to improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiencies.However, the adoption of new technologies in healthcare is often met with regulatory and market-based hurdles. The company's collaboration with Bruker Corporation and the positive feedback from customer reviews are promising, but actual market adoption rates post-launch will be critical to assess the impact on the company's financial performance. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM TUCSON, Ariz., March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXDX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. ""In 2023, we made significant progress with the development of our next-generation rapid Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing system, Accelerate Wave™. We continue to advance this important development program and believe that we remain on plan to begin our clinical trials in the second quarter of 2024,"" commented Jack Phillips, President and CEO of Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. ""In addition, we continue to expand and secure our Accelerate Pheno® customer base, with an upgrade path to Wave adoption. Based on consistent customer feedback, Accelerate Wave is anticipated to set the new standard for rapid, same-shift, susceptibility testing,"" Mr. Phillips continued. 2023 Fourth Quarter Results Notable Wave program achievements during the quarter included:Completed Wave system integration. Significantly advanced antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) performance of gram-negative positive blood culture menu for approximately 200 bug-drug combinations and running approximately 5,000 unique strains of gram-negative organisms with average time-to-results below 4.5 hours.Completed extensive reviews with U.S. and EMEA customers to validate Wave's product specifications and menu roll-out strategy. Approximately 90% of customers have expressed interest in adopting Accelerate Wave for both rapid positive blood culture and isolated colony testing given unique perceived benefits compared to existing and emerging automated susceptibility platforms.In the United States, added six new contracted Pheno instruments during the quarter, ending the quarter with 340 clinically live Pheno revenue-generating instruments and another 71 contracted Pheno instruments in the process of being implemented.Executed a collaboration and quality agreement with Bruker Corporation for the Accelerate Arc™ system, made significant progress towards completing U.S. clinical trials and anticipate submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the first quarter of 2024.Net sales for the quarter were $3.0 million, compared to $3.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Sales for the quarter included a decrease in instrument sales of 11% over the same quarter of the prior year driven by the timing and number of contracts in the funnel, while revenues from consumable products increased by 9% compared to the same period in the prior year.Gross margin was approximately 21% for the quarter, compared to approximately 28% for the same quarter of the prior year. The decline in gross margins resulted from inflation in manufacturing related costs and other factors.Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs for the quarter were $5.8 million, compared to $8.8 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The decline in SG&A costs is a result of lower employee-related expenses. SG&A costs include non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the same periods. Research and development (R&D) costs for the quarter were $5.6 million, compared to $6.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The decline in R&D costs is a result of lower employee-related expenses as well as lower third-party development costs for our next generation susceptibility instrument Accelerate Wave. R&D costs include non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the same periods. Net loss was $13.0 million for the quarter, resulting in $0.89 net loss per share.Cash used in the fourth quarter was $7.9 million. This reflects a continued reduction in operating cash use over the prior quarters of 2023, following cost cutting measures implemented throughout the year.2023 Full Year Results Secured approximately 65% of current U.S. Pheno customers to multi-year contracts for rapid susceptibility testing, reflecting customers' commitment to Accelerate rapid AST technology and interest in Wave.Net Sales were $12.1 million for the year, compared to $12.8 million in the prior year. While year-over-year revenues for consumable products increased by approximately 5%, overall annual revenue was down year-over-year due to a challenging capital sales environment in all our sales regions.Gross margin was approximately 21% for the year, compared to approximately 26% for the prior year. The overall decline in gross margin primarily resulted from a $1.2 million inventory write-down of excess inventory during the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin for the year, excluding inventory write-down and non-cash equity-based compensation was approximately 33%.Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs were $31.2 million for the year, compared to $39.2 million for the prior year. The decline in SG&A costs is a result of lower employee-related expenses during the year. SG&A costs include non-cash stock-based compensation of $3.7 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for the same periods. Research and development (R&D) costs were $25.4 million for the year, compared to $26.9 million for the prior year. The decline in R&D costs is a result of lower employee-related expenses as well as lower third-party development for our next-generation rapid AST system, Accelerate Wave. R&D costs include non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the same periods. GAAP net loss was $61.6 million for the year, resulting in $4.94 net loss per share.Cash used for the year was $46.3 million, which includes approximately $8 million of debt restructuring related expenses. Ended the year with total cash, investments, and cash equivalents of $13.2 million.Full financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 will be filed on Form 10-K through the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) website at http://www.sec.gov.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains certain financial measures that are not recognized measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), which include SG&A, R&D, and operating income (loss) amounts excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Our management and board of directors use expenses excluding the cost of stock-based compensation and certain impairment transactions to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operating and financing plans. Accordingly, we believe that expenses excluding the cost of stock-based compensation and certain impairment transactions provides useful information for investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors. Expenses excluding the cost of stock-based compensation and certain impairment transactions is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, SG&A expenses, R&D expenses, and operating income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP.

(CURV) announces positive financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023, with net sales exceeding guidance. Despite a decrease in sales, the company shows improvements in gross profit margins and adjusted EBITDA. The CEO highlights strategic initiatives for future growth and cash flow generation. Positive Exceeded Q4 guidance with net sales of $293.5 million. Gross profit margin increased to 34.5% driven by improved product margins. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $16.4 million, showing a 250-bps improvement. Net loss of $4.1 million in Q4, compared to $3.8 million in the previous year. Full-year net sales decreased by 10.6% to $1,151.9 million. Net income for the full year was $11.6 million, down from $50.2 million in the previous year.

Significant decrease in net income for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decline for the full year compared to the previous year. Potential impact of macroeconomic challenges and higher labor costs on future financial performance. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ruling may affect profitability. Financial Analyst The report from Torrid Holdings Inc. reveals a mix of positive and negative financial indicators. On one hand, the company managed to exceed its fourth-quarter guidance, which is a sign of operational efficiency and could be seen as a positive signal to investors. The improvement in gross profit margin, notably a 250-bps increase, is significant as it suggests better cost management and potentially higher profitability per item sold. However, the reported net loss of $4.1 million, despite being a relatively small figure, indicates that the company is still facing challenges in achieving net profitability.From a financial perspective, the decrease in net sales year-over-year by 10.6% and the 12% drop in comparable sales are concerning and reflect underlying issues in customer retention or market competition. The store expansion strategy, with 36 new stores opened and 20 closed, suggests an aggressive growth plan, but this needs to be weighed against the backdrop of declining sales. The company's liquidity position, with $12.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and a total liquidity of $114.8 million, provides some cushion, but the cash flow from operations shows a decrease, which could impact future investments and operations.Looking ahead, the fiscal 2024 guidance anticipates stable adjusted EBITDA figures and a slight decrease in net sales, which could be interpreted as cautious optimism amidst macroeconomic challenges and higher labor costs. This outlook, combined with the potential impact of new regulations on credit card fees, adds an element of uncertainty for investors. Retail Industry Analyst The retail sector, particularly in apparel, is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer trends and economic conditions. Torrid's focus on the plus-size market is a strategic attempt to target a specific customer segment, but the reported 9% decrease in comparable sales for the fourth quarter suggests that the company is not fully capitalizing on this niche. The improvement in gross profit margin, however, indicates that Torrid's efforts in enhancing its assortment and reducing inventory levels may be resonating with customers to some extent.The strategic initiative to open new stores while closing underperforming ones is a common practice in the retail industry, aimed at optimizing the store footprint. However, the effectiveness of this strategy must be monitored closely, as opening new stores incurs significant costs and the benefits may not be immediately realized, especially in a declining sales environment.The company's investments in infrastructure and technology, as indicated by the capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2024, are essential for staying competitive in the digital age. These investments could improve the customer experience and operational efficiency, but the payoff needs to be balanced against the capital outlay and the current financial performance. Market Research Analyst Understanding consumer behavior and market trends is important for retailers like Torrid. The decline in comparable sales points to a potential shift in consumer preferences or increased competition. It's essential to analyze whether Torrid's assortments and marketing strategies are aligned with current fashion trends and customer expectations. The company's focus on enhancing its assortment and optimizing marketing investments is a step in the right direction, but it needs to translate into positive sales growth.Additionally, the macroeconomic challenges mentioned in the outlook, including higher labor costs, are industry-wide concerns that could affect consumer spending power and retail margins. The company's anticipation of these challenges in its guidance suggests a realistic approach to planning. However, it's important for Torrid to remain agile and adapt its strategies in response to any economic downturns or shifts in consumer spending habits.The reference to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ruling indicates regulatory risks that could affect Torrid's financial services, such as its private label credit card agreements. This could have implications for customer loyalty programs and financing options, which are important factors in driving repeat business in the retail sector. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Initiates Fiscal 2024 Guidance Delivered Fourth Quarter Net Sales above guidance Fourth Quarter Net Loss of $4.1 million Exceeded Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA(1) guidance CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Torrid Holdings Inc. (“Torrid” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CURV), a direct-to-consumer apparel, intimates, and accessories brand in North America for women sizes 10 to 30, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended February 3, 2024. Lisa Harper, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In fiscal 2023 we improved the fundamentals of our business by enhancing our assortment while reducing overall inventory levels, improving product costs, and optimizing our marketing investments. We are encouraged by the improving trends in sales and margins as customers responded to our new merchandise collections. For the fourth quarter we delivered results that exceeded our guidance, providing a strong foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on our core strategic initiatives, which we believe will position us to deliver consistent results and generate meaningful cash flow.” Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Net sales decreased 2.6% to $293.5 million compared to $301.3 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Comparable sales(2) decreased 9% in the fourth quarter. Gross profit margin was 34.5% compared to 31.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 250-bps improvement was primarily driven by improved product margins. Net loss of $4.1 million, or ($0.04) per share, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million, or ($0.04) per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $16.4 million, or 5.6% of net sales, compared to $16.4 million, or 5.4% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter, we opened 23 Torrid stores and closed 11 Torrid stores. The total store count at quarter end was 655 stores. Financial Highlights for the Full Year of Fiscal 2023 Net sales decreased 10.6% to $1,151.9 million compared to $1,288.1 million last fiscal year. Comparable sales(2) decreased 12% compared to last fiscal year. Gross profit margin was 35.2% compared to 35.7% last fiscal year. Net Income of $11.6 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to net income of $50.2 million, or $0.48 per share last fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $106.2 million, or 9.2% of net sales, compared to $152.4 million, or 11.8% of net sales, last year. Opened 36 Torrid stores and closed 20 Torrid stores. The total store count at year end was 655 stores. Full Year Fiscal 2023 Financial and Operating Metrics Fiscal Year Ended (in thousands, except net sales per active customer, number of stores and percentages) February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Year over Year Change Net sales $ 1,151,945 $ 1,288,144 (11 )% Comparable sales(A) (12 )% (3 )% Number of stores (as of end of period) 655 639 Net income (loss) $ 11,619 $ 50,209 (77 )% Adjusted EBITDA(B) $ 106,219 $ 152,350 (30 )% (A) Comparable sales in fiscal year 2023 compares sales in fiscal year 2023 to sales in the 53-week period ended February 4, 2023. In fiscal year 2022, comparable sales include results from stores that were temporarily closed due to COVID-19. (B) Please refer to ""Non-GAAP Reconciliation"" below for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2023 totaled $12.1 million. Total liquidity at the end of the year, including available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement, was $114.8 million. Cash flow from operations for the twelve-month period ended February 3, 2024 was $42.8 million, compared to $53.3 million for the twelve-month period ended January 28, 2023. Outlook For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 the Company expects: Net sales between $277 million and $282 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1) between $31 million and $34 million. For the full year fiscal 2024 the Company expects: Net sales between $1.135 billion and $1.155 billion. Adjusted EBITDA(1) between $106 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures between $20 million and $25 million reflecting infrastructure and technology investments as well as between 15 and 20 new stores for the year. The above outlook is based on several assumptions, including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic challenges in the industry in fiscal 2024 as well as higher labor costs. The above outlook does not take into consideration the recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ruling which mandates, among other things, decreases in credit card late fees, and could alter the profitability of our agreements with our private label credit card financing company. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information. Conference Call Details A conference call to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results is scheduled for March 28, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET. Those who wish to participate in the call may do so by dialing (877) 407-9208 or (201) 493-6784 for international callers. The conference call will also be webcast live at https://investors.torrid.com. For those unable to participate, a replay of the conference call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of the call until April 4, 2024. Notes (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures and the accompanying table for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company does not provide reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. (2) Comparable sales for any given period are defined as the sales of Torrid’s e-Commerce operations and stores that it has included in its comparable sales base during that period. The Company includes a store in its comparable sales base after it has been open for 15 full fiscal months. If a store is closed during a fiscal year, it is only included in the computation of comparable sales for the full fiscal months in which it was open. Partial fiscal months are excluded from the computation of comparable sales. Comparable sales in fiscal year 2023 compares sales in fiscal year 2023 to sales in the 53-week period ended February 4, 2023. In fiscal year 2022, comparable sales include results from stores that were temporarily closed due to COVID-19. Comparable sales allow the Company to evaluate how its unified commerce business is performing exclusive of the effects of new store openings. The Company applies current year foreign currency exchange rates to both current year and prior year comparable sales to remove the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and achieve a consistent basis for comparison. About Torrid TORRID is a direct-to-consumer brand of apparel, intimates and accessories in North America aimed at fashionable women who are curvy and wear sizes 10 to 30. TORRID is focused on fit and offers high quality products across a broad assortment that includes tops, bottoms, denim, dresses, intimates, activewear, footwear and accessories. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), management utilizes certain non-GAAP performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, for purposes of evaluating ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP operating measures, when reviewed collectively with our GAAP financial information, provide useful supplemental information to investors in assessing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income (loss) plus interest expense less interest income, net of other expense (income), plus provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), and share-based compensation, non-cash deductions and charges, and other expenses We believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to ongoing operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting the overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis, actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and, as such, use it internally to report and analyze our results and as a benchmark to determine certain non-equity incentive payments made to executives. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. This measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, earnings (loss) per share or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except to the extent required by law.

Historically, we recorded PLCC Funds as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Under the new policy, we record PLCC Funds in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). This reclassification does not have any impact on income from operations, income (loss) before provision for income taxes, net income (loss) or earnings (loss) per share and there was no cumulative effect to stockholders’ deficit or net assets. The recognition of PLCC Funds in net sales is preferable because it will enhance the comparability of our financial statements with those of many of our industry peers and provide greater transparency into performance metrics relevant to our industry by showing the gross impact of the funds received as net sales instead of as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The following tables show this change in presentation which has been retrospectively applied to fiscal year 2022 presented in this earnings release.

Financial Analyst The reaffirmation of BGC Group's outlook for the upcoming quarter suggests a stable financial trajectory, aligning with previous forecasts. This stability is indicative of management's confidence in their business strategy and operational efficiency. Investors can interpret this as a signal of predictable financial performance in the near term, potentially reducing market volatility for BGC's stock. However, it is essential to scrutinize the underlying assumptions of the reaffirmed outlook, as external factors such as market conditions and regulatory changes could influence actual results.Furthermore, the company's reliance on non-GAAP financial measures warrants a careful examination. While these measures can provide a more nuanced view of a company's operational performance by excluding non-recurring or non-cash items, they are not standardized. Investors should consider the limitations of non-GAAP metrics and view them alongside GAAP results to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst The use of equity-based compensation by BGC Group is a strategic move to align employees' interests with those of shareholders, potentially fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and cross-selling. This approach could lead to enhanced revenue growth and a more robust corporate culture. However, the complexity of equity-based compensation and its impact on the company's financials requires investors to analyze the potential dilution effects and the implications for future earnings.It is also important to assess market sentiment and peer performance in the context of BGC's outlook. If competitors are issuing more conservative or aggressive forecasts, this could influence investor perceptions and market positioning. Additionally, BGC's operational strategies and market initiatives should be evaluated to determine their effectiveness in sustaining the projected financial outcomes. Tax Expert BGC Group's approach to calculating its non-GAAP tax provision involves adjustments for equity-based compensation and other select items, which may lead to a lower effective tax rate and increased post-tax Adjusted Earnings. This tax strategy appears to optimize the company's tax obligations, potentially enhancing shareholder value. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the volatility of such tax benefits, as they depend on the fluctuating value of equity-based compensation and the company's ability to utilize tax deductions effectively.Investors should also be aware of the tax implications of BGC's corporate structure, including its entities taxed as partnerships and those subject to local income taxes. The geographical distribution of income and the legal structure of subsidiaries could have significant tax consequences and should be factored into investment decisions. The company's approach to presenting taxes for Adjusted Earnings, aiming to reflect a global corporate tax rate, provides a simplified view but may not capture the complexity of tax liabilities across different jurisdictions. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BGC Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: BGC), today announced that it has updated its outlook for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. Updated OutlookBGC reaffirmed its previously stated outlook ranges for revenue and pre-tax Adjusted Earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The Company's outlook was contained in BGC's financial results press release issued on February 14, 2024, which can be found at http://ir.bgcg.com. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe non-GAAP definitions below include references to certain equity-based compensation instruments, such as restricted stock awards and/or restricted stock units (""RSUs""), that the Company has issued and outstanding following its corporate conversion on July 1, 2023. Although BGC is retaining certain defined terms and references, including references to partnerships or partnership units, for purposes of comparability before and after the corporate conversion, such references may not be applicable following the period ended June 30, 2023. The Company has clarified its practice in an updated definition of its ""Calculation of Non-Compensation Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings"". BGC has not modified any prior period non-GAAP measures related to this clarification. This document contains non-GAAP financial measures that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (""GAAP""). Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company include ""Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes"", which is used interchangeably with ""pre-tax Adjusted Earnings""; ""Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders"", which is used interchangeably with ""post-tax Adjusted Earnings""; ""Adjusted EBITDA""; ""Liquidity""; and ""Constant Currency"". The definitions of these terms are below. Adjusted Earnings DefinedBGC uses non-GAAP financial measures, including ""Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes"" and ""Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders"", which are supplemental measures of operating results used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. BGC believes that Adjusted Earnings best reflect the operating earnings generated by the Company on a consolidated basis and are the earnings which management considers when managing its business. As compared with ""Income (loss) from operations before income taxes"" and ""Net income (loss) for fully diluted shares"", both prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted Earnings calculations primarily exclude certain non-cash items and other expenses that generally do not involve the receipt or outlay of cash by the Company and/or which do not dilute existing stockholders. In addition, Adjusted Earnings calculations exclude certain gains and charges that management believes do not best reflect the underlying operating performance of BGC. Adjusted Earnings is calculated by taking the most comparable GAAP measures and adjusting for certain items with respect to compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, and other income, as discussed below. Calculations of Compensation Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation Line Item for Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDAThe Company's Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA measures exclude all GAAP charges included in the line item ""Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs"" (or ""equity-based compensation"" for purposes of defining the Company's non-GAAP results) as recorded on the Company's GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations and GAAP Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These GAAP equity-based compensation charges reflect the following items: Charges related to amortization of RSUs, restricted stock awards, other equity-based awards, and limited partnership units;Charges with respect to grants of exchangeability, which reflect the right of holders of limited partnership units with no capital accounts, such as LPUs and PSUs, to exchange these units into shares of common stock, or into partnership units with capital accounts, such as HDUs, as well as cash paid with respect to taxes withheld or expected to be owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. The withholding taxes related to the exchange of certain non-exchangeable units without a capital account into either common shares or units with a capital account may be funded by the redemption of preferred units such as PPSUs;Charges with respect to preferred units and RSU tax accounts. Any preferred units and RSU tax accounts would not be included in the Company's fully diluted share count because they cannot be made exchangeable into shares of common stock and are entitled only to a fixed distribution or dividend. Preferred units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of common stock, and RSU tax accounts are granted in connection with the grant of RSUs. The preferred units and RSU tax accounts are granted at ratios designed to cover any withholding taxes expected to be paid. This is an alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares, to pay applicable withholding taxes;GAAP equity-based compensation charges with respect to the grant of an offsetting amount of common stock or partnership units with capital accounts in connection with the redemption of non-exchangeable units, including PSUs and LPUs;Charges related to grants of equity awards, including common stock, RSUs, restricted stock awards or partnership units with capital accounts;Allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs. Such allocations represent the pro-rata portion of post-tax GAAP earnings available to such unit holders; andCharges related to dividend equivalents earned on RSUs and any preferred returns on RSU tax accounts.The amounts of certain quarterly equity-based compensation charges are based upon the Company's estimate of such expected charges during the annual period, as described further below under ""Methodology for Calculating Adjusted Earnings Taxes."" Virtually all of BGC's key executives and producers have equity stakes in the Company and its subsidiaries and generally receive deferred equity as part of their compensation. A significant percentage of BGC's fully diluted shares are owned by its executives, partners and employees. The Company issues RSUs, restricted stock, limited partnership units (prior to July 1, 2023) as well as other forms of equity-based compensation, including grants of exchangeability into shares of common stock (prior to July 1, 2023), to provide liquidity to its employees, to align the interests of its employees and management with those of common stockholders, to help motivate and retain key employees, and to encourage a collaborative culture that drives cross-selling and revenue growth. All share equivalents that are part of the Company's equity-based compensation program, including REUs, PSUs, LPUs, HDUs, and other units that may be made exchangeable into common stock, as well as RSUs (which are recorded using the treasury stock method), are included in the fully diluted share count when issued or at the beginning of the subsequent quarter after the date of grant. Compensation charges are also adjusted for certain other cash and non-cash items. Certain Other Compensation-Related Adjustments for Adjusted EarningsBGC also excludes various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company's underlying performance in a given period from its calculation of Adjusted Earnings. These may include compensation-related items with respect to cost-saving initiatives, such as severance charges incurred in connection with headcount reductions as part of broad restructuring and/or cost savings plans. Calculation of Non-Compensation Adjustments for Adjusted EarningsAdjusted Earnings calculations may also exclude items such as: Non-cash GAAP charges related to the amortization of intangibles with respect to acquisitions;Acquisition related costs;Non-cash GAAP asset impairment charges;Resolutions of litigation, disputes, investigations, or enforcement matters that are generally non-recurring, exceptional, or unusual, or similar items that management believes do not best reflect BGC's underlying operating performance, including related unaffiliated third-party professional fees and expenses; andVarious other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company's underlying performance in a given period, including non-compensation-related charges incurred as part of broad restructuring and/or cost savings plans. Such GAAP items may include charges for professional fees and expenses, exiting leases and/or other long-term contracts as part of cost-saving initiatives, as well as non-cash impairment charges related to assets, goodwill and/or intangible assets created from acquisitions.Calculation of Adjustments for Other (income) losses for Adjusted EarningsAdjusted Earnings calculations also exclude gains from litigation resolution and certain other non-cash, non-dilutive, and/or non-economic items, which may, in some periods, include: Gains or losses on divestitures;Fair value adjustment of investments;Certain other GAAP items, including gains or losses related to BGC's investments accounted for under the equity method; andAny unusual, non-ordinary, or non-recurring gains or losses.Methodology for Calculating Adjusted Earnings TaxesAlthough Adjusted Earnings are calculated on a pre-tax basis, BGC also reports post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders. The Company defines post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders as pre-tax Adjusted Earnings reduced by the non-GAAP tax provision described below and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for Adjusted Earnings. The Company calculates its tax provision for post-tax Adjusted Earnings using an annual estimate similar to how it accounts for its income tax provision under GAAP. To calculate the quarterly tax provision under GAAP, BGC estimates its full fiscal year GAAP income (loss) from operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and the expected inclusions and deductions for income tax purposes, including expected equity-based compensation during the annual period. The resulting annualized tax rate is applied to BGC's quarterly GAAP income (loss) from operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. At the end of the annual period, the Company updates its estimate to reflect the actual tax amounts owed for the period. To determine the non-GAAP tax provision, BGC first adjusts pre-tax Adjusted Earnings by recognizing any, and only, amounts for which a tax deduction applies under applicable law. The amounts include charges with respect to equity-based compensation; certain charges related to employee loan forgiveness; certain net operating loss carryforwards when taken for statutory purposes; and certain charges related to tax goodwill amortization. These adjustments may also reflect timing and measurement differences, including treatment of employee loans; changes in the value of units between the dates of grants of exchangeability and the date of actual unit exchange; changes in the value of RSUs and/or restricted stock awards between the date of grant and the date the award vests; variations in the value of certain deferred tax assets; and liabilities and the different timing of permitted deductions for tax under GAAP and statutory tax requirements. After application of these adjustments, the result is the Company's taxable income for its pre-tax Adjusted Earnings, to which BGC then applies the statutory tax rates to determine its non-GAAP tax provision. BGC views the effective tax rate on pre-tax Adjusted Earnings as equal to the amount of its non-GAAP tax provision divided by the amount of pre-tax Adjusted Earnings. Generally, the most significant factor affecting this non-GAAP tax provision is the amount of charges relating to equity-based compensation. Because the charges relating to equity-based compensation are deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws, increases in such charges have the effect of lowering the Company's non-GAAP effective tax rate and thereby increasing its post-tax Adjusted Earnings. BGC incurs income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (""UBT"") in New York City. Any U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the unit holders rather than with the partnership entity. The Company's consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., BGC operates principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes. For these reasons, taxes for Adjusted Earnings are expected to be presented to show the tax provision the consolidated Company would expect to pay if 100% of earnings were taxed at global corporate rates. Calculations of Pre- and Post-Tax Adjusted Earnings per ShareBGC's pre- and post-tax Adjusted Earnings per share calculations assume either that: The fully diluted share count includes the shares related to any dilutive instruments, but excludes the associated expense, net of tax, when the impact would be dilutive; orThe fully diluted share count excludes the shares related to these instruments, but includes the associated expense, net of tax, when the impact would be anti-dilutive.The share count for Adjusted Earnings excludes certain shares and share equivalents expected to be issued in future periods but not yet eligible to receive dividends and/or distributions. Each quarter, the dividend payable to BGC's stockholders, if any, is expected to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors with reference to a number of factors. The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by the Company will be at the discretion of its Board of Directors using the fully diluted share count. For more information on any share count adjustments, see the table titled ""Fully Diluted Weighted-Average Share Count under GAAP and for Adjusted Earnings"" in the Company's most recent financial results press release. Management Rationale for Using Adjusted EarningsBGC's calculation of Adjusted Earnings excludes the items discussed above because they are either non-cash in nature, because the anticipated benefits from the expenditures are not expected to be fully realized until future periods, or because the Company views results excluding these items as a better reflection of the underlying performance of BGC's ongoing operations. Management uses Adjusted Earnings in part to help it evaluate, among other things, the overall performance of the Company's business and to make decisions with respect to the Company's operations. The term ""Adjusted Earnings"" should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). The Company views Adjusted Earnings as a metric that is not indicative of liquidity, or the cash available to fund its operations, but rather as a performance measure. Pre- and post-tax Adjusted Earnings, as well as related measures, are not intended to replace the Company's presentation of its GAAP financial results. However, management believes that these measures help provide investors with a clearer understanding of BGC's financial performance and offer useful information to both management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the GAAP and Adjusted Earnings measures of financial performance should be considered together. For more information regarding Adjusted Earnings, see the sections of this document and/or in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Reconciliation of GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations before Income Taxes to Adjusted Earnings and GAAP Fully Diluted EPS to Post-Tax Adjusted EPS"", including the related footnotes, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA DefinedBGC also provides an additional non-GAAP financial performance measure, ""Adjusted EBITDA"", which it defines as GAAP ""Net income (loss) available to common stockholders"", adjusted to add back the following items: Provision (benefit) for income taxes;Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries;Interest expense;Fixed asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization;Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs;Impairment of long-lived assets;(Gains) losses on equity method investments; andCertain other non-cash GAAP items, such as non-cash charges of amortized rents.The Company's management believes that its Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful in evaluating BGC's operating performance, because the calculation of this measure generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, the Company's management uses this measure to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. BGC believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of the Company's financial results and operations. Since BGC's Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, investors should use this measure in addition to GAAP measures of net income when analyzing BGC's operating performance. Because not all companies use identical EBITDA calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow or GAAP cash flow from operations because the Company's Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements, such as tax and debt service payments. For more information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, see the section of this document and/or in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA"", including the footnotes to the same, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP. Timing of Outlook for Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP ItemsBGC anticipates providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP revenues and for certain non-GAAP measures from time to time. However, the Company does not anticipate providing an outlook for other GAAP results. This is because certain GAAP items, which are excluded from Adjusted Earnings and/or Adjusted EBITDA, are difficult to forecast with precision before the end of each period. The Company therefore believes that it is not possible for it to have the required information necessary to forecast GAAP results or to quantitatively reconcile GAAP forecasts to non-GAAP forecasts with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The relevant items that are difficult to predict on a quarterly and/or annual basis with precision and may materially impact the Company's GAAP results include, but are not limited, to the following: Certain equity-based compensation charges that may be determined at the discretion of management throughout and up to the period-end;Unusual, non-ordinary, or non-recurring items;The impact of gains or losses on certain marketable securities, as well as any gains or losses related to associated mark-to- market movements and/or hedging. These items are calculated using period-end closing prices;Non-cash asset impairment charges, which are calculated and analyzed based on the period-end values of the underlying assets. These amounts may not be known until after period-end; andAcquisitions, dispositions, and/or resolutions of litigation, disputes, investigations, or enforcement matters, or similar items, which are fluid and unpredictable in nature.Liquidity DefinedBGC may also use a non-GAAP measure called ""liquidity"". The Company considers liquidity to be comprised of the sum of cash and cash equivalents, reverse repurchase agreements (if any), financial instruments owned, at fair value, less securities lent out in securities loaned transactions and repurchase agreements (if any). The Company considers liquidity to be an important metric for determining the amount of cash that is available or that could be readily available to the Company on short notice. For more information regarding Liquidity, see the section of this document and/or in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Liquidity Analysis"", including any footnotes to the same, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP. Constant Currency DefinedBGC generates a significant amount of its revenues in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, particularly in the euro and pound sterling. In order to present a better comparison of the Company's revenues during the period, which exhibited highly volatile foreign exchange movements, BGC provides revenues year-over-year comparisons on a ""Constant Currency"" basis. BGC uses a Constant Currency financial metric to provide a better comparison of the Company's underlying operating performance by eliminating the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations between comparative periods. Since BGC's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies have an impact on the Company's GAAP results. The Company's Constant Currency metric, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine the Company's comparative prior period revenues, apply to the current period revenues. Constant Currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current quarter non-GAAP Constant Currency revenues over prior period revenues. Non-GAAP Constant Currency revenues are total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and are calculated by remeasuring and/or translating current quarter revenues using prior period exchange rates. BGC presents certain non-GAAP Constant Currency percentage changes in Constant Currency revenues as a supplementary measure because it facilitates the comparison of the Company's core operating results. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. About BGC Group, Inc.BGC Group, Inc.

The portfolio includes 48 properties with an average price of $332 per sq ft, generating a 4.7% initial cash yield and 5.6% stabilized cash yield. The investments were funded through senior note offerings and cash on hand, strengthening the company's position in the high-demand industrial market. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The acquisition by Rexford Industrial of 3 million square feet of industrial properties from Blackstone Real Estate represents a significant expansion in the Southern California industrial market. Given that the area is known for high barriers to entry and limited supply, the strategic move to secure such a large and well-leased portfolio at an average of $332 per square foot could signal confidence in the region's industrial real estate market stability and growth potential.From an investment perspective, the anticipated initial unlevered cash yield of 4.7% and the stabilized unlevered cash yield of 5.6% are key figures. These yields are in line with the industry's current expectations for industrial real estate investments, reflecting a balanced risk-reward scenario for Rexford Industrial. The funding of the acquisition through exchangeable senior note offerings and cash on hand shows a strategic use of capital, likely aimed at maintaining a solid balance sheet while pursuing growth. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the deal between Rexford Industrial and Blackstone underscores the ongoing demand for industrial properties, particularly in logistics-heavy regions like Southern California. With a 98% leased portfolio, the transaction not only boosts Rexford's asset base but also enhances its revenue-generating capacity due to the high occupancy rates. This is reflective of the broader trend in the market where logistics and warehousing spaces are at a premium, driven by the e-commerce boom and supply chain reconfiguration post-pandemic.Additionally, the relationship between Rexford and Blackstone and their intention for future collaborations, could indicate a consolidation trend within the industrial real estate sector. This may have ripple effects on market dynamics, potentially influencing property valuations and investment strategies across the industry. Financial Analyst When dissecting the financial health and strategic positioning of Rexford Industrial, the aggregate year-to-date investment figure of $1.4 billion, with a weighted average initial unlevered cash yield of 5.0% and a stabilized yield of 5.7%, provides insight into the company's growth trajectory and operational efficiency. The emphasis on core, infill submarkets could be a hedge against market volatility, as these areas typically maintain high demand due to their proximity to urban centers.For investors, the transaction's scale and the yields associated with it may affect Rexford's stock performance. The company's ability to integrate these assets and realize the projected cash flows will be critical in evaluating the success of this acquisition. The short-term impact on the stock market could reflect investor sentiment on the deal's alignment with Rexford's growth strategy and the long-term implications for shareholder value. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.

Financially, operating expenses decreased, leading to a lower net loss compared to the previous year. Positive ENDRA installed the first TAEUS system in the UK at King's College Hospital for clinical evaluation. FDA's review of ENDRA's De Novo request is ongoing, with an in-person meeting confirmed for the second quarter of 2024. The company showcased the TAEUS system at major medical conferences in the U.S. and Europe. ENDRA expanded its intellectual property portfolio with seven additional patents globally. A new ICD-10-CM code was issued for improved NAFLD diagnostics, facilitating standardized billing and promoting consistency in medical documentation and insurance processes. Operating expenses decreased in Q4 2023, resulting in a lower net loss compared to the same period in 2022. Full-year 2023 financial results also showed a decrease in operating expenses and net loss compared to 2022. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, were $2.8 million. Negative None. Medical Technology Analyst The installation of ENDRA Life Sciences' TAEUS system at King's College Hospital for clinical evaluation marks a significant step in the company's efforts to penetrate the UK market and validates the technology's potential in a clinical setting. The comparison of TAEUS liver system's fat assessment accuracy with MRI, the current research standard, could have substantial implications for the company's valuation if the results demonstrate comparable or superior performance. The ongoing FDA review of the De Novo request for the TAEUS liver system is also a critical factor, as FDA approval would open up the lucrative U.S. market for ENDRA's technology. The confirmation of an in-person FDA meeting suggests progress in regulatory discussions, which is a positive sign for investors.The expansion of the intellectual property portfolio, with seven additional patents, indicates a strategic focus on protecting the technology and potentially increasing revenue streams through licensing. The new ICD-10-CM code for NAFLD could enhance the adoption of the TAEUS system by simplifying reimbursement processes for healthcare providers, thereby potentially increasing the demand for ENDRA's diagnostic tool. Financial Analyst ENDRA Life Sciences' reported decrease in operating expenses and net loss for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022, reflects an improved cost structure and operational efficiency. The reduction in research and development expenses could indicate that the company's TAEUS technology has matured to a stage where less investment is required for development, shifting focus towards commercialization efforts.With a net loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from $3.3 million in the same quarter of the previous year and a lower loss per share year-over-year, ENDRA appears to be moving towards a more sustainable financial position. However, the cash and cash equivalents balance of $2.8 million as of December 31, 2023, raises concerns about the company's ability to fund its operations without seeking additional capital, which could lead to dilution for current shareholders. Healthcare Industry Analyst The momentum in the non-invasive liver diagnostics market, as highlighted by the recent FDA approval of the first therapeutic for MASH and updated guidelines for fatty liver screening, positions ENDRA's TAEUS system favorably in an expanding market. The increased awareness and the potential for integration into standard medical practice due to the new ICD-10-CM code could drive adoption rates.ENDRA's strategic engagement at key medical conferences and the hosting of panel discussions with key opinion leaders are important for building credibility and awareness among potential customers. The expected activation of other clinical evaluation sites in Europe and North America should provide additional data to support the TAEUS system's efficacy and assist in the commercialization process. However, the success of these efforts will ultimately depend on the clinical study outcomes and the ability to demonstrate clear advantages over existing diagnostic methods. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today ANN ARBOR, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ENDRA Life Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: NDRA), a pioneer of Thermo Acoustic Enhanced UltraSound (TAEUS®), today reports financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and provides a business update. Highlights from the fourth quarter of 2023 and recent weeks include: Installed first TAEUS system in the UK at King’s College Hospital for clinical evaluation. King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (KCH) in London is one of the leading centers of excellence in the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS). KCH will use ENDRA's TAEUS liver system in a clinical study to compare its liver fat assessment accuracy with MRI, the acknowledged research standard. This study is expected to include approximately 75 subjects and is intended to provide essential data to evaluate the TAEUS technology's performance. FDA’s review of ENDRA's De Novo request is ongoing. In the third quarter of 2023, ENDRA submitted a De Novo request for its TAEUS liver system to the FDA. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDA issued an Additional Information (AI) request to ENDRA. As a result, ENDRA has had several interactions with and provided additional details to the FDA. These efforts have fostered a better understanding of the FDA’s expectations, which ENDRA is working to achieve. ENDRA has confirmed an in-person FDA meeting in the second quarter of 2024. Showcased the TAEUS system at key hepatology, endocrinology and radiology medical conferences in the U.S. and Europe. During the fourth quarter and recent weeks, the ENDRA team met with prospective customers, industry leaders and key partners at four major clinical conferences, including The Liver Meeting by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. During The Liver Meeting. ENDRA also hosted an offsite panel discussion with multidisciplinary key opinion leaders in the fields of hepatology, endocrinology and radiology to share their unique perspectives on managing Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). Expanded intellectual property portfolio to 75 issued patents globally. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and recent weeks, ENDRA was issued seven additional patents, including three in the U.S., one in Europe and three in China. The company is actively exploring licensing opportunities in non-core indications to augment the value of its growing intellectual property portfolio. New ICD-10-CM code issued, which paves the way for improved NAFLD diagnostics. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), a global coding system used to indicate a diagnosis for reimbursement purposes and issued by the World Health Organization, included NAFLD under the ICD-10 K76.0 code. This facilitates standardized billing for the diagnosis of NAFLD, is applicable across the U.S., Europe and other regions, and promotes consistency in medical documentation and insurance processes. ENDRA believes the issuance of the ICD-10 K76.0 code specifically for NAFLD measurement represents a significant opportunity for innovation in liver health diagnostics as healthcare providers now have a clearer pathway to integrate advanced diagnostic technologies, including the TAEUS system. ""With the first therapeutic to treat MASH recently approved by the FDA, updated guidelines that include the screening of fatty liver in adults with type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes and obesity, and new codes that aid reimbursement, there is accelerating momentum in the marketplace for a non-invasive diagnostic tool to assess liver fat like the TAEUS system,” said Francois Michelon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ENDRA. ""We continue to collaborate with the FDA and look forward to advancing the regulatory process. In addition, we continue to drive commercial efforts to build awareness of the TAEUS system in Europe. After the recent installation in the UK, we expect the activation of other clinical evaluation sites in Europe and North America this year to bolster data collection and gain traction with potential customers in each of these regions.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.5 million, compared with $3.3 million in the fourth quarter in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower research and development and general and administrative expenses. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.3 million, or $1.04 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Operating expenses in 2023 were $10.5 million, compared with $13.2 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower research and development and sales and marketing expenses. Net loss in 2023 was $10.1 million, or $1.58 per share, compared with a net loss of $13.2 million, or $4.56 per share, in 2022. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 million as of December 31, 2023.

Positive Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. (RKDA) has achieved a second consecutive year of gross profit growth. The company's SG&A expenses have decreased to the lowest levels since 2019. GoodWheat products are now available in more than 3,500 stores and have expanded into new categories like pancake/waffle mixes and mac & cheese. In the fourth quarter of 2023, total revenues increased by 57% compared to the same period in 2022. Operating expenses decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to an improvement in net loss for the quarter. Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. is exploring strategic opportunities with Lake Street Capital Markets to maximize shareholder value. Negative Total revenues decreased by 28% for the full year of 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. There was a net loss of $14.0 million attributable to common stockholders for the full year of 2023. The company experienced a $821,000 net loss from discontinued body care brands in 2023. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results from Arcadia Biosciences indicate a mixed performance, with a notable 57% increase in quarterly revenues, yet an overall annual revenue decline of 28%. This growth in the final quarter is a positive signal, potentially reflecting successful product launches and market penetration. However, the annual revenue drop requires further analysis to understand the underlying causes, such as market demand shifts or operational challenges.Cost management appears to be a strong point for the company, with total operating expenses decreasing by 10% annually, which includes a significant reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. This disciplined approach to cost control can be seen as a strategic move to improve the company's financial health and work towards profitability.Expansion into new product categories, such as the 'better-for-you' segment with GoodWheat pancake/waffle mixes and mac & cheese, is an attempt to capture a growing consumer trend towards health-conscious food options. The 'Heart Healthy' certification for GoodWheat pasta by the American Heart Association could enhance brand credibility and consumer trust, potentially leading to increased sales. Financial Analyst The reduction in net loss attributable to common stockholders, improving by 9% year-over-year, is a positive development for Arcadia Biosciences' investors. The earnings per share improvement from a loss of $25.65 to $11.30 reflects better control over expenses and possibly a more focused business strategy after discontinuing the CBD body care brands.However, the company's operational performance, with a net loss from continuing operations, signals that despite cost-cutting measures, the path to profitability is still challenging. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to translate product innovations and market expansions into sustainable revenue growth. The strategic review process initiated with Lake Street Capital Markets could result in various outcomes, including acquisitions or mergers, which may significantly impact the company's future financial health and stock performance. Nutrition Industry Expert Arcadia's pivot towards health and wellness products aligns with current market trends, where consumers increasingly demand nutritious and convenient food options. The introduction of GoodWheat and Zola coconut water products with health-centric features, such as high fiber content and no added sugars, positions the company favorably in a competitive landscape.The nutrition industry is witnessing a surge in 'functional foods' that offer additional health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Arcadia's GoodWheat products, particularly the high-fiber mac & cheese and pancakes, cater to this demand. The American Heart Association's certification for the pasta line can be leveraged as a marketing tool to differentiate the products in a crowded marketplace.However, the success of these initiatives hinges on consumer acceptance and the company's ability to scale distribution effectively. While the expansion into over 3,500 stores is a testament to the brand's growth, maintaining momentum and capturing significant market share in the 'better-for-you' category will be important for long-term success. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM -- Second continuous year of gross profit growth -- -- Total SG&A expenses declined to the lowest levels since 2019 -- -- GoodWheatTM now in more than 3,500 stores with better-for-you pasta, pancake/waffle mixes and mac & cheese -- DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcadia Biosciences, Inc.® (Nasdaq: RKDA), a producer and marketer of innovative, plant-based health and wellness products, today released its financial and business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. “We are now at the halfway point of Project Greenfield, our three-year strategic plan to unlock the company’s potential and provide a path to profitability, and the results of this focus are unmistakable,” said Stan Jacot, president and CEO. “Arcadia has significantly improved quality of revenues and has now delivered two straight years of gross profit growth for the first time in its history. SG&A expenses have declined for two straight years and are at their lowest level since 2019. “The foundation we have laid over the past two years provides optimism for even stronger results in 2024. GoodWheatTM is now in three categories with pasta, pancakes and mac & cheese, and garnering national attention. Zola® coconut water is leveraging innovation to expand distribution and is anticipating double-digit growth in 2024. We have right sized the organization and streamlined our cost structure in order to extend our runway. And finally, we remain focused on adjacent acquisitions as well as monetizing our IP,” Jacot said. 2023 Key Operating and Business Highlights GoodWheat Expands Into Two New Categories with Better-For-You Pancake and Waffle Mixes, Single-Serve QuikcakesTM and Mac & Cheese. Building on its success with GoodWheat high-fiber pasta, Arcadia launched two new product categories in 2023: pancake/waffle mixes and mac & cheese. Launched in Q3, Arcadia’s pancake and waffle mixes are made with simple ingredients and its proprietary GoodWheat flour, delivering the same delicious taste and texture of regular pancakes with 8-11 times the fiber and 5-7 grams of protein per serving. GoodWheat single-serve Quikcakes, in Buttermilk, Chocolate Chocolate Chip and Confetti flavors, are available nationwide on Amazon, and both Quikcakes and Multi-Serve Pancake & Waffle Mixes, available in Buttermilk, Chocolate Chocolate Chip and Apple Cinnamon flavors, began shipping to retailers in August. Arcadia expanded to a third category with the launch of GoodWheat Mac & Cheese in Q4, a family household staple representing more than $1.1 billion in sales. Better-for-you brands make up nearly 20% of the category and are growing faster than traditional brands. GoodWheat Mac & Cheese packs in the most fiber of any brand in the category, with four times more fiber than the leading brand, as well as 12 grams of protein. One serving of GoodWheat Mac & Cheese has the same fiber as two servings of oatmeal or two and a half servings of broccoli. Available in three varieties – Classic Cheddar, White Cheddar and Three Cheese – GoodWheat Mac & Cheese began shipping to retailers in November 2023, and launched on Amazon in February 2024. GoodWheat Pasta Certified as “Heart Healthy” by American Heart Association (AHA). GoodWheat pasta received the AHA’s Heart-Check certification for all five varieties of its single ingredient noodles. With its high fiber, lower sodium and zero saturated fat, GoodWheat meets the AHA’s stringent standards for a heart-healthy pasta and provides consumers with a better-for-you option that delivers superior nutrition with the taste and texture of traditional pasta. Arcadia Streamlines Operations by Exiting CBD Body Care Brands. As part of its strategy to focus resources on high-opportunity, scalable businesses, Arcadia discontinued its two remaining Body Care brands ProVaultTM and SoulSpringTM in order to concentrate on the more promising GoodWheat and Zola brands. Streamlined operations and organizational changes resulted in operating expense savings of $2 million in 2023 and $3 million to $4 million annually going forward. Arcadia Explores Strategic Opportunities with Lake Street Capital Markets. Arcadia initiated a strategic review process in mid-2023 to explore a range of potential transactions and opportunities focused on maximizing the GoodWheat value proposition and driving long-term shareholder value. As part of this process, the company is exploring strategic options that may include potential acquisition, company sale, merger, business combination, asset sale, joint venture, licensing arrangement, capital raise or other strategic transactions. Recent Highlights Zola Coconut Water Introduces Two New Flavors to Energize Sales. Arcadia has focused on innovation in Zola coconut water with the introduction of two new flavors – pineapple and lime – to add to its original, extra pulp and espresso flavors. Pineapple is the number one coconut water flavor, and Lime is the number one flavor in sparkling water, and both flavors are 100% natural, no sugar added and non-GMO. Launched in the first quarter of 2024, these new flavors are available in 16.9 oz resealable containers and will be placed in new distribution in Q2. GoodWheat Pasta and Pancake Mixes Receive Accolades From Trusted, Independent Testing Outlets. Following GoodWheat pasta’s 2023 recognition from the American Heart Association’s Heart-Check certification and its selection as “Best New Product” by the Retail Dietitians Business Alliance, GoodWheat pasta and pancake mixes received additional accolades from trusted outlets in the first quarter of 2024. Better Homes and Gardens, with 13 million followers across social platforms, recognized GoodWheat pasta in the New Basics category as the “Best Stealthy Healthy Pasta,” with the same flavor as regular pasta but four times the fiber. And Eat This, Not That, a website which has 7 million unique views per month, awarded GoodWheat Quikcakes recognition in two different categories in January: “Best Store-Bought, High-Protein Desserts” and “Best Store-Bought High-Fiber Snacks.” Arcadia Biosciences, Inc.

Revenues Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 57% to $1.2 million compared to the same period in 2022 driven by higher GoodWheat and GLA revenues. Revenues decreased $2.1 million during 2023 compared 2022. Revenues during 2022 included approximately $1.8 million in sales of GoodWheat grain as well as $0.9 million in one-time license revenue related to the sale of Verdeca. Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased $868,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily driven by a decrease in cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2023. Cost of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 included higher inventory write downs. The decrease in SG&A was primarily related to lower employee costs in 2023. Operating expenses decreased $2.1 million during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by a decrease in cost of revenues and SG&A. Cost of revenues in 2022 included grain sold at cost and higher inventory write-downs. The decrease in SG&A was primarily related to lower employee costs in 2023. Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.8 million, or $2.10 per share, a $1.4 million improvement from the $4.2 million, or $6.31 per share, net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by the reduction in operating expenses. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for 2023 was $14.0 million, or $11.30 per share, a $1.4 million improvement from the $15.4 million, or $25.65 per share, net loss for 2022. The improvement in net loss attributable to common stockholders for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the reduction in operating expenses. The impact of the March 2023 financing had a minimal effect during 2023 as a $6.1 million valuation loss was largely offset by a non-cash gain of $6.5 million related to the change in the fair value of the common stock warrant and option liabilities compared to a non-cash gain of $3.2 million during 2022. Additionally, 2023 included a net loss from the discontinued body care brands of $821,000 compared to $4.8 million during 2022.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth, today announced it has signed a multi-year data-license agreement with Carbon Mapper, Inc. to provide hyperspectral core imagery to the non-profit and its partners until 2030. The $20 million agreement is made possible by initial funding led by a major climate philanthropy. Carbon Mapper, Inc. has been a key partner to Planet in developing the Tanager hyperspectral constellation, and this contract extension marks an important step in the continuation of the coalition’s shared mission to help improve understanding of and accelerate reductions in global methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. “Securing this continued partnership with Planet will help Carbon Mapper deliver high resolution methane and CO2 super-emitter data to decision makers around the globe,” said Riley Duren, Carbon Mapper’s Chief Executive Officer. “In particular, this agreement lays the groundwork for further expansion of the constellation of Tanager satellites and the extension of Carbon Mapper’s mission to make methane and CO2 visible in a transparent fashion through our public data portal.” “We are on the verge of being able to precisely characterize facility-scale methane emissions across the globe,” said Mark Keremedjiev, Planet’s Mission Director for the Tanager Hyperspectral Mission. “We believe the Tanager constellation will help enable real action in the fight against climate change and this contract extension with Carbon Mapper ensures our ability to provide uniquely powerful data for the long term.” The first Tanager satellite is planned to launch in 2024 and is designed to capture hyperspectral imagery across the visible and shortwave infrared regions (VSWIR). This contract marks an extension to an existing data-license agreement between Planet and Carbon Mapper. The multi-year extension covers 2026 to 2030. Beyond methane detection and CO2 measurements, Tanager data are planned to address a wide-range of potential use cases across commercial, civil, and defense applications.

Costs reduced to $22.6 million in 2023 from $27.5 million in 2022, with a net loss improvement to $(19.4) million. Recent partnerships with Velociti, WiGL, Identiv, InPlay, and Veea aim to expand into new markets. Key highlights include regulatory approval in Japan, launch of 2W PowerBridge transmitter, and industry standard establishment for AirFuel RF. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Energous Corporation indicate a mixed financial performance. The reduction in year-over-year revenue from $0.9 million to $0.5 million suggests that the company is facing challenges in scaling its business. However, the significant decrease in total costs and expenses from $27.5 million to $22.6 million, including a reduction in R&D and SG&A expenses, reflects a strategic move to control spending. The improvement in net loss from $(26.3) million to $(19.4) million shows some positive impact of these cost-cutting measures, despite the revenue decline.From a cash flow perspective, the company's position with $13.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt provides a cushion for ongoing operations and investments. The gross margin improvement to 41% from a negative 50% in the previous year is a notable turnaround, indicating better cost management relative to the generated revenue. However, investors might be concerned about the sustainability of this margin given the revenue drop.The approval of Energous' 1W WattUp PowerBridge by Japan's regulatory body and the launch of a 2W transmitter are strategic advancements that could potentially open up new market opportunities and drive future revenue growth. The company's focus on improving cash flow and margins in 2024 will be critical for its financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The partnerships announced by Energous with companies such as Velociti, WiGL, Identiv, InPlay and Veea highlight the company's strategic direction towards expanding its presence in the IoT sector. These collaborations are aimed at integrating Energous' wireless power technology into various applications, which could potentially create new revenue streams and market opportunities.Furthermore, the establishment of AirFuel RF as an industry standard for wireless charging, with Energous' involvement, could be a significant endorsement for the company's technology. This standardization may enhance market acceptance and drive adoption across the IoT ecosystem.However, the actual impact of these developments on the company's financials will depend on the speed of market penetration and the scale of adoption. Investors should monitor the progress of these partnerships and the commercialization of the technologies to assess their potential contribution to Energous' revenue growth. Technology Industry Analyst Energous Corporation's advancements in RF-based charging technology, particularly the FCC compliance of WiGL's touchless Wireless Power Transfer product and the approval of its PowerBridge technology in Japan, signal significant technical milestones. The doubling of the energizing capability with the launch of the 2 Watt PowerBridge transmitter is another technological leap that could enhance the value proposition of Energous' offerings.However, the practical application and market adoption of these technologies will be the true test of their impact. The ability to wirelessly power IoT devices over a distance without the need for replaceable batteries or charging cords presents a compelling use case, but it requires widespread ecosystem support and customer buy-in.The company's engagement in the development of the AirFuel RF standard is a strategic move to foster such ecosystem support. Nonetheless, the translation of technical achievements into commercial success is not guaranteed and will depend on Energous' ability to execute its go-to-market strategy effectively. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energous Corporation (NASDAQ: WATT), a leading developer of RF-based charging for wireless power networks, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on recent partnerships and company highlights. 2023 Financial Results 2023 revenue of approximately $0.5 million versus $0.9 million in 2022.

In 2024, we will continue to focus on opportunities to improve cash flow through sales, improving gross margins, and reductions in spending.” 2023 Results Conference Call Energous will host a conference call to discuss full-year financial results, recent progress and prospects for the future.

The progress in the stroke registrational program and the LOI with Québec's MSSS indicate potential growth avenues. However, the sharp decline in Q4 revenue year-over-year, primarily due to the expiration of PTAP and lower sales in Canada, raises questions about current market demand and the company's ability to execute its commercial strategy effectively.Furthermore, the company's decreased operating expenses and reduced net loss indicate a focus on cost containment, which is essential given the reduced revenue. The cash raised through the ATM program appears to provide a temporary cushion, but the sustainability of the company's financial position hinges on successful commercialization and reimbursement outcomes. The significant decrease in net loss per share year-over-year suggests an improvement in financial health, but the company's long-term viability is yet to be determined. Medical Device Market Analyst The neuromodulation market is witnessing growth, driven by technological advancements and an increasing prevalence of neurological disorders. Helius's PoNS device is situated in a niche segment focusing on balance and gait deficits, which could represent a unique value proposition if clinical outcomes are favorable and reimbursement is secured. The partnership with Québec's MSSS for the government-funded initiative could not only bolster the evidence base for PoNS Therapy’s effectiveness but also serve as a model for adoption in other regions or countries.However, the reduced revenue in the latest quarter, despite these strategic developments, indicates that market adoption may be slower than anticipated. The decrease in product sales in Canada, a key market for Helius, could be indicative of saturation or competitive pressures. Investors should monitor the company's ability to convert regulatory and clinical milestones into tangible sales growth, as this will be critical for Helius's success in the competitive medical device landscape. Healthcare Policy Analyst The securing of HCPCS codes from CMS is a strategic milestone for Helius, as it facilitates the path towards Medicare reimbursement. Reimbursement is often a critical factor in the adoption of new medical technologies, as it influences both provider prescribing behaviors and patient access. The company's engagement with CMS to secure Medicare reimbursement by October 2024 is a key area to watch, as it could dramatically influence the product's commercial success.Additionally, the collaborative study with PBC and HTC showing improved RTW outcomes for TBI patients could serve as compelling evidence to support reimbursement cases. The financial impact of such studies cannot be overstated, as they provide the cost-benefit analyses that payers require to justify coverage of new therapies. The alignment with FDA on optimizing the stroke development plan and the initiation of new studies are also positive steps, yet the actual impact on business will depend on the outcomes of these studies and subsequent regulatory decisions. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM -- Company to host call at 4:30pm today -- NEWTOWN, Pa., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:HSDT) (“Helius” or the “Company”), a neurotech company focused on delivering a novel therapeutic neuromodulation approach for balance and gait deficits, today announced results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter and Recent Business Updates Secured Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) Level II codes for the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (“PoNS®”) mouthpiece and controller from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), representing a significant step toward reimbursement.Further expanded the registrational program in stroke by adding a second site and initiating an open-label study; reached alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on optimizing the stroke development plan.Signed a letter of intent (“LOI”) with the Québec Ministry of Health and Social Services (“MSSS”) to purchase up to 30 PoNS systems that will be distributed in five separate administrative regions within Québec as part of a government-funded initiative designed to evaluate the effectiveness of PoNS Therapy™ when used by patients suffering the effects of stroke.Released study results from collaborative project between Pacific Blue Cross (“PBC”) and HealthTech Connex (“HTC”), demonstrating that PoNS Therapy can drastically improve return-to-work (“RTW”) outcomes for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (“TBI”).Q4 2023 revenue of $134 thousand, compared to $282 thousand in Q4 2022, primarily attributable to the June 30, 2023 expiration of PTAP in the United States and lower Canada product sales.Total operating expenses of $2.3 million in Q4 2023, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to Q4 2022.Generated $1.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of Company common stock under its At-The-Market (“ATM”) in Q1 2024, extending cash runway into Q3 2024. “We are pleased to have reached a key milestone toward Medicare and broad third-party reimbursement last month when CMS assigned HCPCS codes for the PoNS mouthpiece and controller, effective April 1, 2024. We plan to engage with CMS in the coming months with the objective of securing Medicare reimbursement for the PoNS controller and mouthpiece to be effective as soon as October 1, 2024. In addition, these codes will facilitate our ability to concurrently pursue third-party payer coverage,” said Dane Andreeff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Helius. “Delivering PoNS Therapy to stroke patients suffering from gait and balance deficit is one of our chief goals and I'm proud to report that we’ve made several meaningful strides toward potential U.S. authorization. In recent weeks, we’ve added a second site to our ongoing investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled study, begun enrollment of an open-label study at this same site, and met with the FDA to optimize our overall stroke development plan. We are now targeting an early 2025 regulatory submission with possible commercialization by the end of next year.” “With $1.3 million raised under our ATM program since year end, we now have the cash runway to take us into the third quarter of 2024 as we continue progressing our stroke registrational program and pursuing widespread reimbursement,” concluded Andreeff. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $134 thousand, a decrease of $148 thousand compared to $282 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily attributable to the June 30, 2023 expiration of PTAP in the United States and lower Canada product sales. Cost of revenues was $90 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $150 thousand for the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to decreased revenues. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $44 thousand, compared to gross profit of $132 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2022. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to $1.6 million, compared to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 due primarily to a decrease in compensation related expenses. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to $0.7 million compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting primarily from a decrease in clinical and product development expenses in the current year period. Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to a loss of $2.2 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The basic and diluted net loss per share for the fourth quarter 2023 was $1.47, compared to net loss per share of $8.66 in the fourth quarter 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue for the full year 2023 was $644 thousand, compared to $787 thousand for the full year 2022, due to lower Canada product sales resulting from the prior year inclusion of approximately $120 thousand of revenue recognized in connection with the delivery PoNS devices related to noncash consideration paid in the Company’s acquisition of Heuro. Cost of revenue for the full year 2023 increased $120 thousand to $583 thousand, compared to cost of revenue of $463 thousand for the full year 2022, primarily attributable to fixed overhead costs, including salaries and benefits of employees involved in management of the supply chain and certain production costs. Gross profit for the full year 2023 was $61 thousand, compared to gross profit of $324 thousand for the full year 2022. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the full year 2023 decreased to $9.3 million, compared to $10.6 million for the full year 2022, due primarily to a $0.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation and a $0.6 million decrease in payroll taxes including the $0.5 million Employee Retention Credit claims we filed for the prior eligible periods. Research and development expenses for the full year 2023 decreased to $2.9 million, compared to $4.3 million for the full year 2022, due primarily to decreases in product development expenses and clinical trial activities as we transitioned our focus from product development and clinical trials to U.S. commercialization activities beginning in 2022. Operating loss for the full year 2023 decreased $3.1 million to a loss of $12.4 million, compared to a loss of $15.5 million for the full year 2022. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $8.9 million, compared to $14.1 million for the full year 2022. The basic and diluted net loss per share for the full year 2023 was $14.56 per share, compared to $52.13 per share, for the full year 2022. Cash and Liquidity Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $2.0 million, compared to $2.1 used in operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the results of our continued focus on managing cash burn. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $5.2 million, compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2022. In Q1 2024, the Company generated $1.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock under its ATM program at an average share price of $9.27 per share, extending the cash runway into Q3 2024.

Receiving Fast Track Designation from the FDA for SLS009 in r/r AML, facilitating the drug's development and review process. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The reported 50% response rate in the Phase 2a study of SLS009 for relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (r/r AML) patients is a significant finding, particularly when considering that the targeted response rate was 20%. This suggests a potentially meaningful advancement in the treatment of a disease with high unmet need. Moreover, the 100% response rate in patients with identified biomarkers could indicate a precision medicine approach, enhancing the drug's efficacy in a subset of patients. The implications for SELLAS could be substantial in terms of regulatory approval prospects, market differentiation and the potential for partnership opportunities.However, the true commercial potential of SLS009 will depend on the broader data set from the ongoing trials, including long-term survival rates and quality of life assessments. It is also important to consider the competitive landscape, as other therapies for r/r AML are in development. The financial investment required for continued development and potential commercialization must be weighed against the drug's market potential and competitive positioning. Financial Analyst The financial results of SELLAS Life Sciences Group show a year-over-year increase in R&D expenses, attributed to the advancement of clinical trials, particularly the Phase 3 REGAL study and SLS009 trials. The net loss has decreased compared to the previous year and the loss per share has improved. This could reflect a more effective management of expenses or the progression of their clinical programs towards later stages, potentially reducing uncertainty for investors.Furthermore, the recent capital raises, including the $20.0 million registered direct offering, have bolstered the company's cash position, which is important for supporting ongoing research and development activities. Investors would be interested in the company's burn rate and runway, as these financial injections are vital for sustaining operations without the immediate pressure of additional fundraising. The Fast Track Designation by the FDA for SLS009 could also potentially streamline the development process and reduce time to market, which is a positive indicator for future valuation. Biotech Market Analyst The data from SELLAS Life Sciences regarding SLS009 presents a compelling narrative for the biotech market, particularly in the niche of hematologic malignancies. The positive interim results and Fast Track Designation may lead to increased investor interest and could position SELLAS as a notable player in the oncology space. The impact on the stock market will likely hinge on the outcomes of the upcoming IDMC meeting and interim analysis of the Phase 3 REGAL study.Market analysts will be monitoring the company's ability to maintain momentum, manage cash flow effectively and navigate the regulatory landscape. The partnership with GenFleet Therapeutics for the development of SLS009 in China opens up a significant market and adds a layer of strategic value. It is essential to understand how these developments fit within the broader industry trends, such as the increasing focus on personalized medicine and combination therapies. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced Phase 2a study of SLS009 in r/r AML Showing 50% Response Rate in the Selected Optimal Dose of 30 mg BIW Exceeding the Targeted 20% and 100% Response Rate in Patients with Identified Biomarkers -Completed Enrollment in Phase 3 REGAL Study of Galinpepimut-S in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia; Steering Committee Guided Interim Analysis May Be Imminent; IDMC Scheduled in Late April- Phase 1b/2 Study of SLS009 in Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Patients Ongoing with Top-line Data Expected in First Half 2024 First Patient Dosed in Phase 1b/2 Study of SLS009 in Combination with Brukinsa® (Zanubrutinib, BTK Inhibitor) in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) NEW YORK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SLS) (“SELLAS’’ or the “Company”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “We are off to a strong start this year highlighted by progress in our late-stage pipeline, strong data from Phase 2a study of SLS009 in r/r AML, completing enrollment in Phase 3 REGAL study, positive feedback from the REGAL Steering Committee, and the recent FDA Fast Track Designation granted for SLS009 in r/r AML,” said Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD h.c., President and Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. “The data from the Phase 2a study of SLS009 in r/r AML patients resistant to venetoclax combination therapies achieved 50% response in the selected optimal dose regimen of 30 mg BIW and 100% response rate in patients with identified biomarkers to date. We were pleased to recently announce enrollment completion in the Phase 3 REGAL trial and we eagerly anticipate the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) meeting in late April. We also reported Phase 1 data of SLS009 in AML at ESH demonstrating the first-ever complete response achieved in a relapsed/refractory AML patient through CDK9 inhibition monotherapy. We enter 2024 well-positioned to execute on our goals with the priority of reporting data from the Phase 3 REGAL trial of GPS in AML, additional data from our Phase 2a study of SLS009 in r/r AML, and topline data from the Phase 1b/2 study of SLS009 in PTCL by the end of the second quarter.” Recent Highlights: Completed enrollment in Phase 3 REGAL study: Reached planned enrollment of patients in the United States, Europe, and Asia, in accordance with the predetermined statistical analysis plan. Phase 3 REGAL study in AML: The Steering Committee has reviewed the study as of the March 1, 2024 cutoff date, signaling potentially imminent interim analysis of the ongoing global Phase 3 registrational clinical trial (the REGAL study) of GPS in patients with AML who have achieved complete remission following second-line salvage therapy (CR2 patients). The next IDMC meeting is expected in late April 2024. Reported data from the Phase 2a Study of SLS009 in Relapsed/Refractory AML Patients: A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study as of March 15, 2024, 10 in the 45 mg safety cohort and 11 in the 60 mg cohort (2 x 30 mg twice a week or 60 mg once a week). The response rate of 10% was achieved in the 45 mg (safety cohort), 20% in the 60 mg QW cohort, and 50% response rate in the 60 mg, 2 x 30 mg BIW, the optimal dose level cohort. Additionally, in the patients with identified biomarkers, a 100% response rate was observed to date at the optimal dose level and a 57% response rate across all the levels tested in patients with those biomarkers. The SLS009 aza-ven treatment was well-tolerated and evoked anti-leukemic effects in 67% of patients across all levels dosed. The median survival rate has not been reached in any of the dose levels. The first patient who achieved a complete response continues on the study and remains leukemia-free 9 months post-enrollment. Received $20.0 million of gross proceeds from a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules: On March 19, 2024, announced the closing of a $20.0 million registered direct offering with two institutional investors before deducting placement agent’s fees and related offering expenses. The net proceeds from the offering strengthen the Company’s financial position and will be used for research and development activities, working capital, and general corporate purposes. Presented Phase 1 Data in AML at the 2024 European School of Haematology (ESH): All key study objectives regarding pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and clinical activity were met.

SELLAS had submitted a CMC Briefing Package to the FDA which provided an up-to-date overview of the extensive work completed for the GPS CMC program and commercial manufacturing and regulatory plans. The FDA reviewed this package of data and accompanying questions to the agency and responded with favorable guidance. SLS009: highly selective CDK9 inhibitor The Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with AML and lymphomas was completed in 2023. For patients with AML, SLS009 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no dose limiting toxicities. Anti-tumor activity and clinical responses across dose levels were observed, indicating a broad therapeutic index. Meaningful cell killing activity, defined as ≥50% reduction in blasts in the bone marrow, was observed at several dose levels. A durable complete remission (CR) with no minimal residual disease (MRD) was observed in one patient with AML who had failed prior venetoclax plus azacytidine (aza/ven) therapy. The patient achieved CR three months after the treatment that lasted 8 months and continues to be alive 12 months following commencement of treatment per last follow-up. The recommended Phase 2 dose for patients with AML was established at 60 mg. For the patients with lymphomas, no off-target safety issues were observed at any dose level and responses were observed across dose levels with a 14.7% clinical response rate overall, 35.3% overall disease control rate, and 36.4% clinical response rate for patients with PTCL. The recommended Phase 2 dose for patients with lymphomas was established at 100 mg administered as a once weekly infusion.In the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the dosing of the first patient (45 mg) in an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase 2a study that is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy at two dose levels of SLS009 (once weekly 45 mg or 60 mg) in combination with aza/ven in patients with AML. Enrollment in the 45 mg cohort was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company announced the dosing of the first patients in the 60 mg dose cohort. The patients in the 60 mg dose cohort will be dosed with 60 mg once per week or 30 mg twice per week.Early topline data from the Phase 2a study in patients with AML dosed at the 45 mg level (n=9) include one patient with a CR and significant anti-leukemic effects (≥50% decrease in bone marrow blasts) were observed in five out of six assessable patients with no significant safety issues to date.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase Ib/II open-label, single-arm trial in r/r PTCL which will enroll up to 95 patients to evaluate safety and efficacy and, based on results, may serve as a registrational study.

ASML cautions investors regarding Tutanota LLC’s “mini-tender” offer,2024-03-28T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,ASML Holding NV (ASML) cautions investors about Tutanota 's 'mini-tender' offer to purchase a small fraction of ASML's ordinary shares at a price below market value. ASML advises shareholders to reject the offer due to unfavorable conditions and lack of investor protections.,"ASML cautions investors regarding Tutanota LLC’s “mini-tender” offer Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ASML Holding NV (ASML) cautions investors about Tutanota 's 'mini-tender' offer to purchase a small fraction of ASML's ordinary shares at a price below market value. ASML advises shareholders to reject the offer due to unfavorable conditions and lack of investor protections. Positive None. Negative Tutanota 's 'mini-tender' offer to ASML shareholders is below market value, conditioned on share price exceeding offer price, and lacks investor protections. Mini-tender offers like Tutanota's aim to acquire less than five percent of a company's shares, avoiding SEC disclosure requirements and providing investor safeguards. Financial Analyst The mini-tender offer by Tutanota LLC for ASML's shares is a financial maneuver that warrants scrutiny. Investors should note that such offers are often made below current market value, as is the case with Tutanota's bid of $1,075 per share. The conditional nature of the offer, hinging on the share price exceeding the offer price, poses a risk for shareholders who might lock in a sale at a suboptimal price. It's imperative to consider the liquidity position and the potential impact on share price if a significant number of shares are tendered. The fact that Tutanota expects to extend the offer until the share price exceeds the offer price indicates a speculative strategy that may not align with shareholder interests.Furthermore, the avoidance of SEC disclosure and procedural requirements due to the size of the offer being less than five percent of ASML's shares is a red flag. This lack of transparency can leave shareholders without the full picture, potentially leading to uninformed decision-making. Shareholders should be aware of the implications of tendering their shares under these conditions, including the possibility of losing out on future gains if the share price appreciates post-offer period. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the nature of mini-tender offers like the one presented by Tutanota LLC requires attention to the nuances of securities regulation. Mini-tender offers bypass certain SEC regulations that are designed to protect investors in larger tender offers. This includes detailed disclosure requirements and procedural safeguards. Investors should be cautious and may wish to seek legal counsel before participating in such offers. The recommendation by ASML for shareholders to reject the offer and, if already tendered, to withdraw, is a protective measure that underscores the potential legal complexities and risks involved in mini-tender offers.The legal framework governing these offers is complex and the SEC's previous cautions about mini-tender offers are a testament to their controversial nature. Shareholders should be fully informed of their rights, including the right to withdraw tendered shares and the potential legal ramifications of participating in an offer that may not afford them the same protections as larger, regulated tender offers. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications of Tutanota's mini-tender offer for ASML shares, it's evident that the offer price is a critical factor. The offer being below the current market price suggests that Tutanota is attempting to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. This could potentially undervalue ASML's shares for participating investors. Market trends indicate that such offers can create a temporary distortion in the stock's trading volume and price. It's essential for investors to assess the offer against current market conditions and future growth prospects of ASML.Additionally, the strategy to extend the offer until the market price exceeds the offer price could signal an expectation of market volatility or a forecasted increase in ASML's share value. This tactic might pressure shareholders into tendering their shares prematurely. The historical performance and market position of ASML should be carefully weighed against the terms of the offer. Investors would benefit from considering long-term value creation versus the immediate, albeit uncertain, gain proposed by Tutanota. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM ASML cautions investors regarding Tutanota LLC’s “mini-tender” offer VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands, March 28, 2024 – ASML Holding NV (ASML) today announced that it recently became aware of an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer by Tutanota LLC to purchase up to 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) of ASML’s ordinary shares, nominal value €0.09 per share, representing significantly less than 0.1% of ASML’s ordinary shares, at an offer price of $1,075 net per share. ASML is not associated in any way with Tutanota or its mini-tender offer and recommends that shareholders reject this unsolicited mini-tender offer. Any shareholder considering tendering to the offer should exercise caution, carefully review the Tutanota offer documents, obtain current market quotations for their shares and consult with their broker or financial adviser. ASML recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota’s offer because Tutanota’s offer is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of ASML’s ordinary shares exceeding the offer price on the last trading day before the offer expires and is subject to numerous additional conditions, including Tutanota obtaining financing for the offer. Tutanota also states in its offer documents that it expects to extend the offer for successive periods of up to 180 days until the market price of ASML’s ordinary shares exceeds the offer price. This means that ASML shareholders who tender their shares in the offer would receive a below-market price for their shares if the offer conditions are satisfied and shares are purchased in the offer. According to Tutanota’s offer documents, shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them by following the procedures described in the offer documents. ASML recommends shareholders who have already tendered their shares to consider withdrawing their tendered shares. Tutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than five percent of a company’s outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the SEC that would otherwise apply. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has cautioned investors about these offers, issuing the guidance available at https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsminitend. ASML also strongly encourages brokers, dealers and other market participants to exercise caution and to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. ASML warns investors that the offer does not comply with, and does not offer the protections of, the public offer regulations of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act. Tutanota's offer documents have not been approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the AFM. ASML requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to Tutanota’s mini-tender offer for ASML’s ordinary shares.

The company completed a successful $201 million IPO in January 2024, ensuring cash runway into 2026. Upcoming milestones include proof-of-concept data in 2024 and preclinical data presentation at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting. Positive ArriVent secured Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for furmonertinib, enhancing its development prospects. Successful completion of a $201 million IPO in January 2024 provides the company with a strong financial position. The company's Phase 3 FURVENT trial for furmonertinib is currently enrolling patients globally, showing progress in clinical development. ArriVent's collaboration with InnoCare Pharma for a clinical combination study with furmonertinib and ICP-189 demonstrates strategic partnerships. Presentation of preclinical data at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting showcases the potential of furmonertinib in treating NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and PACC mutations. Negative Net loss increased from $37.0 million in 2022 to $69.3 million in 2023, indicating growing financial challenges. Research and development expenses surged from $30.4 million in 2022 to $64.9 million in 2023, reflecting increased clinical spending. General and administrative expenses rose from $6.5 million in 2022 to $9.7 million in 2023, impacting overall financial performance. Selection of an ADC development candidate is expected to be completed in late 2024 or early 2025, potentially delaying progress. Increased external costs related to operating as a public company may strain financial resources in the long run. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted by the FDA to furmonertinib for first-line treatment of NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is a significant milestone. This status is accorded to drugs that demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The designation can lead to expedited development and review processes, potentially accelerating time to market and providing a competitive advantage.From a clinical perspective, the focus on EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is noteworthy. These mutations are associated with a subset of NSCLC and have historically been difficult to target effectively with current EGFR inhibitors. The development of furmonertinib may represent an advance in precision medicine, offering a new therapeutic option for patients with limited treatments available.The upcoming proof-of-concept data in 2024 will be critical in validating the efficacy and safety profile of furmonertinib. Positive results could not only solidify the drug's clinical prospects but also enhance investor confidence in ArriVent's pipeline and its potential for revenue generation in a market with unmet medical needs. Biotech Financial Analyst ArriVent's successful IPO in January 2024, raising $201 million, is a robust indicator of investor confidence and provides substantial capital to fund ongoing and future clinical trials. The cash runway into 2026 suggests that the company has a secure financial position in the near to mid-term, reducing the immediate need for further financing and dilution of shares.However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks in biotech investing, particularly in clinical-stage companies. The costs associated with the development of furmonertinib are reflected in the increased R&D expenses year-over-year and the net loss has also widened. While these are expected trends in the biotech industry, they underscore the importance of successful clinical trial outcomes for future profitability and sustainability.It is important to monitor the enrollment and progression of the pivotal Phase 3 FURVENT trial, as any delays or negative outcomes could impact the stock price and investor sentiment. Conversely, positive trial results and subsequent regulatory approvals could significantly enhance the company's valuation. Market Research Analyst The landscape of NSCLC treatments is evolving, with a shift towards targeted therapies for specific genetic mutations. Furmonertinib's focus on EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations places ArriVent in a niche but growing segment of the oncology market. The potential market size for this treatment could be substantial, considering the global incidence of lung cancer and the percentage of NSCLC patients with this mutation.ArriVent's collaboration with InnoCare Pharma for the combination study using ICP-189, a SHP2 inhibitor, indicates a strategic approach to combination therapies, which are becoming an industry norm due to their potential for improved patient outcomes. The success of this combination strategy could position ArriVent favorably within the competitive landscape.Investors should consider the broader implications of ArriVent's pipeline developments, such as the selection of an ADC development candidate, on the company's long-term growth prospects. Diversification of the pipeline can mitigate risks associated with the development of a single lead candidate and provide multiple avenues for revenue generation. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Company progresses the development of furmonertinib with a data readout planned for 2024Furmonertinib granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Completed $201 million initial public offering (“IPO”) in January 2024 NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArriVent BioPharma, Inc.

The company received FDA Fast Track Designation for CAN-3110 in Q1 2024. Positive Positive results from ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of CAN-3110 in recurrent high-grade glioma patients. Nearly doubled expected median overall survival to ~12 months after a single dose of CAN-3110. Positive HSV-1 serology linked to improved survival with a median overall survival of 14 months. CAN-3110 received FDA Fast Track Designation for treatment of rHGG in Q1 2024. Collaboration with Batavia Biosciences to accelerate development and production of CAN-3110. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The announcement from Candel Therapeutics regarding their phase 1b clinical trial for CAN-3110, a viral immunotherapy for recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG), presents intriguing data for the medical community and investors alike. With the trial demonstrating a near doubling of median overall survival (mOS) and positive safety profile, this could signify a substantial advancement in the treatment of a notably difficult-to-treat cancer. The FDA's Fast Track Designation, typically granted to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, underscores the potential of CAN-3110 to become a significant player in the oncology market.From a medical research perspective, the use of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) as a vector in cancer treatment is a cutting-edge approach. It leverages the virus's ability to selectively replicate in tumor cells and initiate an immune response. The positive correlation between HSV-1 serology and improved survival is particularly noteworthy, suggesting a possible biomarker for patient selection in future trials. This could lead to more personalized treatment regimens and potentially better outcomes for patients with rHGG. Investors should monitor the progress of CAN-3110, as its success in later-stage trials could disrupt the current treatment paradigm for rHGG and create substantial market opportunities for Candel Therapeutics. Oncology Doctor The treatment landscape for recurrent high-grade glioma is notoriously challenging, with limited options available post-standard of care treatment. As an oncologist, the reported increase in mOS from less than 6-9 months to approximately 12 months and even 14 months in patients with positive HSV-1 serology, represents a beacon of hope for patients. It's important to note that the safety and tolerability of repeated doses are critical factors, as they can significantly affect patient quality of life and treatment adherence.The ongoing monitoring of safety and biomarker data will be essential to understanding the long-term implications of CAN-3110 treatment. The potential for this therapy to not only extend life but also to be administered multiple times without significant toxicity could be a game-changer. It is imperative for clinicians to have new avenues to explore, especially for conditions like rHGG where prognosis is typically poor. The medical community will be eagerly awaiting further data, particularly from the second cohort and future phase 2 trials, to determine the true clinical benefit of CAN-3110. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes and the positive results from Candel Therapeutics' ongoing phase 1b trial of CAN-3110 could have meaningful implications for the company's valuation and stock performance. The mOS improvement and the FDA's Fast Track Designation may lead to increased investor confidence and could potentially attract partnership opportunities or additional funding for further research and development.It's also worth considering the competitive landscape. If CAN-3110 continues to demonstrate efficacy and a favorable safety profile in subsequent trials, it could capture a significant share of the glioma treatment market. The current unmet need for effective treatments in rHGG positions CAN-3110 as a possible front-runner in this niche but critical space. Investors should keep an eye on the progression of the second cohort and the initiation of phase 2 trials, as these will provide more definitive evidence of CAN-3110's commercial potential and its impact on Candel Therapeutics' growth trajectory. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM The first cohort of patients were treated with multiple injections of CAN-3110 in the ongoing phase 1b clinical trial.The serial procedures were well tolerated without observed dose-limiting toxicity.A second cohort is being planned for enrollment in the ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of CAN-3110. NEEDHAM, Mass., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Candel Therapeutics, Inc. (Candel or the Company) (Nasdaq: CADL), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing viral immunotherapies to help patients fight cancer, today announced the presentation of updated data from an ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of its herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) replication-competent viral immunotherapy candidate, CAN-3110, in patients with rHGG that has recurred after standard of care (SoC) treatment. The data were presented today during the 5th Glioblastoma Drug Development Summit in Boston, Massachusetts. “We have recently reported encouraging clinical and biomarker activity data observed after a single dose of CAN-3110 in patients with rHGG. We observed a nearly doubling of the expected median overall survival in this therapy-resistant patient population,” said Francesca Barone, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Candel. “The data presented today further supports that repeated doses of CAN-3110 are feasible and generally well-tolerated in rHGG, potentially further improving the clinical activity of this investigational medicine. Safety and tolerability of both repeated injections and serial biopsies, performed prior to the administration of CAN-3110, will be monitored to gauge disease progression and tissue response to treatment. We look forward to sharing additional biomarker and clinical activity data in the second half of this year.” To date, over 50 patients have been treated with a single dose of CAN-3110 in the phase 1b clinical trial of CAN-3110 in recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG). The investigators observed a nearly doubling of the expected median overall survival (mOS) after a single CAN-3110 injection, achieving a mOS of ~12 months, compared to historical reports of less than 6 to 9 months in this therapy-resistant condition. Positive HSV-1 serology was a predictor of response and was associated with improved survival (mOS in this population reached 14 months). Results from the ongoing phase 1b clinical trial were published in Nature in Q4 2023. CAN-3110 received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track Designation for treatment of rHGG in Q1 2024, based on these data. “Dosing patients with multiple injections represents the next step forward in the development of CAN-3110 for rHGG,” said Paul Peter Tak, MD, PhD, FMedSci, President and CEO of Candel. “The observed data suggest that repeated injections of CAN-3110 are well tolerated, supporting the design of a future phase 2 clinical trial in this indication. We’re excited by our recent progress -- as illustrated by the publication in Nature, CAN-3110’s recent FDA Fast Track designation, and the collaboration with Batavia Biosciences -- to accelerate the development and production of CAN-3110, along with our update presented today. Together, we hope this will help to accelerate the development of a better treatment for patients with high unmet need.” About the phase 1 clinical trial of CAN-3110 in rHGG The clinical trial comprises three arms. In arm A, 41 patients with recurrent HGG received a single intratumoral injection of CAN-3110 (dose ranging from 1x106 plaque forming units (pfu) to 1x1010 pfu), including nine patients with multifocal/multicentric, deep or bilateral tumors associated with poor survival. After observing this regimen was generally well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity, patients in arm B (n=9) received a single dose of cyclophosphamide (24 mg/kg) two days before CAN-3110 injection at doses of 1 x 108 pfu (n=3) and 1 x 109 pfu (n=6). The rationale is based on findings in mouse models, where cyclophosphamide improved viral persistence in injected tumors. In arm C, two cohorts of 12 patients with rHGG will receive up to six injections of CAN-3110 over a four-month period. About CAN-3110 CAN-3110 is a first-in-class, replication-competent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) oncolytic viral immunotherapy candidate designed with dual activity for oncolysis and immune activation in a single therapeutic. Its activity is designed to be conditional to the expression of Nestin in cancer cells. CAN-3110 is being evaluated in a phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in patients with rHGG. In October 2023, the Company announced that Nature published results from this ongoing clinical trial. CAN-3110 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicity reported and CAN-3110 plus prodrug was associated with improved survival. Positive HSV-1 serology was a predictor of response and was associated with improved survival. Increased infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and expansion of the T cell repertoire after treatment were also associated with improved survival. In the clinical trial, the investigators observed a nearly doubling of the expected median overall survival after a single CAN-3110 injection, compared to historical reports of less than 6 to 9 months in this therapy-resistant condition. By comparison, survival in the anti-HSV1 positive patients who received CAN-3110 was more than 14 months. Candel expects to initiate Investigational New Drug-enabling work in a second indication characterized by Nestin expression.

The commitment to the TFF TAC program, based on its Phase 2 study results, signals a potential breakthrough in lung transplant medicine. The decision to explore strategic alternatives for TFF VORI, including partnerships and funding opportunities, indicates a proactive approach to capitalizing on its clinical successes. The financial health of the company, with a cash position of $5.5 million and additional funds from a recent stock offering, is important for sustaining ongoing research and development efforts. However, the reported net loss of $21.2 million, despite being a decrease from the previous year, remains a concern for profitability and long-term viability. Healthcare Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reduction in R&D and G&A expenses for TFF Pharmaceuticals is a positive indicator of improved cost management. The decrease in clinical and preclinical expenses could be attributed to the completion of certain study phases, while the reduction in manufacturing costs suggests potential efficiencies gained in the production process. These cost-saving measures, combined with the strategic focus on the promising TFF TAC program, may enhance the company's financial stability. However, investors should remain cautious as the company's cash reserves, despite the recent capital raise, may not sustain long-term operations without additional funding or revenue streams. The balance between cost control and investment in innovation will be critical for the company's future growth and market position. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The prioritization of the TFF TAC program by TFF Pharmaceuticals reflects a strategic move to target a niche market with significant unmet needs. The lung transplant medicine market presents a substantial opportunity for innovative treatments like TFF TAC, which could lead to a competitive advantage and potential market leadership. The company's decision to seek strategic partnerships and alternative funding sources for the TFF VORI program suggests a strategic allocation of resources towards the most promising avenues for growth. While the company's financial results show a narrowed net loss, the focus on strategic development and potential market capture with TFF TAC could be a pivotal point for future revenue generation and stock performance. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: TFFP) (“the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on its patented Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “Over the last several months, we have made significant progress showing that our Thin Film Freezing technology can be successfully applied, with both TFF TAC and TFF VORI demonstrating the potential to significantly improve the product profiles for two FDA-approved therapies,” said Harlan Weisman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of TFF Pharmaceuticals. “As recently announced, we made the decision to prioritize the clinical development of TFF TAC, and we look forward to continuing work on this exciting program, along with evaluating strategic alternatives for the TFF VORI program. We also look forward to our Late-Breaking Abstract Presentation for TFF TAC at the 44th Annual International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2024 Meeting in mid-April 2024.” Recent Clinical and Corporate Highlights: On March 27, 2024, the Company hosted a conference call and webcast to present new data from the ongoing Phase 2 study of TFF TAC for the prevention of acute rejection in lung transplant, and from the Phase 2 study and the Expanded Access Program (EAP) of TFF VORI for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) infections. For TFF TAC, the Company presented data showing that eight out of eight patients successfully transitioned from oral Tacrolimus to TFF TAC in the Phase 2 study. There has been no evidence of acute rejection, and four out of four patients who completed the 12-week treatment period of the study chose to remain on TFF TAC and proceed to the long-term extension of the trial. TFF TAC continues to demonstrate favorable safety results with no mortality or discontinuations due to adverse events. For TFF VORI, a total of nine patients have enrolled between the Phase 2 study and the EAP. The Company continues to see positive efficacy results, as five of six patients who completed treatment achieved a clinical and mycologic response. Updated data from the Phase 2 study and Expanded Access Program demonstrate that TFF VORI continues to maintain an attractive safety profile with no IPA-related mortality or all-cause mortality. A replay of the call and webcast can be accessed here. In March 2024, the Company announced its intention to prioritize the TFF TAC program based on positive data from the ongoing Phase 2 study, the potential of the product to address a significant unmet need in lung transplant medicine, and the substantial market opportunity. With respect to TFF VORI, the Company announced that it would explore strategic alternatives, including partnering opportunities, collaborations, and government-based funding sources to support its continued development. In January 2024, the Company presented data from the Phase 2 trial of TFF VORI at the Advances Against Aspergillosis & Mucormycosis (AAAM) Conference, which was held from January 25-27, 2024, in Milan, Italy. The data presented at the AAAM Conference were first disclosed by the Company in December 2023.In the fourth quarter 2023, the Company announced the appointment of three new members of its Board of Directors, including Thomas B. King, Catherine Lee, J.D. and Michael Patane, Ph.D. All three members bring significant life sciences experience to their positions.

ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS’ THIN FILM FREEZING (TFF) TECHNOLOGY TFF Pharmaceuticals’ proprietary Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology allows for the transformation of both existing compounds and new chemical entities into dry powder formulations exhibiting unique characteristics and benefits. The TFF process is a particle engineering process designed to generate dry powder particles with advantageous properties for inhalation, as well as parenteral, nasal, oral, topical and ocular routes of administration. The process can be used to engineer powders for direct delivery to the site of need, circumventing challenges of systemic administration and leading to improved bioavailability, faster onset of action, and improved safety and efficacy. The ability to deliver therapies directly to the target organ, such as the lung, allows TFF powders to be administered at lower doses compared to oral drugs, reducing unwanted toxicities and side effects. Laboratory data suggests the aerodynamic properties of the powders created by TFF can deliver as much as 75% of the dose to the deep lung. TFF does not introduce heat, shear stress, or other forces that can damage more complex therapeutic components, such as fragile biologics, and instead enables the reformulation of these materials into easily stored and temperature-stable dry powders, making therapeutics and vaccines more accessible for distribution worldwide. The advantages of TFF can be used to enhance traditional delivery or combined to enable next-generation pharmaceutical products. ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaging patented rapid freezing technology to develop and transform medicines into potent dry powder formulations for better efficacy, safety, and stability. The company’s versatile TFF technology platform has broad applicability to convert most any drug, including vaccines, small and large molecules, and biologics, into an elegant dry powder highly advantageous for inhalation, or for topical delivery to the eyes, nose and the skin. TFF Pharmaceuticals has two lead drug candidates in the clinic: TFF TAC (Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder) and TFF VORI (Voriconazole Inhalation Powder). The Company continues collaborations with a broad array of pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and government partners to revolutionize healthcare around the globe. The TFF Platform is protected by over 170 patents issued or pending in the U.S. and internationally.

Cartesian Therapeutics Announces Approval of Conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Plans to Effect Reverse Stock Split,2024-03-28T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Cartesian Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNAC) announced stockholder approval for the conversion of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock and a 1-for-30 reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will reduce outstanding shares from 165.5 million to 5.5 million, maintaining trading under the symbol 'RNAC'.","Cartesian Therapeutics Announces Approval of Conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Plans to Effect Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Cartesian Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNAC) announced stockholder approval for the conversion of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock and a 1-for-30 reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will reduce outstanding shares from 165.5 million to 5.5 million, maintaining trading under the symbol 'RNAC'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the reverse stock split by Cartesian Therapeutics' shareholders and the subsequent conversion of preferred stock into common stock are strategic financial maneuvers that can influence the company's stock liquidity and market perception. The reverse stock split, in particular, is a move often employed by companies to boost the share price, potentially making it more attractive to investors by maintaining compliance with exchange listing requirements. It's important to note that while the reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, it can sometimes be perceived as a red flag if the underlying motives are to mask a declining share price or if it doesn't align with a broader strategic plan for value creation.From a financial perspective, the reduction in the number of outstanding shares increases the earnings per share (EPS) metric, a key indicator watched by investors. However, this is purely a mathematical outcome and does not reflect an actual improvement in the company's financial performance. Additionally, the conversion of preferred stock into common stock will dilute the current shareholders' stake, but it also indicates that the company is progressing towards a capital structure that could be more appealing to new investors. The conversion terms and the impact on the exercise or conversion prices of outstanding stock options and warrants are important details that stakeholders should examine closely.Overall, the implications of these corporate actions must be monitored over time to assess their effectiveness in improving shareholder value and the company's position in the competitive biotechnology sector. Market Research Analyst Cartesian Therapeutics' decision to conduct a reverse stock split and convert preferred shares into common stock can have implications for the company's brand perception in the market. Reverse stock splits can be a double-edged sword; they can lead to a more manageable and higher stock price, which may be perceived positively if the market views it as a step towards a more stable financial future. Conversely, it can be seen as a cosmetic change if not accompanied by fundamental improvements in the company's operations and financial health.Furthermore, the biotechnology sector is highly sensitive to investor sentiment, which can be swayed by such structural changes. Investors and analysts typically look for consistency in a company's growth trajectory and sudden changes in capital structure can prompt a reevaluation of the company's long-term strategy. The timing and nature of these changes will be closely scrutinized, especially considering the industry's reliance on continuous funding for research and development activities.It is also essential to understand the market's response to the new share structure post-conversion, as it could affect the stock's volatility and trading volume. Monitoring competitor reactions and investor engagement in the weeks following the reverse stock split will provide additional insights into the strategic impact of Cartesian's decisions. Biotech Industry Analyst In the context of the biotechnology industry, where research and development timelines are long and capital-intensive, Cartesian Therapeutics' corporate actions reflect a strategic approach to managing its financial resources and investor relations. The conversion of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock is a notable event, as it suggests a potential preparation for future funding rounds or a simplification of the capital structure to attract investment. This conversion also speaks to the company's confidence in its mRNA cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, signaling progression in its clinical development path that could be nearing key milestones.It is important to analyze the potential impact of these decisions on the company's ability to raise additional capital, as a streamlined equity structure can be more attractive to institutional investors. Additionally, the reverse stock split could be a strategic move to align the company's share price with peer companies in the biotech sector, which often trade at higher prices per share due to the speculative nature of the industry.The biotech sector is driven by innovation and the potential for significant returns on successful therapies. Investors will be interested in how these corporate actions align with Cartesian's pipeline progress and any strategic partnerships or collaborations that may be in the works, which could provide additional context to the company's long-term growth prospects. 03/28/2024 - 04:05 PM Proposals approved at Company’s special meeting of stockholders held March 27, 2024GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cartesian Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNAC) (the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering mRNA cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, today announced results from a special meeting of stockholders held March 27, 2024. During the meeting, Cartesian stockholders approved the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of Cartesian’s Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The conversion of the majority of the shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock will occur automatically on April 8, 2024 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, and the remaining shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock remain subject to beneficial ownership limitations described in Cartesian’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, stockholders voted to approve a reverse stock split of Cartesian’s issued and outstanding common stock. In conjunction with this approval, a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of Cartesian’s outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, will be effective after the closing of trading hours on April 4, 2024. Information Regarding Reverse Stock Split Cartesian’s common stock will begin trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis at the opening of market trading on April 5, 2024. Following the reverse stock split, the Company’s common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “RNAC” with the new CUSIP number 816212302. At the effective time of the reverse split, every 30 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share of the Company’s common stock without any change in the par value per share. Fractional shares will not be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share. The reverse stock split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s relative interest in the Company’s equity securities, except for any adjustments for fractional shares. In addition, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares underlying, and the exercise or conversion prices of, the Company’s outstanding stock options and warrants, and to the number of shares of common stock issuable under the Company’s equity incentive plans, and to the conversion ratio of the Company’s Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock from approximately 165.5 million shares to approximately 5.5 million shares before the automatic conversion of the Company’s Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock, or approximately 17.8 million shares thereafter. The approximately 166.3 thousand shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock that remain subject to beneficial ownership limitations will be convertible into approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock for a total of approximately 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding once converted.

(SCYX) reports positive financial results for 2023, with significant progress in developing SCY-247 and advancing clinical studies. The company ended 2023 with $98.0 million in cash and projects a cash runway of over two years. Phase I initiation for SCY-247 is expected in the second half of 2024, with promising preclinical results against fungal pathogens. Positive SCYNEXIS ended 2023 with $98.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. SCY-247's Phase I initiation is anticipated in the second half of 2024. Positive top-line data from the CARES study aligns with previously disclosed results. SCYNEXIS made significant progress in 2023, monetizing BREXAFEMME® and advancing SCY-247 development. Physician interest in SCYNEXIS's antifungal treatments is growing, with presentations at medical conferences showcasing promising preclinical data. Negative Cost of product revenue increased due to an impairment loss on raw material inventory. Total other expense was $5.5 million for 2023. Net income for 2023 was $67.0 million, compared to a net loss of $62.8 million in the previous year. Financial Analyst The financial results of SCYNEXIS, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023, show a substantial increase in license agreement revenue from $103 thousand in 2022 to $139 million in 2023. This dramatic increase is primarily attributed to the $130.1 million recognized from the GSK License Agreement. The net product revenue from BREXAFEMME, however, decreased from $5.0 million in 2022 to $1.0 million in 2023, which may be a point of concern for investors. The reported impairment loss of $14.6 million due to potential cross-contamination issues indicates a significant operational setback and could impact investor confidence. On the upside, the company's cash position improved, with $98.0 million at the end of 2023 compared to $73.5 million at the end of 2022, suggesting a solid liquidity status and a runway of over two years. This financial stability is important for supporting ongoing R&D efforts and mitigating the impact of increased R&D expenses, which rose by 14% from the previous year. The anticipated $10 million milestone payment from GSK in the first half of 2024 could further strengthen the company's financial position. Medical Research Analyst The progress of SCYNEXIS in advancing its antifungal platform, particularly SCY-247, is poised to address a critical need in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. The positive top line data from the CARES study and the ongoing preclinical work supported by NIH grants underscore the potential of SCY-247 to become a significant player in the antifungal market. The upcoming Phase I initiation in the second half of 2024 marks a key milestone in the drug's development pathway. The efficacy of SCY-247 against a broad range of fungal pathogens, including multi-drug resistant strains, positions the compound as a promising candidate in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. The collaboration with GSK, despite the revised deal terms, still represents a strong endorsement and could accelerate the clinical and regulatory progress of ibrexafungerp. The medical community's increasing awareness and enthusiasm for the fungerp class, as evidenced by presentations at medical conferences, could facilitate future adoption and commercial success. Market Research Analyst The antifungal drug market is witnessing an increasing demand due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance and the limited number of effective treatments available. SCYNEXIS's strategic focus on this area, particularly its next-generation compound SCY-247, aligns with market needs and could capture significant market share if clinical trials prove successful. The decrease in SG&A expenses by 67% reflects a strategic shift in resource allocation, likely prioritizing R&D over commercialization efforts in the short term. This could position the company for long-term growth, as successful R&D outcomes may lead to lucrative commercial opportunities. Furthermore, the positive scientific reception of SCY-247 at conferences suggests a growing market interest, which could bode well for future commercialization efforts. The partnership with GSK, despite the reduced potential value, still offers substantial financial incentives for SCYNEXIS, including milestone payments and royalties, which can be a catalyst for future stock performance. 03/28/2024 - 04:01 PM SCY-247’s IND-enabling activities continue to advance with initiation of Phase I anticipated in the second half of 2024 Data analysis for the FURI study is ongoing; top line data from the CARES study has been received and is positive and consistent with previously disclosed results from interim analyses The clinical study reports for FURI, CARES and NATURE in refractory invasive fungal infections are on target for delivery to GSK in the first half of 2024 which would trigger a $10 million development milestone payment to SCYNEXIS SCYNEXIS ended 2023 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $98.0 million and projects a cash runway of more than two years JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. “SCYNEXIS had a year of significant progress in 2023, laying the foundation for future success by monetizing our first antifungal, BREXAFEMME®, and progressing the development of SCY-247, our next generation compound,” said David Angulo, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “SCY-247 continues to demonstrate highly encouraging preclinical results, with potent activity against a broad range of fungal pathogens, including mucormycosis. We look forward to continuing IND-enabling activities, culminating in the initiation of the first Phase I clinical study later this year. We are working diligently toward the resumption of the MARIO Phase III study of ibrexafungerp in invasive candidiasis and, with our strong cash balance, we are well-positioned to continue advancing SCY-247 as the next potential weapon in the fight against deadly fungal infections.” SCY-247 Preclinical Development Program Phase I enabling development activities for SCY-247, the next generation fungerp from SCYNEXIS’ proprietary antifungal platform, continue to progress. A portion of these activities, including assessing the compound’s activity against Candida auris and Mucorales, are being supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) grants. Phase I initiation is anticipated in the second half of 2024. Ibrexafungerp Clinical and Regulatory Updates In March 2023, SCYNEXIS and GSK entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of ibrexafungerp (BREXAFEMME). The agreement was amended in December of 2023 in connection with the delay in the commercialization of BREXAFEMME and further clinical development of ibrexafungerp associated with the potential cross contamination of ibrexafungerp drug substance with a non-antibacterial beta lactam compound. The deal has a total potential value of $448 million plus royalties (revised from $593 million plus royalties), including development milestone payments of up to $72.35 million, regulatory approval milestone payments of up to $49 million, commercial milestone payments of up to $57.5 million based on the first commercial sale in invasive candidiasis, and sales milestone payments of up to $179.5 million. SCYNEXIS is eligible to receive royalty payments based on cumulative global annual sales of Ibrexafungerp in the mid-single digit to mid-teen range. To date, SCYNEXIS has received an upfront payment of $90 million and a development milestone of $25 million. Final study reports from the completed FURI, CARES, SCYNERGIA, NATURE, and VANQUISH studies are anticipated to be delivered to GSK in the first half of 2024, which would trigger a $10 million development milestone payment to SCYNEXIS. Top line data from the CARES study is positive and consistent with previously disclosed results from interim analyses. It is anticipated that the CARES data will be presented at a future scientific meeting. Scientific Presentations Physician awareness and enthusiasm towards the fungerp class addressing critical antimicrobial resistant threats continues to build at medical conferences. Presented preclinical efficacy data on SCY-247 for the treatment of mucormycosis at the 11th Advances Against Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis (AAAM) Conference held in Milan, Italy January 25 – 27, 2024. The poster featured results from a study in a highly lethal mouse model of mucormycosis that demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival and reduced fungal burden following treatment with SCY-247 alone and in combination with standard of care liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) compared to placebo. Presented preclinical data on SCY-247 at the 11th Congress on Trends in Medical Mycology (TIMM) held in Athens, Greece October 20-23, 2023. The oral presentation featured a preclinical study that demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum activity of SCY-247 against a range of fungal pathogens, including multi-drug resistant strains, in in vitro and in vivo models. Full Year 2023 Financial Results License agreement revenue was $139 million for the full year 2023, compared to $103 thousand for the full year 2022. License agreement revenue primarily consists of the $130.1 million recognized upon the transfer of the license associated with the GSK License Agreement in May 2023. BREXAFEMME generated net product revenue of $1.0 million for the full year 2023, compared to $5.0 million for the full year 2022. Cost of product revenue was $15.6 million for the full year 2023 compared to $0.6 million for the full year 2022. The increase was primarily due to the $14.6 million impairment loss on the recoverability of raw material inventory given the potential cross-contamination of ibrexafungerp. Research and development expense for the full year 2023 increased to $30.9 million from $27.3 million versus the comparable prior year. The increase of $3.7 million, or 14%, was primarily driven by increased clinical costs for the MARIO study and the costs associated with the closing activities for the FURI, CARES, and SCYNERGIA studies. SG&A expense for the full year 2023 decreased to $20.9 million from $63.0 million versus the comparable prior year. The decrease of $42.0 million, or 67%, was primarily driven primarily by reductions in BREXAFEMME commercialization expenses. Total other expense was $5.5 million for the full year 2023, versus income of $18.2 million for the comparable prior year. During the full years 2023 and 2022, SCYNEXIS recognized a non-cash loss of $3.2 million and a non-cash gain of $22.3 million, respectively, on the fair value adjustment of the warrant liabilities and non-cash loss of $0.2 million and a $1.3 million non-cash gain, respectively, on the fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities. Net income for the full year 2023, was $67.0 million, or $1.40 basic income per share, compared to a net loss of $62.8 million, or $1.47 basic loss per share for the comparable prior year. Cash Balance Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $98.0 million on December 31, 2023, compared to $73.5 million on December 31, 2022. Based upon the company’s current operating plan, SCYNEXIS believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments provide a cash runway beyond two years. About Triterpenoid Antifungals Triterpenoid antifungals (also known as “fungerps”) are a novel class of structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitors that combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. They have demonstrated broad-spectrum antifungal activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, including azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains. Ibrexafungerp is the first representative of this novel class of antifungal agents. Ibrexafungerp, formerly known as SCY-078, is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and is in late-stage of development for invasive candidiasis and other indications. SCY-247 is a next generation fungerp in pre-clinical development for the treatment of life-threatening and often multi-drug resistant fungal diseases including Candida auris infections. About SCYNEXIS SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps.” Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phase, including the compound SCY-247. For more information, visit www.scynexis.com.
