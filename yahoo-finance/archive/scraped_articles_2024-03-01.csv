Reuters,US value stocks draw bargain hunters while AI fever rages,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-value-stocks-draw-bargain-195100623.html,"Value stocks, typically defined as companies trading at a discount on metrics such as book value or price-to-earnings, have largely been left behind as AI put a charge into their growth-focused peers.  Proponents believe that's a sign that the rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index is broadening beyond a handful of tech and growth names.  “There’s clearly an investment case for value stocks over the long term,” said Que Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates.","By David RandallNEW YORK (Reuters) - As fervor for artificial intelligence sweeps Wall Street, some investors are seeking bargains in more conventional areas of the stock market.Value stocks, typically defined as companies trading at a discount on metrics such as book value or price-to-earnings, have largely been left behind as AI put a charge into their growth-focused peers.However, gains in some value-heavy sectors such as industrials and materials have accelerated lately. Proponents believe that's a sign that the rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index is broadening beyond a handful of tech and growth names.“There’s clearly an investment case for value stocks over the long term,” said Que Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates. “These companies are still very, very cheap and many of them have already gone through the difficult process of restructuring their businesses and balance sheets.”The S&P 500 is up 7.6% in 2024 and stands at a record high. The S&P 500 Value Index is up 3.1% year-to-date, lagging the 11.5% gain in the S&P 500 Growth Index. Yet some value-heavy sector have shown signs of life in recent weeks.The S&P 500 industrial sector rose 7.1% last month, driven by rallies in General Electric and Howmet Aerospace. The broader index gained 5.8% in that period.The materials sector gained 6.7% in February, led by Vulcan Materials and Ecolab . Consumer discretionary, home of recent gainers such as Chiptole Mexican Grill and Ralph Lauren, rose nearly 9%.One major draw: value stocks are relatively cheap compared to the rest of the market. The health care sector trades at 18.9 times forward earnings with energy trading at a 12.2 multiple, much less than the 20.8 forward earnings for the S&P 500 after a rally lifted the benchmark 42% from its October 2022 lows.Michael Hunstad, Northern Trust Asset Management’s deputy chief investment officer and head of global equities, believes multiples have grown too steep for the S&P 500 and the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have led its rally. Tesla's drop of nearly 20% this year illustrates how quickly such stocks can reverse, he said.Story continues""We expect to see more risk to the downside for multiples, particularly among the Mag 7,"" said Hunstad, who has been increasing his positions in value-focused sectors such as healthcare and energy.Hunstad also believes value stocks could better weather a prolonged period of elevated interest rates than growth names, as their cash flows are shorter-term and less sensitive to borrowing costs.While investors still expect the Fed to cut rates this year, they have reduced expectations for how quickly and deeply the central bank will cut rates, as a stronger-than-expected economy could reignite inflation if monetary policy eases too soon.Next week’s congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could shed light on policymakers’ views. Investors are also awaiting U.S. employment data next Friday.Betting against growth stocks has been dangerous over the last decade, when searing rallies in shares of companies such as Apple, Google-parent Alphabet and Meta Platforms led markets higher. The S&P 500 Value index is up about 110% over the last 10 years, compared with a nearly 235% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index.Broader sentiment toward value has waned, by some measures. A net 13% of fund managers polled by BofA Global Research expect growth stocks to outperform value names over the next year, the highest conviction level since May 2020.Still, some strategists argue the productivity gains promised by AI could lift all boats long-term, benefiting value stocks as well as growth shares.Robert Robotti, chief investment officer of Robotti & Company, believes value stocks are likely to see the largest efficiency gains from adopting AI, bolstering their margins and pushing up valuations. He has increased his stake in industrial and healthcare stocks as a result.""The application of AI is going to be across the entire company and that’s not limited to the guy selling the chip,"" Robotti said. ""It’s the guy buying the chip and increasing his efficiency who is going to benefit.”(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)"

TheStreet,Analysts revamp Dell stock price targets after earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-revamp-dell-stock-price-191220686.html,Here's what could happen next to Dell Technologies' shares.,"Dell Technologies (DELL) has seen the future and probably looks much better than the past.The tech giant, founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, has hit some incredible highs and some serious lows in its 40-year existence.In 1992, Fortune included Dell Computer Corp. in its list of the world's 500 largest companies.But things went south for a while, and the company found itself in the crosshairs of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that cost Dell $100 million.Dell went private in 2013 in a leveraged buyout before announcing its plans to become publicly traded again five years later.Now, the company founded the same year ""Ghostbusters"" was the No. 1 movie has gone all in on the hottest tech concept of the moment: artificial intelligence.AI was a key factor in the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, and the shares took off like a bat out of Dell on March 1, soaring more than 30% in the opening minutes of trading and touching a record.The frenzy comes shortly after AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rocked Wall Street's earnings forecasts.Analysts unveil new price targets for Dell. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg/Getty ImagesCOO: 'Just started to touch AI opportunities'Dell earned $2.20 a share in Q4, beating FactSet’s analyst consensus of $1.73 per share. Revenue totaled $22.3 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $22.2 billion.A year earlier, the company posted earnings of $1.80 per share on $25 billion in sales.Looking ahead, Dell said that it expected first-quarter revenue of $21 billion to $22 billion. The FactSet consensus is calling for $21.5 billion.Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill said Dell had $8.7 billion in cash flow from operations in the fiscal year, returning $7 billion to shareholders since the first quarter of fiscal 2023.""We're optimistic about FY25 and are increasing our annual dividend by 20%, a testament to our confidence in the business and ability to generate strong cash flow,"" she said.Related: Analyst who forecast Nvidia stock could exceed $750 revamps targetDell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group posted $9.3 billion in quarterly revenue, up 10% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year.Story continuesServers and networking revenue totaled $4.9 billion, with sequential growth driven primarily by AI-optimized servers.Dell said storage revenue was $4.5 billion, up 16% sequentially with demand strength across the portfolio, while operating income came to $1.4 billion.Orders for the company's AI-optimized servers, including the flagship PowerEdge XE9680, jumped 40% sequentially in the fourth quarter.“Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and chief operating officer, said in a statement.“We've just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, and we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build [generative-AI] solutions that meet performance, cost and security requirements,” Clarke added.The company said it would have the broadest portfolio of commercial AI laptops and mobile workstations, which feature built-in AI acceleration with the addition of the neural processing unit.New XPS systems also feature the neural processing unit or NPU, which Dell said would help improve performance, productivity, and collaboration.Analysts responded enthusiastically to Dell's AI strategies, with several raising their share-price targets.Analyst: AI 'stole the show'Morgan Stanley said Dell's AI server commentary ""stole the show.""The investment firm boosted its price target on Dell shares to $128 from $100, kept an overweight rating on the shares, and reinstalled the company as Top Pick in its group.More AI Stocks:Analyst reveals new Broadcom stock price target tied to AIAI stock soars on new guidance (it's not Nvidia!)Nvidia CEO Huang weighs in on huge AI opportunityWith AI server orders backlog and pipeline tracking “well ahead of our prior expectations,” Morgan Stanley said, its prior bull case has become its new base case.The firm also said a better-than-feared April-quarter outlook and expectations for recovery and traditional infrastructure were welcoming sites.Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers raised the firm's price target on Dell to $140 from $85 and reiterated an overweight rating on the shares.The firm said artificial intelligence momentum and conversion plus evidence of traditional server recovery and significant capital return should drive the shares higher.Bernstein raised its price target on Dell to $120 from $90 and affirmed an outperform rating on the shares.The company's quarterly results were solid, and its artificial intelligence business showed strong progress on key metrics, the firm said.Bernstein sees Dell's first-quarter earnings guidance as very conservative. And the investment firm sees a path to $8 in earnings per share for the year.TD Cowen raised its price target on Dell to $105 from $75 and maintained a market-perform, effectively neutral, rating on the shares.The firm said its outlook was better than expected as AI-driven storage growth joins the narrative alongside AI servers. Execution remains solid, TD Cowen said and called the 20% increase to the annual dividend a positive.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"
Motley Fool,Why Celsius Holdings Stock Rocketed Almost 25% This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-celsius-holdings-stock-rocketed-191122503.html,Celsius Holdings doubled revenue year over year in 2023.,"Shares of energy drink maker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) soared after the company reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results this week. Celsius stock has rocketed nearly 50% this year, but about half of that was from its surge this week. As of Friday afternoon, shares were higher by about 25% just this week, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Swinging to profitsCelsius' huge growth in product sales led it to a full-year profit of $0.77 diluted earnings per share. That compares to a loss of $0.88 for 2022. For the full year, international revenue jumped by 52% while sales in North America soared by 105%. Maybe more importantly, gross margin expanded by 660 basis points or more than 6 full percentage points to 48%.Celsius CEO John Fieldly said in a statement that the growth has been ""driven by expanded availability of our products and increased consumer awareness. We continued to drive growth of the category by bringing in new loyal consumers, as well as increasing consumption occasions.""Is Celsius stock a buy?Now that it's generating profits, Celsius is no longer the speculative stock it once was. Growth stocks are typically expensive, and Celsius falls in that category. One big catalyst for its recent success is the distribution partnership it started with PepsiCo nearly two years ago. That seems to be paying off in a big way.While its valuation from traditional metrics remains high, that partnership may help the company with its roadmap for international expansion. The Pepsi relationship is only for North America, but Celsius' international sales have been accelerating.If it can use its North American success as a template, there may be much more growth ahead that could be led by international markets. Celsius is a growth stock that might be worth paying up for.Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

A renewed rally in tech lifted stocks.Most Read from BloombergTrump Warns of Big Losses From Asset Sales During Property SlumpNYCB Flags Weaknesses in Loan Oversight and Names New CEOElon Musk Sues OpenAI and Altman for Breaching Firm’s Founding MissionIndia’s Blowout GDP Based on Data Distortion That Masks SlowdownUS two-year yields extended their slide after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said he would like the central bank to boost its share of short-term Treasuries. Also speaking Friday, Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he doesn’t want to have to raise interest rates again.A gauge of US factory activity shrank at a faster pace in February — as orders, production and employment contracted — suggesting manufacturing is struggling for momentum.“This ISM report misaligns with the narrative of ‘surprisingly positive growth’ that was emerging from the earnings reports, casting doubt now on the solidity of the manufacturing industry and of the cycle with it,” said Florian Ielpo at Lombard Odier Asset Management in Switzerland.Treasuries rose across the curve, with two-year yields sinking eight basis points to 4.54%. Traders slightly boosted their bets on a Fed rate-cut in June. The S&P 500 topped 5,100, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 1%. Dell Technologies Inc. surged 28% on solid sales and profit. Boeing Co. fell on news reports it’s in discussions to acquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. New York Community Bancorp plunged after saying said it discovered “material weaknesses” in how it tracks loan risks. The dollar was little changed. Oil rose above $80.To Chris Low at FHN Financial, despite weakness in the ISM manufacturing index, gross domestic product and consumer spending have remained strong.Story continues“February’s ISM Manufacturing survey underscores the slow movement in the upward trend of the past few months, but keeps it intact,” he noted. “Expectations of future stronger orders, expressed in the featured survey responses, is an encouraging sign, and a drop in the rate of prices paid shows input price inflation is under control for the time being.”Also on Friday, Fed Richmond President Thomas Barkin said markets are pricing in fewer rate reductions in response to economic data. His Dallas counterpart Lorie Logan reiterated it’ll likely be appropriate to start slowing the pace at which it shrinks its balance sheet. Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee told CNBC he believes the Fed funds rate is quite restrictive — and he wouldn’t be surprised if January inflation ends up being just noise.In recent weeks, many policymakers have indicated that interest rates will remain at a 22-year high at least through the Fed’s next meeting on March 19-20, with the first cut likely later this year. Officials are watching to see whether January’s surprise jump in consumer prices was a fluke or a roadblock on the way toward lower inflation.Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks set to echo his colleagues in suggesting that rate cuts are likely to begin “later this year” in his testimony to Congress next week, according to Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics. But with the downward trend in core inflation still looking intact, we don’t think that rules out a first cut at the June meeting, he noted.US policymakers are likely to raise their 2024 projections for economic growth and inflation at their upcoming meeting this month, upping the chances that the US central bank might signal fewer interest rate cuts for this year, according to rate strategists at Bank of America.“The March Fed summary of economic projections is quite likely to shift the outlook for ‘24 GDP & inflation higher + unemployment rate lower,” BofA’s Mark Cabana, Ralf Preusser and Sphia Salim wrote in a Friday note. “This macro projection shift naturally raises the risk of the Fed signaling fewer cuts in ‘24 at the March FOMC.”Apollo Management Chief Economist Torsten Slok said that a re-accelerating US economy, coupled with a rise in underlying inflation, will prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates in 2024.“The bottom line is that the Fed will spend most of 2024 fighting inflation,” Slok wrote in a Friday note to clients. “As a result, yield levels in fixed income will stay high.”Treasury yields could soon be heading back toward 5% if strong economic performance delays the Fed’s rate-cut plans, according to Capital Group Inc.’s Pramod Atluri.Meantime, Pacific Investment Management Co. is warning that US fiscal profligacy threatens to drag the Treasury market back to 1980s, a time when bond vigilantes demanded far higher compensation to own longer-dated bonds.A combination of stickier inflation and deteriorating budget estimates “could start to reverse the 40-year downtrend” of a key measure of how much bond investors are compensated for holding long-term debt, according to Pimco’s Marc Seidner and Pramol Dhawan.Meantime, a stock indicator from BofA that’s tracking Wall Street strategists’ average recommended equity allocations ticked higher last month, moving closer to flashing a contrarian “sell” signal than a “buy” for the first time since April 2022. Still, the gauge remains in “neutral,” not “sell,” territory.The frenzy around AI stocks has blindsided Wall Street forecasters, spurring a race among strategists to keep up with a stock market rally that’s already blowing past their expectations when 2024 began.Five Wall Street firms have already lifted their forecasts for the S&P 500, which is up a 7% to start the year after rising 24% in 2023. In the past week alone, Piper Sandler & Co., UBS Group AG and Barclays Plc boosted their targets. Two firms — Goldman Sachs Group and UBS — have done it twice since December.Corporate Highlights:Elon Musk sued OpenAI and its Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, alleging they violated the artificial intelligence startup’s founding mission by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity.Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. delayed its annual report and indicated that a “material weakness” in its internal controls won’t have a broad impact on earnings.Debt-laden Dish Network Corp. said it’s unlikely to meet an April 1 deadline to buy prized airwaves from T-Mobile USA Inc., a failure that would set in motion an auction of the frequencies valued at $3.6 billion or more.B. Riley Financial Inc. posted a wider quarterly loss, halved its dividend and delayed filing its annual report, citing a review of transactions with a key client that have drawn attacks by short sellers.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reduced its outlook for sales growth and profit in the current fiscal year, citing lower demand for networking products and a crunch in computer chip availability.Volkswagen AG said sales growth will slow this year as the auto industry grapples with slumping demand for electric vehicles and intensifying competition.Fisker Inc. is seeking a financial lifeline as liquidity challenges put its survival in doubt, the latest sign of stress in an electric vehicle market plagued by slowing growth and questions over consumer demand.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.5% as of 12:20 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%The MSCI World index rose 0.6%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%The euro rose 0.3% to $1.0835The British pound rose 0.2% to $1.2655The Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 150.14 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 0.5% to $61,731.27Ether rose 1.8% to $3,411.25BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined five basis points to 4.20%Germany’s 10-year yield was little changed at 2.41%Britain’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 4.11%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.6% to $80.27 a barrelSpot gold rose 1.9% to $2,082.90 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Carter Johnson, Michael Mackenzie and Alexandra Semenova.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle ClassChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less ChocolateTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal FamilyRobotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

The company's share price was down 18.1% as of 1:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.SoundHound published its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closed yesterday, reporting sales and earnings for the period that fell short of market expectations. The technology specialist reported a loss of $0.07 per share on revenue of $17.15 million, while the average analyst estimate had called for the business to record a per-share loss of $0.06 on sales of $17.21 million.SoundHound's Q4 report fell short of the hypeSoundHound AI has been one of the market's most explosive stocks in 2024. Even with today's post-earnings pullback, the company's share price is still up roughly 189% year to date. The business actually showed strong momentum in Q4, but the results couldn't sustain the artificial intelligence (AI) stock's incredible valuation run-up.Revenue increased 80.5% year over year in Q4. Notably, the sales increase did not include contributions from the company's acquisition of AI audio tech specialist Sync3, which was announced in last year's fourth quarter but closed in Q1 this year. SoundHound also reported that its cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog had increased to $661 million at the end of last year's fourth quarter -- more than double compared to where it was at the end of Q4 2022.With its Q4 report, SoundHound AI showed that its business is seeing strong momentum. But sales and earnings results still fell a bit short of Wall Street's targets. Additionally, it looks like investors were expecting some groundbreaking announcements with the report that failed to materialize.What comes next for SoundHound AI?With its Q4 report, SoundHound AI laid out performance targets for 2024 and 2025. For the current fiscal year, the company expects revenue to come in between $63 million and $77 million. If the company were to hit the midpoint of its sales target, that would mean delivering growth of approximately 52.5%, compared to the $45.9 million in sales that it recorded last year.Story continuesLooking ahead to 2025, the company expects to deliver more than $100 million in sales. If performance were to come in near the low end of that guidance target, that would suggest sales growth of roughly 43% compared to this year's midpoint revenue target.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Is It Time to Buy the Stock Hand Over Fist?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-power-says-biggest-risk-183322527.html,"Plug Power has found money to run its day-to-day operations, but will that be enough?","Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) sent shockwaves among investors some months ago when it issued a ""going concern"" warning. Management has tried hard to pacify investors since, and some of the updates it provided in late January even sent the hydrogen stock surging more than 40% in the last week of the month.All eyes have been on Plug Power's earnings report since, with investors hoping for some more good news. The company seems to have succeeded, or so it seems from the way Plug Power stock made a U-turn on Friday, jumping into the green as the day progressed after slumping more than 10% at one point in early-morning trading.Is this a sign to buy Plug Power stock?Plug Power's addresses going concern issuePlug Power's revenue rose 27% in 2023, but its total revenue of $891 million fell short of the company's outlook of $1.2 billion issued late last year. Moreover, Plug Power's net loss nearly doubled to $1.4 billion in 2023.The highlight of the earnings report, however, wasn't the numbers, but something huge that management said. It stated that Plug Power has resolved the going concern issue, and that the company has enough cash and liquidity to fund its ongoing operations ""for the foreseeable future."" In November last year, Plug Power said its cash and available equity securities for sale weren't sufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months.So what has changed since?Well, Plug Power entered into an agreement with investment bank B. Riley Securities in January this year to sell stock worth a little more than $1 billion, and it believes the proceeds from such a share sale will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Plug Power says the earlier substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, therefore, no longer exists.Is Plug Power stock a buy now?Investors are evidently betting on Plug Power ""resolving"" its going concern issue today, but it's too early to turn bullish. Plug Power's revenue growth is decelerating, and its high costs are eating into its bottom line. Also, whatever money Plug Power raises from the share sale could primarily be used to run its day-to-day operations, meaning the company still requires a lot of money to fund its growth plans.Story continuesEven if Plug Power secures a loan from the Department of Energy later this year, as it expects to, I wouldn't touch the stock until its numbers show what investors want to see: higher revenue growth, lower costs, and better margins.Should you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?Before you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Plug Power wasn’t one of them.
