Motley Fool,Why SoundHound AI Stock Was Falling Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-soundhound-ai-stock-falling-193100204.html,The March inflation report was surprisingly hot.,"Shares of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) were pulling back today in line with the broader market sell-off on a hotter-than-expected inflation reading. The high inflation report makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates later this year, and high-priced, unprofitable, growth stocks are generally more sensitive to interest rates and inflation than the rest of the stock market.Considering SoundHound's dramatic surge this year, this may be doubly true for the AI stock. As a result, the company's stock was down 7.1% as of 1:25 p.m. ET.Image source: Getty Images.A new SoundHound risk gets exposedThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this morning that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 0.4% from February and was up 3.5% from a year ago. Those numbers were above consensus forecasts of 0.3% monthly growth and 3.4% annual growth.Core inflation, which excludes food and gas prices, rose 0.4% from February and 3.8% from a year ago. Both numbers were above estimates, as well.The news sent stocks falling broadly as investors believed it would lead to the Federal Reserve lowering its number of planned interest-rate cuts. Lower rates tend to favor growth stocks like SoundHound AI, as those stocks are valued based on earnings in the distant future, according to the discounted cash flow model. When interest rates are low, those earnings are worth more than when rates are high.What's next for SoundHound AI?It's easy to see why SoundHound would be sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. The company still had minimal revenue of just $17.1 million in its most recent quarter. Though it's growing fast, with revenue up 80% in the fourth quarter, much of that new revenue comes from companies experimenting with its voice activation technology, and its customers are less likely to embrace new technologies or spend on new products when times are tough.While the economy currently looks stable, high inflation and interest rates could cool off, putting pressure on stocks like SoundHound AI, which is small, unprofitable, and expensive at a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 24.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Bloomberg,S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-skew-higher-ahead-221402334.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders sent stocks and bonds sliding after another hot inflation report signaled the Federal Reserve will be in no rush to cut rates this year.

Treasury 10-year yields hovered near the closely watched 4.5% mark — reaching a fresh high for 2024. Fed swaps priced in only 50 basis points of easing in 2024 — which equates to only two rate cuts. The dollar climbed against all of its developed world counterparts.As the Fed pushes forward in its “last mile” toward the 2% inflation target, investors’ concern is that the recent price pressures may not be just a bump in the road — with the world’s largest economy roaring. For a data-dependent central bank, that means the higher-for-longer rates narrative taking hold again.“It’s often said that the Fed takes the escalator up and the elevator down when setting rates,” said Richard Flynn at Charles Schwab. “But for the path downwards in this cycle, it looks like they will opt for the stairs.”All major groups in the S&P 500 retreated, with the gauge down to around 5,160. Treasury two-year yields, which are more sensitive to imminent Fed moves, surged 20 basis points to 4.95%. The dollar rose the most in two months. The loonie trimmed losses after Bank of Canada officials signaled they need more evidence of slowing inflation.Wall Street’s Reaction to CPI Data:Jason Pride at Glenmede:Inflation right now is like the stubborn child that refuses to heed the parent’s call to leave the playground.Story continuesTwo cuts is now likely the base case for 2024, down from 3 just a month ago and 6-7 expected cuts at the start of the year. As a result, investors should be prepared for a higher-for-longer monetary regime.Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group:Rates aren’t going higher, but the distance to a rate cut is another quarter.Torsten Slok at Apollo Global Management:Easy financial conditions continue to provide a significant tailwind to growth and inflation. As a result, the Fed is not done fighting inflation and rates will stay higher for longer.We are sticking to our view that the Fed will not cut rates in 2024.Matthew Weller at Forex.com and City Index:No matter how you slice the data, it’s hard to argue that inflation is falling. For a central bank that was looking for any sign that inflation was continuing to fall toward its target, this report will be a big disappointment for the Federal Reserve.Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments:The battle between the sticky vs continued disinflationary narratives is moving decidedly toward an inflation backdrop that is plateauing and potentially accelerating. This inflation release effectively takes June off the table for the first rate cut and should push the odds out further with a coin toss in July or September.Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance:Goldilocks has left the building – inflation isn’t coming down anymore and rate-cut hopes are going to be pushed off even further into the future.We believe the Fed still has a bias to cut rates and they are likely to still cut interest rates by 25 bps in either July or September — but if the inflation data remains sticky then that may be the only rate cut we get this year.Charles Hepworth at GAM Investments:For the June rate cut optimists, this reading is a bit of blow. Markets have been wrestling with the likelihood of the Federal Reserve delivering on three rate cuts this year, but on these numbers, two rate cuts may now be the more likely outcome.Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley:A third-straight hotter-than-expected CPI may have been the final nail in the coffin for a June rate cut, but it remains to be seen whether 2024 will turn out to be a two-cut year, or something less.The other question is whether the stock market will see this as more than a “bump” in the inflation road. We’ve seen sharp moves after other CPI surprises reversed in a day or two, but if today’s reaction in the pre-market is any indication, the recent volatility may not have run its course.David Kelly at JPMorgan Asset Management:That’s the sound of the door slamming shut on a June rate cut.Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets:Core-CPI at +0.4% takes June cut off the table. Overall, the figures materially undermine the Fed’s assumption that Jan/Feb were simply a bump in the road toward normalization.Greg McBride at Bankrate:You can kiss a June interest-rate cut goodbye. There is no improvement here, we’re moving in the wrong direction.Richard Flynn at Charles Schwab:In recent months it has become clear that the journey to the Fed’s target of 2% inflation will be bumpy. It’s often said that the Fed takes the escalator up and the elevator down when setting rates, but for the path downwards in this cycle, it looks like they will opt for the stairs.Neil Birrell at Premier Miton Diversified Funds:The US economy is running along at quite a pace and a June rate cut looks less and less likely – July or September is the call now. The Fed has got some head scratching to do and if other central banks were waiting for the Fed to move, they have got a conundrum on their hands now.Lindsay Rosner at Goldman Sachs Asset Management:The rates market needs to seriously consider the likelihood of higher-for-longer at minimum lasting through the Summer and potentially through the end of the year. This number did not eclipse the Fed’s confidence, it did, however, cast a shadow on it.Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management:This marks the third consecutive strong reading and means that the stalled disinflationary narrative can no longer be called a blip. In fact, even if inflation were to cool next month to a more comfortable reading, there is likely sufficient caution within the Fed now to mean that a July cut may also be a stretch.Corporate Highlights:Delta Air Lines Inc. expects earnings to exceed Wall Street’s projections for the second quarter as the carrier benefits from a step-up in corporate travel and steady leisure demand heading into summer.Macy’s Inc. named two new directors nominated by activist investor Arkhouse Management Co., which agreed to end its effort to seek majority board representation as it attempts to acquire the department-store operator.Apple Inc. assembled $14 billion of iPhones in India last fiscal year, doubling production in a sign it’s accelerating a push to diversify beyond China.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in AI development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers.UBS Group AG faces a “substantial” increase in regulatory capital requirements under reforms that the Swiss government is advocating for in the wake of the collapse of Credit Suisse.KKR & Co. laid out a plan to scale its core businesses as it aims to reach at least $1 trillion of assets under management in five years.Key events this week:China PPI, CPI, ThursdayEurozone ECB rate decision, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, PPI, ThursdayNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, ThursdayBoston Fed President Susan Collins speaks, ThursdayChina trade, FridayUS University of Michigan consumer sentiment, FridayCitigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo due to report results, Friday.San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaks, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 1% as of 9:57 a.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.8%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2%The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%The MSCI World index fell 0.9%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.7%The euro fell 1% to $1.0752The British pound fell 0.9% to $1.2569The Japanese yen fell 0.6% to 152.69 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 1.4% to $68,159.51Ether fell 1.6% to $3,457.61BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced 13 basis points to 4.49%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced five basis points to 2.42%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced eight basis points to 4.11%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $85.37 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.9% to $2,331.14 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain FutureEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

At the same time, the finance industry and carbon credit providers are positioning themselves to reap the monetary benefits of the growing market for offsetting reported emissions.The decision could help boost the market, which currently is valued somewhere between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, to more than $1 trillion a year by 2050, according to Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF.“For Scope 3-heavy companies, working towards and achieving net zero under SBTi is a moonshot without some reliance on carbon credits,” he said.Market participants were quick to respond to the move. Rich Gilmore, chief executive at Carbon Growth Partners, said the decision could be “massively consequential” for the future of carbon prices. Sonia Zugel, CEO of ESG Playbook, called the adjustment “a huge change” to SBTi’s framework.Tej Virk, co-founder of NLX Capital, said the relaxed guidelines will “invigorate the demand for voluntary carbon credits.” SBTi’s decision “signals a crucial shift towards the acceptance of carbon credits in corporate climate strategies, promising to boost both the market and the efficacy of these credits in achieving real-world climate action.”Story continuesThe new relaxed guidelines represent “a significant step forward in scaling carbon markets and climate action,” said Teresa Hartmann, chief ratings officer at BeZero Carbon.“For companies that aren’t currently able to meet their Scope 3 reduction targets, the flexibility to use credits will represent an opportunity to continue engaging with climate action meaningfully, and fund practicable climate solutions within the critical next decade,” she said.SBTi had previously sought to limit the use of credits to residual emissions, or those that can’t be cut through other means. The organization says its revised guidelines follow a “wide” consultation over the past six months.Nevertheless, some experts closely affiliated with SBTi were caught off guard. Doreen Stabinksy, professor of global environmental politics at College of the Atlantic and a member of SBTi’s technical council, said “the statement came as a surprise.” She also questioned the climate science underpinning the move.“It clearly contravenes governance procedures within SBTi, as the Technical Council has not engaged on this matter yet at all subsequent to the call for evidence in the fall of last year,” Stabinsky said. “A number of Technical Council members have raised concerns internally in the hours since the publication of the statement, on both process and content of the statement.”Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit and research group, went a step further and said it “strongly condemns” the decision by SBTi, noting that Scope 3 emissions often make up the “lion’s share of a company’s carbon footprint.”Stephannie Galdino, a voluntary carbon market analyst with Veyt, warned of a “high risk of greenwashing” as a result of SBTi’s decision.SBTi, in its statement, promised to develop “specific guardrails and thresholds” to ensure proper use of credits. It also said it isn’t planning to validate the quality of carbon credits. Instead, it will give organizations that do so “clear access” to the rules that it will establish around the credits’ use. SBTi expects to issue a first draft by July setting out details of when credits may be used.“While recognizing that there is an ongoing healthy debate on the subject matter, SBTi recognizes that, when properly supported by policies, standards and procedures based on scientific evidence, the use of environmental attribute certificates for abatement purposes on Scope 3 emissions could function as an additional tool to tackle climate change,” it said.Investors are increasingly demanding validation of emission-cutting plans by SBTi, which is a voluntary program. More than 5,000 companies and financial institutions have had their plans approved, with the number roughly doubling each year, according to SBTi.(Adds BNEF comment.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekToyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4RunnerHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Motley Fool,"Nvidia Stock Has 17% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-17-upside-according-182750515.html,The recent correction in Nvidia's stock price represents an opportunity for investors.,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the standard bearer for the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for significant productivity increases resulting from the widespread adoption of the technology. The company's state-of-the-art processors have essentially cornered the market for AI applications. However, Nvidia is seeing increasing competition, which is weighing on the stock in recent weeks.One Wall Street analyst believes this represents a buying opportunity.The best way to capitalize on AIMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised his price target on Nvidia to $1,000 while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating. That represents potential gains of 17% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst notes that Nvidia stock is down about 10% from its peak, giving investors a compelling opportunity to buy shares.Moore goes even further, suggesting that owning Nvidia stock is the ""best way"" to capitalize on the shift to generative AI, as investments in the technology are only beginning to ramp up.I'm completely on board with this logic. Data centers are in the midst of a massive upgrade cycle to handle the computational horsepower needed to run AI workloads. Furthermore, the construction of new data centers is booming. One example is the $100 billion data center project planned by Microsoft and OpenAI dubbed ""Stargate.""CEO Jensen Huang estimates there will be $2 trillion in data center spending over the coming four to five years. With a 95% share of the GPU data center market, this will result in continuing strong demand for Nvidia's processors.Nvidia stock currently sells for 73 times trailing 12-month earnings. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $24.48 in 2025 and $30.63 by 2026. If the analyst's price target is on track, that would shrink Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 41 next year and 33 the year after, which illustrates why Nvidia stock is still a bargain.Story continuesFor those reasons and more, Nvidia stock is a buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Disney Stock Has 20% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-20-upside-according-182022369.html,Disney stock is riskier -- and more expensive -- than this analyst seems to believe.,"Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) stock -- like most stocks -- got a bit banged up on Wednesday after higher-than-expected inflation data dashed investors' hopes for a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024. But in contrast to many other stocks, Disney investors also got some good news.Inflation or no inflation, and rate cuts or no interest rate cuts ... Disney stock is going up nearly 20% (according to Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner), and will hit $140 a share within a year.Is Disney stock a buy?Disney is an entertainment conglomerate, boasting multiple profitable businesses -- most of which contribute to Bonner's buy thesis. True, the TV business is in secular decline, and ""bleeding subscribers"" as cord-cutting continues. But Disney parks and cruise lines, says the analyst, have ""resumed full operations"" and ""are posting strong results."" And Disney's streaming TV business is the only real competitor to Netflix.He's right about almost all of this. While cable TV is in decline, it still generated more than $4.1 billion in operating profit for Disney over the last 12 months, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Parks and cruises combined to produce another $6 billion in profit. And while streaming is currently unprofitable, it's approaching $20 billion in annual revenue for Disney. (And Disney's plans to ban password sharing could help make those revenues profitable).Given time, Disney has enough levers to pull to rehab the House of Mouse and get its profits growing again, I'm sure. My bigger concern is that investors are already assuming this growth will happen. At 27 times free cash flow (and Disney is even more expensive when debt is considered -- its enterprise value-to-free cash flow ratio is closer to 32x -- investors are crediting Disney stock with much more than the 17% long-term annual growth rate it's projected to achieve.They're also not discounting the risk multiple movie flops (yes, I'm talking to you, Marvel) will cause profits to shrink further. If Disney's profits shrink rather than grow, its stock price could go down rather than up.Story continuesWhere to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
