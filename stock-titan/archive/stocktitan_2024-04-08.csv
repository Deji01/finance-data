Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst The recent decision by the Minister to allow Sasol South Africa Limited to regulate sulphur dioxide emissions on a load-based limit rather than concentration-based limits from April 2025 could have a significant impact on the company's operational flexibility and cost management. Load-based limits provide a cap on the total amount of emissions over a period, which could enable Sasol to optimize operations during periods of high production demand without breaching emission limits, as long as the total emissions stay within the approved load. This could potentially lead to cost savings in terms of reduced need for immediate technological upgrades or process changes that would have been necessary to meet concentration-based limits.However, this decision also places a spotlight on the company's environmental responsibilities and the scrutiny it faces from both regulators and the public. Investors should monitor how Sasol plans to maintain or reduce overall emissions within the new framework and any investments they make in cleaner technologies. The long-term implications include the potential for improved stakeholder relations if Sasol uses this opportunity to demonstrate environmental leadership, as well as risks associated with potential future regulatory changes or public backlash if improvements to air quality are not perceived. Investment Analyst From an investment perspective, the Minister's decision to uphold Sasol's appeal is a positive development for the company. It provides a clearer regulatory environment for the next five years, which can enhance investor confidence in the stability of Sasol's operations. By mitigating the immediate risk of having to significantly reduce SO2 emissions on a concentration basis, Sasol may avoid substantial capital expenditures in the near term, which could have impacted its financial performance and, consequently, investor returns.Investors should also consider the potential impact on Sasol's reputation as a sustainable operator and how this might affect its long-term market valuation. As environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria become increasingly important to investors, Sasol's actions following this decision could influence its attractiveness to sustainability-focused funds and investors. The company's subsequent environmental initiatives and communication strategy will be critical in shaping investor perception. 04/08/2024 - 02:35 AM JOHANNESBURG, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholders are referred to Sasol's SENS announcement issued on 12 July 2023, wherein it was stated that, on 11 July 2023, the National Air Quality Officer (NAQO) refused the application of Sasol South Africa Limited (SSA), in terms of Clause 12A of the Minimum Emission Standards (MES) published on 22 November 2013 in terms of section 21 of the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act, 2004 (Act No. 39 of 2004), to be regulated on an alternative emission load basis, as opposed to the current concentration-based limits, for the sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions generated from the boilers at the Secunda Operations' steam plants from 1 April 2025 onwards. Sasol has been steadfast in its commitment to ambient air quality improvement and reducing its environmental footprint. On 31 July 2023, SSA submitted an appeal to the Minister, as provided for in section 43(1) of the National Environmental Management Act,1998 (Act No. 107 of 1998), to set aside the decision of the NAQO. On 5 April 2024, the Minister issued her decision, in terms of which she upheld SSA's appeal and set aside the decision of the NAQO. The Minister concluded that SSA's application met all the requirements of Clause 12A, and therefore replaced the NAQO's decision by permitting that load-based limits be applied from 1 April 2025 up to 31 March 2030. Sasol will engage with the Minister to finalise the regulatory requirements for the decision to take full effect, following which our atmospheric emission license will have to be varied accordingly.

The treatment was well-tolerated and resulted in immune activation. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Analyst The interim results from the ARTACUS trial for Replimune's RP1 monotherapy present a significant development in the treatment of skin cancers, particularly for the immunocompromised patient cohort such as organ transplant recipients. The reported overall response rate (ORR) of 34.8% and complete response rate (CRR) of nearly 22% are promising figures, especially considering the historical context where effective treatments for this patient group are limited due to the contraindication of systemic immunotherapies. The fact that RP1 has been well tolerated and has shown a safety profile consistent with non-immunocompromised patients is noteworthy, as it suggests a potential for broader application. Additionally, the observed immunological markers, such as increased CD+8 T cells and PD-L1 expression, indicate a mechanism of action through immune system activation, which aligns with the current trend in oncology towards immunotherapies. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the positive results of RP1 monotherapy could be a catalyst for Replimune's stock performance and its position in the biotech sector. The niche focus on transplant recipients, a group with limited treatment options, could allow Replimune to capture a significant share of this market segment. It's important to note that while the data is promising, it is still interim and from a relatively small patient population. The durability of benefit and long-term safety will be key factors for market adoption. Furthermore, the increase in PD-L1 expression post-treatment could position RP1 as a potential combination therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, expanding its market potential beyond monotherapy. Investors should watch for further data releases and regulatory milestones that could impact Replimune's valuation and market dynamics within the oncology space. Transplant Medicine Specialist From a clinical standpoint, the absence of allograft rejection in the study is a critical aspect of the treatment's profile. Allograft rejection is a common and serious concern in transplant recipients undergoing cancer treatment and the fact that RP1 did not trigger this response is a significant advantage. This could lead to increased interest and usage in the transplant community, provided these results hold up in larger trials. The treatment's ability to elicit a response in a new primary basal cell carcinoma further demonstrates its potential efficacy against multiple skin cancer types. This could influence treatment protocols and guidelines in the future, making RP1 an important tool in the management of post-transplant skin cancers. 04/07/2024 - 05:00 PM RP1 monotherapy showed clear anti-tumor activity with an overall response rate of nearly 35 percent and complete response rate of nearly 22 percent in evaluable patientsSAN DIEGO, April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Replimune Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: REPL), a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel portfolio of oncolytic immunotherapies, today announced the presentation of interim results from ARTACUS, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating RP1 monotherapy for the treatment of skin cancers in patients who have had solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants, by Michael R. Midgen, M.D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during an oral session at the AACR 2024 Annual Meeting in San Diego. The results were initially presented late last year at the 38th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). In the study, treatment with RP1 as monotherapy, for up to 25 doses, resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 34.8 percent (8 of 23 evaluable patients, including 5 complete responses and 3 partial responses) with most responses ongoing as of the data cutoff date of September 18, 2023. In the evaluable patient population (n=23), 20 had cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and three had merkel cell carcinoma. Of note, a patient treated with RP1 for CSCC also had a complete response of a new primary basal cell carcinoma which appeared post baseline. There was no evidence of allograft rejection including of hepatic and lung allografts. RP1 monotherapy was well tolerated, and the safety profile was similar to the profile in non-immunocompromised patients with advanced skin cancers. Additional biomarker data collected showed an increase in CD+8 T, a type of immune cell, and an increase in the expression of PD-L1, after treatment suggesting immune activation. The slides are available on the Replimune website under presentations. “Organ transplant recipients are at a higher risk for skin cancer when compared to the broader population and have access to a limited number of treatment options given that systemic immunotherapy is typically contra-indicated,” said Sushil Patel, Ph.D., CEO of Replimune. “These data show RP1 as monotherapy has clear anti-tumor activity and may be a safe and effective treatment option for these patients with an overall response rate of nearly 35 percent with good durability of benefit to date.” About ARTACUSARTACUS is a multicenter, open-label, two-part Phase 1b/2 study evaluating RP1 as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignancies in patients who underwent a kidney, liver, heart, lung, or other solid organ transplant, or hematopoietic cell transplantation, who are on chronic immunosuppressive treatment, in whom systemic immunotherapy is typically contra-indicated. Researchers will assess the safety of RP1 and also evaluate its ability to shrink tumors. ARTACUS is currently recruiting patients.

The poster pertains to the Company's collaboration with BioView, for which ANGLE is developing an end-to-end assay for the evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification and protein expression in circulating tumour cells (CTCs) harvested using the Parsortix system from the blood of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. The presented data showcases the development and analytical validation of this assay using the BioView Allegro Plus, an automated, high-throughput platform for imaging and identification of CTCs. The system facilitates the assessment of CTC classification, HER2 biomarker expression, and assessment of HER2 gene copy number by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization.ANGLE's in-house study reports the successful identification of the HER2 protein and gene copy information from cell targets with minimal cell loss. The analysis of clinical samples using the assay has demonstrated the ability to detect HER2 positive CTCs in patients who were previously HER2 negative based on a primary tissue biopsy. This assay is being developed as a product kit for minimally invasive identification of HER2 positive and HER2 low patients, who may benefit from HER2-targeted therapies and HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. The ability to monitor HER2 status over time from repeat blood samples may provide valuable data for assessing treatment options. The combination of ANGLE's Parsortix system for harvesting CTCs for analysis, BioView's imaging and analysis technologies, and the new HER2 CTC staining kit under development is intended to provide an easy to use assay based on a simple blood test, providing an up-to-date HER2 status for breast cancer patients on a repeat basis.The evaluation of HER2 status via tissue biopsy is the current standard of care for guiding breast cancer patient treatment plans. However, tissue biopsy is invasive and difficult to repeat throughout the patient care pathway. Moreover, discordance between a primary tumour sample and a metastatic site is common. Liquid biopsy evaluation of HER2 status is a minimally invasive technique, suitable for repeat monitoring and capturing changes in disease status during and after treatment. Specifically, CTCs, as a liquid biopsy analyte have shown considerable potential to provide key information on HER2 status in breast cancer patients. One third-party study of 575 breast cancer patients found that HER2 status had changed in 38% of patients from the original primary tissue biopsy to the metastatic tissue biopsy, at disease recurrence1.ANGLE Chief Scientific Officer, Karen Miller, commented:""We are delighted to be presenting results from our HER2 assay development programme at the AACR's Annual Meeting as one of the key annual events in the cancer research calendar. We are excited to engage with the multidisciplinary community of attendees at this preeminent event to showcase this novel HER2 assay in partnership with BioView.""BioView Chief Scientific Officer, Chassidy Johnson commented:""We are pleased to present both analytical and clinical data to support this novel HER2 assay being developed in collaboration with ANGLE.

The 2024 winter drill program is expected to wrap up by the end of April with drilling at the Property scheduled to resume in early June.Darren L. Smith, Vice President of Exploration for the Company, comments: ""The 2023 drill program at CV13 was very successful and confirmed spodumene pegmatite over an approximate 2.3 km strike length, as well as down dip more than 300 m. The pegmatite remains open along strike and to depth and has confirmed high-grade zones with multiple core samples over 5% Li2O (+60% spodumene). The discovery in CV23-311 is also very significant, returning our best reported intersection to date (28.7 m at 1.49% Li2O) at a depth not expected and with more cumulative width of pegmatite downhole than any other hole at CV13 through the 2023 program. This is a high-priority area for follow-up."" Mr. Smith continued, ""The results of our maiden drill program at CV9 are very encouraging and have demonstrated that the pegmatite can thicken dramatically up to 80 m interpreted true width, which is a strong indication of tonnage potential of the system. Although variably mineralized in spodumene (typically <5 to 15%), the drilling has demonstrated strong grades (>1% Li2O) over 7 to 10+ m intervals in addition to wider, more moderately mineralized zones (e.g., 30.6 m at 0.80% Li2O in CV23-345). Given the nature of lithium pegmatite systems, it is common for low to moderate grade zones to neighbour strongly mineralized zones. Therefore, the combination of thick pegmatite intercepts with spodumene common in the system is a key indicator of potential and we look forward to following up on these encouraging results. CV9 remains open along strike at both ends and to depth."" Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Patriot"") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce the remaining core assay results for drill holes completed in September to November 2023 at the CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites. The Corvette Property (the ""Property"" or ""Project""), wholly owned by the Company, is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, respectively, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1 and is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. CV13 Pegmatite, 2023 Drill ResultsDrill results for the remaining 20 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite are reported herein (Figure 1). These holes primarily target the near-surface and downdip extension of the principal pegmatite body along its western and eastern limbs. Results are highlighted by drill hole CV23-311 which returned 28.7 m at 1.49% Li2O, including 20.4 m at 2.03% Li2O, and represents a newly discovered zone at shallow depth (~135 m vertical depth from surface) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). This is the widest mineralized drill intercept reported to date from CV13. Additionally, the sum of all pegmatite intercepts in the hole totalled 71 m over 13 separate intervals, which is also the most pegmatite encountered in a single drill hole at CV13 reported to date. Although some of these additional intercepts have low to moderate spodumene contents, the presence of a marked increase in pegmatite intercepts downhole is significant and indicates a stacking of pegmatite dykes. Stacking of pegmatite dykes is an indicator of a potentially larger total volume of pegmatite which may have a reasonable potential to thicken and/or coalesce into a larger body down-dip, up-dip, or along strike. This area is of keen interest for follow-up. The most eastern drill hole (CV23-365) completed in 2023 at CV13, also the final hole of the 2023 drill program, returned 19.7 m at 0.43% Li2O, including 6.3 m at 1.22% Li2O. This is significant as it builds upon the 30+m pegmatite intersections from the 2022 drill holes in the area that were only weakly mineralized. The mineralized interval in CV23-365 supports a thickening of the pegmatite in this area, which is also now confirmed to be accompanied by material levels of spodumene mineralization. This area of CV13 is also of keen interest for follow-up. Moving northwest along the western arm at CV13, drill hole CV23-324 returned a strong intercept of 20.2 m at 1.16% Li2O, including 15.4 m at 1.49% Li2O (Figure 1). Geological cross-sections of this area interpret mineralized spodumene pegmatite traced down-dip at least 280 m (~130 m vertical depth from surface) (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Moving further northwest along the western arm, the principal pegmatite thins to <5 m at places, although remains open and often well mineralized. Results reported herein include 12.6 m at 0.80% Li2O, including 8.8 m at 1.07% Li2O (CV23-346), 7.8 m at 1.53% Li2O (CV23-336), and 6.3 m at 0.82% Li2O, including 2.5 m at 2.02% Li2O (CV23-360). The CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite is currently interpreted to be characterized by a principal ""upper"" dyke and a secondary ""lower"" dyke, as well as several subordinate sub-parallel dykes, and are collectively geologically modelled to be shallowly dipping northerly. The principal dyke (the ""upper"" dyke), dips typically between 20-25° and has been traced at depth to at least 300 m down-dip (vertical depth from surface of <150 m). Through 2023, the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite has been traced by drilling over an approximate 2.3 km strike length and remains open along strike at both ends and to depth (Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4). Its most eastern drill hole is situated ~3 km along geological trend to the southwest of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite (Figure 5). This highly prospective corridor, also coincident with a local structural and magnetic trend, remains to be drill tested. In 2024, through April 4, approximately 10,000 m in additional drilling has been completed at CV13 with core assays remaining to be reported for all of these holes. A maiden mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for CV13 is planned to be announced in Q3 2024, which will form part of a larger MRE for the Corvette Project including both the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites. Core sample assays for drill holes reported herein from the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite are presented in Table 1 for all pegmatite intersections >2 m. Drill hole locations and attributes are presented in Table 3. CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite, 2023 Drill ResultsDrill results for all 18 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite are reported herein (Figure 6). These drill holes are the first to test the spodumene pegmatite outcrop in the area. Wide intervals of variably mineralized spodumene-bearing pegmatite were intersected in this maiden drill program at CV9. Results include: 99.9 m at 0.39% Li2O, including 30.6 m at 0.80% Li2O (CV23-345).15.7 m at 0.76% Li2O, including 10.8 m at 1.00% Li2O (CV23-267).17.9 m at 0.69% Li2O, including 8.6 m at 1.03% Li2O (CV23-310).7.7 m at 1.35% Li2O (CV23-333).The results are encouraging and confirm widespread spodumene mineralization is present at depth at CV9. The pegmatite intersected in drill hole at CV9 is variably mineralized (typically <5 to 15% spodumene content), with strong grades (>1% Li2O) demonstrated over 7 to 10+ m intervals in addition to wider and more moderately mineralized zones (e.g., 30.6 m at 0.80% Li2O in CV23-345). High grades of spodumene pegmatite were also intercepted with multiple holes returning individual sample grades over 2% Li2O, including a peak sample high of 4.28% Li2O (over 0.6 m) in CV23–345 – the last drill hole of the program at CV9. Of particular significance is the demonstrated thickening of pegmatite from <5 m to ~80 m interpreted true width at depth. This is a strong indication of overall tonnage potential in the system. Additionally, due to internal fractionation of pegmatitic melts, it is common to have strong variability in grades over short distances which may result in low to moderate grades being immediately proximal to high grades. This, coupled with the common presence of spodumene in the system, is very encouraging and supports a considerable potential for wide and well mineralized intervals of spodumene pegmatite to be present at CV9 along strike and/or at depth. Following the maiden 2023 drill program, the interpreted orientation of the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite is steeply dipping northerly, with a possible plunge easterly (Figure 7), which is similar to the general orientation of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. At CV9, variably mineralized spodumene pegmatite has now been traced by drilling and outcrop over a distance of ~450 m and remains open along strike at both ends and at depth. The spodumene is typically present as centimetre (up to decimetre) size crystals hosted within a smoky quartz – feldspar pegmatite, with accessory tourmaline and mica (Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11). Core sample assays for drill holes reported herein from the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. A total of 42 drill holes completed in 2023 remain to be reported, all from the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. At the Corvette Property in 2024, through April 4, approximately 57,000 m of drilling have been completed – 47,000 m at CV5 and 10,000 m at CV13 – with eleven (11) drill rigs active at site. The 2024 winter drill program is expected to wrap up by the end of April with drilling at the Property scheduled to resume in early June. An updated mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for the Corvette Project, including both the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites, is planned for Q3 2024. The MRE update will focus on an increase in confidence from the inferred to indicated categories for CV5, as well as a maiden estimate for CV13. 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Largest in the Americas based on contained LCE. Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)A Quality Assurance / Quality Control protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5%. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and coarse-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation. All core samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which includes drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. The pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). About the CV Lithium TrendThe CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.4 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, eight (8) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, CV13, and the recently discovered CV14. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

Appendix 1 – JORC Code 2012 Table 1 (ASX Listing Rule 5.7.1)Section 1 – Sampling Techniques and Data Criteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Sampling techniques • Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialized industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. • Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. • Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the Public Report. • In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverized to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. • Core sampling protocols meet industry standard practices. • Core sampling is guided by lithology as determined during geological logging (i.e., by a geologist). All pegmatite intervals are sampled in their entirety (half-core), regardless if spodumene mineralization is noted or not (in order to ensure an unbiased sampling approach) in addition to ~1 to 3 m of sampling into the adjacent host rock (dependent on pegmatite interval length) to ""bookend"" the sampled pegmatite. • The minimum individual sample length is typically 0.3-0.5 m and the maximum sample length is typically 2.0 m. Targeted individual pegmatite sample lengths are 1.0 m. • All drill core is oriented to maximum foliation prior to logging and sampling and is cut with a core saw into half-core pieces, with one half-core collected for assay, and the other half-core remaining in the box for reference. • Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Drilling techniques • Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). • NQ size core diamond drilling was completed for all holes. Core was not oriented. Drill sample recovery • Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. • Measures taken to maximize sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. • Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. • All drill core was geotechnically logged following industry standard practices, and includes TCR, RQD, ISRM, and Q-Method. Core recovery is very good and typically exceeds 90%. Logging • Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. • Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. • The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. • Upon receipt at the core shack, all drill core is pieced together, oriented to maximum foliation, metre marked, geotechnically logged (including structure), alteration logged, geologically logged, and sample logged on an individual sample basis. Core box photos are also collected of all core drilled, regardless of perceived mineralization. Specific gravity measurements of pegmatite are also collected at systematic intervals for all pegmatite drill core using the water immersion method, as well as select host rock drill core. • The logging is qualitative by nature, and includes estimates of spodumene grain size, inclusions, and model mineral estimates. • These logging practices meet or exceed current industry standard practices. Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation • If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. • If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. • For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. • Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize representivity of samples. • Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. • Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. • Drill core sampling follows industry best practices. Drill core was saw-cut with half-core sent for geochemical analysis and half-core remaining in the box for reference. The same side of the core was sampled to maintain representativeness. • Sample sizes are appropriate for the material being assayed. • A Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC) protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs) into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5% each. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and course-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation at a secondary lab. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests • The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. • For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. • Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. • Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). • The Company relies on both its internal QAQC protocols (systematic use of blanks, certified reference materials, and external checks), as well as the laboratory's internal QAQC. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Verification of sampling and assaying • The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. • The use of twinned holes. • Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. • Discuss any adjustment to assay data. • Intervals are reviewed and compiled by the VP Exploration and Project Managers prior to disclosure, including a review of the Company's internal QAQC sample analytical data. • Data capture utilizes MX Deposit software whereby core logging data is entered directly into the software for storage, including direct import of laboratory analytical certificates as they are received. The Company employs various on-site and post QAQC protocols to ensure data integrity and accuracy. • Adjustments to data include reporting lithium and tantalum in their oxide forms, as it is reported in elemental form in the assay certificates. Formulas used are Li2O = Li x 2.153, and Ta2O5 = Ta x 1.221. Location of data points • Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. • Specification of the grid system used. • Quality and adequacy of topographic control. • Each drill hole's collar has been surveyed with a RTK Trimble Zephyr 3 or RTK Topcon GR-5. • The coordinate system used is UTM NAD83 Zone 18. • The Company completed a property-wide LiDAR and orthophoto survey in August 2022, which provides high-quality topographic control. • The quality and accuracy of the topographic controls are considered adequate for advanced stage exploration and development, including mineral resource estimation. Data spacing and distribution • Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. • Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. • Whether sample compositing has been applied. • At CV5, drill hole collar spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, tightens to ~50 m in multiple areas, and widens to ~150 m in a small number of areas. Several collars are typically completed from the same pad at varied orientations resulting in more varied pegmatite pierce points at depth. • At CV13, drill hole spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, collar locations and hole orientations may vary widely, which reflect the varied orientation of the pegmatite body along strike. • At CV9, drill hole collar spacing is irregular with varied hole orientations and multiple collars on the same pad. • It is interpreted that most of the drill hole spacing is sufficient to support a mineral resource estimate. • Core sample lengths typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 m and average ~1 m. Sampling is continuous within all pegmatite encountered in the drill hole. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure • Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. • If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. • No sampling bias is anticipated based on structure within the mineralized body. • The principal mineralized bodies are relatively undeformed and very competent, although have some meaningful structural control. • At CV5, the principal mineralized body and adjacent lenses are steeply dipping resulting in oblique angles of intersection with true widths varying based on drill hole angle and orientation of pegmatite at that particular intersection point. i.e., the dip of the mineralized pegmatite body has variations in a vertical sense and along strike, so the true widths are not always apparent until several holes have been drilled (at the appropriate spacing) in any particular drill-fence. • At CV13, the principal pegmatite body has a shallow varied strike and northerly dip. • At CV9, the orientation and geometry of the pegmatite is not well understood. The pegmatite is currently interpreted to be comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. Sample security • The measures taken to ensure sample security. • Samples were collected by Company staff or its consultants following specific protocols governing sample collection and handling. Core samples were bagged, placed in large supersacs for added security, palleted, and shipped directly to Val-d'Or, QC, being tracked during shipment along with Chain of Custody. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were cross-referenced with the shipping manifest to confirm all samples were accounted for. At the laboratory, sample bags are evaluated for tampering. Audits or reviews • The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. • A review of the sample procedures for the Company's 2021 fall drill program (CF21-001 to 004) and 2022 winter drill program (CV22-015 to 034) was completed by an Independent Competent Person and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada"", by Alex Knox, M.Sc., P.Geol., Issue Date of June 27th, 2022.) • A review of the sample procedures through the Company's 2023 winter drill program (through CV23-190) was completed by an independent Competent Person with respect to the CV5 Pegmatite's maiden mineral resource estimate and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled "" NI 43–101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property"" by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. • Additionally, the Company continually reviews and evaluates its procedures in order to optimize and ensure compliance at all levels of sample data collection and handling. Section 2 – Reporting of Exploration Results Criteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Mineral tenement and land tenure status • Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. • The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. • The Corvette Property is comprised of 424 CDC claims located in the James Bay Region of Quebec, with Patriot Battery Metals Inc. being the registered title holder for all of the claims. The northern border of the Property's primary claim block is located within approximately 6 km to the south of the Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of CV5, respectively. • The Company holds 100% interest in the Property subject to various royalty obligations depending on original acquisition agreements. DG Resources Management holds a 2% NSR (no buyback) on 76 claims, D.B.A. Canadian Mining House holds a 2% NSR on 50 claims (half buyback for $2M) and Osisko Gold Royalties holds a sliding scale NSR of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2% on all other products, over 111 claims. The CV5 and CV9 pegmatites are subject to a 2% royalty. The vast majority of the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as is currently delineated, is not subject to a royalty. • The Property does not overlap any atypically sensitive environmental areas or parks, or historical sites to the knowledge of the Company. There are no known hinderances to operating at the Property, apart from the goose harvesting season (typically mid-April to mid-May) where the communities request helicopter flying not be completed, and potentially wildfires depending on the season, scale, and location. • Claim expiry dates range from February 2025 to November 2026. Exploration done by other parties • Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. • No core assay results from other parties are disclosed herein. • The most recent independent Property review was a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property, James Bay Region, Québec, Canada"", by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Geology • Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. • The Property overlies a large portion of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt, considered part of the larger La Grande River Greenstone Belt and is dominated by volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The claim block is dominantly host to rocks of the Guyer Group (amphibolite, iron formation, intermediate to mafic volcanics, peridotite, pyroxenite, komatiite, as well as felsic volcanics). The amphibolite rocks that trend east-west (generally steeply south dipping) through this region are bordered to the north by the Magin Formation (conglomerate and wacke) and to the south by an assemblage of tonalite, granodiorite, and diorite, in addition to metasediments of the Marbot Group (conglomerate, wacke). Several regional-scale Proterozoic gabbroic dykes also cut through portions of the Property (Lac Spirt Dykes, Senneterre Dykes). • The geological setting is prospective for gold, silver, base metals, platinum group elements, and lithium over several different deposit styles including orogenic gold (Au), volcanogenic massive sulfide (Cu, Au, Ag), komatiite-ultramafic (Au, Ag, PGE, Ni, Cu, Co), and pegmatite (Li, Ta). • Exploration of the Property has outlined three primary mineral exploration trends crossing dominantly east-west over large portions of the Property – Golden Trend (gold), Maven Trend (copper, gold, silver), and CV Trend (lithium, tantalum). The CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites are situated within the CV Trend. Lithium mineralization at the Property, including at CV5, CV13, and CV9, is observed to occur within quartz-feldspar pegmatite, which may be exposed at surface as high relief 'whale-back' landforms. The pegmatite is often very coarse-grained and off-white in appearance, with darker sections commonly composed of mica and smoky quartz, and occasional tourmaline. • The lithium pegmatites at Corvette are categorized as LCT Pegmatites. Core assays and ongoing mineralogical studies, coupled with field mineral identification and assays, indicate spodumene as the dominant lithium-bearing mineral on the Property, with no significant petalite, lepidolite, lithium-phosphate minerals, or apatite present. The pegmatites also carry significant tantalum values with tantalite indicated to be the mineral phase. Drill hole Information • A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: o easting and northing of the drill hole collar o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar o dip and azimuth of the hole o down hole length and interception depth o hole length. • If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. • Drill hole attribute information is included in a table herein. • Pegmatite intersections of <2 m are not typically presented as they are considered insignificant. Data aggregation methods • In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. • Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. • The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. • Length weighted averages were used to calculate grade over width. • No specific grade cap or cut-off was used during grade width calculations. The lithium and tantalum average of the entire pegmatite interval is calculated for all pegmatite intervals over 2 m core length, as well as higher grade zones at the discretion of the geologist. Pegmatites have inconsistent mineralization by nature, resulting in some intervals having a small number of poorly mineralized samples included in the calculation. Non-pegmatite internal dilution is limited to typically <3 m where relevant and intervals indicated when assays are reported. • No metal equivalents have been reported. Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths • These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. • If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. • If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known'). • At CV5, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports a principal, large pegmatite body of near vertical to steeply dipping orientation, flanked by several subordinate pegmatite lenses (collectively, the 'CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV13, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports an upper and lower pegmatite body, each trending sub-parallel to each other with a shallow northerly dip, as well as several other subordinate dykes (collectively, the 'CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV9, geological modelling and interpretation indicates CV9 is comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. A strike length of 450 m has been delineated through drilling and outcrop. • All reported widths are core length. True widths are not calculated for each hole due to the relatively wide drill spacing at this stage of delineation and the typical irregular nature of pegmatite, as well as the varied drill hole orientations. As such, true widths may vary widely from hole to hole. Diagrams • Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. • Please refer to the figures included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Balanced reporting • Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. • Please refer to the table(s) included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. • Results for pegmatite intervals <2 m are not reported. Other substantive exploration data • Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. • The Company is currently completing baseline environmental work over the CV5 and CV13 pegmatite area. No endangered flora or fauna have been documented over the Property to date, and several sites have been identified as potentially suitable for mine infrastructure. • The Company has completed a bathymetric survey over the shallow glacial lake which overlies a portion of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The lake depth ranges from <2 m to approximately 18 m, although the majority of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, as delineated to date, is overlain by typically <2 to 10 m of water. • The Company has completed preliminary metallurgical testing comprised of HLS and magnetic testing, which has produced 6+% Li2O spodumene concentrates at >70% recovery on both CV5 and CV13 pegmatite material, indicating DMS as a viable primary process approach, and that both CV5 and CV13 could potentially feed the same process plant. A DMS test on CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite material returned a spodumene concentrate grading 5.8% Li2O at 79% recovery, strongly indicating potential for a DMS only operation to be applicable. • No metallurgical work has been completed on the CV9 pegamtite. • Various mandates required for advancing the Project towards economic studies have been initiated, including but not limited to, environmental baseline, metallurgy, geomechanics, hydrogeology, hydrology, stakeholder engagement, geochemical characterization, as well as transportation and logistical studies. Further work • The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). • Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. • The Company intends to continue drilling the pegmatites of the Corvette Property, focused on the CV5 Pegmatite and adjacent subordinate lenses, as well as the CV13 and CV9 pegmatites.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 03:00 AM TORONTO, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd. (TSX: WDO, OTCQX: WDOFF) (“Wesdome” or the “Company”) today provides an update regarding its underground exploration activities at the Company’s 100% owned Kiena Mine in Val d'Or, Quebec. Highlights Include:Kiena Deep - Footwall Zone (Figure 1, Table 1)1 The latest drilling results have continued to better define the Footwall Zone: Hole N127-6913: 55.6 g/t Au over 3.5 m core length (25.7 g/t Au capped, 2.0 m true width)Hole N127-6912: 13.8 g/t Au over 11.1 m core length (13.8 g/t Au capped, 5.0 m true width); and 22.0 g/t Au over 6.7 m core length (19.6 g/t Au capped, 3.0 m true width) Hole N127-6890: 35.7 g/t Au over 5.3 m core length (20.9 g/t Au capped, 3.0 m true width) Kiena Deep - South Limb Zone (Figure 2, Table 1) 1 Drilling continues to extend this zone down plunge and confirm the continuity of high-grade mineralization: Hole N103-6807W5: 30.3 g/t Au over 5.8 m core length (17.7 g/t Au capped, 5.0 m true width)Hole N103-6807W4: 25.2 g/t Au over 6.0 m core length (18.4 g/t Au capped, 1.6 m true width) Wish Zone area (Figure 3, Table 1) 2 Initial reconnaissance drilling closer to surface has intersected high-grade gold values similar to those at Kiena Deep: Hole N033-6901: 36.4 g/t Au over 1.5 m core length 1. Assays capped at 90.0 g/t Au. True widths are estimated based on 3D models where available.2. Assays uncapped. True widths currently unavailable. Ms. Anthea Bath, President and Chief Executive Officer commented: “we expect that 2024 will see a significant increase in exploration at Wesdome with approximately $30 million budgeted between our two sites, or 185,000 meters across surface and underground exploration as well as delineation drilling. Currently, we are seeing immediate returns from this stepped-up effort at Kiena, with results that are not only expanding and defining existing zones at Kiena Deep, but also identifying potentially significant gold mineralization in historically underexplored areas like Wish from the 33-level. As the main ramp at Kiena Deep progresses towards the 136-level by year end, additional drill platforms are being established to facilitate drilling in previously discovered but not fully explored zones. Initial drilling at both the Footwall and South Limb zones is being used to better define the high-grade mineralization with a view to converting existing Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. Drilling is also expected to continue to build upon our early success and aim to expand and extend the known size of these zones. In the shallower Wish Zone area, the first hole we drilled from 33-level returned a high grade interval, which combined with other results in the same area, suggests the potential for additional high-grade lenses. This is highly prospective, and we expect to follow up this area with an expanded drill program in the coming months. Furthermore, as 33-level development is currently being rehabilitated further east of this zone, we expect to have more optimal drilling platforms available from the eastern side of the interpreted zone in the second half of 2024. We underscore that these initial high-grade results are all in proximity to our existing underground infrastructure such that they could be low-cost to develop and potentially provide additional operational flexibility as we optimize the asset. With Kiena Deep open down-plunge, and significant gold mineralization being identified closer to surface at Wish, Presqu'île and Dubuisson, we expect Kiena’s track record of exploration success to continue,” Ms. Bath added. Technical DetailsOver the past several years, underground drilling has primarily focussed on testing areas proximal to the Kiena Deep A Zone. As part of this exploration focus, early success discovered the Footwall zones in 2021. Subsequently in 2022, exploration confirmed the presence of the South Limb at depth in a folded area of the Kiena Deep A Zone (see press release dated June 1, 2022), suggesting potential to expand the folded high grade structure. Later in 2022, drilling intersected two new zones in the relative high rock quality hanging wall basalt that returned up to 2,850 g/t Au over 1.5 meters (see press release dated November 16, 2022). The Kiena Deep A Zone now extends continuously from 1,100 meters below surface and beyond current resources which extend to approximately 1,800 meters. More recently, drilling has been focussed on the South Limb and the Footwall zones and will continue to increase as exploration platforms become more available with the deepening of the main Kiena ramp. Growth in resource inventory in these areas has the potential to increase ounces per vertical meter and thereby provide opportunities for operational flexibility and increasing production from each level. Additional drill platforms at depth will also provide an opportunity to test the previously discovered Hanging Wall Zone in the Basalt as well as follow up on areas northeast of Kiena Deep for a parallel structure. The Wish Zone area has remained underexplored until 2024. Initial reconnaissance drilling in 2024 approximately one kilometer east of the Kiena mine from the existing 33 level development has intersected narrow, high grade gold mineralization from quartz veining within a horizon of competent basalt, in contact with sheared ultramafic rocks. These results, combined with historic hole 4344 (65.5 g/t Au over 1.0 m core length), have identified gold mineralization proximal to the contact over 300 meters along strike (See Figure 3). Follow-up drilling is expected to focus on extrapolating this contact and related gold mineralization at depth, to provide an initial assessment of the size and potential continuity of the mineralization. About WesdomeWesdome is a Canadian focused gold producer with two high grade underground assets, the Eagle River mine in Ontario and the recently commissioned Kiena mine in Quebec.

The latest drilling results include high-grade gold intersections such as 55.6 g/t Au over 3.5 m core length in Hole N127-6913. What is the budget allocated for exploration at Wesdome in 2024? Approximately $30 million is budgeted for exploration at Wesdome in 2024. What is the significance of the results at the Wish Zone area? The results at the Wish Zone area suggest the potential for additional high-grade gold mineralization in historically underexplored areas near the Kiena Deep mine. How has the exploration focus evolved at Kiena Deep over the past few years? The exploration focus has shifted towards identifying new zones like the Footwall and South Limb zones, expanding the folded high-grade structure, and increasing resource inventory to enhance operational flexibility and production. What are the future exploration plans for the Wish Zone area? Future exploration plans include drilling to extrapolate the gold mineralization at depth and assess the size and continuity of the mineralization in the Wish Zone area."

The results included 5.00m of 2.33%, 4.10m of 2.81%, and 4.00m of 1.26% Li2O at the White Ridge Target and 5.30m of 1.25% Li2O at Morning Star. These and other surface samples collected were designed to augment the Phase II, 2023 drilling program as well as determine that this technique can and will be applied to future surface exploration programs planned in Q3 of this year.Sample locations include: Morning Star, South Morning Star, White Ridge, and Midnight Owl.Channel Sample Highlights:5.00m @ 2.33% Li20 at White Ridge4.10m @ 2.81% Li2O at White Ridge4.00m @ 1.26% Li2O at White Ridge5.30m @ 1.25% Li2O at Morning Star4.00m @ 0.43 % Li2O at South Morning Star2.90m @ 2.31% Li2O at Midnight OwlHighlightsA total of 77 samples were collected from strategic targets across the San Domingo project, with locations designed to supplement drill holes that contain lithium (spodumene) mineralization, particularly those that could result in mineable resources;Some locations were chosen as a result of newly exposed spodumene bearing pegmatites at new drill sites;White Ridge channel samples correspond to drill hole SD-DH23-072, confirming continuity of spodumene rich pegmatite, indicates mineralization is open to the north and at depth;Channel samples at Morning Star drill site SD-DH23-090 cut, 5.30m at 1.25% Li2O, clearly connect and add confidence in continuity, building on resource potential;The channel samples at Midnight Owl likely connect to drill hole SD-DH23-049 which had an intercept of 6.35m @ 0.83% Li2O and 3.05m of 1.03% (see 11 Nov 2023 Press Release for details), a distance of 55m from surface.The Company is capitalizing on surface lithium mineralization exposures through channel sample techniques and by connecting to drill holes; this continues to demonstrate open cut potential and in part, will drive the next exploration program.Ian Stalker, Executive Chair, commented:""We are highly encouraged by the surface channel samples taken at our San Domingo Project, which was designed to test multiple sample locations and provide further data that can be integrated into our planned work programme whilst targeting resource development. We believe that these high-grade samples bode extremely well for the potential of the asset in its entirety, and reaffirms favourable results from both previous sampling undertaken by Bradda, as well as the historic sampling.Looking forward, the success of this cost-effective and efficient technique is also a notable positive, particularly as we look to further our surface exploration in Q3 of this year. This demonstrates our innovative thinking in regard to how to best maximise our resources, and so far, we are having great success.""Channel samples collected at White Ridge mine cut returned excellent results, including 5.00m at 2.33% and 4.10m at 2.81% Li2O. Each of the three sample groups at White Ridge are separated by roughly 2.0m, where sample material was unavailable. The results strengthen Bradda's confidence that the values represent viable thicknesses in these steeply dipping pegmatites. The sample locations are correlative to drill hole SD-DH23-072 intercept which carries 5.18m @ 0.88% Li2O (see January 16, 2024 RNS for drill hole intercepts), see Figure 1 below. The shallow mineralization in the mine cut and at depth in the drill hole is open to the north.Figure 1. White Ridge channel sample locations and values in percent, drill hole intercept and surface projection.The sampling on the surface at Morning Star and near the center of this target, contains 5.30m a 1.25% Li2O, which is proximal to drill hole SD-DH23-090 where 2.80m of 0.655% Li2O was encountered within a broader zone of 17.43m at 0.18% Li2O (see Figure 2 below). Towards the north end of Morning Star and proximal to drill hole SD-DH23-093 is an isolated 0.80m sample running 5.337% Li2O. Hole SD-DH23-093 contains 8.99m at 1.20% Li2O, which could link to the 5.337% surface sample, providing opportunity for expansion in this part of Morning Star.Mine cut channels collected at South Morning Star, resulted in 4.00m of 0.43% Li2O. This interval is very proximal and above drill hole SD-DH23-099 which contains 6.69m at 0.576% Li2O followed by 5.55mm at 1.034% Li2O.The mine cut at Midnight Owl was sampled, resulting in a 2.90m interval running 2.31% Li2O. This interval is the up-dip correlation to intervals seen in our drill holes, such as hole SD-DH23-049 which has 6.35m at 0.83% Li2O followed by 3.05m at 1.03% Li2O (see Figure 3). These drill hole intercepts are interpreted to connect with the surface channel samples, a vertical distance of 55m. Several areas within the historic mine were inaccessible due to steep walls or obvious spodumene which was out of reach. Outcrops above and outside the mine were also sampled to provide information on natural exposures.Figure 2. Morning Star channel samples and relevant drill hole intercepts.Elevated to well mineralized lithium-rich channel samples also contained very anomalous amounts of tin, tantalum, caesium, niobium, and rubidium, again typifying the LCT nature of this pegmatite district.Bradda Head considers this channel sample program a success and will continue to implement this technique over the property on pegmatites that are reasonably accessible, visibly lithium-bearing, offering the opportunity to collect clean samples over continuous lengths and subsequently adding value to future drill targeting.The sampling procedures were designed for integration into 3-D models that could lead to development of shallow resources. Sample cuts were made with a diamond saw along contiguous exposures, adding certified standards for every 10th sample, similar to our drill holes. Cuts were dominantly horizontal and along pegmatite exposures with a diamond handheld core saw. Two parallel cuts were made at 4-5cm apart and the material between the cuts was sampled to depths of 2-3cm.Figure 3 above. Midnight Owl channel samples and nearby drill holes.Figure 4 above. Location map of channel samples, property, drilling, landBasin Drilling UpdateThe drilling at Basin is progressing well, with the Company completing its second drill hole, encountering >80 meters of Upper Clay in both holes and finding encouraging thicknesses of between 25 to 35m of the Lower Clay unit. The first two holes have been logged, sampled, and shipped to the laboratory for analysis.QAQCChannel samples cut in the field under the supervision of Joey Wilkins.

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.Indicated Mineral ResourceThat part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings, and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.SnTinTa2O5Tantalum pentoxideForward-Looking StatementsNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

On this occasion, Patrick Pouyanné reaffirmed to the Prime Minister that TotalEnergies, operator of the project, and its international partners ExxonMobil, Santos, JX Nippon, are fully committed to Papua LNG. In particular, he shared the high interest of several LNG buyers for off-taking LNG from Papua LNG due to its strategic location close to key Asian markets. He also informed the Prime Minister that, after receiving first EPC offers, it appears that the project will need to keep working with contractors to obtain commercially viable EPC contracts and requires more work to reach FID. In that view, the project will review the structure of some packages and open the competition to an enlarged panel of Asian contractors. As a consequence, FID of Papua LNG project is now expected in 2025. The Prime Minister and Patrick Pouyanné agreed that this slight delay will not affect the early works planned in Papua New Guinea in 2024 and that the project will maintain its full support to local population of Gulf Province. This demonstrates the commitment of TotalEnergies to the well-being of the people of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, Patrick Pouyanné announced that TotalEnergies intends to drill the first deepwater exploration well on the PPL 576 license in 2025. *** About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 02:00 AM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sirona Biochem Corp. (TSX-V: SBM) (FSE: ZSB) (OTC: SRBCF) (“Sirona” or the “Company”) provides the following update: Dear shareholders, We are pleased to provide an update on our recent milestones and strategic decisions shaping Sirona Biochem’s path forward. AGM Last week, during our Annual General Meeting (AGM), we successfully gained another year of backing for our management team. Although it's common for many shareholders to abstain from voting, we're pleased to report that we've received numerous messages from our shareholders expressing their support for our ongoing corporate strategy. Financing We have closed our financing well below its anticipated goal. The small cap marketplace in the Canadian market is very challenged at this time. Our past supporting brokers do not have the fund-raising capabilities of the past. Instead of dropping the financing share price we are in discussion with investment funds to assist with our financial needs. This includes funds based in Europe, North America, and Asia, linking future investments to our commercialization of GlycoProteMimTM. The commercialization of GlycoProteMimTM offers substantial potential for financial returns, benefits from clinically validated technology, and has a relatively swift path to generating revenue. We persist in exploring non-dilutive funding sources from France and Canada as our preferred financing option whenever feasible. Branding of GlycoProteMimTM (TFC-1326) We have successfully selected the brand name for our anti-aging product. We will soon be proceeding with the formal trademark registration. The name will be made public closer to launch. Our cosmetic branding expert, based in Paris, is currently concentrating on developing brand messaging to establish this new product line as a premium offering in the anti-aging market. Preparation for Commercialization of GlycoProteMimTM We are on track for a commercial launch of our first consumer products containing GlycoProteMimTM in Europe and North America in early 2025 through our subsidiary, Sirona Laboratories, with plans to expand to other international markets afterward. Additionally, we've expanded our strategy to include the development of a second GlycoProteMimTM-infused product. Our brand and marketing team is convinced that broadening our product range is essential for achieving the best market penetration and ensuring consumer satisfaction. An initial production batch of custom cosmetic containers, tailor-made for our products, is currently being manufactured by a premier French company. We have engaged a South Korean specialist in product label design to create our labels. Furthermore, a renowned Parisian facialist is crafting a specific massage protocol for the application of our products. Product Samples The demand for product samples has arisen earlier in the development phase than expected, prompting us to adjust our plans to accommodate this interest. It's clear that people are eager to physically interact with the product themselves. At this point, our capability to provide samples is limited to key potential stakeholders around the world who require a hands-on experience with the product to build their investment confidence. Overall GlycoProteMimTM Strategy Our strategy involves launching in Europe and North America in early 2025, with a view to exploring licensing opportunities in pivotal markets such as South Korea, Japan, and China, where partnering is the favored approach for market entry. We foresee a variety of commercialization paths. Possessing established products significantly enhances our ability to achieve this objective. Key contacts have been pinpointed, and we are in the process of identifying additional ones. Our strategy does not encompass any solitary licensing agreement. Our patent application for GlycoProteMimTM spans 54 countries, encompassing all major markets. Pipeline Sirona Biochem is currently honing its focus on the cosmetic and therapeutic skincare sector, where we identify the most significant commercial potential. Our pipeline includes a variety of projects, some of which have been made public, while others are kept under wraps due to competitive reasons and intellectual property concerns. Our scientific team is continuously at the forefront of innovation, discovering incredibly promising opportunities. TFC-1067 Global License Agreement Allergan Aesthetics is actively progressing with the integration of TFC-1067 into its product lineup. We will inform our shareholders of any developments as soon as it is feasible. The introduction of TFC-1067 into the market presents a significant chance to enhance our company’s value and expand our growth prospects. It's important for shareholders to recognize that this is a global licensing agreement, which represents a considerably greater value to Sirona compared to the prior supply agreement with Rodan and Fields. Summary Navigating the financial challenges in this market is complex, but we have strategies in place to address them. While there are concerns among shareholders about dilution, our plans carry substantial potential to benefit our shareholders significantly. Although some level of dilution may occur, our goal is to enhance value to a degree that more than validates our approach. The continued support from our shareholders is crucial for our collective success. About Sirona Biochem Corp.

Pharming announces completion of enrollment in pediatric clinical trial of leniolisib,2024-04-08T05:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Pharming Group N.V. completes patient enrollment in Phase III trial of leniolisib tablets for children with APDS, aiming for regulatory approval in 2025.","Pharming announces completion of enrollment in pediatric clinical trial of leniolisib Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Pharming Group N.V. completes patient enrollment in Phase III trial of leniolisib tablets for children with APDS, aiming for regulatory approval in 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The completion of patient enrollment in Pharming Group's Phase III clinical trial for leniolisib is a significant milestone for the company, as it marks a step closer to potentially expanding the drug's indication to a younger pediatric population. The trial's successful execution could pave the way for a new treatment option for children with APDS, a demographic that currently has limited therapeutic choices.From a medical research perspective, the focus on the primary efficacy endpoints—reduction in index lymph node size and an increase in naïve B cells—reflects a targeted approach to address the pathological manifestations of APDS. These endpoints are important for demonstrating the drug's direct impact on the disease's biomarkers and its potential to improve patients' immune function.Furthermore, the inclusion of health-related quality of life measures as secondary endpoints is commendable. It shows a holistic understanding of the disease's impact on the patient's daily life, which is vital for evaluating the broader benefits of leniolisib beyond clinical metrics. Pediatric Healthcare Specialist As a Pediatric Healthcare Specialist, the emphasis on early intervention with leniolisib in children aged 4 to 11 is noteworthy. Intervening at a younger age could indeed prevent the progression of immune-related complications associated with APDS, which can be debilitating over a lifetime.It's also important to recognize the unique challenges faced in pediatric trials, such as ensuring the safety and tolerability of treatments in a developing immune system. The open-label design of the trial will provide valuable data on leniolisib's safety profile in this young population, which is essential for regulatory approval and eventual clinical use.The study's international scope, with sites in the United States, Europe and Japan, enhances the diversity of the patient population and may improve the generalizability of the findings. This is particularly significant for rare diseases like APDS, where patient populations are often limited and geographically dispersed. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst An analysis of the business implications of Pharming Group's announcement reveals potential for market expansion and revenue growth. The pediatric approval of leniolisib, if granted, would allow Pharming to tap into a new segment of the APDS market, possibly increasing the drug's profitability.The strategic planning of regulatory filings starting in 2025 suggests a calculated approach to market entry, which could provide Pharming with a competitive edge in the rare disease pharmaceutical space. Moreover, the existing approval for patients 12 years and older could facilitate a smoother regulatory process for the pediatric indication due to the established safety and efficacy profile of leniolisib in an adjacent age group.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the outcomes of this Phase III trial closely, as positive results could lead to a significant uptick in the company's valuation, while any setbacks could have the opposite effect. It's also worth noting the potential for leniolisib to become a standard of care in APDS treatment, which would have long-term implications for the company's market share and industry standing. 04/08/2024 - 01:00 AM This multinational Phase III study is evaluating leniolisib tablets in children aged 4 to 11 years with APDS, a rare primary immunodeficiency Leiden, the Netherlands, April 8, 2024: Pharming Group N.V. (“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the completion of patient enrollment in its Phase III clinical trial (NCT05438407) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib, an oral, selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor, in children aged 4 to 11 years with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS). Leniolisib, marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S., received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023. Pharming plans to include data from this 4–11-year-old trial in regulatory filings worldwide for the approval of leniolisib for pediatric patients with APDS, beginning in 2025. Anurag Relan, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer of Pharming, commented: “This is the first clinical trial for younger pediatric patients with APDS, who have a significant unmet need for a disease modifying treatment. I am pleased with the progress made in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS. By intervening at a younger age, we may help prevent patients from developing immune-related complications that are likely to progress throughout their lives.” The study enrolled 21 children with APDS ages 4 to 11 years at sites in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The single-arm, open-label clinical trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of leniolisib. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical, social, emotional, and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire. These endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older. The first patient was dosed in November 2023 in a separate Phase III clinical trial that includes children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial. About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1, which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway, which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly, leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1,2,3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including severe, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and enteropathy.4,5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions, including other primary immunodeficiencies, it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease, this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time, including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide. About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate, which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation, cytokine production, cell survival, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Results from a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients, and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8,9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area, Canada, Australia and Israel and a regulatory submission has been made in the U.K., with plans to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS. About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Late-Breaking Research: Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics 1 Topic: IBI3001: a potentially first-in-class site-specific glycan-conjugated B7-H3/EGFR bispecific ADC for multiple solid tumorsAbstract Number: LB055Presentation Form: PosterPresentation Time: Sunday Apr 7, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMLocation: Poster Section 53Presenting Author: Dr. Kaijie He IBI3001 is a potentially first-in-class bispecific ADC against B7-H3 and EGFR that is site-specifically glycan-conjugated using the clinically validated SYNtecanE® platform. IBI3001 has multiple anti-tumor mechanisms of action: (1) enhanced EGFR signaling blockade; (2) EGFR- and B7-H3-aided payload internalization and cytotoxicity; and (3) potent bystander killing effects of ADC. The optimized B7-H3 arm not only enhances the EGFR signaling blockade but also reduces EGFR on-target toxicities. IBI3001 showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo across multiple solid tumors and is well tolerated with the therapeutic index at 40. Topic: IBI334, a novel ADCC-enhanced B7-H3/EGFR bispecific antibody, demonstrated potent pre-clinical efficacy in solid tumorsAbstract Number: LB056Presentation Form: PosterPresentation Time: Sunday Apr 7, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMLocation: Poster Section 53Presenting Author: Dr. Kaijie He IBI334 is an afucosylated bispecific antibody against B7-H3 and EGFR that is constructed using Innovent's proprietary Innobody platform. With the aid of B7-H3, IBI334 showed better tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo than EGFR monoclonal antibody and c-met/EGFR bispecific antibody benchmarks. IBI334 has a favorable safety profile with the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in cynomolgus monkeys at 120 mg/kg and a large therapeutic window of > 200 folds. As a promising bispecific antibody against multiple solid tumors, IBI334 is currently under clinical evaluation. Topic: Discovery and preclinical characterization of IBI343, a site-specific glycan-conjugated anti-Claudin18.2 ADC for treating solid tumorsAbstract Number: LB057Presentation Form: PosterPresentation Time: Sunday Apr 7, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMLocation: Poster Section 53Presenting Author: Dr. Kaijie He IBI343 is a potentially first-in-class anti-Claudin 18.2 ADC that is site-specifically glycan-conjugated to cytotoxin exatecan via Synaffix's GlycoConnect® technology. It demonstrated Claudin 18.2-specific in vitro cytotoxicity on a series of cancer cell lines at varying levels of target expression, and potent in vivo efficacy in multiple xenograft models. The glycan-based conjugation technology leads to enhanced stability of the ADC molecule. IBI343 displayed good safety profile in GLP toxicology study in rhesus monkey and was well tolerated up to 30 mg/kg. IBI343 has favorable pre-clinical efficacy and safety, and it is currently in preparation for Phase 3 clinical trial for Claudin-18.2-positive HER2-negative gastric cancer. Dr. Kaijie He, Vice President of Innovent, stated: ""We are pleased that the pre-clinical studies of our novel anti-cancer drugs are accepted for Late-Breaking Research poster presentation at the 2024 AACR conference. This is the result of dedicated work from scientists at Innovent Academy with the aim to tackle cancers with innovative drugs that are more effective and safer. With careful design and optimization, our molecules can achieve favorable therapeutic windows of 40 to more than 200 times. We look forward to their performance in clinical settings and hope that these innovations can eventually benefit cancer patients."" Poster Session: Immunology - Single Target and Bispecific Antibodies Topic: A novel TROP2-targeted immune stimulating antibody conjugate (ISAC) with potent anti-tumoral activity and acceptable safetyAbstract Number: 2718Presentation Form: PosterPresentation Time: Monday Apr 8, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMLocation: Poster Section 6Poster Board Number: 9Presenting Author: Dr. Huizhong Xiong Immune stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) are a unique class of ADC in which antibodies recognizing tumor antigens are conjugated with immune agonists. ISACs target tumor tissue and specifically activate intra-tumoral myeloid cells, unleashing downstream immune response. Like the other immune agonists, balance between efficacy and safety remains a challenge for ISACs. Here we describe a potential first-in-class TROP2 ISAC with rationally selected antibody and TLR7/8 agonist linker-payload. The anti-TROP2 antibody elicited robust ADCP of TROP2+ tumor cells by macrophages. In-vitro, TROP2 ISAC mildly activated myeloid cells only in the presence of TROP2+ tumor cells. In-vivo, the molecule potently suppressed tumor growth in different TROP2+ xenograft tumors, and effectively enhanced killing of an ADC. In terms of safety, the ISAC was tolerated in both WT and hTROP2KI mice, and, importantly, in monkeys. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel TROP2 ISAC with outstanding efficacy and manageable safety profile, which may benefit patients with TROP2+ tumors. Poster Session: Immunology - Immune Modulation Employing Agonist or Co-Stimulatory Approaches Topic: Tumor targeted-CD28 bispecific antibody with optimized potency, robust anti-tumoral activity and stringent CD3-dependenceAbstract Number: 5295Presentation Form: PosterPresentation Time: Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PMLocation: Poster Section 3Poster Board Number: 4Presenting Author: Dr. Huizhong Xiong We reported a rationally screened CD28 agonist antibody and its PSMAxCD28 bispecific format, IAR038. IAR038 has minimal activity in the absence of CD3, even under stringent conditions, different from benchmark antibody in clinical development. It demonstrated moderate activity in vitro in a CD3-dependent and PSMA-dependent manner. Notably, IAR038 elicited superior tumor killing in vivo and combined effectively with anti-PD1 antibody. In addition, it had an improved half-life compared with the Benchmark antibody. These features may translate to a wider therapeutic window and improved safety for CRPC patients. Dr. Huizhong Xiong, Senior Director of Immunology of Innovent, stated: ""We keep pushing for deeper understanding and more rational design of agonistic and costimulatory molecules. Our work on tumor targeted TLR7/8 agonist and tumor targeted CD28 antibody demonstrates the capability of our biology-driven drug development to achieve better balance between efficacy and safety, made possible by our advanced technology platforms.""

Its business includes notification services, marketing growth, development tools, and data products. As its sub-brand, MoonFox Data is a leading expert in data insights and analysis services across all scenarios, aiming to help companies gain market insights and empower precise decision-making. CHENGDU, China , April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On March 28, Xiaomi cars were officially launched on the market and announced with its selling price, which quickly ignited hot discussions. Within just half an hour of its listing, more than 50,000 sets were pre-ordered, indicating a worth-expecting market performance of Xiaomi cars. As a crucial action of Xiaomi Group to move into the high-end market, Xiaomi cars have initiatively invested substantial costs. In the continuously competitive automotive market environment in the future, what is the confidence of Xiaomi Group to continuously support the development of Xiaomi cars? MoonFox believes that the confidence of Xiaomi Group comes from three aspects: Firstly, the main business of Xiaomi Group has achieved stability, with obvious effect in quality improvement and efficiency enhancement in the group; Secondly, Xiaomi's high-end strategies have made gradual breakthroughs, gathering groups of high-potential users and responding to the questioning voice from the market; Thirdly, the life experience provided by intelligent ecology has become a necessary demand for many users, highlighting the unique advantages of Xiaomi cars. In the future, Xiaomi Group is being driven by a longtermism for development, and Xiaomi can pay attention to the high-end marketing publicity focusing on the foundation of young and high-potential user groups, to promote Xiaomi to continuously advance along the high-end way. I. Confidence I: In 2023, the core business of the Group recovered as a whole, and its operational efficiency reached a record high. Main Financial Indicators of Xiaomi Group in 2019-2023 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Total operating revenue (RMB million) 205,838.68 245,865.63 328,309.15 280,044.02 270,970.10 YoY 17.7 % 19.4 % 33.5 % -14.7 % -3.2 % Gross profit (RMB million) 28,554.03 36,751.86 58,260.94 47,577.20 57,476.20 YoY 28.7 % 28.7 % 58.5 % -18.3 % 20.8 % Operating profit (RMB million) 11,760.22 24,034.73 26,028.66 2,816.50 20,008.70 Profit before income tax (RMB million) 21,633.43 21,633.43 24,417.03 3,934.96 22,011.00 Annual profit (RMB million) 10,102.95 20,312.71 19,283.24 2,502.57 17,474.20 Measured based on the non-international financialreporting standard: Adjusted net profit (RMB million) 11,532.30 13,006.36 22,039.47 8,518.01 19,272.80 YoY 34.8 % 12.8 % 69.5 % -61.4 % 126.3 % Data source: Financial report of Xiaomi Group, sorted by Urora MoonFox Research Institute Founded in 2010, Xiaomi rapidly rose to prominence in the market with its advantages of ""affection to the people"" and ""cost performance"". After sustainable development, Xiaomi Group had entered a mature stage by 2019, developing into a well-known brand in China, with its market performance continuously improved. From 2019 to 2021, Xiaomi Group experienced substantial overall growth, and achieved record high in revenues and net profits in 2021. However, subject to the macro-environment changes, the intensified competition in the mobile phone market and the continuous influence of COVID-19, its overall performance declined in 2022 accordingly, showing that combined with the cost performance and brand image, Xiaomi is difficult to achieve significant development in this traditional main business of mobile phones. Therefore, it is an inevitable option for development for Xiaomi Group to move towards high-end products, explore new automobile businesses, reduce costs and increase efficiency. In 2023, Xiaomi adjusted its business, proposed the ""scale and profit"" strategy in management and significantly optimized the operation efficiency to improve the profitability. According to the 2023 financial report of Xiaomi, in 2023, Xiaomi Group achieved comprehensive revenue of RMB 271 billion, a gross profit of RMB 57.476 billion, and an adjusted net profit of RMB 19.3 billion with a year-on-year growth of 126.3%. Through the analysis of various main indicators, the reduction in sales costs made a significant contribution to the increase in operating profit. Compared to 2022, the sales costs decreased by RMB 18.973 billion year on year, with the sales cost of the smartphone business segment decreased by 11.3% year on year, driving Xiaomi Group's gross profit to reach RMB 57.5 billion in 2023. The overall gross profit margin reached 21.2%, reaching a record high. Xiaomi Group's strategy of improving quality and increasing efficiency has achieved its initial results. Xiaomi cars are the second growth curve that Xiaomi Group expected to achieve, and Xiaomi Group has invested more than RMB 10 billion into its R&D. The stable income from the Group's main business serves is an important support for Xiaomi to enter the intensely competitive automobile industry. Sales Cost of Xiaomi Group in 2020-2023 (Unit: RMB million) Year Sales cost 2020 209,113.80 2021 270,048.20 2022 232,466.80 2023 213,493.90 Data source: Annual financial reports of Xiaomi Group, sorted by Urora MoonFox Research Institute Comparison of Sales Costs of Various Segments of Xiaomi Group in 2022-2023 (Unit: RMB million) 2022 2023 2023 YoY Smartphone 152,248.4 134,480.7 -11.67 % IoT and living consumption products 68,296.4 67,029.1 -1.85 % Internet services 7,974.4 7,773.5 -2.52 % Others 3,947.6 4,210.6 +6.66 % Data source: Financial report of Xiaomi Group, sorted by Urora MoonFox Research Institute II. Confidence II: The high-end strategy has finally achieved results, and the Xiaomi brand has the possibility to move on a high-end way As a key battle in which Xiaomi expected to achieve leapfrog development, Xiaomi cars still faced constraints of the brand impression of ""cost performance"" before its launch. As early as 2020, Xiaomi Group had put forward the high-end strategy, however, the successive releases of Xiaomi 11 and 12 series did not make significant breakthroughs, and the market questioned ""whether Xiaomi brand could move on a high-end way"". However, in 2023, Xiaomi's high-end strategy made a strong back fight in the intelligent business segment. Xiaomi brand already has a considerable base of high-potential users, which will also provide an important support for Xiaomi cars to achieve significant sales volumes in the future. From the end of 2022 to 2023, Xiaomi successively launched high-end smartphone products such as the Xiaomi 13, Xiaomi 13 Pro and Xiaomi 14 series, which were developed in deep cooperation with Leica. Matched with Leica professional lenses and one-inch large sensors, etc., these two versions of series products focused on professional imaging experience as a selling point to drive the high-end brand image of Xiaomi smartphone series. According to the data of Xiaomi's financial reports, in 2023, Xiaomi's market share of smartphones in the price range of RMB 4,000-6,000 in Chinese mainland reached 16.9%, with a year-on-year increase of 9.2%, and in the fourth quarter of 2023, Xiaomi ranked the first in the sales volume in this price segment, so that Xiaomi could achieve a year-on-year increase of 19% in ASP (Average Selling Price) for smartphones in Chinese mainland in 2023. According to the user data of Xiaomi high-end series models, Xiaomi has captured a group of young, highly-educated and high-potential users. According to the MoonFox data, among the users of Xiaomi 14 model, more than 80% users are aged below 35, more than 80% users have obtained an education background of college education and above, and in terms of gender, male users account nearly 70%. It can be observed that the current consumers purchasing Xiaomi high-end models are highly educated young people of the post-80s and post-90s generations. From the perspective of the source and flow direction of model changes, in addition to the upgrading and updating of existing Xiaomi users, such model also attracts a considerable portion of users from the brands such as iPhone, Huawei and Honor, showing the user attraction of Xiaomi 14 in high-end price segments. User Portraits of Xiaomi 14 Model Gender Proportion Male 69.2 % Female 30.8 % Age Proportion Aged below 25 46.1 % Aged 26-35 40.2 % Aged 36-45 11.8 % Aged above 46 1.9 % Educational background Proportion TGI Junior college and undergraduate 81.0 % 111 Postgraduate and above 13.6 % 145 Data source: MoonFox iApp vendor version; Data cycle: 2024.02 Source brand for changes of Xiaomi 14 model Source brand Proportion Xiaomi 21.80 % iPhone 21.00 % Huawei 15.60 % Redmi 14.60 % Honor 6.90 % Data source: MoonFox iApp vendor version; 2024.02 III. Confidence III: Intelligent ecological experience has become a necessary demand for many users, highlighting the unique advantages of Xiaomi cars Another major selling point of Xiaomi cars is the ecological cooperation of ""people, automobile and family"". For example, in terms of ecological cooperation concepts put forward at the press conference of Xiaomi cars, such as ""voice preparation of automobile at home"" and ""automatic activation of home scenes upon the automobile's arrival in the community"", whether can Xiaomi make it attractive as a selling point? From the perspective of Xiaomi IoT and consumer goods business, it can be believed that the current market has already exhibited a high level of acceptance for the intelligent living experience, and the intelligent life has become a necessary demand for many users, which is also a unique advantage of Xiaomi compared to other manufacturers. Specifically, at present, Xiaomi Group's IoT and consumer goods business is still growing. In 2023, Xiaomi's revenue in this sector reached RMB 80.1 billion, the number of IoT equipment connected to Xiaomi AIoT platform reached 739 million, with a year-on-year increase of 25.5%, and the number of users with more than 5 sets of connected equipment reached 14.5 million, with a year-on-year increase of 25.3%. In terms of Mi Home App, an intelligent control terminal of Xiaomi IoT, MoonFox data show that the market penetration rate of Mi Home App continued to rise in 2023, rising from 19.4% in March 2023 to a level close to 30% in March 2024, with the average number of launches per person up to 3.57 times, higher than the average level for smart home industry. In December 2023, heavy users accounted for more than 50% of the Mi Home App users, indicating the strong user attraction and stickiness towards the intelligent living experience. Changes in the Penetration Rate of Xiaomi Mi Home App in the Smart Home Industry Date Penetration rate March 1, 2024 27.5 % February 1, 2024 22.8 % January 1, 2024 21.5 % December 1, 2023 21.3 % November 1, 2023 21.1 % October 1, 2023 20.7 % September 1, 2023 20.4 % August 1, 2023 20.1 % July 1, 2023 19.7 % June 1, 2023 19.6 % May 1, 2023 19.6 % April 1, 2023 19.6 % Data source: MoonFox iApp; Data cycle: March 2023 - March 2024 The statistical results only contain independent application client data, excluding ecological traffic data such as web pages, applets and Quick App. IV. Looking forward to the future: Capturing the young and high-potential groups, building a high-end brand, and establishing a new Xiaomi of technology for the next decade Xiaomi Group has set goals for a new decade, aiming to become a world-class hardcore technology enterprise with continuous R&D investment. At present, Xiaomi Group has made solid steps in its automobile business, but there is still a long way to go in the next decade to achieve high-end positioning and shape a hardcore technology image. The recent launch of Xiaomi cars is a testament to this point, and under the impression of the market's inherent view, Xiaomi products should be ""affordable"", which made Xiaomi cars face significant public sentiment challenges before its launch, exerting a certain impact on the pricing of Xiaomi cars to some extent. However, in the long run, we believe that Xiaomi still has the foundation to become a high-end brand in the market, and the user assets owned by Xiaomi brand is a key factor. Compared to other brands, Xiaomi brand has gathered a group of young, dynamic and quality-conscious youths, with the age concentrated between 20 and 35. This group contains both young and strong users with high consumption power and users who focus on quality but have yet to fully unleash their purchasing potential. Their common characteristics focus on trendy fashion, personalized and quality experience. For example, Xiaomi cars are designed with human-vehicle collaborative functions, which is the best way to attract this type of users. If Xiaomi can maintain the loyalty of this group, with the growth of these users, they will contribute higher revenue to Xiaomi brand in the next 10 years. On the other hand, in addition to the continuous increase of R&D investment and the focus on product quality and details, strengthening the high-end brand publicity is also a key factor. Although Xiaomi brand invests a lot in the quality design and parameters, the brand's tonality is still difficult to initiate more users' sense of identity. Xiaomi brand needs to try to break the circle-type high-end image marketing, continuously change the market's image perception towards Xiaomi brand. We believe that Xiaomi brand's approach of inviting the renowned actor Zhang Songwen to participate in the promotion of Xiaomi 13 smartphones in 2023 is worth persisting in, injecting effective vitality into the brand's high-end elements. For example, Xiaomi could try to propagandize through mainstream media (such as official media) and by inviting different celebrities professional driver experience and other means focusing on the current high popularity of Xiaomi cars, and carry out publicity focusing on the dimensions of Xiaomi cars such as design philosophy and performance, and human-vehicle collaboration experience to arouse the market users' thinking and imagination on the innovative experience of Xiaomi automobile and the innovative ability of Xiaomi brand, and guide users to further form a sense of substitution and a sense of identity for brands, gradually promoting the shaping of Xiaomi's high-end brand sense.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/07/2024 - 04:30 PM WATERTOWN, Mass. and GOSSELIES, Belgium, April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iTeos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITOS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients, today announced a poster presentation of preclinical data on EOS-984, a potential first-in-class small molecule inhibitor targeting the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) in oncology, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, being held April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, California. Based on the Company’s discovery and characterization of ENT1 in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression, this novel mechanism allows for the intracellular accumulation of adenosine, which then suppresses proliferation and effector function of T cells in the high adenosine tumor microenvironment. In mouse models, deletion of ENT1 led to potent control of tumor proliferation and increased CD8+ T cell frequency, proliferation, and cytokine production within tumors, further supporting ENT1’s role in tumor growth. In preclinical studies, blockade of intracellular adenosine accumulation by EOS-984 enabled proliferation of memory T cells and TILs despite high adenosine concentrations, resulting in the restoration of T cell function and enhanced tumor cell killing. Furthermore, combination of EOS-984 with anti-PD-1 therapy synergistically led to the control of tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of triple negative breast cancer resistant to anti-PD-1 blockade. Due to its mechanism of action, EOS-984 holds potential as a combination partner beyond anti-PD-1 therapy, including other immuno-oncology agents, cell therapies, and bispecific T cell engagers. EOS-984 is currently in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 trial in advanced malignancies. Topline data from the Phase 1 trial is anticipated in the second half of 2024. Abstracts are available on AACR’s website located at www.aacr.org. Posters will be archived in the Investors section of the Company’s website located at www.iteostherapeutics.com.

UMC Reports Sales for March 2024,2024-04-08T06:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"United Microelectronics  (UMC) reported unaudited net sales for March 2024, showing a 2.70% increase year-over-year. The revenues for the period from January to March 2024 also saw a 0.78% rise compared to the same period in 2023.","UMC Reports Sales for March 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary United Microelectronics (UMC) reported unaudited net sales for March 2024, showing a 2.70% increase year-over-year. The revenues for the period from January to March 2024 also saw a 0.78% rise compared to the same period in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales for United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) for March 2024 and the cumulative first-quarter revenue growth, reflects a modest year-over-year improvement. The 2.70% increase in March and 0.78% increase for the January-March period may seem marginal, but in the semiconductor industry, where production capabilities and market demand can fluctuate, consistent growth is a positive indicator. The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and even small gains can be significant in the context of global economic conditions and industry-specific challenges such as supply chain disruptions or changes in consumer electronics demand.Investors should consider these figures in the context of the broader semiconductor market trends, including competition, pricing pressures and technological advancements. With UMC being a key player in the foundry sector, these sales figures could indicate their ability to maintain or grow market share. However, investors should also be aware of the capital-intensive nature of the semiconductor industry, which may require significant investment in R&D and manufacturing facilities to sustain growth. Therefore, while the reported sales growth is a positive sign, it should be weighed against the company's future capital expenditure commitments and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst UMC's sales report provides insights into the demand for semiconductor products, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The modest year-over-year sales growth could suggest that UMC is maintaining steady demand for its semiconductor products despite potential market saturation or competition from other foundries. This growth might be driven by specific industry segments where UMC has a strong presence or through securing contracts with key customers. It's also essential to consider the impact of foreign exchange rates, as the figures are presented in New Taiwan Dollars and currency fluctuations can affect the perceived growth when converted to US dollars for international investors.Understanding the end markets for UMC's products is crucial. If the growth is driven by industries with strong future growth prospects, like automotive electronics or IoT devices, it could suggest a sustainable demand trajectory. Conversely, if the growth is primarily in segments facing potential downturns, like certain consumer electronics, caution may be warranted. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to shifting market demands will be vital for long-term success. Economist The reported figures by UMC should be analyzed within the larger economic environment. The semiconductor industry is a bellwether for the global economy due to its pervasive use in a multitude of products. A 2.70% year-over-year sales increase for a single month, coupled with a smaller 0.78% increase for the quarter, may indicate broader economic trends such as the state of global manufacturing, consumer spending and the impact of international trade policies. This growth, albeit modest, could be an early sign of stabilization or recovery in certain sectors that rely heavily on semiconductors.Additionally, Taiwan's geopolitical situation and its relationship with major markets, including China and the United States, can have significant implications for companies like UMC. Trade agreements, tariffs and intellectual property protections are all factors that can influence UMC's performance. As such, while the sales growth is a positive development, it must be contextualized within these larger economic and geopolitical frameworks to fully understand its implications for the company and its stakeholders. 04/08/2024 - 02:00 AM TAIPEI, Taiwan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE: UMC; TWSE: 2303) (“UMC”), today reported unaudited net sales for the month of March 2024.

The CFO, Jérôme Serve, emphasizes the alignment of the upgrade with the company's financial roadmap and the focus on improving financial performance, cash generation, and balance sheet deleveraging. Positive None. Negative None. Credit Analyst The upgrade of CGG's issuer credit rating by S&P Global Ratings is a positive signal to investors and creditors, indicating an improvement in the company's financial stability and creditworthiness. The shift from 'CCC+' to 'B-' suggests that the risk of default has decreased, which could lead to a reduction in borrowing costs and an enhanced ability to secure financing for future projects. This is particularly relevant for companies in the geoscience sector, where substantial capital is required for advanced equipment and research activities.From a credit analysis perspective, the acknowledgment of a 'markedly stronger financial performance' points towards effective management strategies and possibly, improved market conditions or operational efficiencies. Investors should note that while the upgrade is a step in the right direction, 'B-' is still considered speculative grade, indicating that there are still risks involved. It would be prudent to monitor the company's future financial reports and any strategic initiatives that might impact its ability to maintain or improve its credit rating. Investment Strategist The rating upgrade for CGG can have a ripple effect on investor sentiment and stock market performance. Typically, a higher credit rating can lead to an increase in stock price as market confidence grows. Investors might view this as a sign of a turnaround, especially when coupled with a focus on financial performance, cash generation and balance sheet deleveraging as mentioned by the CFO. However, it's important to contextualize this within the broader geoscience industry trends and CGG's competitive position.Investors should consider the long-term implications of CGG's strategic financial roadmap in relation to industry cycles. The geoscience sector is heavily influenced by commodity prices and technological advancements. An improvement in financial performance could be indicative of CGG's ability to adapt to industry changes and innovate. However, given the volatility of the sector, a conservative approach would be to assess the sustainability of CGG's growth and profitability before adjusting investment strategies. 04/08/2024 - 01:30 AM PARIS, France – April 8, 2024 CGG today announced that S&P Global Ratings (""S&P"") has upgraded the Company's issuer credit rating to 'B-' from 'CCC+'.

(CSE: CRC) (OTC Pink: CNRCF) (FSE: 6O1) (""Canter"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that, after interpreting recently acquired third party data and completing 3D modeling, the Company's technical team immediately mobilized to site to stake the limited open ground along the western edge of the Columbus Lithium-Boron Project (""Columbus"" or the ""Project""). The full surface sampling dataset, shown in Figure 1, includes highly anomalous lithium (""Li"") values along the Company's previous western boundary and beyond. Furthermore, the Company's 3D modeling, and particularly the HSAMT resistivity shells, highlighted a broadening and open-ended conductive zone trending west with only two (2) kilometres to the limits of the Company's previous property boundary (see press release dated March 30, 2024). The land package now stands at a commanding 29,600 acres (119 km²). ""We are thrilled to have significantly expanded our land package at Columbus to encompass the full extent of the most prospective ground for lithium-enriched brines before commencing our drill campaigns,"" stated Joness Lang, CEO of Canter Resources. ""Our team sees tremendous potential at Columbus and we are excited to get underway with Geoprobe drilling, which will commence imminently.""Watch: Video animation highlighting Columbus surface and 3D model results, newly staked ground and substantial Li-brine target with initial drill locations. Watch Video Here > The 3D modeling has been instrumental in revealing the expansive potential within the Columbus Project area. By carefully analyzing the geological structures and resistivity patterns, the Company has identified a westward-trending conductive zone that signifies a broadening corridor of potential lithium-bearing brines. This insight is critical, as it suggests a continuous zone extending beyond the original property boundaries (see Figure 1).Moreover, the HSAMT data has been pivotal in understanding the subsurface characteristics of the Project area. The HSAMT survey's leading edge terminated within an area exhibiting extremely low resistivity, indicative of highly conductive material likely associated with brine concentrations. This cutoff, due to the survey reaching its westernmost extent, aligned with the trend of anomalous lithium values in surface sediments extending westward. This discovery underpins the decision to expand the land package, thereby increasing the scope for further exploration and potential resource identification.Figure 1: Figure showing expanded land package, differentiating between current claim boundary and newly staked ground, highlighting the <0.5 ohm-metre HSAMT openness to the west and full third-party data including the western flank samples within previous boundary and extending beyond.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10112/204646_3118d57ac445eb1f_001full.jpgCanter Resources is now poised to implement a more comprehensive Phase II exploration program.

(PAAS) reports promising results from the La Colorada Skarn project in Mexico, with high-grade intercepts in drill holes. The company plans to update its mineral resource estimate in August 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Geologist The recent drill results from Pan American Silver Corp.'s La Colorada Skarn project are indicative of a significant mineralization, particularly with the discovery of high-grade silver, lead and zinc. The presence of such high-grade intervals, like the ones found in drill hole U-121-22, suggests potential for increased resource estimates which could influence the company's asset valuation. It is important to note that the true widths are yet to be determined, which is important for understanding the extent of the deposit. The company's commitment to an updated mineral resource estimate in August 2024 reflects a strategic move to quantify this potential.Investors should be aware that the grades reported are pre-mill recoveries, which means the actual quantity of metal that can be economically extracted might be lower. The mention of quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) protocols provides confidence in the reliability of the data presented. However, these results are part of an ongoing exploration process and the feasibility of mining these resources, including economic and environmental considerations, will only be clear once more comprehensive studies are completed. Mining Analyst From a market perspective, the disclosed high-grade intercepts could lead to a positive market reaction as they enhance the prospects of the La Colorada Skarn project. The substantial intervals of mineralization, particularly silver, which is Pan American Silver Corp.'s primary product, could lead to an increase in the company's stockpile and future revenue streams. However, investors should consider the long-term timeline before these resources contribute to the bottom line, as the development of mining projects is typically measured in years.Moreover, the geopolitical stability of Mexico as a mining jurisdiction, along with the company's operational efficiency, will play a pivotal role in the project's success. The company's adherence to National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and the involvement of Qualified Persons in the review process substantiate the credibility of the reported data, which is a positive signal for investors looking for transparency and adherence to industry standards. Financial Analyst For shareholders and potential investors, the announcement of such significant drilling results could be a catalyst for stock price movement. The long-term implications of these findings could potentially lead to an increase in Pan American Silver Corp.'s market capitalization, assuming the mineral resource estimate in August 2024 confirms the quantity and quality of the deposit. In the short term, the market will likely react to these results with speculation on the project's potential.It is also worth noting that exploration costs and capital expenditures associated with further development will affect the company's financials. The company's ability to fund these activities without significant dilution to existing shareholders or taking on burdensome debt will be an important factor to monitor. As the project progresses, the cost of production compared to the global silver market prices will determine the profitability and return on investment for the company and its investors. 04/08/2024 - 01:00 AM VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pan American Silver Corp.

The study, presented at ACC.24/WCC, highlights a high prevalence of hypertension. Positive None. Negative None. Cardiologist The HUDDLE study funded by Edwards Lifesciences reveals a stark contrast in the self-perceived versus actual cardiovascular health status among NFL Alumni. The high prevalence of hypertension, at 83.8%, is alarming and significantly higher than the national average, which hovers around 45% according to the CDC. This discrepancy suggests a need for increased awareness and proactive health management within this demographic. From a cardiology standpoint, this study underscores the importance of regular health screenings, even in populations that may be considered physically active or at a lower perceived risk. The long-term implications for healthcare providers and insurers could include re-evaluating risk assessment models and potentially adjusting health insurance premiums or coverage for professional athletes post-retirement. Health Economist Edwards Lifesciences' investment in the HUDDLE study is not only a contribution to public health knowledge but also a strategic move that could influence the company's market position. By identifying a high-risk population, Edwards may anticipate increased demand for cardiac monitoring devices and services. This could potentially lead to targeted marketing strategies and product development tailored to athletes and physically active individuals. Furthermore, the study's findings may prompt policy discussions around mandatory health screenings for athletes, both active and retired, which could expand the market for cardiac care services. The economic impact on the healthcare system could be substantial, as early intervention in high-risk groups typically results in cost savings by preventing more severe health events. Market Research Analyst The data presented by Edwards Lifesciences at the ACC conference could have a ripple effect on the stock market, particularly in the medical device sector. Investors are likely to watch how the company leverages these findings to capture a niche market of former professional athletes who may require specialized cardiovascular care. While the immediate market reaction may be muted, the long-term strategic positioning of Edwards as a leader in heart disease awareness and management among athletes could enhance its brand reputation and drive future growth. Competitors will likely take note, potentially leading to increased innovation and competition in the cardiovascular health space for this specific demographic. 04/07/2024 - 04:30 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW) announced the release of data from the HUDDLE study that examined the prevalence of heart disease and associated risk factors among members of the National Football League (NFL) Alumni Association and their families. The findings of this study, which identified a significant discrepancy between participant self-awareness and actual prevalence of heart disease and associated risk factors, were presented today during a late-breaking clinical trials session at the American College of Cardiology (ACC.24/WCC) and published simultaneously in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Results of the HUDDLE study indicated that the prevalence of hypertension in the 498 screened participants was 83.8%, though only about half (46.5%) self-reported a history of hypertension. Of all participants screened and found to have an elevated systolic blood pressure, a staggering 73.8% were also found to have structural heart changes present on transthoracic echo sonography (TTE). “These alarming results are a call to action,” said Michael Amponsah, MD, ChB, FACC, Interventional Cardiologist, Banner Boswell Medical Center, Peoria, Ariz. “The disparities highlighted in the cohort involved in the HUDDLE study point to a significant opportunity to examine a greater role for routine age-based screening, and especially for the expanded use of echocardiogram to better identify undetected or undiagnosed heart disease and heart failure.” Initiated by Edwards in 2021, the HUDDLE study’s objective was to examine the unrecognized prevalence of heart disease and associated risk factors, particularly among groups historically known to experience disparities in access to care. For instance, with more than a million patients treated globally with TAVR, the treatment rate of African Americans in the US has remained constant over the past decade at around 4%, despite comprising approximately 14% of the US population. Conducted across eight U.S. cities in cooperation with NFL Alumni Health, a subsidiary of the NFL Alumni Association, HUDDLE was a cross sectional study of NFL alumni and their family members aged 50 years and above. The participants were mostly male (66.5%) and African American or Black (63%). Study participants self-reported their medical histories and participated in heart health education and screenings that included blood pressure, electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram. “Edwards is committed to helping identify and dismantle barriers to access for communities that are underserved due to race, gender and socioeconomic status,” said Larry Wood, Edwards’ corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart. “We realized that by working with the NFL Alumni Association and through this unique network of former players, we might be able to gain a greater understanding of how heart disease is impacting underserved populations, and how education, awareness and simple screening tools can save lives in these communities and in the entire nation as a whole.” About Edwards Lifesciences Edwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. We are driven by a passion for patients, dedicated to improving and enhancing lives through partnerships with clinicians and stakeholders across the global healthcare landscape.

With a unique asset-light model, Hotel101 aims to expand globally by providing consistent, secure, and predictable hospitality experiences through dynamic pricing and self-check-in options. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The merger between Hotel101 and JVSPAC Acquisition Corporation is a strategic move that could potentially reshape the hospitality market. The 'condotel' model, an innovative blend of condominium ownership and hotel amenities, presents a unique investment opportunity. By pre-selling individual hotel units during construction, Hotel101 capitalizes on early investment returns, while the standardized global room concept could attract a consistent customer base seeking familiarity and predictability in their accommodations.From a market research perspective, the scalability of this asset-light approach could allow for rapid expansion and diversification of revenue streams. However, the success of this model hinges on market acceptance and the ability to maintain high standards across diverse locations. The proposed NASDAQ listing is likely to enhance visibility and access to capital, which is essential for the aggressive expansion plans laid out by Hotel101. Financial Analyst The equity value of over US$2.3 billion post-transaction suggests strong investor confidence in Hotel101's business model and growth prospects. This valuation will be scrutinized by the market, especially considering the projected completion during a period of economic uncertainty. Investors will be keen on the performance metrics, such as occupancy rates and average daily rates, once the properties are operational.Moreover, the dual revenue stream model, combining pre-sales with operational income, could provide a buffer against market volatility. However, potential investors should consider the regulatory and execution risks inherent in international expansion, particularly in the diverse markets Hotel101 is targeting. Hospitality Industry Analyst The global standardization concept that Hotel101 is pioneering could be a game-changer in the value segment of the hospitality industry. By offering a consistent product, they are positioning themselves to compete with both traditional hotels and short-term rental platforms. The amenities provided, typically reserved for higher-tier hotels, could give Hotel101 a competitive edge in the market.However, the success of this model will depend on the execution of the global expansion strategy and the ability to maintain a standardized service across all properties. The impact on local hotel markets, particularly in the value segment, could be significant if Hotel101 successfully executes its vision and scales to the projected one million rooms in over 100 countries. 04/08/2024 - 12:30 AM HONG KONG, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Singapore-headquartered subsidiary of Philippine-listed investment company DoubleDragon Corporation, Hotel101 Global Pte. Ltd. and affiliates (""HOTEL101"" or ""HBNB"") and JVSPAC Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: JVSA) (""JVSPAC"") announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Hotel101 is a hotel prop-tech operator pioneering a globally standardized, asset-light ""condotel"" business model. Upon completion of the proposed business combination transaction, the combined entity is expected to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ""HBNB."" Hotel101 is expected to have an equity value of over US$2.3 billion following completion of the transaction, which is expected to close during the second half of 2024 subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. Management believes that Hotel101 is a global ""one room"" hotel chain poised to disrupt the tourism industry by offering identical, standardized hotel rooms around the world, creating what management believes to be unbeatable efficiency, simplicity, and value. Management believes Hotel101s are efficient to build, maintain, and operate – as well as to scale and expand through direct development, joint venture partnerships, and licensing. Management believes that the Hotel101 platform is unlike anything available in any part of the world today: while it is similar to other short-term rental platforms because its inventory is generally owned by third-party individual condominium unit owners who can opt to list their unit on the Hotel101 platform, it is able to deliver consistency, security, and predictability for its guests, as well as arguably higher acceptance in the communities where it operates as all Hotel101 properties are purposely built as hospitality assets. The global opportunity that management sees in the hospitality space is that of standardization, which management believes brings unbeatable efficiency, especially for the value segment. In addition, Hotel101's proprietary app adopts dynamic pricing for its room rates and is planned to offer self-check in, simplified by the availability of just one type of room. Hannah Yulo-Luccini, CEO of Hotel101, said: ""Hotel101's asset-light business model allows us to generate revenues twice: first from the pre-selling of strata-titled individual hotel units during the construction phase; and second, from the long-term recurring revenue derived from day-to-day hotel operations following completion of the units. Building on the success of our business model in the Philippines – where we have several operating properties and a number under development – and our ongoing international expansion to Japan, Spain, and the U.S., we believe that a NASDAQ listing will provide Hotel101 with access to public capital markets and help accelerate our global expansion plans."" Edgar ""Injap"" Sia II, Chairman and CEO of DoubleDragon Corporation and Founder of Hotel101, said: ""With its unique and novel concept, we believe Hotel101 has significant potential to successfully expand globally. We expect this to have a network effect that will further elevate the brand and benefit all stakeholders within its ecosystem. The standardization of a Hotel101 room globally means that a customer knows exactly what to expect wherever they may be in the world. Management also expects this formula to result in creating sustained value for consumers globally."" Albert Wong, Chairman, JVSPAC Acquisition Corporation, said: ""Today marks a significant milestone towards the successful completion of the business combination between JVSPAC and Hotel101. We sought out a partner that aligns with our vision and are confident that this merger will position us for long-term success. We are pleased to work with Hotel101 and believe its unique business model and the track record of its founders will be a disruptive force in the hospitality industry. We are honored to be part of their journey and be the ones introducing their business to the public capital markets."" By building properties at scale – what management believes to be roughly five times the size of other branded 3-star hotel chains – Hotel101 can offer its guests amenities that go well beyond what management believes to be the typical offering in the value segment. These amenities usually include in-room kitchenettes, pools, gyms, business centers, all-day dining, function rooms, 24/7 front desks, and children's playgrounds – features that other mid-tier players do not typically provide. Outside of the Philippines, Hotel101 has broken ground in Madrid, Spain to construct a 680-room property located in the Valdebebas area beside the IFEMA Convention Complex, the Real Madrid Complex and the upcoming new F1 Grand Prix Track. Another 482-room property, Hotel101-Niseko, is under construction in Hokkaido, Japan; and a site has been secured in Los Angeles, California to build the first Hotel101 in the U.S. Hotel101's long term vision is to have one million rooms, operating in over 100 countries worldwide. As a first step, Hotel101 has identified the first 25 priority countries for expansion: the Philippines, Japan, Spain, the U.S., United Kingdom, the U.A.E., India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Italy, Germany, France, and Saudi Arabia. --- About DoubleDragon Corporation DoubleDragon Corporation currently has total assets of about US$3 billion, with a portfolio that spans over one million square meters of gross floor area principally from provincial community malls, a string of office buildings, a chain of industrial warehouse complexes and its chain of hotels.

Cardiologist From a cardiological perspective, the study of acoramidis presents significant implications for the treatment of ATTR-CM, a condition characterized by the deposition of transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the heart, leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The stabilization of TTR by acoramidis, indicated by the CMR imaging substudy, suggests a potential for not only halting the progression of cardiac amyloidosis but also possibly reversing some of the damage already done to the cardiac structure.Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a gold standard for non-invasively assessing cardiac morphology and function. The stability or improvement in indexed left ventricular mass and ejection fraction are important markers of cardiac health. In patients with ATTR-CM, these improvements could translate to better clinical outcomes and quality of life. However, it's important to note that CMR imaging was possible only in surviving participants, which introduces a survival bias into the results. The long-term impact of acoramidis on survival and quality of life will be important for its clinical adoption. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of BridgeBio's New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA and the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the EMA are pivotal steps in bringing acoramidis to market. The high statistical significance of the primary endpoint in the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 trial (Win Ratio of 1.8, p<0.0001) is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a robust effect of the drug on clinical outcomes. This could potentially make acoramidis a leading treatment for ATTR-CM, affecting BridgeBio's market position and stock value.However, it is essential to consider the size and design of the substudy when interpreting the results. With CMR imaging performed on a relatively small subset of patients, the generalizability of the findings to the broader ATTR-CM patient population might be limited. Furthermore, the lack of safety concerns is promising, but post-marketing surveillance will be critical to monitor for any long-term adverse effects once the drug is used in a wider population. Healthcare Industry Analyst The advancements in treatment options for ATTR-CM, such as those presented by acoramidis, have the potential to disrupt the current market for cardiac amyloidosis treatments. Given the rarity of the condition, treatments can command high prices and successful drugs can become significant revenue drivers for their developers. The potential for cardiac amyloid regression with acoramidis could set a new standard in the treatment landscape, impacting the competitive dynamics within the pharmaceutical industry focused on rare diseases.Investors will likely monitor the PDUFA action date closely as FDA approval is a major catalyst for pharmaceutical stocks. The market reaction to these developments will depend on the final approval, the drug's pricing strategy and its adoption by clinicians. The expected decision from the EMA will also play a role in international market penetration. It is important to note that the drug's financial impact will be influenced by the prevalence of ATTR-CM and the ability of healthcare systems to reimburse such specialized treatments. 04/07/2024 - 01:15 PM - In this exploratory substudy, treatment with acoramidis was associated with possible cardiac structural and functional improvement compared with placebo, with potential cardiac amyloid regression - The data demonstrate that targeting near-complete transthyretin (TTR) stabilization with acoramidis may enable cardiac remodeling and functional recovery in patients with ATTR-CM - These results are the first prospective, longitudinal evaluation of cardiac structure and function by CMR imaging in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study in ATTR-CM - The findings from this study build upon positive results from BridgeBio’s global ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 trial, wherein the primary endpoint was met (Win Ratio of 1.8) with a high statistical significance (p<0.0001); the substudy data are consistent with the cardiovascular clinical benefits observed with acoramidis - Acoramidis was well-tolerated, with no safety signals of potential clinical concern observed - BridgeBio’s New Drug Application (NDA) has been accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024; a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for acoramidis has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), with an expected decision in 2025 PALO ALTO, Calif., April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today presented results from the exploratory CMR imaging substudy of ATTRibute-CM, its Phase 3 trial of acoramidis in ATTR-CM. These data were presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Scientific Sessions & Expo in a moderated poster session by Yousef Razvi, M.D. of University College London. ATTRibute-CM was designed to study the efficacy and safety of acoramidis, an investigational, next-generation, orally-administered, highly potent, small molecule stabilizer of TTR. Based on the positive results from ATTRibute-CM, BridgeBio submitted an NDA to the U.S. FDA, which has been accepted with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024, and an MAA to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025. “CMR is the reference non-invasive imaging method to evaluate cardiac structure, function, and amyloid burden in patients with ATTR-CM. The results shown in the imaging substudy are indicative of potential improvement of cardiac structure and function in patients with ATTR-CM, consistent with the clinical outcomes with acoramidis treatment observed in the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 clinical trial. The impact on cardiac amyloid load highlights the potential that acoramidis could lead to cardiac amyloid regression in a proportion of patients with ATTR-CM, which we have not observed in such a controlled clinical trial to date,” said Marianna Fontana, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Cardiology and Honorary Consultant Cardiologist at the National Amyloidosis Centre, Division of Medicine, University College London, and Principal Investigator of the Substudy. CMR imaging was performed at baseline before the first dose in 35 participants or within three months after the first dose in 17 participants (range, 14-105 days); subsequent CMR imaging was performed at months 12, 24, and 30 in those individuals who were available to undergo imaging, which was influenced by survival. Images were read centrally at the National Amyloidosis Centre in a fashion blinded to other clinical data. Findings included: Key CMR imaging parameters measuring cardiac structure, including mean indexed left ventricular mass, were found to be stable or have a trend towards improvement on acoramidis vs. deteriorated on placebo over 30 monthsTreatment with acoramidis preserved or was associated with a trend towards improvement in measures of cardiac function including left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume compared to initial measures, and relative to placebo In July 2023, BridgeBio announced positive results from ATTRibute-CM, reporting a highly statistically significant result, demonstrated by a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p<0.0001) on the primary endpoint (a hierarchical analysis prioritizing in order: all-cause mortality, then frequency of cardiovascular hospitalization, then change from baseline in N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, then change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance). Acoramidis was well-tolerated, with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified. BridgeBio has also presented analyses from ATTRibute-CM at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2023 and at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2023. In February 2024, BridgeBio shared positive results of a single-arm Phase 3 study of acoramidis in Japanese patients with ATTR-CM, including no mortality observed in the trial at 30 months.

FSD Pharma Inc. Receives Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency,2024-04-08T02:55:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"FSD Pharma Inc. received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, giving them a 180-day compliance period to meet the requirement or face potential delisting.","FSD Pharma Inc. Receives Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FSD Pharma Inc. received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, giving them a 180-day compliance period to meet the requirement or face potential delisting. Positive None. Negative The company is not currently meeting the minimum bid price requirement set by Nasdaq, which could lead to potential delisting if not rectified within the specified timeframe. Market Analyst The recent announcement by FSD Pharma regarding its non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement presents a notable concern for investors and stakeholders. The stipulation that a listed security must maintain a bid price of at least US$1.00 is fundamental to ensuring a degree of liquidity and market confidence. The company's failure to meet this threshold over 30 consecutive business days signals potential investor apprehension or a lack of market enthusiasm for its Class B Shares.From a market perspective, the 180-day grace period to regain compliance is standard procedure, offering the company a window to address the issue. However, the implicit risk here is the potential for a reverse stock split, which companies often use as a last resort to inflate stock prices artificially. While this can bring the stock back into compliance, it can also be viewed unfavorably by investors as it dilutes share value. The company's decision-making in the coming months will be pivotal in maintaining investor confidence and ensuring its ability to raise capital in the public markets. Financial Analyst FSD Pharma's notification of non-compliance is a critical financial indicator for the company's performance and investor relations. The stock price is a reflection of the company's perceived value and its future prospects. A persistent low bid price may suggest underlying financial difficulties or skepticism about the company's growth strategy. It is essential for investors to monitor FSD Pharma's operational and financial health closely during this period.Investors should also consider the broader implications of a delisting scenario. Should the company fail to regain compliance, it may face delisting from the Nasdaq, which could significantly impact its visibility and attractiveness to institutional investors, potentially leading to lower trading volumes and higher volatility. The company's dual listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange may provide some cushion, but the prestige and liquidity of the Nasdaq are difficult to replace. Biotech Industry Analyst FSD Pharma's core business operations in the biopharmaceutical sector are not directly impacted by the Nasdaq compliance issue; however, the financial stability and market perception can indirectly influence its ability to fund research and development projects. For companies in the biotech industry, consistent investment is vital for sustained innovation and progress in clinical trials. The market's reaction to FSD Pharma's stock price and its ability to regain compliance will be indicative of the confidence investors have in the company's pipeline and strategic direction.Given the highly competitive nature of the biopharmaceutical industry, where investor sentiment can shift rapidly based on clinical trial outcomes and regulatory news, maintaining a strong stock market presence is important for FSD Pharma's long-term success. Their ability to navigate this compliance challenge will be a test of management's adeptness in financial and strategic planning within the highly volatile biotech market. 04/07/2024 - 10:55 PM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 7, 2024) - FSD Pharma Inc.

The data show promising results with high response rates, durable responses, and good safety profile. Positive Positive pivotal data presented for linvoseltamab in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. 71% objective response rate with 46% achieving a complete response and 62% achieving a very good partial response. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival not reached at 11-month follow-up. 93% of patients who achieved a complete response were minimal residual disease negative at 10-5. High objective response rates observed across various subgroups, including high-risk populations. Linvoseltamab showed a good safety profile with manageable adverse events. Fast Track Designation and Priority Review granted by the FDA with a target action date of August 22, 2024. Phase 3 confirmatory trial (LINKER-MM3) for linvoseltamab in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ongoing. Negative 46% of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome as the most common treatment-emergent adverse event. Infections occurred in 73% of patients, with 34% being Grade 3 or 4. Six deaths occurred on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose due to treatment-emergent adverse events. Safety and efficacy of linvoseltamab have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Medical Research Analyst The recent data from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM1 trial of linvoseltamab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma presented at AACR is a significant milestone in oncology therapeutics. The reported 71% objective response rate and 46% complete response rate are notable, particularly in a patient population that has limited treatment options. These results may suggest a strong potential for linvoseltamab to become a key player in the multiple myeloma treatment landscape, pending regulatory approval.Furthermore, the response-adapted dosing regimen presents a potential improvement in patient quality of life by reducing the frequency of dosing upon achieving a very good partial response. This innovation could lead to better patient adherence and reduced healthcare costs associated with treatment administration. However, the occurrence of cytokine release syndrome in 46% of patients and infections in 73% of patients raises safety concerns that may need to be addressed through careful patient monitoring and management strategies. Oncology Doctor The clinical efficacy of linvoseltamab, as evidenced by the high rates of complete response and very good partial response, is impressive and could represent a breakthrough in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. The depth and durability of responses, coupled with the favorable safety profile, particularly the manageable rates of Grade 3 or higher adverse events, suggest that linvoseltamab could offer a substantial benefit to patients. The MRD negativity in 93% of evaluable patients who achieved a complete response is a strong predictor of long-term outcomes and could potentially set a new standard for therapeutic success in this disease. Market Research Analyst Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' linvoseltamab, if approved, could capture a significant share of the multiple myeloma market, which is characterized by high unmet needs for effective and durable treatments. The Fast Track Designation and Priority Review status by the FDA indicate the therapy's potential to address these needs. The market impact could be substantial, as investors and stakeholders closely watch the FDA's decision expected in August. The successful development of linvoseltamab may also lead to an increase in Regeneron's market valuation and could attract further investment in bispecific antibody technologies for cancer treatment. 04/07/2024 - 04:00 PM Regulatory applications for linvoseltamab currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)TARRYTOWN, N.Y., April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the oral plenary session presentation of positive pivotal data from the Phase 1/2 LINKER-MM1 trial of linvoseltamab in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego. Linvoseltamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing. “The presentation of these pivotal results in an oral plenary session at AACR recognizes the exciting potential of linvoseltamab to advance the treatment of multiple myeloma,” said Sundar Jagannath, M.D., Director of the Multiple Myeloma Center of Excellence at Tisch Cancer Center at Mount Sinai in New York City and a trial investigator. “In clinical trials, linvoseltamab treatment led to responses that occurred early, were durable and deepened over time – all critical efficacy measures for this heavily pre-treated patient population. Further, among patients who had at least 24 weeks of treatment, the majority achieved a very good partial response, enabling them to transition from every two-week to every four-week dosing. This is an important accomplishment that I’ve seen firsthand in my trial patients, and I eagerly anticipate the FDA decision expected this August.” With an 11-month median duration of follow up, the linvoseltamab data among 117 patients presented at AACR reinforce the strength of previously shared findings and included a: 71% objective response rate (ORR), with 46% of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or better and 62% achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) or better, as determined by an independent review committee.1-month median time to response (range: <1-6 months). In responders, the median time to a VGPR or better was 3 months (range: <1-13 months) and to a CR or better was 8 months (range: 2-14 months).Median duration of response (DoR), median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were not reached. At 12 months, the estimated probability of maintaining a response was 78%, being progression free was 69% and survival was 75%.Among patients who had a CR or better and were minimum residual disease (MRD) evaluable, 93% (25 of 27 patients) were MRD negative at 10-5. The trial included a response-adapted regimen that enabled linvoseltamab patients to shift to every four-week dosing if they achieved a VGPR or better and completed at least 24 weeks of therapy. In the dose expansion portion of the trial (n=105), of the patients who had at least 24 weeks of therapy at data cutoff, 90% (56 of 62) achieved a VGPR or better and were able to transition to every four-week dosing. Of the 29 patients who transitioned to the extended dosing regimen prior to achieving a CR, 48% (14 of 29) subsequently experienced a deepening of response to CR or better. In addition, high ORRs were observed across prespecified subgroups – including high-risk and high-disease burden populations – as follows: 85% among Black or African American patients (17 of 20 patients)71% among those aged 75 years or older (22 of 31 patients)67% among those with high cytogenetic risk (31 of 46 patients)62% among those with International Staging System stage III disease (13 of 21 patients)53% among those with extramedullary plasmacytomas (10 of 19 patients) Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most commonly occurring treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and was observed in 46% of patients; 35% were Grade 1, 10% were Grade 2 and one case (1%) was Grade 3. Adjudicated immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) events of any grade occurred in 8% of patients, including three cases that were Grade 3 and no cases that were ≥Grade 4. Infections occurred in 73% of patients, with their frequency and severity decreasing after 6 months; 34% were Grade 3 or 4. The most common Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥20%) were neutropenia (40%) and anemia (31%). Six deaths occurred on treatment or within 30 days of the last treatment dose due to TEAEs; five were due to infection, and one was due to renal failure. Linvoseltamab has been granted Fast Track Designation and was accepted for Priority Review for the treatment of R/R MM by the FDA, with a target action date of August 22, 2024. In addition, linvoseltamab is being reviewed by the EMA. Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. The Phase 3 confirmatory trial for linvoseltamab in patients with R/R MM (LINKER-MM3) is underway. About Multiple MyelomaAs the second most common blood cancer, there are over 176,000 new cases of MM diagnosed globally, and 35,000 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. In the U.S., there are approximately 8,000 people who have MM that has progressed after three lines of therapy, and 4,000 whose disease has progressed after four or more therapies. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Despite treatment advances, MM is not curable and while current treatments are able to slow progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies.About the Linvoseltamab Phase 1/2 Trial and Clinical Development ProgramThe ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion LINKER-MM1 trial is investigating linvoseltamab in 282 enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory MM. The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial – which is now complete – primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across nine dose levels of linvoseltamab and explored different administration regimens. The ongoing Phase 2 dose expansion portion is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with the primary endpoint of ORR. Key secondary endpoints include DoR, PFS, rate of MRD negative status and OS. Eligibility in the Phase 2 portion requires patients to have received at least three prior lines of therapy or have triple-class refractory MM. Linvoseltamab is administered with an initial step-up dosing regimen followed by the full 200 mg dose administered weekly. At week 16, all patients transition to every two-week dosing. A response-adapted regimen further enables patients to shift to every four-week dosing if they achieve a VGPR or better and have completed at least 24 weeks of therapy. The regimen requires a total of two 24-hour hospitalizations for safety monitoring. The broader linvoseltamab clinical development program includes additional trials in earlier lines of therapy and stages of disease that are planned or underway. They include a Phase 1/2 trial in first-line MM, a Phase 2 trial in high-risk smoldering MM, and a Phase 2 trial in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. A Phase 1 trial of linvoseltamab in combination with a Regeneron CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in MM is also planned.

Positive Olezarsen met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in fasting triglycerides. Demonstrated substantial reduction in acute pancreatitis events. Results presented at ACC 2024 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Ionis pursuing regulatory approval for olezarsen as a potential breakthrough treatment for FCS patients. Favorable safety and tolerability profile observed in the study. Significantly reduced incidence of acute pancreatitis events and all-cause hospitalizations compared to placebo. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings on olezarsen's efficacy in treating familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) are a significant advancement in the field of lipid disorders. The data indicating a reduction in triglyceride levels and acute pancreatitis events could set a new benchmark for FCS treatment protocols. This is particularly noteworthy given the current lack of FDA-approved treatments for FCS in the United States.From a medical research perspective, the sustained reduction in serum apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) levels is a promising indicator of olezarsen's potential mechanism of action. ApoC-III is a known regulator of triglyceride metabolism and its reduction could explain the observed decrease in triglyceride levels. The robustness of these results over a 12-month period suggests a durable therapeutic effect, which is important for chronic conditions like FCS.The safety profile of olezarsen, as reported, also merits attention. The higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the placebo group compared to the olezarsen-treated groups could imply a favorable risk-benefit ratio. However, the long-term safety profile will need continuous monitoring post-approval, considering the chronic nature of FCS treatment. Financial Analyst The announcement by Ionis Pharmaceuticals regarding olezarsen's Phase 3 Balance study results could have a material impact on the company's financial outlook. The potential approval and commercialization of olezarsen represent a significant opportunity for Ionis to capture a market with an unmet medical need. Given the rarity of FCS, olezarsen could be positioned as an orphan drug, which typically allows for premium pricing and extended market exclusivity.The focus on the upcoming FDA priority review and the potential for olezarsen to become the standard of care for FCS patients could drive investor optimism. Moreover, the clinical success of olezarsen in the Balance study may also bode well for its ongoing Phase 3 CORE studies in the broader population with severe hypertriglyceridemia, potentially expanding the drug's market potential.Investors should monitor the FDA's decision and the subsequent market uptake of olezarsen, as well as the company's ability to leverage this approval for further pipeline development. The favorable results and safety profile could also position Ionis favorably for strategic partnerships or acquisition interest. Healthcare Economist The introduction of olezarsen as a treatment for FCS, assuming FDA approval, would have implications for healthcare economics. Currently, the management of FCS and its complications, such as acute pancreatitis, involves significant healthcare resources and costs due to hospitalizations and ongoing care. The reported 84% reduction in all-cause hospitalizations among olezarsen-treated patients could translate into substantial cost savings for healthcare systems.It is important to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of olezarsen, which will depend on its pricing and the reduction in long-term healthcare costs associated with the management of FCS. The potential reduction in acute pancreatitis events, a serious and costly complication, could justify the investment in olezarsen from a payer perspective. However, the economic impact will need to be assessed against the backdrop of the drug's pricing strategy and the overall budget impact on healthcare payers.As a rare disease treatment, olezarsen may also benefit from various incentives aimed at encouraging the development of orphan drugs, which can affect the economic dynamics of its market entry and sustainability. 04/07/2024 - 09:48 AM – Olezarsen met the primary endpoint with statistically significant reduction of fasting triglycerides and showed substantial, clinically meaningful reduction in acute pancreatitis events – – Results demonstrate olezarsen may represent a novel treatment option for this rare, life-threatening disease, for which there are no approved treatments in the U.S. – – Data presented today at ACC 2024 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine – – Ionis to host webcast on Monday, April 8 at 10:00 am ET – CARLSBAD, Calif., April 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS) today announced full results from the Phase 3 Balance study of Ionis' lead independent investigational medicine, olezarsen, for the treatment of adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). The olezarsen 80 mg monthly dose met the primary endpoint of significantly reducing triglycerides (TGs) in patients with genetically validated FCS at six months. In addition, olezarsen demonstrated robust and sustained reductions in TGs and serum apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) levels. Importantly, olezarsen reduced the incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) events over the 12-month treatment period compared to placebo. Olezarsen also demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. These results were presented in an oral presentation at the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Meeting in Atlanta, Georgia and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Based on these data, Ionis is pursuing regulatory approval of olezarsen as a potential breakthrough treatment for adults with FCS. ""As a physician who has seen first-hand the struggles of people living with FCS and its serious complications, there is significant need for an effective therapy to lower triglycerides and reduce acute pancreatitis events,"" said Erik Stroes, M.D., professor of medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, and a principal investigator of the Balance study. ""Olezarsen represents a potentially life-changing new medicine for these patients who experience debilitating chronic symptoms, including abdominal pain and cognitive symptoms, as well as hospitalizations associated with potentially fatal acute pancreatitis events."" Balance Study Results In the study, patients were treated with olezarsen 80 mg (n=22), 50 mg (n=21) or placebo (n=23) once every four weeks. In the 80 mg group, olezarsen met the primary endpoint, with a statistically significant placebo-adjusted reduction in TG levels from baseline to six months (44%, p<0.001).Reductions from six to 12 months were sustained, with olezarsen 80 mg achieving a placebo-adjusted 59% reduction in TGs.ApoC-III placebo-adjusted reductions were robust and sustained at six and 12 months (74% and 81% reductions, respectively).In the 50 mg group, olezarsen reduced TG levels, however this difference was not statistically significant at six months compared to placebo (22%, p=0.078).Reductions from six to 12 months were improved, with olezarsen 50 mg achieving a placebo-adjusted 44% reduction in TGs.Olezarsen-treated patients had markedly fewer AP events during the 12-month period, compared to placebo.Eleven episodes of AP occurred in the placebo group versus one episode in the 80 mg olezarsen group and one episode in the 50 mg group.Furthermore, there was a substantially greater time to the first event with olezarsen compared to placebo (one year (80 mg) and 102 days (50 mg), vs. nine days for placebo).Olezarsen-treated patients experienced a placebo-adjusted 84% reduction in all-cause hospitalizations between baseline and 12 months.A favorable safety and tolerability profile was observed, with a higher number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the placebo group. There were no serious TEAEs related to olezarsen.The most common AEs were COVID-19, abdominal pain and diarrhea, none of which were more frequent in patients treated with either dose of olezarsen versus placebo.Serious AEs occurred in 14% of patients treated with olezarsen 80 mg, 19% treated with olezarsen 50 mg, and 39% treated with placebo.""Balance is the first clinical study to validate the association of reduced triglyceride levels with reduced incidence of acute pancreatitis events in patients with severely elevated triglycerides. This important finding supports the potential for olezarsen to be the standard of care for patients with FCS, if approved. These data further strengthen our confidence for a successful outcome in the ongoing Phase 3 CORE studies evaluating olezarsen in the much more prevalent severe hypertriglyceridemia patient population,"" said Brett P. Monia, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Ionis. ""Our team looks forward to working closely with the FDA to advance the first potential treatment for FCS in the U.S., and to successfully delivering Ionis' first independent commercial launch later this year, assuming priority review. We offer our sincerest gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in this pivotal study."" The ACC Balance presentation can be found on Ionis' website after today's presentation at 10:08 am ET. In addition to the Balance data, a late-breaking abstract entitled, ""Efficacy and Safety of Olezarsen in Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia and High Cardiovascular Risk: Primary Results of the Bridge-TIMI 73a Trial"" was also presented at ACC and published in NEJM. Webcast Ionis will host a webcast to discuss the detailed results from the Balance study on Monday, April 8 at 10:00 am ET. Interested parties may access the webcast here. A webcast replay will be available for a limited time. About the Balance Study The global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Balance study (NCT04568434) enrolled 66 patients aged 18 and older with confirmed FCS. Patients in the study received background therapies including statins, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive olezarsen 80 mg or 50 mg or placebo via subcutaneous injection once every four weeks for 53 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in fasting triglyceride levels at six months compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints included percent changes in triglyceride levels at 12 months, percent changes in other lipid parameters, and adjudicated acute pancreatitis event rates over the treatment period. About Olezarsen Olezarsen is an RNA-targeted investigational LIgand Conjugated Antisense (LICA) medicine being evaluated for people at risk of disease due to elevated triglyceride levels, including those with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). Olezarsen is designed to inhibit the body's production of apoC-III, a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood.1,2 The U.S. FDA granted olezarsen Fast Track designation for the treatment of FCS in January 2023, as well as Orphan Drug designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation in February 2024. In addition to FCS, Ionis is evaluating olezarsen for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) in Phase 3 clinical trials. Olezarsen is an investigational medicine that has not been reviewed or approved for the treatment of any disease by any regulatory authority. About FCS FCS is a rare, genetic disease characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels. It is caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL).3 Because of limited LPL production or function, people with FCS cannot effectively break down chylomicrons, lipoprotein particles that are 90% triglycerides.3,4 FCS is estimated to impact one to 13 people per million in the U.S.5,6,7 People living with FCS are at high risk of acute pancreatitis (AP) in addition to other chronic health issues such as fatigue and severe, recurrent abdominal pain.3,8,9 People living with FCS are sometimes unable to work, adding to the burden of disease.9 Currently, there are no U.S. FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of FCS and standard triglyceride lowering therapies are generally ineffective in patients with FCS.10,11 People living with this condition currently rely solely on nutrition management through extremely restrictive and difficult to manage diets to navigate the health risks associated with FCS.11,12 About Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Cardiovascular Research Analyst The recent findings from the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals on zilebesiran, an RNAi therapeutic, are significant for the field of cardiovascular medicine. The study's primary endpoint, a reduction in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), has been met and the results show promise for zilebesiran as a potential game-changer in hypertension treatment. Notably, the additive reductions in SBP across various antihypertensive backgrounds suggest that zilebesiran could be effective in a wide range of patient profiles.Furthermore, the biannual dosing regimen could improve patient compliance, a major issue in chronic disease management. The safety profile, with no deaths or study discontinuations due to adverse events, is also encouraging, although the elevated kidney function impact in some patients warrants further investigation. As a cardiovascular research analyst, these results suggest that zilebesiran has the potential to fill a significant unmet need in hypertension management, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and reduced cardiovascular risk. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the positive results from the KARDIA-2 study could have a substantial impact on Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' position in the antihypertensive drug market. Given the chronic nature of hypertension and the large patient population, a new therapeutic with the potential for less frequent dosing could disrupt the current treatment paradigm, which relies heavily on daily medication regimens.Investors should note the strategic partnership with Roche, which may facilitate the acceleration of zilebesiran's development and potential market entry. The drug's differentiation in dosing and efficacy could enable Alnylam to capture a significant market share. However, the long-term safety and effectiveness in a broader population will be critical for widespread adoption. The market potential for zilebesiran will depend on these factors, as well as pricing, reimbursement and competitive dynamics within the antihypertensive drug market. Healthcare Economist Examining the economic implications, the introduction of zilebesiran could potentially lead to cost savings within the healthcare system. Hypertension is a major risk factor for costly cardiovascular events. Thus, improved blood pressure control with fewer doses per year could reduce the frequency of doctor visits and the economic burden of hypertension-related complications.However, it is essential to consider the cost-effectiveness of zilebesiran compared to existing therapies. The pricing strategy will be a important determinant of its adoption, especially in cost-sensitive healthcare markets. Moreover, the reduced need for rescue antihypertensives, as indicated by the study, could further impact healthcare expenditure. Overall, zilebesiran's value proposition will hinge on its ability to deliver both clinical benefits and healthcare savings. 04/07/2024 - 08:00 AM – Study Met Primary Endpoint Demonstrating Clinically Significant Additive Reductions in Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure of Up to 12.1 mmHg Across Three Independent Study Cohorts at Month 3 – – A Single Dose of Zilebesiran Resulted in Clinically Significant Additive Reductions in Office Systolic Blood Pressure at Month 3 and in Time-Adjusted Office Systolic Blood Pressure at Month 6 Across Three Independent Study Cohorts – – Zilebesiran Demonstrated an Encouraging Safety and Tolerability Profile When Added to Standard of Care Antihypertensives – – Alnylam to Host Webcast Investor Event Today at 7:00 p.m. ET – CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced positive results from the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran when added to one of three standard of care antihypertensives including a thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or angiotensin receptor blocker (olmesartan). Zilebesiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting liver-expressed angiotensinogen (AGT) in development for the treatment of hypertension with the potential for biannual dosing. The results were presented today as a late-breaking clinical trial at the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Scientific Session. The Company previously announced positive topline results from the KARDIA-2 study in March 2024. The KARDIA-2 study achieved its primary endpoint demonstrating clinically and statistically significant additive, placebo-adjusted reductions of up to 12.1 mmHg in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) when zilebesiran was added to a thiazide-like diuretic, calcium channel blocker or angiotensin receptor blocker, measured independently at Month 3. The study achieved the key secondary endpoint evaluated at Month 3, demonstrating clinically significant additive reductions in office SBP across all three independent cohorts. At Month 6, zilebesiran demonstrated clinically significant and sustained placebo-adjusted, time-adjusted reductions in office SBP when added to indapamide, amlodipine and olmesartan, despite the addition of rescue antihypertensives at Month 3. In addition, zilebesiran resulted in clinically significant placebo-adjusted, time-adjusted reductions in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by ABPM, when added to indapamide and amlodipine, sustained to Month 6. A non-statistically significant result was observed when zilebesiran was added to the maximum dose of olmesartan when evaluated by time-adjusted change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by ABPM at Month 6. “Although many effective oral treatments are available, a large proportion of patients with hypertension are not managed to guideline-recommended targets. Inconsistent adherence to complex, daily, oral medication regimens as well as therapeutic inertia on the part of clinicians may be important contributors to this treatment gap,” said Akshay Desai, M.D., Director of the Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure Program, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Even in those who are treated, residual blood pressure variability may ultimately enhance risk for cardiovascular events. Zilebesiran may help to address many of these limitations of current treatment options. Although further evidence is needed to ensure long term efficacy and safety in a broader population, these data are encouraging and the potential to reduce blood pressure consistently with two injections a year might be transformative for clinical practice.” KARDIA-2 Study Results The KARDIA-2 study results are as follows: Key Endpoint Indapamide (2.5 mg) Amlodipine (5 mg) Olmesartan (40 mg) Primary Endpoint: Change from Baseline to Month 3 in 24-Hour Mean SBP, Assessed by ABPM - 12.1 mmHg (p<0.001) - 9.7 mmHg (p<0.001) - 4.0 mmHg (p=0.036) Key Secondary Endpoints: Change from Baseline to Month 3 in Office SBP - 18.5 mmHg (p<0.001) - 10.2 mmHg (p<0.001) - 7.0 mmHg (p<0.001) Time Adjusted Change from Baseline Through Month 6 in 24-Hour Mean SBP, Assessed by ABPM - 11.0 mmHg (p<0.001) - 7.9 mmHg (p<0.001) - 1.6 mmHg (p=0.26) Time Adjusted Change from Baseline Through Month 6 in Office SBP - 13.6 mmHg (p<0.001) - 8.6 mmHg (p<0.001) - 4.6 mmHg (p<0.001) The final key secondary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM <130 mmHg and/or reduction ≥20 mmHg without rescue antihypertensive medication at Month 6. As outlined in the study protocol, after three months of treatment, all patients were permitted to receive rescue antihypertensives as needed based on rescue response criteria. Across all cohorts, a higher percentage of placebo-treated patients required treatment with rescue antihypertensives compared to zilebesiran-treated patients. Additionally, the odds of meeting the SBP response criteria were significantly higher with zilebesiran in the indapamide and amlodipine cohorts, compared to placebo.

There were no deaths reported, and no AEs led to study discontinuation during the six-month double-blind period. “The KARDIA program has built a robust body of evidence, with more than six hundred patients having received zilebesiran in Phase 2 trials, demonstrating clinically significant blood pressure reductions with encouraging safety as both a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy, with the potential for both quarterly and biannual dosing,” said Simon Fox, Ph.D., Vice President, Zilebesiran Program Lead at Alnylam. “At Alnylam, we are aiming to disrupt cardiovascular disease, and in collaboration with our partner Roche, we are committed to moving zilebesiran forward in the hope of changing the hypertension treatment paradigm for patients. We are taking that next step with our recently initiated third Phase 2 study, KARDIA-3, designed to evaluate zilebesiran as an add-on therapy in high cardiovascular risk patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite receiving two or more antihypertensives.” The KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran, when added to standard of care antihypertensive medications, in adults with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This global, multicenter study enrolled 672 adults with hypertension. Patients who met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during a screening period were first randomized into three different cohorts to receive open-label therapy with indapamide, amlodipine or olmesartan as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a run-in period of at least four weeks. Following the run-in period, eligible patients with elevated SBP were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of 600 mg zilebesiran or placebo in addition to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication for six months.

About Zilebesiran Zilebesiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen (AGT) in development for the treatment of hypertension in high unmet need populations. AGT is the most upstream precursor in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), a cascade which has a demonstrated role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and its inhibition has well-established anti-hypertensive effects. Zilebesiran inhibits the synthesis of AGT in the liver, potentially leading to durable reductions in AGT protein and ultimately, in the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Zilebesiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry Plus (ESC+) GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables infrequent subcutaneous dosing with increased selectivity and the potential to achieve tonic blood pressure control demonstrating consistent and durable blood pressure reduction throughout a 24-hour period, sustained up to six months after a single dose of zilebesiran. The safety and efficacy of zilebesiran have not been established or evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority. Zilebesiran is being co-developed and co-commercialized by Alnylam and Roche. About Hypertension Uncontrolled hypertension is the chronic elevation of blood pressure (BP), defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines as ≥130 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ≥80 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (DBP). More than one billion people worldwide live with hypertension.i Approximately one in three adults are living with hypertension worldwide, with up to 80% of individuals remaining uncontrolled despite the availability of several classes of oral anti-hypertensive treatments. Despite the availability of anti-hypertensive medications, there remains a significant unmet medical need, especially given the poor rates of adherence to existing daily oral medications, resulting in inconsistent BP control and an increased risk for stroke, heart attack and premature death.ii In particular, there are a number of high unmet need settings where novel approaches to hypertension warrant additional development focus, including patients with poor medication adherence and in patients with high cardiovascular risk. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines known as RNAi therapeutics is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins – thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ALNY) has led the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach yielding transformative medicines. Since its founding in 2002, Alnylam has led the RNAi Revolution and continues to deliver on a bold vision to turn scientific possibility into reality. Alnylam’s commercial RNAi therapeutic products are ONPATTRO® (patisiran), AMVUTTRA® (vutrisiran), GIVLAARI® (givosiran), OXLUMO® (lumasiran), and Leqvio® (inclisiran), which is being developed and commercialized by Alnylam’s partner, Novartis.

The acquisition strengthens TotalEnergies' position in the U.S. LNG market and aligns with its goal to reduce carbon emissions and promote the transition from coal to natural gas. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The acquisition by TotalEnergies of a 20% interest in the Dorado leases in the Eagle Ford shale gas play represents a strategic move to bolster its position in the U.S. natural gas market. This move is expected to increase TotalEnergies' net U.S. natural gas production by 50 million cubic feet per day (Mcf/d) in 2024, with potential further increases by 2028. Considering the current natural gas prices and market trends, this could significantly enhance TotalEnergies' revenue from its U.S. operations.Furthermore, the integration into the U.S. LNG value chain is noteworthy. As the largest exporter of U.S. LNG, TotalEnergies' expansion in natural gas production is likely to improve its supply stability for LNG export operations, which is important given the volatile nature of global energy markets. The company's position as a leading LNG player is reinforced by its stake in the Cameron LNG plant and the upcoming Rio Grande LNG project. This vertical integration can be seen as a hedge against market fluctuations and a step towards a more resilient business model in the energy sector. Environmental Analyst From an environmental perspective, the reported emission intensity of around 10 kg CO2e/boe for the Dorado field is a figure that stakeholders should consider. In comparison to industry norms, this intensity level is relatively low, which aligns with the growing investor and consumer demand for cleaner energy production. TotalEnergies' commitment to reducing carbon emissions and eliminating methane emissions is aligned with global efforts to transition to lower-carbon energy sources.However, the expansion of fossil fuel operations, such as natural gas, must be weighed against the long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. The company's involvement in renewables, CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) and low-carbon fuels is a positive sign, though the scale and effectiveness of these initiatives in offsetting emissions from increased natural gas production remain to be critically evaluated. Energy Policy Expert The U.S. energy policy landscape significantly influences TotalEnergies' strategic decisions. The increase in natural gas production capacity and the integration into the LNG value chain align with the U.S. policy of promoting energy independence and export capacity. The U.S. has been encouraging the development of its natural gas resources and the expansion of LNG exports to create jobs, support allies and exert geopolitical influence.TotalEnergies' investment in the U.S. also reflects the broader trend of energy companies adapting to the energy transition by diversifying their portfolios to include both traditional and renewable energy sources. The company's investments in renewable energy projects and the LNG sector are an example of how energy companies are positioning themselves in a changing policy environment where there is pressure to provide cleaner energy while also ensuring energy security. 04/08/2024 - 02:40 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) has agreed to acquire the 20% interest held by Lewis Energy Group in the Dorado leases operated by EOG Resources (80%) in the Eagle Ford shale gas play, increasing its natural gas production capacity in Texas and further strengthening its business integration in the U.S. LNG value chain.

The compound demonstrates potent inhibition of over 50 clinically relevant non-classical EGFR mutations and the C797S resistance mutation, offering a promising treatment option for EGFR-mutant lung cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor Understanding the mutation profile of tumors is paramount in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The presence of non-classical EGFR mutations in 20-30% of patients indicates a significant subset of the population that could benefit from more targeted therapies. The fact that BDTX-1535, a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor, covers a broad spectrum of mutations including the C797S resistance mutation, could mark a pivotal shift in treatment paradigms.Traditionally, third-generation EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib have been frontline treatments for NSCLC with classical mutations. However, the emergence of resistance mutations like C797S and the presence of non-classical mutations alongside classical ones, as indicated by real-world data, necessitates the development of more comprehensive therapies. If BDTX-1535 demonstrates efficacy in ongoing clinical trials, it could potentially offer a new standard of care for a broader patient demographic, including those with complex mutational profiles. Medical Research Analyst The clinical development of BDTX-1535 represents a significant investment in precision oncology. The drug's ability to inhibit over 50 non-classical EGFR mutations, while sparing wild-type EGFR, suggests a favorable therapeutic index. This specificity is important for reducing off-target effects and improving patient tolerability, which is a common issue with many cancer therapies.Furthermore, the drug's brain penetrance is a noteworthy feature, as central nervous system involvement is a major challenge in NSCLC treatment. The preclinical data suggesting good brain penetrance of BDTX-1535 could address a critical unmet need in the patient population. As the Phase 2 trial progresses, investors and stakeholders should monitor the enrollment and response rates closely, as these will provide valuable insights into the drug's efficacy and safety profile and ultimately its commercial potential. Financial Analyst Black Diamond Therapeutics' focus on developing a MasterKey therapy like BDTX-1535 could have significant financial implications for the company and its investors. The NSCLC market is competitive and the introduction of a therapy with a differentiated profile can capture substantial market share, especially if it addresses resistance mutations that limit the efficacy of current treatments.The anticipated initial results from the second and third-line patient trials in Q3 2024 will be a critical milestone for the company. Positive data could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive the stock price up. Conversely, any setbacks could have a negative impact. It's essential for investors to consider the inherent risks of clinical development and the potential for regulatory challenges, but the upside of a successful novel therapy in a high-prevalence indication like NSCLC could be considerable. 04/07/2024 - 06:00 PM Real-world data demonstrate non-classical mutations are present in 20-30% of all patients with EGFRm NSCLC Emerging data show non-classical EGFR mutations can be co-expressed with the classical L858R mutation, a setting characterized by shorter duration of response to osimertinib BDTX-1535 profile differentiated as the most advanced fourth-generation oral TKI in clinical development addressing the full spectrum of classical, non-classical, and C797S resistance EGFR mutations CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BDTX), a clinical-stage oncology company developing MasterKey therapies that target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with cancer, presented real-world evidence of the evolving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation landscape in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the potential of BDTX-1535 to address a broader range of mutations compared to existing therapies. The results were disclosed in an oral presentation on April 7, 2024, at the 2024 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting held in San Diego, California. The oral presentation, titled “BDTX-1535 – A MasterKey EGFR Inhibitor Targeting Classical, Non-Classical and the C797S Resistance Mutation to Address the Evolved Landscape of EGFR Mutant NSCLC,” evaluated more than 235,000 sequenced cases of NSCLC sourced from Guardant Health (GuardantINFORM™) and Foundation Medicine (FoundationInsights™). The analyses reveal a broad spectrum of non-classical mutations, as well as an increased prevalence of the acquired resistance mutation, C797S. Over 100 unique non-classical EGFR oncogenic driver mutations were identified in newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC, and these non-classical EGFR mutations were present in 20-30% of patients across all lines of treatment. “The landscape of EGFR mutations in NSCLC continues to evolve, revealing classical and non-classical driver mutations,” said John Heymach, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Non-classical mutations fall into categories including kinase domain PACC mutations and ectodomain mutations; therefore, next generation EGFR targeted therapies must effectively cover multiple subgroups of mutations.” “Novel targeted therapies are still needed to continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers,” added Xiuning Le, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor, Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. “To extend survival for our patients, newer drugs need to have good mutational coverage, good tolerability, and good brain penetrance.” Preclinical data demonstrated that BDTX-1535 potently inhibits more than 50 clinically relevant, non-classical EGFR mutations (as well as the classical L858R and exon19-del mutations) while sparing wild-type EGFR. The compound also potently inhibits the drug resistance C797S mutation, which emerges following treatment with third-generation EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib. Real-world data indicate non-classical EGFR mutations can be co-expressed with classical mutation L858R, a setting that has been characterized by shorter duration of response to osimertinib first-line therapy. Preclinical data show that BDTX-1535 potently inhibits these co-expressed non-classical mutations. “BDTX-1535 was designed to address a broad spectrum of more than 50 non-classical oncogenic EGFR mutations, as well as the C797S resistance mutation,” said Elizabeth Buck, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Black Diamond Therapeutics. “We believe that the potency of BDTX-1535 against the full spectrum of classical, non-classical, and C797S mutations positions the compound as the first and best-in-class fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor potentially offering NSCLC patients a well-tolerated, brain-penetrant, oral therapy across various lines of treatment.” Phase 1 proof-of-concept data demonstrating durable responses in recurrent NSCLC patients with both non-classical and acquired resistance C797S mutations were presented in October 2023. Black Diamond is currently advancing BDTX-1535 in a Phase 2 trial for patients with EGFRm NSCLC across multiple lines of therapy. Patients are being enrolled both in a first-line (1L) setting (for those expressing EGFR non-classical mutations) and in second- and third-line (2L/3L) settings following prior treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. Initial results from 2L/3L patients are anticipated in the third quarter of 2024. About BDTX-1535BDTX-1535 is an oral, brain-penetrant MasterKey inhibitor of oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including classical driver mutations, non-classical driver mutations, and the acquired resistance C797S mutation.

The FARAVIEW technology and the FARAWAVE Nav catheter expand the capabilities of the FARAPULSE™ PFA System through integration with our cardiac mapping system. In a pulsed field cardiac ablation procedure, a catheter is guided into the heart to administer targeted non-thermal electrical fields that selectively treat heart tissue cells, while avoiding damage to nearby structures. Before PFA therapy application, a physician might employ a separate cardiac mapping catheter to examine and analyze the heart's electrical patterns to plan the PFA applications. The FARAWAVE Nav PFA Catheter adds magnetic navigation capabilities to the current FARAWAVE PFA catheter, enabling detailed mapping and PFA therapy within the same device. This mapping data is visualized using the new FARAVIEW Software Module, offering a tailored mapping solution for procedures with the FARAPULSE PFA System. ""Creating a detailed cardiac map during an ablation procedure can improve guidance, reduce fluoroscopy times and assist physicians in assessing the location of energy delivered, which may improve patient outcomes,"" said Ignacio García-Bolao, M.D., Ph.D., study investigator and director of cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. ""Through this study, we hope to identify the procedural benefits of the FARAWAVE Nav catheter, which can both map and ablate, alongside technology that allows for magnetically-tracked, dynamic visualization of a patient's cardiac anatomy and catheter configuration."" In the prospective, single-arm, open-label, multi-center NAVIGATE-PF study, approximately 30 patients at several European centers who live with paroxysmal or persistent AF will be enrolled.

Patients with obesity on NEXLETOL had a 23% lower risk of MACE-4 compared to placebo. The trial highlighted benefits in women and Hispanic/Latinx patients, emphasizing the importance of early LDL-C lowering for reducing cardiovascular events. Positive Positive results from the CLEAR Outcomes trial presented at the ACC.24 conference. Patients with obesity on NEXLETOL showed a 23% lower risk of MACE-4 compared to placebo. Benefits of NEXLETOL seen in women and Hispanic/Latinx patients with or at risk for CVD. Bempedoic acid component of NEXLETOL demonstrated LDL-C reduction and reduced inflammatory markers. High enrollment of women and Hispanic/Latinx patients in the CLEAR Outcomes trial. Importance of early and aggressive LDL-C lowering highlighted for reducing cardiovascular events. Negative None. Cardiovascular Medical Research Analyst The reported efficacy of NEXLETOL in reducing Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE-4) by 23% in patients with obesity is a significant finding in the field of cardiovascular health. This data suggests that bempedoic acid could be an important treatment option for a subpopulation at high risk for cardiovascular events. The focus on historically underrepresented groups, such as women and Hispanic/Latinx patients, aligns with current medical research trends emphasizing diversity and inclusion.From a medical research perspective, the results contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports early and aggressive lowering of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) as a means to reduce cardiovascular risk. The fact that bempedoic acid did not worsen glucose or weight is particularly relevant, as these are common concerns with cardiovascular medications in patients with obesity. The reported tolerability across different ethnic backgrounds also suggests that bempedoic acid could have broad applicability in diverse patient populations. Health Economist The economic implications of the CLEAR Outcomes trial could be profound, especially considering the high cost burden associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A 23% reduction in MACE-4 events could translate into significant healthcare savings by potentially reducing the need for expensive interventions such as coronary revascularization. Furthermore, the potential reduction in healthcare disparities by providing an effective LDL-C lowering therapy for underrepresented populations could improve overall health outcomes and reduce long-term healthcare costs.However, the cost-effectiveness of bempedoic acid as a non-statin LDL-C lowering therapy will need to be evaluated against its price point, the cost of managing side effects and its comparison to existing therapies. It will be important to assess whether the upfront costs of the medication are offset by the reduction in cardiovascular events and related medical expenses over time. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The positive trial results for NEXLETOL in specific subgroups could influence Esperion's market positioning and competitive edge within the lipid-lowering therapy market. The emphasis on diversity in clinical trials may enhance the drug's marketability and appeal to a broader patient demographic. As clinicians and healthcare providers increasingly prioritize personalized medicine, Esperion's focus on delivering targeted treatments for diverse populations could lead to increased adoption and market share gains.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate of NEXLETOL post-trial results, as well as the response from key opinion leaders and prescribing patterns among cardiologists. It will be critical to track whether these clinical benefits translate into tangible sales growth and market penetration, especially in the context of Esperion's broader portfolio and strategic direction. 04/07/2024 - 02:45 PM – Patients With Obesity Who Took NEXLETOL Were 23% Less Likely to Experience a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE-4) Compared to Placebo – – NEXLETOL Demonstrated Clinical Benefit in Historically Underrepresented Groups: Women and Hispanic/Latinx Patients With and Without Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) – – CLEAR Outcomes Sets New Standards for Diversity and Inclusion with Enrollment of 48% Women and 17% Hispanic/Latinx Patients – ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (Nasdaq: ESPR) today announced the presentation of results from three pre-specified subgroups from CLEAR Outcomes at the 2024 American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Sessions (ACC.24): women, Hispanic/Latinx, and patients with obesity. These results align with the American College of Cardiology’s robust diversity, equity and inclusion programs to drive cultural change across the profession and ensure that the cardiovascular care team is as diverse as the patients they care for and that all patients are represented in cardiovascular research. The data also reinforce the mission of the ACC: transforming cardiovascular care for all. “These analyses showcase the benefit of NEXLETOL and the bempedoic acid component of NEXLIZET® (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablets in several important yet often understudied populations,” said JoAnne Foody, MD, FACC, FAHA, Chief Medical Officer of Esperion. “Bempedoic acid is the only FDA approved non-statin LDL lowering therapy to demonstrate reductions in MACE in both primary prevention and secondary prevention patient populations. In women and Hispanic/Latinx patients with or at risk for CVD, bempedoic acid decreased LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and inflammatory markers, did not worsen glucose or weight, and in turn reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). These results continue to reinforce the importance of early and aggressive LDL-C lowering in order to reduce cardiovascular events, underscoring the paradigm of ‘even lower, even earlier is even better.’” Harold Bays, MD, FOMA, FTOS, FACC, FNLA, FASPC, Louisville Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center, University of Louisville School of Medicine, presented “Bempedoic Acid for Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Obesity: A CLEAR Outcomes Subset Analysis.” Nearly 45% of patients in CLEAR Outcomes had obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) at the start of the study. In this analysis, patients with obesity treated with bempedoic acid were 23% less likely to experience MACE-4 (cardiovascular (CV) death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization) compared to placebo. “Given that obesity is an epidemic and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, clinicians and their patients can make more informed therapeutic decisions upon knowing the CVD outcomes among patients with obesity who receive specific cardiometabolic therapies,” said Dr. Bays. Fatima Rodriguez, MD, MPH, Stanford Medicine, presented “Characteristics and Outcomes for Hispanic/Latinx Participants with Statin Intolerance Receiving Bempedoic Acid: Results from a CLEAR Outcomes Pre-Specified Subgroup Analysis.” Hispanic/Latinx patients represented almost 17% of those enrolled in the CLEAR Outcomes trial. The Hispanic population is the largest ethnic minority in the U.S., yet is a population historically underrepresented in clinical trials. This subgroup analysis showed a similar 21% lowering of LDL-C with bempedoic acid compared to placebo in Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic/Latinx alike, confirming the CV risk reduction benefit of LDL-C lowering and the high tolerability of bempedoic acid, regardless of ethnicity. This analysis was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). Leslie Cho, MD, Cleveland Clinic, presented “Characteristics and Outcomes for Statin-Intolerant Women Receiving Bempedoic Acid in the CLEAR Outcomes Trial.” CLEAR Outcomes is notable for the highest percentage enrollment (48%) of females among contemporary lipid-lowering cardiovascular outcomes trials. In the CLEAR Outcomes trial, the risk of MACE-4 was similarly reduced for women treated with bempedoic acid compared to placebo, thus confirming its LDL-C lowering benefit on CV risk reduction, regardless of sex. This analysis was simultaneously published in Circulation. INDICATION NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL are indicated: The bempedoic acid component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization in adults who are unable to take recommended statin therapy (including those not taking a statin) with: established cardiovascular disease (CVD), orat high risk for a CVD event but without established CVD. As an adjunct to diet: NEXLIZET, alone or in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH.NEXLETOL, in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, or alone when concomitant LDL-C lowering therapy is not possible, to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe or any of the excipients. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported. Hyperuricemia: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, may increase blood uric acid levels, which may lead to gout. Hyperuricemia may occur early in treatment and persist throughout treatment, returning to baseline following discontinuation of treatment. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. Tendon Rupture: Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, is associated with an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. Tendon rupture may occur more frequently in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, in patients with renal failure, and in patients with previous tendon disorders. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL at the first sign of tendon rupture. Consider alternative therapy in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture. The most common adverse reactions in the primary hyperlipidemia trials of bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, in ≥2% of patients and greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with ezetimibe (a component of NEXLIZET) and at an incidence greater than placebo in clinical trials were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis, pain in extremity, fatigue, and influenza. In the primary hyperlipidemia trials of NEXLIZET, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and greater than placebo) observed with NEXLIZET, but not observed in clinical trials of bempedoic acid or ezetimibe, were urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and constipation. The most common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial for bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET and NEXLETOL, at an incidence of ≥2% and 0.5% greater than placebo were hyperuricemia, renal impairment, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, muscle spasms, gout, and cholelithiasis. Discontinue NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL when pregnancy is recognized unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breast-fed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NEXLIZET or NEXLETOL.

Positive Positive results from the largest head-to-head TAVR trial by Medtronic plc. Superior valve performance and non-inferior clinical outcomes for Evolut TAVR. SMART Trial demonstrates benefits of Evolut TAVR in patients with small aortic annuli. Significant findings for women with severe aortic stenosis, highlighting need for tailored treatment approaches. Evolut TAVR meets co-primary endpoints of non-inferiority and hemodynamic superiority at one year. Negative None. Cardiologist From a clinical perspective, the SMART Trial's findings are pivotal for the management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in patients with small aortic annuli, a condition that predominantly affects women. The trial's emphasis on a demographic that is both underrepresented and more severely affected by AS underscores the importance of personalized healthcare. The non-inferiority in clinical outcomes coupled with the superior valve performance of the Evolut TAVR system could influence clinical decision-making, potentially leading to a preference for this device over the Sapien system in certain patient populations.It's notable that the trial achieved a hemodynamic superiority endpoint, which is a measure of how well blood can flow through the new valve. This is particularly relevant as improper blood flow can lead to heart failure, necessitating rehospitalization, or even death. The substantial reduction in bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with the Evolut TAVR system suggests that patients could experience better long-term outcomes, which is important given the mortality risks associated with aortic stenosis. Medical Device Analyst The results of the SMART trial have significant implications for Medtronic's market positioning in the TAVR space. Demonstrating non-inferiority and superiority in valve performance relative to a competitor's product provides a competitive edge that could translate into increased market share and potentially justify a premium pricing model for the Evolut TAVR system. The data could also influence purchasing decisions by hospitals and treatment recommendations by physicians, leading to a higher adoption rate of Medtronic's device.Investors should note that the trial's outcome may not only impact Medtronic's revenue in the short term but could also affect the company's research and development strategy. Continued investment in clinical trials that focus on underrepresented populations could further strengthen Medtronic's position as a leader in equity-focused healthcare innovation. Health Equity Advocate The SMART trial's focus on a patient population that is primarily women is commendable and a step forward in addressing health inequities. The fact that 87% of the trial's participants were women highlights an intentional effort to generate data that can improve treatment for a group that has historically been under-diagnosed and under-treated. This approach not only has the potential to enhance patient outcomes but also to drive systemic change in how clinical trials are designed and executed, ensuring they are more reflective of the real-world patient population.Moreover, the trial's findings could be instrumental in advocating for more widespread and routine cardiac assessments for women over 65, who are at increased risk for chronic conditions associated with aortic stenosis. This could lead to earlier interventions and better management of the condition, ultimately improving the quality of life and survival rates for this demographic. 04/07/2024 - 09:45 AM New data from largest head-to-head randomized control TAVR trial demonstrates non-inferior clinical outcomes and superior valve performance for Evolut TAVR compared to Sapien™ at one year DUBLIN and ATLANTA, April 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced new data from the largest head-to-head comparative trial of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), were presented as a late breaking clinical trial at the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The one-year results of the SMall Annuli Randomized To Evolut or SAPIEN (SMART) Trial in individuals with aortic stenosis (AS) with small aortic annuli (SAA) demonstrated noninferior clinical outcomes and superior valve performance as measured by bioprosthetic valve dysfunction performance for the Evolut™ TAVR platform compared to the SAPIEN™ platform. ""SMART was launched to better understand how the two most commonly used TAVR systems perform in patients with small aortic annuli, and particularly in women who tend to have smaller heart valves,"" said Nina Goodheart, senior vice president and president, Structural Heart & Aortic, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""We continue to develop evidence to better understand the benefits of our Evolut TAVR technology in all patients, including patient populations that are underrepresented, under-diagnosed and under-treated. The results from the SMART trial demonstrate these benefits in a large patient population and reinforce our commitment to driving health equity and engineering the best technology to solve unmet patient needs."" In addition to being the largest comparative trial of TAVR, SMART is also the largest TAVR trial to date to enroll primarily women (87%). Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis can be fatal if left untreated and the average patient survival is two years without treatment.1 Despite women's longer life expectancy, once impacted by severe aortic stenosis they suffer from higher mortality than men, even after matching for age.2 Both TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are options for women to treat AS. Due to their smaller aortic annuli, women can often receive a valve replacement that does not properly fit their anatomy — highlighting the need for clinical evidence to inform the best treatment approaches.3 Additionally, despite prevalence of chronic conditions associated with AS in women over 65, a new survey of over 1,000 women announced today found that the majority have never been referred to a cardiologist. ""As clinicians, we know that tailored approaches are needed to address the unique presentation of AS in the small annulus patient population, which is primarily women. Little comparative data exists to help us with valve selection,"" said Howard C. Herrmann, M.D., Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Penn., and lead investigator of the SMART Trial. ""While we know women have a greater benefit than men when treated with TAVR vs SAVR, now for the first time there is definitive data demonstrating that women have the best valve performance when treated with the Evolut TAVR system."" The SMART Trial is an international, prospective, multi-center, randomized (1:1) post-market trial comparing the safety and performance of self-expanding versus balloon-expandable TAVR in patients with symptomatic severe AS and SAA. The trial randomized and treated 716 patients, 87% of which were women, across more than 80 sites worldwide. Eligible patients had a computed tomography aortic valve annulus area of ≤430 mm2 and suitable anatomy for transfemoral TAVR with both an Evolut PRO/PRO+/FX or a SAPIEN 3™/3 Ultra™ valve. ""For patients with heart valve replacements, early bioprosthetic valve dysfunction can lead to increased risk of serious long term outcomes including mortality and rehospitalization,"" added Dr. Herrmann. ""As clinicians, these data further reinforces that not all valves are the same, and we strongly need to consider valve performance when determining device selection."" Results demonstrated that the Evolut TAVR platform met both co-primary endpoints of clinical non-inferiority and hemodynamic superiority at one year. Evolut TAVR met non-inferiority for the clinical outcome primary endpoint, a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, or heart failure rehospitalization at one year (9.4% Evolut vs. 10.6% SAPIEN, p<0.001 for non-inferiority).Evolut TAVR demonstrated superiority for the valve function primary endpoint, bioprosthetic valve dysfunction through one year (9.4% Evolut vs. 41.6% SAPIEN, p<0.001 for superiority).""Medtronic is committed to providing clinicians and patients with aortic stenosis long-term data to help to inform their treatment decisions,"" said Jeffrey Popma, M.D., vice president and Chief Medical Officer for the Coronary & Renal Denervation business and the Structural Heart & Aortic business at Medtronic. ""Our prior studies have shown an important link between valve performance, mortality, and re-hospitalization at five years. All SMART patients will be followed for five years to assess the relationship between better valve performance and improved clinical outcomes in patients with small annuli.""

Positive None. Negative None. 04/07/2024 - 08:00 AM Despite prevalence of chronic conditions associated with aortic stenosis in women over 65, the majority have never been referred to a cardiologist; Racial disparities may present further opportunities for awareness amongst women at risk for cardiovascular disease DUBLIN, April 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc, a global leader in healthcare technology, today unveiled topline findings of its comprehensive survey on women's perceptions and knowledge of risk factors, treatment patterns, and preventive care practices related to heart valve disease. The survey is endorsed by Women as One and was conducted by Wakefield Research sampling 1,000 women in the United States (U.S.) aged 50 and older. ""In order to tackle the ever-growing challenges that female patients face in health care, we need to fully understand issues surrounding their awareness and the impact it has on their health,"" said Nina Goodheart, senior vice president and president, Structural Heart & Aortic, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""Heart valve disease awareness deserves broader attention in the U.S., especially considering many women aged 50 and older are at an increased risk of developing the disease. This survey shines a light on the need for increased awareness, early detection, and access to appropriate care for women."" The survey targeted a diverse sample of women aged 50 and above, with 53% between 50 to 65 years old and 47% aged 66 or older. Notably, 23.5% of respondents were Black or Hispanic, ensuring a nationally representative demographic of U.S. women in this age group. Findings from the survey highlight: There is a lack of awareness among women about the risks of aortic stenosis (AS) and cardiovascular disease. Despite the prevalence of cardiovascular disease amongst women, awareness is low, with 26% of women not having heard of any of the most common heart-related conditions such as coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, heart valve disease, or AS, and only 30% of women aged 50 and older having heard of AS. Additionally, women of color have less awareness compared to their white counterparts, with only 10% of Black women and 21% of Hispanic women having heard of AS, compared to 33% of white women. Women are not referred for diagnosis and treatment.Even in women who present with risk factors, they are not always referred or screened- highlighting the opportunity to strengthen the referral and preventive screening pathway. In fact, 82% of women above age 65 are living with a chronic condition that increases their risk of aortic stenosis, yet the majority (68%) have never been referred to a cardiologist or taken a heart disease risk assessment. Women do not seek cardiovascular care because they believe their symptoms will not be taken seriously.Women experiencing heart valve disease symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath stated the following would prevent them for seeking medical care: More than 2 in five women cite fear or anxiety about going to the doctor15% cite feeling like their doctor will dismiss their symptomsWomen are interested in treatments that have been proven effective in women.For women diagnosed with a medical condition such as heart valve disease and deciding which treatment to pursue, they look to what would work best for them based on several important factors, such as minimally invasive treatment, recovery time, and doctor recommendation. When selecting the top three factors they consider, close to half (45%) include a minimally invasive procedure - highlighting the importance of solutions like TAVR.Additionally, the majority (75%) of women surveyed are very or extremely likely to ask their doctor about a different treatment option if they learn of one that is shown to be more effective in women than the one their doctor recommended.""When compared to male patients, female patients often present with more advanced symptoms of heart valve disease highlighting the importance of uncovering how we can best educate women on early warning signs and treatment options sooner,"" stated Roxana Mehran, MD, co-founder and president of Women as One. ""These survey findings grant us the opportunity to develop better partnerships with communities experiencing the most inequities and provide a pathway to refining policies and systems that will lead to better care."" Medtronic, Women as One, and others are spearheading a range of initiatives, from educational campaigns and women-focused clinical trial research with policymakers and government officials to increase health equity for women with heart valve disease. ""Driving change to address inequities in healthcare cannot be done alone. When it comes to heart valve disease in women, Medtronic is proud to partner with our clinical community and organizations like Women as One to identify opportunities to improve health equity outcomes,"" added Goodheart. ""Today at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session, we look forward to further demonstrating this commitment with the results of our SMART trial, our latest effort to address the underrepresentation of women in cardiovascular health research."" About Women and Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis (AS), a narrowing of the aortic valve, is among the most common of all valvular heart diseases, impacting 1.5 million in the U.S.1 Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (ssAS) can be fatal if left untreated and the average patient survival is two years without treatment.2 Despite women's longer life expectancy, once impacted by ssAS, women suffer from higher mortality than men, even after matching for age.3 Alarmingly, 77% of women are living with chronic conditions that increase their risk of aortic stenosis, including high blood pressure (53%), high cholesterol (39%), and obesity (38%).

The lead candidate is being evaluated in Phase 2 trials for multiple cancer types. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Analyst The recent follow-up data from the Phase 1 trial of autogene cevumeran presents a significant advancement in the field of oncology, particularly for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has historically had poor prognoses. The elicitation of a polyspecific T cell response over a three-year period indicates a potentially durable immune response, a critical factor in cancer recurrence prevention. The fact that 50% of the trial participants showed a prolonged median recurrence-free survival is notable, as PDAC typically has high recurrence rates post-surgery.From a research perspective, the use of mRNA technology in cancer vaccines is a burgeoning area. The vaccine's mechanism, leveraging the body's own immune system to target tumor-specific neoantigens, represents a shift towards personalized medicine. The reported synergy of autogene cevumeran with the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab could signal an emerging standard in combination therapies, which may become a focal point in future oncology treatment protocols. Market Research Analyst In terms of market impact, BioNTech's update on autogene cevumeran could influence investor sentiment, particularly as the company progresses into Phase 2 trials for multiple cancer indications. The positive follow-up results may lead to increased investor confidence in BioNTech's mRNA-based iNeST platform. Given the high unmet medical need in PDAC and the limited treatment options, a successful vaccine could capture a significant market share and offer substantial revenue potential for both BioNTech and Genentech.Moreover, the expansion of clinical trial sites globally suggests a strategic move to accelerate enrollment and gather diverse data, potentially expediting the path to regulatory approval. If Phase 2 trials confirm the Phase 1 results, it could be a precursor to the vaccine becoming a new standard of care, which would disrupt the current treatment landscape and have a profound impact on the companies' financials and stock performance. Biotech Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the development of autogene cevumeran is significant for both BioNTech and Genentech. The investment in this vaccine development is a strategic move, considering the high costs associated with PDAC treatment and the potential for a breakthrough therapy designation, which could expedite the approval process and provide market exclusivity benefits. The collaboration between BioNTech and Genentech could distribute development costs and risks, while also combining resources for a more robust market entry strategy.It's critical to monitor the progress of the Phase 2 trials, as they will have a more substantial patient cohort and will provide more definitive efficacy and safety data. This will be a key determinant in the vaccine's path to market and can have significant implications for the financial projections of both companies. Investors will be keen to track this development, as positive Phase 2 outcomes could lead to a surge in stock valuation, while any setbacks could have the opposite effect. 04/07/2024 - 02:00 PM Three-year follow-up data of an investigator-initiated Phase 1 trial of the individualized mRNA cancer vaccine candidate autogene cevumeran (BNT122, RO7198457) continue to show polyspecific T cell responses up to three years and delayed tumor recurrence in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”)A randomized Phase 2 clinical trial with autogene cevumeran in patients with resected PDAC is currently enrolling patients at clinical trial sites in the United States, with additional sites planned to open globallyThe medical need in PDAC is high with a 5-year overall survival rate of only 8-10%1,2, high recurrence rates after surgery at nearly 80%3 and limited treatment optionsAutogene cevumeran, jointly developed by BioNTech and Genentech Inc. (“Genentech”), a member of the Roche Group, is the lead candidate of BioNTech’s mRNA-based individualized cancer vaccine platform iNeST and currently being evaluated in three ongoing randomized Phase 2 clinical trials in adjuvant PDAC, first-line melanoma, and adjuvant colorectal cancer MAINZ, Germany, April 7, 2024 - BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) today announced three-year follow-up data from a Phase 1 trial with the mRNA-based individualized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (“iNeST”) candidate autogene cevumeran (also known as BNT122, RO7198457) in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”). The data show that in 8 out of 16 patients autogene cevumeran elicited an immune response up to three years post administration measured by activated T cells. The persistence of T cels was associated with a longer median recurrence-free survival in cancer vaccine responders. “These new data are an early signal for the potential of our individualized mRNA cancer vaccine approach in this indication with an unmet medical need. The results indicate that our uridine mRNA-LPX technology can promote activation of cytotoxic T cells that may help to eliminate residual tumor foci at early stages of the disease to delay or prevent recurrence,” said Prof. Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech. “Our ongoing Phase 2 trial with Genentech aims to confirm these findings on benefit for patients with PDAC compared with the current standard of care treatment in the post-surgical, adjuvant setting in a larger patient population. We remain committed to our vision of personalized cancer medicine and aim to help advance the standard of care for many patients.” The results featured in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting 2024 show the following: In 8 of 16 patients, autogene cevumeran elicited high-magnitude T cells specific to the encoded neoantigens. 98% of the T cells targeting individual neoantigens on the tumor and induced by autogene cevumeran were de novo in that they were not detected in blood, tumors, and adjacent tissues prior to administration of the investigational treatment. Over 80% of the vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific T cells could still be detected up to three years post administration in patients with an immune response. These patients showed a prolonged median recurrence-free survival compared to non-responders. 6 of 8 patients with an immune response to autogene cevumeran remained disease free during the three-year follow-up period, while 7 of the 8 patients without an immune response to the treatment during the trial showed tumor recurrence. The investigator-initiated, single center Phase 1 trial (NCT04161755) evaluated the safety of autogene cevumeran in sequential combination with the anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and standard-of-care chemotherapy in 16 patients with resected PDAC. Data from the 1.5-year median follow-up were published in Nature in May 2023. The current data update includes a three-year median follow-up and was presented in a late-breaking oral presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego, California, by principal investigator Vinod Balachandran, M.D., surgeon-scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and principal investigator of the study. An ongoing open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 2 trial (NCT05968326), sponsored by Genentech in collaboration with BioNTech, was started in October 2023. The trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant autogene cevumeran in combination with the anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and chemotherapy compared with the current standard of care chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) in patients with PDAC. The Phase 2 trial is currently enrolling patients at clinical trial sites in the United States, with additional sites planned to open globally. Autogene cevumeran is being jointly developed by BioNTech and Genentech and is currently being evaluated in three ongoing randomized Phase 2 clinical trials in adjuvant PDAC (as mentioned above), first-line melanoma, and adjuvant colorectal cancer. ----- About resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)PDAC is amongst the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States4 with approximately 90% of patients dying within two years of their diagnosis5. A combination of surgical removal and systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown to improve clinical outcomes; however, even with surgical resection, the relapse rate remains high, and the 5-year overall survival is only approximately 20%6 in patients who undergo surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (“ACT”) and only 8-10%i,ii in those who do not receive ACT. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for novel therapies for patients with resected PDAC. About iNeST (individualized Neoantigen Specificimmuno Therapy)iNeST immunotherapies are investigational individualized cancer therapies tailored to a specific patient’s tumor. They contain unmodified, pharmacologically optimized mRNA encoding up to 20 patient-specific neoantigens, identified using real-time next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic neoantigen discovery. Neoantigens are proteins that are produced by cancer cells that differ from the proteins produced by healthy cells and are recognized by immune cells. The mRNA is encapsulated in BioNTech’s proprietary intravenous RNA-lipoplex delivery formulation which is designed to enhance stability as well as enable targeted delivery to dendritic cells. By analyzing each patient’s tumor, BioNTech is able to identify the cancer mutations that may act as neoantigens. Each individual cancer vaccine encodes for neoantigen candidates with the highest likelihood of helping the immune system recognize the cancer. For this purpose, BioNTech has developed an on-demand manufacturing process, following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. Autogene cevumeran is currently being evaluated in various solid tumor indications, including three Phase 2 clinical trials in first-line melanoma, adjuvant colorectal cancer, and adjuvant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Plozasiran demonstrated a favorable safety profile with common adverse events like COVID-19 infection and diarrhea. Phase 3 studies SHASTA-3 and SHASTA-4 are planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plozasiran in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The data from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals' Phase 2 SHASTA-2 study on plozasiran indicates a substantial reduction in triglycerides and APOC3 levels in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG). The implications of these results are significant for the medical community and potential investors, as SHTG is associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis and cardiovascular diseases. The ability of plozasiran to achieve a reduction in triglyceride levels below the threshold for elevated pancreatitis risk in a large percentage of patients could position it as a leading treatment option, addressing an unmet medical need.From a research perspective, the consistency and durability of the drug's effect, with limited interpatient variability, are particularly noteworthy. These characteristics could translate into a strong value proposition in the competitive landscape of lipid-lowering therapies. The upcoming Phase 3 studies, SHASTA-3 and SHASTA-4, are critical for confirming efficacy and safety in a larger population, which, if successful, could lead to FDA approval and commercialization. The safety profile, as reported, appears favorable, which is an essential factor for both regulatory approval and market acceptance. Financial Analyst Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals' announcement regarding the progress of plozasiran may have a positive impact on its stock valuation. The transition into Phase 3 clinical trials represents a significant milestone in the drug development process, often serving as a catalyst for investor interest. Given the high prevalence of SHTG and the limited treatment options currently available, the market potential for plozasiran is considerable. Moreover, the drug's ability to significantly lower triglyceride levels and improve other atherogenic lipid profiles presents a strong case for its differentiation in the market.Investors will likely monitor the initiation of the Phase 3 studies closely, as these trials could further de-risk the investment proposition. It is also important to consider the broader implications of a successful launch, such as potential partnerships, licensing agreements, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their cardiometabolic portfolios. The financial health of Arrowhead, including cash flow and burn rate, will be critical as they progress through these capital-intensive late-stage trials. Cardiologist The clinical outcomes of plozasiran are promising from a cardiology standpoint, as the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is a challenging aspect of cardiovascular risk reduction. The drug's efficacy in reducing triglycerides and APOC3, a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism, could have significant implications for patient care. Achieving normal triglyceride levels in nearly half of the patients is particularly impressive and could lead to a reduction in the incidence of pancreatitis and potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular events.However, long-term data and real-world evidence will be necessary to fully understand the clinical benefits and to integrate plozasiran into treatment guidelines. The cardiovascular community will also be interested in the drug's impact on endpoints such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death in future studies. Additionally, the drug's tolerability and ease of use in a broader patient population will be critical factors for widespread clinical adoption. 04/07/2024 - 09:00 AM - Plozasiran reduced triglycerides and APOC3 up to a mean maximum of 86% and 90% respectively in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia - SHASTA-3 and SHASTA-4 Phase 3 studies to be initiated PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today presented final data from the double-blind treatment period of its Phase 2 SHASTA-2 study of investigational plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG). Results from the SHASTA-2 study showed dramatic, consistent, and sustained reductions in Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) and triglycerides and improvement in multiple atherogenic lipoprotein levels. These data were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation today at the American College of Cardiology 73rd Annual Scientific Session & Expo (ACC.24) in Atlanta and simultaneously published in the journal JAMA Cardiology. “Promising results presented today at ACC.24 and simultaneously published in JAMA Cardiology showed that treatment with plozasiran in the SHASTA-2 study led to significant and sustained reductions in triglyceride levels below the threshold associated with elevated risk for pancreatitis. These are important and exciting data as patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia currently have limited treatment options,” said Daniel Gaudet, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at Université de Montréal and Principal Investigator for the SHASTA-2 study. Select SHASTA-2 Results Treatment with plozasiran led to dose-dependent placebo-adjusted reductions in triglycerides (primary endpoint) of -49% (P < 0.001), -53% (P < 0.001), and -57% (P < 0.001), driven by placebo-adjusted reductions in APOC3 of -68% (P < 0.001), -72% (P < 0.001), and -77% (P < 0.001) at week 24, after receiving two doses of 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg plozasiran, respectively. Mean maximum, non-placebo adjusted reductions from baseline in triglycerides and APOC3 were up to 86% and 90% and typically occurred around week 16 or week 20. Significant and durable triglyceride and APOC3 reductions persisted to week 48, 36 weeks after the last dose. There was limited interpatient variability in pharmacodynamic response across all plozasiran treatment groups. Among patients treated with plozasiran, 90.6% achieved a triglyceride level less than 500 mg/dL, the level associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis, at week 24. In addition, 48.4% of patients achieved normal triglyceride levels of less than 150 mg/dL at week 24. Subjects treated with plozasiran also showed improvements in multiple atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein levels, including remnant cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. Bruce Given, M.D., interim chief medical scientist at Arrowhead, added, “We continue to be encouraged by the full 48-week data from the SHASTA-2 study of plozasiran in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and as a result we are confidently advancing the program into multiple Phase 3 studies. We are pleased that over 90% of patients that received just two doses of plozasiran in the SHASTA-2 study achieved triglyceride levels below the level associated with increased risk of pancreatitis, and almost half of patients achieved triglyceride levels in the normal range, which is surprising given the high mean starting levels of almost 900 mg/dL. Two of Arrowhead’s planned Phase 3 studies are SHASTA-3 and SHASTA-4, which are both pivotal, year-long, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plozasiran in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, the same patient population as SHASTA-2. These studies are both on schedule to begin dosing over the coming months.” Safety and Tolerability Plozasiran demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the SHASTA-2 study. The adverse event and serious adverse event profile were similar across treatment groups. Observed adverse events generally reflected the comorbidities and underlying conditions of the study population. All serious treatment emergent adverse events were deemed not related to plozasiran. The most common events occurring in 5 or more patients were COVID-19 infection, worsening glycemic control, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, and headache.

American College of Cardiology 73rd Annual Scientific Session & Expo – April 6-8, 2024 Title: Plozasiran (ARO-APOC3), An Investigational RNAi Therapeutic, Demonstrates Profound and Durable Reductions in APOC3 and Triglycerides (TG) in Patients With Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), SHASTA-2 Final Results Date/Time: April 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m. EDT Presenter: Daniel Gaudet MD, PhD Session: Late-Breaking Clinical Trials II Slides from the late-breaking oral presentation at ACC.24 may be accessed on the Events and Presentations page under the Investors section of the Arrowhead website after the oral presentation concludes. About SHASTA-2 SHASTA-2 (AROAPOC3-2001) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in adults with SHTG. Three dose levels of plozasiran (10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg) were evaluated against placebo in 229 participants who had mean fasting triglycerides of greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) at screening. Participants were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive plozasiran or placebo. Each participant received subcutaneous injections on day 1 and week 12. The duration of the study was approximately 54 weeks from screening to the week 48 end-of-study examination. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of plozasiran in adults with SHTG and to select a dosing regimen for later stage clinical studies in this patient population. About Severe Hypertriglyceridemia Severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) is characterized by triglyceride (TG) levels greater than 500 mg/dL1-3. Very severe forms (TG greater 880 mg/dl) include familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS)4-6. SHTG significantly increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and acute pancreatitis (AP), often with recurrent attacks requiring repeat hospital admissions and worsening outcomes1-3,6. AP risk is proportional to number, characteristics, and concentration of triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs), particularly chylomicrons, and increases as TGs rise7. Limited treatment options exist to sustainably reduce TGs below the pancreatitis risk threshold1-3. About Plozasiran Plozasiran, previously called ARO-APOC3, is a first-in-class investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic designed to reduce production of Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), which is a component of triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. APOC3 increases triglyceride levels in the blood by inhibiting breakdown of TRLs by lipoprotein lipase and uptake of TRL remnants by hepatic receptors in the liver. The goal of treatment with plozasiran is to reduce the level of APOC3, thereby reducing triglycerides and restoring lipids to more normal levels. In multiple clinical studies, investigational plozasiran demonstrated reductions in triglycerides and multiple atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), and mixed dyslipidemia (MD). Plozasiran has demonstrated a favorable safety profile to date with treatment emergent adverse events reported that reflect the comorbidities and underlying conditions of the study populations. Plozasiran is currently being investigated in the Phase 3 PALISADE clinical study in patients with FCS, which is on schedule to be completed in the middle of 2024. Phase 2 studies in patients with SHTG and MD, SHASTA-2 and MUIR respectively, are complete and additional Phase 3 studies are planned to begin shortly. Plozasiran has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency.
