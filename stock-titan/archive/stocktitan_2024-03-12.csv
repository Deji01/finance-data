The relevant criteria for World Class deposits, adjusted to current long run commodity prices, are considered to be those holding or likely to hold more than 5 million tonnes of copper and/or more than 6 million ounces of gold with a modelled net present value of greater than US$1billion.The Company cautions that the Cascabel Project remains an early-stage project at this time and there is inherent uncertainty relating to any project at prior to the determination of pre-feasibility study and/or defined feasibility study.On this basis, reference to the Cascabel Project as ""World Class"" (or ""Tier 1"") is considered to be appropriate.This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The company also announced a share repurchase program and plans to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance. Positive Positive financial results for Aurora Mobile Limited in Q4 and fiscal year 2023, with consecutive quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth in all quarters. Gross profits increased in every quarter of 2023, despite some revenue declines in specific segments. Operating expenses decreased by 36% year-over-year, indicating improved operational efficiency. The company had a net operating cash inflow of RMB11.4 million in Q4 2023. Aurora Mobile announced a share repurchase program and plans to repurchase up to US$5 million of its shares until December 31, 2024. Negative Revenues decreased by 11% year-over-year in Q4 2023. Cost of revenues, gross profit, and net loss all decreased year-over-year in Q4 2023. Adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA figures were negative in Q4 2023. Some segments, like Value-added services and Vertical applications, experienced revenue declines in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The unaudited financial results released by Aurora Mobile Limited for Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 indicate a complex financial position that stakeholders should analyze with care. While the company has achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA for consecutive quarters, which is a sign of operational efficiency and potentially stabilizing financial health, the overall revenue has decreased by 11% year-over-year in Q4 and 12% year-over-year for the fiscal year. This juxtaposition of positive operational metrics against a backdrop of declining revenue warrants a deeper analysis of the company's revenue streams and cost management strategies.Particularly noteworthy is the company's ability to reduce operating expenses significantly, by 36% year-over-year in Q4 and manage a net operating cash inflow of RMB11.4 million. The reduction in expenses is a positive sign for the company's cost control measures. However, the decline in revenue, especially in the Value-Added Services and Vertical Applications, raises concerns about the company's growth prospects in these areas. The growth in Developer Services revenue and the expansion of the EngageLab platform globally, with a substantial increase in customer numbers and contract value, provides a counterbalance to these concerns and suggests potential areas of growth for the company.Another positive indicator is the improvement in accounts receivable turnover days, which suggests enhanced efficiency in the company's credit control and cash collection processes. The high balance of deferred revenue also indicates a strong future contract performance pipeline, which could translate into stable future revenues. However, the net losses reported, despite being lower than the previous year, suggest that profitability remains a challenge. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Aurora Mobile's performance reflects broader trends in the technology services sector in China, where competition is fierce and customer demands are rapidly evolving. The company's focus on customer engagement and marketing technology services positions it in a highly competitive market, where innovation and adaptability are crucial for maintaining and growing market share.The significant growth in EngageLab's global customer numbers and contract value indicates a successful scaling of this platform, which could be a strategic advantage in attracting international clients and diversifying revenue sources. This international expansion could mitigate risks associated with market saturation and regulatory challenges in the domestic Chinese market.The decrease in Value-Added Services revenue, however, is a concern that the company will need to address. As this can be an important driver for profitability in tech companies, understanding the cause of reduced demand in this area is critical. It could be due to increased competition, changes in consumer preferences, or a lack of innovation in the services offered. The company's strategy to revive this segment will be crucial for its long-term success. Economist Examining Aurora Mobile's financial results from an economic standpoint, the company's cost-cutting measures, such as the decrease in operating expenses, reflect a strategic response to the macroeconomic environment. In periods of economic uncertainty or slowdown, which China has faced due to various internal and external factors, businesses often resort to tightening their operational costs to maintain financial stability.The company's ability to maintain a high deferred revenue balance indicates strong forward contracts, which can be viewed as a positive economic indicator of future revenue stability. However, the overall decrease in revenues and the net losses indicate that the company is not immune to economic pressures. The tech sector in China is subject to cyclical fluctuations and regulatory changes, which can significantly impact companies like Aurora Mobile.Furthermore, the share repurchase program, extended until December 31, 2024, signals confidence by the company's board in the intrinsic value of the company's shares. This could be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, potentially indicating underpricing of the shares or a strategic move to consolidate ownership, which can sometimes lead to an increase in the stock price. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of using cash for share repurchases instead of investing in growth or innovation, especially in a dynamic sector like technology services. 03/12/2024 - 03:30 AM SHENZHEN, China, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aurora Mobile Limited (“Aurora Mobile” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JG), a leading provider of customer engagement and marketing technology services in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Last but not least, our overseas messaging service platform, EngageLab, continued to expand globally and record great results this quarter. For our total group revenues, we achieved positive growth of 5% quarter-over-quarter driven mainly by the growth in Developer Services revenues. Subscription Services revenues were RMB48.8 million, up 5% both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. This was mainly driven by increases in both ARPU and customer numbers year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Within the year 2023, the Subscription Services revenues grew sequentially in all 4 quarters mainly due to the steady increase in ARPU throughout the year. Value-added services revenues were RMB6.8 million, decreased by 60% year-over-year, which was due to reduced demands, but increased by 38% quarter-over-quarter. Vertical applications had a tough quarter where revenue recorded single-digit decline both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. EngageLab business continued to see great growth between the quarters where global customer number grew by more than 70% and cumulative contract value grew by more than 50%. We are very pleased with the growth trajectory and looking forward to more growth going forward.” Mr. Shan-Nen Bong, Chief Financial Officer of Aurora Mobile, added, “Through our tight expense control, operating expenses have decreased by 36% year-over-year in Q4 of 2023.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation, reduction in force charges, share of loss from equity method investment, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of long-term investments and change in fair value of foreign currency swap contract. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of land use right, income tax expenses/(benefits), share-based compensation, reduction in force charges, share of loss from equity method investment, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of long-term investments and change in fair value of foreign currency swap contract. The Company believes that adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that it includes in loss from operations and net loss. The Company believes that adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the management in their financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.

ATRenew Announces US$20 Million Share Repurchase Program,2024-03-12T08:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"ATRenew Inc. (RERE) announces a share repurchase program of up to US$20 million, aimed at enhancing shareholder value and utilizing existing cash balance.","ATRenew Announces US$20 Million Share Repurchase Program Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary ATRenew Inc. (RERE) announces a share repurchase program of up to US$20 million, aimed at enhancing shareholder value and utilizing existing cash balance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The authorization of a share repurchase program by ATRenew Inc. is a strategic financial move that typically indicates the company's management believes its shares are undervalued. By allocating up to US$20 million for this initiative, ATRenew is signaling confidence in its financial stability and future prospects. Repurchasing shares can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS), as the total number of shares outstanding decreases, theoretically making each remaining share more valuable.Investors often view buyback programs positively, as they can provide support to the stock price by creating additional demand in the market. It's also a way for the company to return value to shareholders, which could be preferable to dividends if the management believes reinvestment opportunities are not as attractive. However, it's crucial to consider the opportunity cost of using cash for buybacks over alternative investments or debt reduction. The effect on the stock price will largely depend on the market's perception of the buyback's motive and the company's ability to generate future growth. Market Research Analyst In the context of the consumer electronics sector in China, a repurchase program could be a response to sector-specific challenges such as market saturation or increased competition. For ATRenew, a company that specializes in pre-owned electronics, the repurchase decision might also reflect an assessment of the second-hand market's growth potential. As the circular economy gains traction globally, companies like ATRenew could benefit from the increased consumer interest in sustainability and cost-effective alternatives to new electronics.The timing and execution of the buybacks are also critical. If done when the market undervalues the company's stock, buybacks can be particularly beneficial. The company's approach to executing the repurchase - whether on the open market, in block trades, or privately negotiated transactions - will affect the program's impact on the market. The flexibility of the program allows for adjustments based on market conditions, which can be advantageous in volatile markets. Economist On a broader economic scale, share repurchase programs reflect corporate sentiment and can influence market dynamics. In a bullish market, such programs can further fuel positive sentiment, whereas in a bearish market, they can provide a floor for the stock price. The decision by ATRenew to repurchase shares also has macroeconomic implications, as it might indicate the company's liquidity and overall health of the consumer electronics market in China.However, the impact of such a program also depends on the size relative to the company's market capitalization. A US$20 million buyback for a large-cap company might have a negligible impact, whereas, for a smaller-cap company, the same amount could be significant. It's also important to consider the source of funding for the repurchase; in this case, ATRenew plans to use its existing cash balance, which suggests a strong cash position but also reduces the cash available for other uses. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 AM SHANGHAI, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ATRenew Inc. (""ATRenew"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: RERE), a leading technology-driven pre-owned consumer electronics transactions and services platform in China, today announced that its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to US$20 million of its shares over a twelve-month period. The Company's proposed repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The Company's board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size. The Company expects to fund the repurchases out of its existing cash balance. About ATRenew Inc.

NextPlay Received Notice From NASDAQ,2024-03-12T07:19:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NextPlay Technologies, Inc. received a notice from NASDAQ for not holding an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months, leading to non-compliance with NASDAQ's Listing Rules. The company faces the risk of delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market.","NextPlay Received Notice From NASDAQ Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NextPlay Technologies, Inc. received a notice from NASDAQ for not holding an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months, leading to non-compliance with NASDAQ's Listing Rules. The company faces the risk of delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Positive None. Negative Risk of delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market due to non-compliance with Listing Rules for not holding an annual meeting within twelve months. Market Research Analyst The notification received by NextPlay Technologies from NASDAQ regarding non-compliance with the Annual Meeting Rules signifies a procedural lapse that could potentially lead to the delisting of the company's securities. This development is critical because being listed on a major exchange like NASDAQ provides a company with liquidity, better visibility among investors and generally lower cost of capital. Delisting can trigger a decline in investor confidence and potentially lead to a drop in the stock price due to reduced visibility and perceived credibility.Investors and stakeholders should be aware of the immediate and long-term implications of such a notification. In the short term, the company might experience volatility in its stock price as the market reacts to the possibility of delisting. In the long term, if delisting occurs, it could affect the company's ability to raise capital and might necessitate seeking listing on alternative exchanges, which often have less stringent requirements but also less prestige and may not provide the same level of exposure. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, NASDAQ's Annual Meeting Rules are designed to ensure that companies adhere to certain governance practices, which include holding regular shareholder meetings. These meetings are a fundamental aspect of shareholder rights, allowing investors to vote on important company matters and board elections. Non-compliance with these rules is taken seriously by the exchange and can result in delisting, which is a legal process that removes a company's stock from the exchange.The notice of potential delisting is a formal step in this process and indicates that the company will have an opportunity to present its case before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The outcome of this hearing will be pivotal for the company's future on the exchange. It's crucial for investors to monitor the developments of this hearing, as the final decision will have significant legal and financial ramifications for the company and its shareholders. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the failure to hold an annual shareholder meeting within the stipulated time frame raises concerns about NextPlay Technologies' corporate governance and operational management. Investors and analysts often scrutinize such events for underlying issues that may not be immediately apparent from financial statements alone. The market generally views governance issues negatively and this can be reflected in the company's cost of equity and debt, as well as its overall valuation.It is also important to note that if the company is delisted, it may find it more difficult to access public capital markets, which could hamper its growth and operational strategies. Current investors should assess the potential impact on their portfolios and consider the company's plans to remedy the situation and regain compliance. The company's response to this notice and its ability to convince the Panel of its commitment to compliance will be crucial in determining its financial health going forward. 03/12/2024 - 03:19 AM SUNRISE, FL, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- NextPlay Technologies, Inc.

(OTCMKTS:NEWH), the developer of a breakthrough technology that uses clean energy and water to produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen, today announced that in a recent podcast the Company’s CEO Steve Hill spoke with Will Eckenhoff, Associate Professor of Chemistry and Chair of Environmental Studies at Rhodes College. During the discussion, Dr. Eckenhoff described his research about identifying catalysts for the reduction reaction of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, leading to a new paper accepted for publication in Inorganic Chemistry. He also detailed the challenges they faced, including the need to perfect the synthesis and the impact of Covid-19 on the research process. Regarding obstacles in hydrogen adoption, Dr. Eckenhoff said, “There are challenges of transitioning to a hydrogen-based economy, especially in the context of vehicle electrification. There is the issue of recharge times and the need for efficient hydrogen production methods that don't rely on fossil fuels.” The conversation also touched on the potential of light-driven hydrogen production and electro catalytic hydrogen production and developing a distribution network for hydrogen. Mr. Hill said, “There is also a need to overcome the rate-limiting factor in electrolysis and the potential of using heat to generate the necessary reaction.” Dr. Eckenhoff concurred that generating hydrogen locally using solar energy could be a disruptive technology. They discussed the potential applications and challenges of battery technology and hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles, and they concurred that electric vehicles are suitable for short commutes due to their range, while hybrid technology or hydrogen fuel cells might be more appropriate for long-distance trucking. The discussion also touched on the recharging times, which can be a drawback for long-distance travel. They agreed that new technologies will find a niche as they mature and solve particular problems. The conversation concluded with a discussion on the future of energy technology, with a potential focus on fusion energy and the mass production of green hydrogen. Dr. Eckenhoff received his Ph.D. in Inorganic Chemistry from Duquesne University. He is a synthetic inorganic chemist specializing in the synthesis of copper, iron, cobalt, nickel and molybdenum complexes. Research in Dr. Eckenhoff’s lab has two main projects underway. The first project investigates the design, synthesis, and testing of nickel and cobalt complexes as catalysts for hydrogen production in artificial photosynthesis. A clean and inexpensive method of producing hydrogen gas is vital for the creation of a future hydrogen economy. The second project looks at a group of Molybdenum complexes which exhibit a stunning and previously unknown solvatochromic effect, or color-change in different solvents. These compounds have potential applications in sensor technology and also enhance our understanding of polarity.

For more information about NewHydrogen, please visit https://newhydrogen.com/. About NewHydrogen, Inc. NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™ – a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world’s lowest cost green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

Entry into 4 new markets in the December Quarter. Growth in the number of TOP TOY stores by 31 year over year and 26 quarter over quarter. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial performance of MINISO Group indicates a robust year-over-year growth in revenue, gross profit, operating profit and adjusted net profit. With a 54.0% increase in revenue and a 77.3% increase in profit for the period, these figures suggest a significant expansion in the company's market presence and operational efficiency. The gross margin improvement from 40.0% to 43.1% reflects a strategic success in cost management or product mix optimization, which is crucial for retail companies to maintain competitiveness.Furthermore, the operational expansion, as seen by the addition of 973 stores, demonstrates aggressive growth strategies, particularly in international markets. This not only diversifies the company's revenue streams but also mitigates risks associated with single-market dependence. The entry into four new markets suggests a confident global outlook by the company. However, rapid expansion can also entail risks such as brand dilution or operational challenges and it will be important to monitor how MINISO manages these potential issues. Financial Analyst The significant year-over-year increases in adjusted net profit and adjusted EBITDA, by 77.0% and 66.8% respectively, indicate a strong financial performance and operational leverage. An increase in adjusted net margin from 15.0% to 17.2% also highlights improved profitability, which is a positive signal to investors regarding the company's earnings quality. The improved EBITDA margin suggests that the company is not only increasing its sales but is also becoming more efficient in its operations.Investors should note that such performance may positively influence the stock price as it reflects the company's ability to scale profitably. Nonetheless, it is essential to consider the sustainability of this growth, given the volatile nature of the retail industry and the potential impact of macroeconomic factors. Economist The expansion of MINISO's store count and its entry into additional markets indicate an aggressive pursuit of market share in the value retail segment. This strategy can be seen as a response to the growing global demand for affordable lifestyle products. The increase in the number of stores, both domestically and overseas, also reflects confidence in consumer spending patterns despite potential economic headwinds.However, the company's rapid growth must be weighed against the backdrop of global economic conditions, including trade tensions, currency fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. These factors can significantly impact the retail sector and should be considered when evaluating the company's long-term growth trajectory and resilience. 03/12/2024 - 12:15 AM GUANGZHOU, China, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MINISO Group Holding Limited (NYSE: MNSO; HKEX: 9896) (""MINISO"", ""MINISO Group"" or the ""Company""), a global value retailer offering a variety of trendy lifestyle products featuring IP design, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the ""December Quarter"").

Unaudited Financial Results for the December Quarter Revenue was RMB3,841.3 million (US$541.0 million), representing an increase of 54.0% year over year, primarily driven by a 55.7% increase in revenue from China, and a 51.4% increase in revenue from overseas markets. Revenue from China was RMB2,347.3 million (US$330.6 million). The 55.7% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by (i) an increase of 63.2% in revenue from MINISO's offline stores in China, which was the result of a 17.2% growth in average store count and a 39.2% growth in average revenue per MINISO store in China, and (ii) an increase of 90.5% in revenue from TOP TOY, which was the result of a 19.5% growth in average store count and a 59.4% growth in average revenue per TOP TOY store. Revenue from overseas markets was RMB1,494.0 million (US$210.4 million). The 51.4% year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase of 15.9% in average store count and a growth of 30.7% in average revenue per MINISO store in overseas markets. Revenue from overseas markets contributed 38.9% of the Company's total revenue in the December quarter of 2023, compared to 39.5% in the same period of 2022 and 34.2% in the previous quarter of 2023. For more information on the composition and year-over-year change of revenue, please refer to ""Unaudited Additional Information"" in this press release. Cost of sales was RMB2,184.0 million (US$307.6 million), representing an increase of 45.9% year over year. Gross profit was RMB1,657.3 million (US$233.4 million), representing an increase of 66.2% year over year. Gross margin was 43.1%, compared to 40.0% in the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher gross margin in overseas markets contributed by product optimization and higher revenue contribution from directly operated overseas markets which accounted for over 50% of revenue from overseas markets, compared to 42.0% in the same period of 2022, and (ii) higher gross margin of TOP TOY due to a shift in product mix towards more profitable products. Other income was RMB5.6 million (US$0.8 million), compared to RMB7.9 million in the same period of 2022. Selling and distribution expenses were RMB722.2 million (US$101.7 million), representing an increase of 73.3% year over year. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, selling and distribution expenses were RMB700.8 million (US$98.7 million), representing an increase of 71.4% year over year. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to (i) increased personnel-related expenses, logistics expenses and IP licensing expenses in relation to the growth of the Company's business, (ii) increased depreciation expenses of the right-of-use assets in relation to directly operated stores, and (iii) increased promotion and advertising expenses, mainly in connection with the Company's brand upgrade and the opening of new stores in overseas markets. General and administrative expenses were RMB187.1 million (US$26.4 million), representing an increase of 27.9% year over year. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses were RMB185.9 million (US$26.2 million), representing an increase of 32.0% year over year. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to increased personnel-related expenses in relation to the growth of the Company's business. Other net income was RMB20.2 million (US$2.8 million), compared to RMB8.8 million in the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to an increase in fair value of an investment in an unlisted limited partnership enterprise. Operating profit was RMB765.4 million (US$107.8 million), representing an increase of 71.0% year over year. Net finance income was RMB40.9 million (US$5.8 million), representing an increase of 75.7% year over year, mainly due to an increase in interest income of bank deposits. Profit for the period was RMB637.8 million (US$89.8 million), representing an increase of 77.3% year over year. Adjusted net profit, which represents profit for the period excluding equity-settled share-based payment expenses, was RMB660.5 million (US$93.0 million), representing an increase of 77.0% year over year. Adjusted net margin was 17.2%, compared to 15.0% in the same period of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was RMB995.3 million (US$140.2 million), representing an increase of 66.8% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9%, compared to 23.9% in the same period of 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS were both RMB2.04 (US$0.29) in this quarter, representing an increase of 82.1% year over year from RMB1.12 in the same period of 2022. Each ADS represents four of the Company's ordinary shares. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ADS were both RMB2.12 (US$0.30) in this quarter, representing an increase of 82.8% year over year from RMB1.16 in the same period of 2022.

Exchange Rate The U.S. dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release, except for those transaction amounts that were actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the readers. The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into US$ in this press release is based on the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 29, 2023, which was RMB7.0999 to US$1.0000. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on the RMB amounts. Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating the business, MINISO considers and uses adjusted net profit, adjusted net margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per share and adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per ADS as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of these non-IFRS financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. MINISO defines adjusted net profit as profit for the period excluding equity-settled share-based payment expenses. MINISO calculates adjusted net margin by dividing adjusted net profit by revenue for the same period. MINISO defines adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net profit plus depreciation and amortization, finance costs and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is computed by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the period. MINISO computes adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per ADS by dividing adjusted net profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company by the number of ADSs represented by the number of ordinary shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation on an IFRS basis. MINISO computes adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per share in the same way as it calculates adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per ADS, except that it uses the number of ordinary shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation on an IFRS basis as the denominator instead of the number of ADSs represented by these ordinary shares. MINISO presents these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. These non-IFRS financial measures enable the management to assess its operating results without considering the impacts of the aforementioned non-cash and other adjustment items that MINISO does not consider to be indicative of its operating performance in the future. Accordingly, MINISO believes that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as the management and Board of directors. These non-IFRS financial measures are not defined under IFRS and are not presented in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-IFRS financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect MINISO's operations. Further, these non-IFRS financial measures may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to profit, net profit margin, basic and diluted earnings per share and basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as applicable, or any other measures of performance or as indicators of MINISO's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review MINISO's historical non-IFRS financial measures in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measures, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing MINISO's data comparatively. MINISO encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information on the non-IFRS financial measures, please see the table captioned ""Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" set forth at the end of this press release.

Reports Unaudited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary ATRenew Inc. (RERE) reports strong financial results for Q4 2023 and FY 2023, with significant revenue growth and improved operational efficiency. The company achieved record total net revenues, increased adjusted income from operations, and announced a new share repurchase program. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported growth in total net revenues by 29.9% for the fourth quarter and 31.4% for the full year is a significant indicator of ATRenew's top-line performance. The substantial reduction in loss from operations from RMB2,210.6 million to RMB16.7 million year-over-year for the fourth quarter, alongside the improvement in adjusted income from operations, signals enhanced operational efficiency. Investors should note the positive trajectory in operational income, despite the reported net losses, which could suggest a strategic pivot towards profitability.The share repurchase program announced is often interpreted as a signal of confidence from management in the company's valuation and future prospects. This program can potentially support the stock price by reducing the supply of shares in the market and demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, investors should consider the scale of the buyback relative to the company's market capitalization and liquidity position.It is also important to note the company's cash position, which has remained relatively stable year-over-year. This provides insight into the company's liquidity and its ability to sustain operations and invest in growth initiatives. The forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests continued revenue growth, which may be a positive signal for investors regarding the company's performance trajectory. Market Research Analyst ATRenew's focus on the pre-owned consumer electronics market in China places it within a growing sector that benefits from increasing consumer interest in sustainability and the circular economy. The reported increase in the number of consumer products transacted indicates a solid demand for the company's services and an expanding customer base. This can be a critical driver for long-term growth, especially as environmental concerns become more prominent in consumer decision-making.The company's strategic investments in service quality upgrades and customer acquisition are also noteworthy. These investments are likely aimed at enhancing the user experience and increasing market share, which are vital for maintaining competitive advantage in the online marketplace space. By improving service quality and pricing mechanisms, ATRenew is likely to attract and retain users, which is fundamental for revenue growth in platform-based businesses. Economist The economic context within which ATRenew operates is crucial for understanding its financial results. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, as mentioned in the report, suggests that the company is overcoming previous operational challenges. This recovery is reflected in the increased service revenues from the Paipai and PJT marketplaces. The Chinese economy's performance, especially in the technology and consumer goods sectors, will continue to influence ATRenew's business.Furthermore, the company's operational efficiency improvements, indicated by the reduction in losses from operations, are essential in a competitive landscape where margins can be thin. The ability to control costs while growing revenues is often a significant challenge for companies in the e-commerce space. ATRenew's reported cost controls and the decrease in certain expenses, such as selling and marketing, suggest effective management practices that could have long-term positive implications for the company's financial health. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 AM SHANGHAI, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ATRenew Inc.

Net product revenues increased by 31.1% to RMB3,522.5 million (US$496.1 million) from RMB2,687.9 million in the same period of 2022.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses.General and administrative expenses were RMB62.2 million (US$8.8 million), compared to RMB76.6 million in the same period of 2022, representing a decrease of 18.8%, primarily due to (i) a one-off consulting fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, and (ii) a decrease in share-based compensation expenses.Technology and content expenses were RMB63.8 million (US$9.0 million), compared to RMB54.5 million in the same period of 2022, representing an increase of 17.1%.

The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in expected credit loss, and (ii) an increase in office related expenses.Technology and content expenses decreased by 14.1% to RMB195.7 million (US$27.6 million) from RMB227.8 million in the full year of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in one-off technological expenses as the Company's platforms become more sustainable.LOSS FROM OPERATIONS Loss from operations was RMB173.3 million (US$24.4 million), compared to RMB2,623.7 million in the full year of 2022. Adjusted income from operations (non-GAAP) was RMB251.7 million (US$35.5 million), compared to RMB6.9 million in the full year of 2022. NET LOSS Net loss was RMB156.3 million (US$22.0 million), compared to RMB2,467.9 million in the full year of 2022. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was RMB225.2 million (US$31.9 million), compared to RMB50.8 million in the full year of 2022. BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share were RMB0.96 (US$0.14), compared to RMB15.16 in the same period of 2022. Adjusted basic and diluted net income per ordinary share (non-GAAP) were RMB1.39 (US$0.20), compared to RMB0.31 and RMB0.30 in the same period of 2022. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND FUNDS RECEIVABLE FROM THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and funds receivable from third party payment service providers were RMB2,854.4 million (US$402.0 million) as of December 31, 2023, as compared to RMB2,802.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Business Outlook For the first quarter of 2024, the Company currently expects its total revenues to be between RMB3,550.0 million and RMB3,650.0 million, representing an increase of 23.6% to 27.1% year-over-year. This forecast only reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.

Exchange Rate Information This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.0999 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 29, 2023. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its business. For example, the Company uses adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per ordinary share as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted income from operations is loss from operations excluding the impact of the impairment loss of deferred cost, intangible assets and goodwill, share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Adjusted net income is net loss excluding the impact of the impairment loss of deferred cost, intangible assets and goodwill, share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions and tax effects of impairment loss of deferred cost and intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Adjusted net income per ordinary share is adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating net loss per ordinary share. The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's financial and operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income help identify underlying trends in the Company's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that are included in loss from operations and net loss. The Company also believes that the use of non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors' assessment of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income provide useful information about the Company's operating results, enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. The impairment loss of deferred cost, intangible assets and goodwill, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions and tax effects of impairment loss of deferred cost and intangible assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and is not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the Company's. In light of the foregoing limitations, the non-GAAP financial measures for the period should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to income from operations, net income, and net income attributable to ordinary shareholders per share, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, ""Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.""

The innovative technology aims to provide zero-emission solutions for heavy-duty road transport and other industrial ecosystems. The system offers a more efficient and cost-effective option compared to traditional fuel cell systems. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The unveiling of Hyzon's 200kW Prime Mover represents a significant stride in the heavy-duty commercial vehicle sector, particularly in the context of zero-emission alternatives. This development is noteworthy for its potential to disrupt the traditional diesel market, as it offers a zero-emission option that promises to meet the operational demands of heavy-duty road transport. The integration of a single stack 200kW fuel cell system that is lighter and more cost-efficient than its predecessors could enhance the competitiveness of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) against diesel-powered trucks and other electric vehicle technologies.From an industry perspective, the ability of this technology to potentially penetrate other industrial ecosystems such as mining and rail signifies a broader application of hydrogen fuel cells, which could lead to increased demand and economies of scale. Moreover, the localization of the vehicle assembly in Australia taps into the existing skilled workforce, which could bolster the regional economy and support industry growth.The long-term implications for stakeholders include the potential reduction in operational costs due to lower fuel consumption and maintenance expenses associated with FCEVs. Additionally, as governments worldwide implement stricter emission regulations, the adoption of such technology could help fleet operators remain compliant and possibly benefit from incentives aimed at reducing carbon footprints. Environmental Policy Expert The launch of Hyzon's 200kW Prime Mover aligns with global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality in the transportation sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The vehicle's introduction into the Australian and New Zealand markets addresses specific regional challenges, such as the need for heavy-duty vehicles capable of handling longer distances and heavier payloads without emissions. This move could set a precedent for the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in other regions with similar transport demands.Environmental policies are increasingly favoring the transition to low-carbon technologies and Hyzon's initiative could be well-positioned to take advantage of such policies. The collaboration with educational institutions like Kangan Institute further emphasizes the importance of developing a skilled workforce to support the emerging clean energy sector, which is essential for sustaining technological advancements and ensuring a smooth transition from fossil fuels.In the broader context of environmental policy, the success of such technologies could accelerate the decarbonization of the transport sector, contributing to the achievement of international climate goals and potentially influencing future policy frameworks to support the hydrogen economy. Market Research Analyst The entry of Hyzon's 200kW Prime Mover into the market could have implications for the competitive landscape of the commercial vehicle industry. It is essential to monitor how this technology is received by fleet operators in terms of performance, reliability and total cost of ownership compared to traditional and alternative fuel vehicles.Market acceptance will depend on the availability of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, which is currently less developed than that for diesel or battery electric vehicles. The infrastructure's development will be crucial for the widespread adoption of FCEVs. Additionally, the initial investment and operational costs will be critical factors in determining the Prime Mover's market penetration.Consumer sentiment towards sustainability and corporate responsibility to reduce carbon emissions could drive the demand for zero-emission vehicles. However, it is necessary to assess whether the performance of the 200kW Prime Mover meets the rigorous demands of heavy-duty transport to ensure a successful market entry and long-term viability. 03/11/2024 - 11:44 PM Australian Team Brings Zero-Emissions Alternatives to Region's Long-Haul Operators U.S. Developed Fuel Cell Technology Offers Smaller, Lighter, More Fuel-Efficient Option for Global Applications BOLINGBROOK, Ill., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyzon (NASDAQ: HYZN), a U.S. based leading hydrogen fuel cell technology developer and global supplier of zero-emission heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), today launched its single stack 200kW fuel cell system and powertrain in a vehicle at a ceremony attended by government officials, heavy-duty fleet operators and company employees and executives. The vehicle – Hyzon's 200kW Prime Mover, the Australian term for a heavy-duty commercial truck designed to tow a semi-trailer – was officially unveiled at the Kangan Institute's Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) in Melbourne, one of the largest educational providers of automotive training and accreditation in Australia. Sporting the company's bright refreshed branding, the 200kW Prime Mover reflects Hyzon's commitment to technological advancements and is designed to meet the operational demands of heavy-duty road transport. Hyzon integrated its innovative fuel cell technology and 200kW FCEV powertrain first into a cabover vehicle, a familiar design for fleets in Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. The company expects to deploy 200kW cabovers in Europe and 200kW conventional vehicles in the U.S. later this year. ""This is Hyzon at its best,"" said Hyzon Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Parker Meeks. ""The Hyzon 200kW Prime Mover provides our customers with a powerful, zero-emission option for their fleets, showcasing our expertise in crafting state-of-the-art FCEVs."" According to Meeks, the single stack 200kW fuel cell system also may allow Hyzon to bring the same technology to industrial ecosystems beyond trucking, including mining, rail, marine, stationary power generation, and airport ecosystems. ""Hyzon is harnessing the power of hydrogen to deliver zero-emission energy where it is needed most,"" he added. The single stack 200kW fuel cell system for the Prime Mover was manufactured at Hyzon's U.S. production facility in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This system, expected to reach start of production in the second half of 2024, generates 200kW of power output from a single fuel cell stack. Reaching 200kW fuel cell power typically requires two smaller units, but Hyzon has engineered a single stack 200kW fuel cell system that is 30% lower in weight and volume and estimated to be 25% lower in total fuel cell system cost compared to two of its 110kW fuel cell systems combined. By integrating high-power, compact fuel cell systems into familiar vehicle builds, Hyzon plans to offer a zero-emission option to fleets that can match the operational expectations of a diesel truck. Hyzon Managing Director for Australia, John Edgley, said the Prime Mover was designed and assembled locally, which is a testament to the skills and capabilities of the company's local workforce. ""We are assembling zero-emission heavy vehicles right here in Melbourne, Australia, using local skills and employing local people,"" said Edgley. ""Hyzon established Australia's first purpose-built assembly plant in Melbourne's Southeast in 2021 to capitalize on the wealth of homegrown industry skills left behind when several global automotive businesses shut down their regional operations. We have grown our team to more than 50 local employees, including engineers, fabricators, welders, and designers to put this new 200kW vehicle on the road."" According to Edgley, the 200kW Prime Mover is expected to revolutionize Australia's heavy-duty transport market and is an important step in solving a uniquely ""Australian"" problem: conquering heavier payloads and longer distance requirements – without emissions. ""We look forward to working with transport operators across Australia and New Zealand as we move forward with the decarbonization of our transport sector,"" he added. Speaking at the event, Hyzon Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Dr. Christian Mohrdieck addressed the unique design elements of the Hyzon fuel cell and fuel cell system. ""Hyzon designs and manufactures fuel cell technology from the ground up. We apply our advanced engineering capabilities throughout the system – from the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), the heart of the fuel cell system, to the balance of plant to the software,"" said Mohrdieck. ""This allows us to build a fuel cell system that fits the performance and durability needs of heavy-duty applications such as a commercial trucking."" ""The fuel cell system and powertrain integration and assembly work on our Prime Mover here in Australia demonstrates the skill of our local team, and the accelerated product development cycle highlights the advantage of Hyzon's strong global and functional collaboration,"" he added. As the host of Hyzon's 200kW Prime Mover event, Kangan Institute Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sally Curtain affirmed Kangan's collaboration partnership with Hyzon. ""Kangan Institute, through our Automotive Centre of Excellence is thrilled to continue our partnership with Hyzon, dedicated to advancing Australia's clean energy sector. Together, we are developing specialized skills and knowledge for hydrogen fuel cell training programs,"" said Curtain. ""This collaboration accelerates the commercial deployment of heavy-duty FCEVs in Australia, driving sustainable innovation in transportation."" Hyzon's 200kW Prime Movers are expected to operate on Australian and New Zealand roads later in 2024.

The offering is expected to close on March 14, 2024. Various financial institutions are involved as managers and co-managers for the offering. The Company entered into forward sale agreements with certain entities for the shares. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase additional shares. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential future investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The upsizing of Essential Properties Realty Trust's public offering from 8 million to 9 million shares at a price of $24.75 per share indicates robust investor demand and a positive market reception. This capital raise is a strategic move to bolster the company's balance sheet. The involvement of forward sale agreements allows the company to potentially delay equity dilution, as actual shares may only be issued upon settlement within an estimated 12-month period.The decision to use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential future investments, suggests a proactive approach to growth and operational expansion. Investors should monitor how these funds are allocated to gauge the effectiveness of the company's growth strategy and its impact on future earnings.The granting of a 30-day option to underwriters to purchase additional shares could lead to further capital inflow but also potential dilution for existing shareholders. The timing and execution of this option will be key factors in determining the immediate impact on the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The engagement of a diverse group of financial institutions as book-runners and co-managers reflects the offering's complexity and the need for widespread distribution channels. The breadth of underwriters and co-managers, including well-known entities such as BofA Securities and Wells Fargo Securities, enhances the credibility of the offering and could contribute to a more successful capital raise.Additionally, the use of forward sale agreements in this offering is indicative of a cautious approach to market volatility. By deferring the actual sale of shares, Essential Properties Realty Trust can mitigate potential market risks. However, this strategy also adds a layer of complexity for investors to consider, including the conditions under which the forward purchasers may not be required to borrow and sell shares. Legal Expert The utilization of a shelf registration statement for this offering streamlines the process, allowing Essential Properties Realty Trust to act swiftly in capitalizing on favorable market conditions. Investors should be aware that the final prospectus supplement will provide critical legal disclosures, including specific terms of the forward sale agreements and risks associated with the offering.It is essential for stakeholders to understand that the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory compliance. The legal framework, including the potential for the offering not to proceed if certain conditions are not met, could influence the company's ability to raise the expected capital. 03/11/2024 - 11:51 PM PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: EPRT; the “Company”) announced today the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 9,000,000 shares of its common stock, all of which are being offered in connection with the forward sale agreements described below, at a public offering price of $24.75 per share. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of 8,000,000 shares of common stock, and the offering is expected to close on March 14, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

Stifel, Raymond James, Wolfe Capital Markets and Advisory, Scotiabank, BNP PARIBAS and Huntington Capital Markets are acting as co-managers of the offering.

Despite challenges from macroeconomic factors, the company remains focused on generating strong returns for shareholders. Positive Positive: Monroe Capital Corporation reported Net Investment Income of $5.3 million for Q4 2023, with Adjusted Net Investment Income at $5.6 million. The company's portfolio consists mainly of first lien loans, contributing to a weighted average contractual and effective yield of 12.1% on debt investments. Positive: Monroe Capital Corporation's current annual cash dividend yield to shareholders stands at approximately 13.4%, showcasing a commitment to rewarding investors. The company's management highlighted the 15th consecutive quarter of covering dividends with Adjusted Net Investment Income. Negative: Monroe Capital Corporation experienced a decrease in NAV by $0.18 per share, primarily due to net unrealized losses on specific legacy portfolio companies affected by macroeconomic challenges. Additionally, the company's debt-to-equity leverage decreased from 1.60 times to 1.49 times, impacting financial stability. Negative: The net loss of ($3.7) million for Q4 2023 was driven by unrealized mark-to-market losses on specific legacy portfolio companies, indicating volatility and potential risks in the investment portfolio. The increase in income taxes and expenses poses challenges in maintaining profitability. Negative: Despite a slight increase in Adjusted Net Investment Income, Monroe Capital Corporation faced challenges in interest income due to a decrease in average invested assets. The company's total expenses remained consistent, but income taxes and excise taxes increased, impacting overall financial performance. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Monroe Capital Corporation for Q4 and the full year of 2023 indicate a steady performance in terms of Net Investment Income (NII) and Adjusted Net Investment Income (ANI). The consistency in covering dividends for 15 consecutive quarters suggests a stable cash flow, which is critical for investors seeking regular income. However, the decrease in Net Asset Value (NAV) per share and the net unrealized losses on portfolio could be a concern, reflecting potential valuation adjustments in the underlying assets.The debt-to-equity leverage reduction is a positive sign of risk management, potentially making the company's balance sheet more resilient to market volatility. The current annual cash dividend yield of approximately 13.4% is significantly higher than the average market yield, which could be attractive to income-focused investors but also raises questions about the sustainability of such high payouts in the long term. Market Research Analyst The business development company (BDC) sector, where Monroe operates, is known for higher yields due to the risk profile of lending to middle-market companies. Monroe's focus on first lien loans (82.4% of the portfolio) is significant as it indicates a preference for secured lending, which could mitigate potential credit losses. The slight uptick in non-accruals from 1.2% to 1.5% is not alarming but should be monitored for trends indicating deteriorating credit quality.The weighted average yield on debt and preferred equity investments has decreased slightly, which could reflect changes in interest rates or a shift in the composition of the portfolio. Investors should consider how Monroe's performance compares to peers in the BDC industry and whether the company's strategy aligns with broader market trends. Legal Expert Monroe's use of Adjusted Net Investment Income, a non-GAAP measure, is common in the industry to provide additional insight into a company's operational performance. This measure excludes certain items like the net capital gains incentive fee and income taxes, which can fluctuate and obscure the core income-generating ability of the company. However, stakeholders should be aware that non-GAAP measures are supplementary and should be considered alongside GAAP measures. The reconciliation provided in the financial statements allows for transparency and comparability.Additionally, the partnership with Life Insurance Company of the Southwest in the Senior Loan Fund joint venture diversifies Monroe's investment strategies and could spread risk. The legal structures of such joint ventures are designed to align interests and provide additional layers of governance, which can be beneficial for risk management. 03/11/2024 - 04:25 PM CHICAGO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monroe Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: MRCC) (“Monroe”) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms “Monroe,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Company” refer to Monroe Capital Corporation. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Net Investment Income of $5.3 million, or $0.24 per shareAdjusted Net Investment Income (a non-GAAP measure described below) of $5.6 million, or $0.26 per shareNet increase in net assets resulting from operations of $1.6 million, or $0.07 per shareNet Asset Value (“NAV”) of $203.7 million, or $9.40 per sharePaid quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on December 29, 2023Current annual cash dividend yield to shareholders of approximately 13.4% (1) Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Net Investment Income of $23.2 million, or $1.07 per shareAdjusted Net Investment Income (a non-GAAP measure described below) of $24.1 million, or $1.11 per shareNet increase in net assets resulting from operations of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share Chief Executive Officer Theodore L. Koenig commented, “We are pleased to report that our Adjusted Net Investment Income covered our dividend for the 15th consecutive quarter. As we look ahead in 2024, our focus continues to be on portfolio credit quality while capitalizing on the current market dynamics in order to generate strong risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.” Monroe Capital Corporation is a business development company affiliate of the award-winning private credit investment firm and lender, Monroe Capital LLC. ______________________________________________________________________(1) Based on an annualized dividend and closing share price as of March 8, 2024. Management Commentary Adjusted Net Investment Income totaled $5.6 million or $0.26 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This compares with $5.5 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The slight increase in Adjusted Net Investment Income during the quarter is driven by a combination of factors, including a comparatively smaller reversal of previously accrued fee income and reductions in interest expense as a result of lower leverage during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of a decrease in average invested assets. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income discussion below. NAV decreased by $0.18 per share, or 1.9%, to $203.7 million or $9.40 per share as of December 31, 2023, compared to $207.6 million or $9.58 per share as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in NAV this quarter was primarily the result of net unrealized losses on the portfolio attributable to a few specific legacy portfolio companies that continued to be affected by macroeconomic and idiosyncratic challenges which impacted financial performance. During the quarter, MRCC’s debt-to-equity leverage decreased from 1.60 times debt-to-equity to 1.49 times debt-to-equity. The decrease in leverage was primarily driven by an increase in proceeds from sales and paydowns received during the quarter which were used to paydown the revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on managing our investment portfolio and selectively redeploying capital resulting from repayments.

The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. Portfolio Review The Company had debt and equity investments in 96 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $488.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to debt and equity investments in 99 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $518.3 million, as of September 30, 2023. The Company’s portfolio consists primarily of first lien loans, representing 82.4% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2023, and 82.9% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average contractual and effective yield on the Company’s debt and preferred equity investments was 12.1% and 12.1%, respectively, as compared to the weighted average contractual and effective yield of 12.4% and 12.5%, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. Portfolio yield is calculated only on the portion of the portfolio that has a contractual coupon and therefore does not account for dividends on equity investments (other than preferred equity). As of December 31, 2023, 1.5% of the Company’s total investments at fair value were on non-accrual as compared to 1.2% as of September 30, 2023. Financial Review Results of Operations: Fourth Quarter 2023 Net investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $5.3 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to $5.4 million, or $0.25 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Net Investment Income was $5.6 million, or $0.26 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.25 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $15.5 million, compared to $15.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Both quarters included an impact for the reversal of previously accrued fee income associated with the Company’s former loan investment in IT Global Holdings, LLC (“IT Global”), $0.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company has no remaining fee income accrued associated with IT Global. Excluding the impact of these fee income reversals, investment income decreased by $0.7 million, primarily as a result of the decrease in the size of the Company’s average investment portfolio during the quarter. Total expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 totaled $10.2 million, consistent with $10.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. A decline in interest and other debt financing expenses driven by a reduction in the Company’s average leverage level was offset by an increase in income taxes, including excise taxes, primarily associated with blocker entities that hold certain of the Company’s equity investments. Net gain (loss) was ($3.7) million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to ($5.7) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses of a few specific legacy portfolio companies. Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $1.6 million, or $0.07 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to ($0.2) million, or ($0.01) per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Results of Operations: Full Year 2023 Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $23.2 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to $22.2 million, or $1.02 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted Net Investment Income was $24.1 million, or $1.11 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $23.6 million, or $1.09 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $64.3 million, compared to $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in investment income compared to prior year was primarily the result of an increase interest income, partially offset by a decrease in fee income. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 included the reversal of $1.6 million of previously accrued fee income associated with the Company’s former loan investment in IT Global and the year ended December 31, 2022 included the one-time benefit of $2.0 million in previously unrecorded interest income associated with the repayment of the Company’s former loan investment in Curion Holdings, LLC (“Curion”). Excluding these two non-recurring items, investment income increased $11.3 million, primarily as a result of an increase in interest income due to the increases in effective rates on the portfolio from the rising interest rate environment. Total expenses, net of incentive fee and management fee waivers, for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $41.0 million, compared to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $6.6 million increase in expenses during the year was primarily driven by an increase in interest and other debt financing expenses, resulting from the rising interest rate environment, and an increase in incentive fees driven by stronger pre-incentive fee net investment income performance. Net gain (loss) was ($22.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to ($25.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were ($23.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This net loss was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses of a few specific legacy portfolio companies that continue to be affected by macroeconomic and idiosyncratic challenges and the Company’s investment in MRCC Senior Loan Fund I, LLC (“SLF”). The decrease in value at the SLF was driven by net losses on the SLF’s investments, which are loans to traditional upper middle-market borrowers. Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to ($2.8) million, or ($0.13) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2023, the Company had $5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $174.1 million of debt outstanding on its revolving credit facility and $130.0 million of debt outstanding on its 2026 Notes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $80.9 million available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base availability. MRCC Senior Loan Fund SLF is a joint venture with Life Insurance Company of the Southwest (“LSW”), an affiliate of National Life Insurance Company. SLF invests primarily in senior secured loans to middle market companies in the United States. The Company and LSW have each committed $50.0 million of capital to the joint venture. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had made net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $33.1 million, as compared to net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $33.3 million at September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company received dividend income from SLF of $0.9 million, consistent with the $0.9 million received during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. SLF’s underlying investments are loans to middle-market borrowers that are generally larger than the rest of MRCC’s portfolio which is focused on lower middle-market companies. SLF’s average mark on the underlying investment portfolio increased by 1.5% during the quarter, from 89.4% of amortized cost as of September 30, 2023, to 90.9% of amortized cost as of December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the realization of a debt position during the quarter. As of December 31, 2023, SLF had total assets of $148.4 million (including investments at fair value of $139.9 million), total liabilities of $82.2 million (including borrowings under the $110.0 million secured revolving credit facility with Capital One, N.A. (the “SLF Credit Facility”) of $82.0 million) and total members’ capital of $66.2 million. As of September 30, 2023, SLF had total assets of $158.7 million (including investments at fair value of $148.2 million), total liabilities of $92.1 million (including borrowings under the SLF Credit Facility of $92.1 million) and total members’ capital of $66.6 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income On a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted Net Investment Income (including on a per share basis) which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents net investment income, excluding the net capital gains incentive fee and income taxes. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The management agreement with the Company’s advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. The following tables provide a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented: For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Amount Per ShareAmount Amount Per ShareAmount (in thousands, except per share data)Net investment income$5,278 $0.24 $5,420 $0.25 Net capital gains incentive fee — — — — Income taxes, including excise taxes 311 0.02 95 0.00 Adjusted Net Investment Income$5,589 $0.26 $5,515 $0.25 For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Amount Per ShareAmount Amount Per ShareAmount (in thousands, except per share data)Net investment income$23,249 $1.07 $22,192 $1.02 Net capital gains incentive fee — — — — Income taxes, including excise taxes 806 0.04 1,405 0.07 Adjusted Net Investment Income$24,055 $1.11 $23,597 $1.09 Adjusted Net Investment Income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted Net Investment Income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

The rise in gross margins, particularly in the Air Pollution Control (APC) segment, indicates improved efficiency or a favorable project mix. However, the overall net loss and increased SG&A expenses suggest that the company's cost control measures may not be fully compensating for the revenue decline in the FUEL CHEM segment.Investors should note the strategic significance of the company's strong financial position with substantial cash reserves and no long-term debt. This could potentially provide resilience against market volatility and enable strategic investments or R&D initiatives. The APC backlog increase suggests a healthy pipeline, but the expected delay in new award activity until the second half of 2024 could indicate a period of revenue stagnation or uncertainty in the near term. Energy Sector Financial Analyst The reported increase in interest income for Fuel Tech is indicative of a broader economic context where higher interest rates are impacting corporate earnings. This could be both a risk and an opportunity, depending on the company's ability to manage cash effectively and leverage investment opportunities.The decline in the FUEL CHEM segment revenue, attributed to warmer weather and thus reduced demand for electrical generation, underscores the susceptibility of certain business segments to external environmental factors. However, the stable gross margin in this segment suggests that Fuel Tech is maintaining operational efficiency despite revenue fluctuations.From an investment perspective, the unchanged Adjusted EBITDA loss year-over-year might raise concerns about the company's ability to turn operational improvements into bottom-line results. The modest increase in APC revenue forecasted for 2024 needs to be balanced against the company's overall performance and the potential for increased SG&A expenses to erode profitability. Environmental Technology Analyst The successful trial of Fuel Tech's Dissolved Gas Infusion (DGI) technology in an aquaculture setting and the subsequent increase in inquiries suggest a growing market interest in sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies. The focus on DGI technology could represent a strategic pivot towards emerging markets with significant growth potential, such as aquaculture and water treatment.The APC segment's strong performance and the emphasis on emissions control solutions reflect the ongoing demand for environmental technologies driven by regulatory pressures and corporate sustainability goals. The increased backlog and gross margin in this segment suggest that Fuel Tech is well-positioned to capitalize on these market trends.However, the company's ability to secure its first commercial contract for DGI in 2024 will be critical to validate the technology's market viability and could serve as a catalyst for future revenue streams. Stakeholders should monitor the progress of negotiations and on-site demonstrations as indicators of the company's potential to grow this segment. 03/11/2024 - 04:20 PM WARRENVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fuel Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: FTEK), a technology company providing advanced engineering for the optimization of combustion systems, emissions control, and water treatment in utility and industrial applications, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter (Q4) and full year ended December 31, 2023. “We reported higher total revenues compared to full year 2022, completed a successful trial of our Dissolved Gas Infusion (DGITM) technology in an aquaculture setting, maintained tight expense control, and ended the year in a strong financial position, with $33.4 million in cash and investments, and no long-term debt,” said Vincent J. Arnone, President and CEO. “Our Air Pollution Control (APC) business performed well in the 2023 fourth quarter and full year, driven by approximately $8.3 million of new project awards announced during the year, with an emphasis on our ULTRA, SCR, SNCR and FGC emissions control solutions both domestically and abroad. Our APC backlog at December 31, 2023 was $7.5 million, up from $5.6 million at September 30, 2023. Although we do expect that APC revenue will increase modestly in 2024 when compared to 2023, it is likely that the bulk of our new award activity will occur in the second half of the year. As expected, revenues at our FUEL CHEM® segment declined year-over-year for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023, with warmer weather across the US impacting unit dispatch; however, segment gross margin was essentially unchanged and at historic levels. Our base FUEL CHEM unit count remains intact as we enter 2024 and we are currently pursuing additional FUEL CHEM opportunities which could provide incremental revenue contribution in 2024.” Mr. Arnone concluded, “We are very pleased with the trajectory of our DGI business segment. In February we announced the publication of a white paper that detailed the benefits of deploying DGI for oxygen injection at a shrimp farm in the US and we presented these results at Aquaculture America in San Antonio, Texas. We have received a notable increase in inquiries regarding our DGI technology from potential customers in multiple end markets and are currently in negotiations with potential customers regarding on-site demonstrations of DGI. We are targeting to enter into our first commercial contract for DGI in 2024.” Q4 2023 Consolidated Results Overview Consolidated revenues for Q4 2023 declined to $6.3 million from $7.0 million in Q4 2022, with modest declines in both business segments from the prior year. Consolidated gross margin for Q4 2023 rose to 51.1% of revenues from 42.8% of revenues in Q4 2022, due to a significant increase in APC gross margin during the quarter driven by the mix of APC projects and services executed during the quarter. SG&A expenses increased to $3.7 million from $3.1 million in Q4 2022, reflecting the timing of employee and employee-related expenses. Interest income improved to $0.3 million from $0.1 million in Q4 2022, reflecting an increase in capital invested and higher interest rates on held-to-maturity debt securities and money market funds. Net loss in Q4 2023 was $(539,000), or $(0.02) per share, compared to net loss of $(402,000), or $(0.01) per share, in Q4 2022. Consolidated APC segment backlog at December 31, 2023 was $7.5 million compared to $5.6 million at September 30, 2023 and $8.2 million at December 31, 2022. APC segment revenue decreased to $2.8 million from $2.9 million in Q4 2022. APC gross margin rose to 55.6% from 35.4%, due primarily to the mix of APC projects and services executed during the quarter. FUEL CHEM segment revenue declined to $3.6 million from $4.1 million in Q4 2022, due to a decline in electrical generation demand for the units on which our FUEL CHEM program is installed. Gross margin was unchanged at 48.0%. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(0.6) million in Q4 2023 compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(0.3) million in Q4 2022. 2023 Full Year Overview Consolidated revenues for 2023 rose 1.0% to $27.1 million from $26.9 million in 2022, reflecting the increase in APC revenue partially offset by a decline in FUEL CHEM revenue. Consolidated gross margin for full year 2023 was unchanged at 43% compared to 2022, reflecting an increase in APC gross margin and a stable FUEL CHEM gross margin. SG&A expenses for 2023 increased to $12.8 million, or 47.3% of revenues, from $12.3 million, or 45.6% of revenues, in 2022, reflecting an increase in employee related costs and other expenses. Interest income improved to $1.3 million from $0.2 million in 2022, reflecting an increase in capital invested and higher interest rates on held-to-maturity debt securities and money market funds. Net loss for 2023 was $(1.5) million, or $(0.05) per share, compared to net loss of $(1.4) million, or $(0.05) per share, in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(2.0) million in 2023 compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(0.9) million in 2022. Financial Condition At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $17.6 million, short-term investments were $12.1 million, and long-term investments totaled $3.7 million. Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2023 was $43.7 million, or $1.44 per share, and the Company had no debt.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock compensation expense, and intangible assets abandonment and building impairment. The Company's reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and ability to generate cash flow, which we believe is a meaningful measure for our investor and analyst communities. In many cases non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by these individuals to evaluate Company performance and ultimately determine a reasonable valuation for our common stock. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure of net income (loss) has been included in the above financial table.

The Company reaffirms its annual outlook for fiscal 2024. Positive Solid third-quarter performance with a 13% decrease in diluted EPS compared to the previous year. Net income and EBITDA down by 13% and 2%, respectively. Inside same-store sales increased by 4.1% with inside gross profit up by 11.3%. Total fuel gross profit decreased by 2.0%. Company reaffirms its fiscal 2024 outlook with expectations for same-store inside sales to increase by 3.5% to 5% and EBITDA growth in-line with strategic plans. The Company expects to add at least 150 stores in fiscal 2024. Negative Diluted EPS, net income, and EBITDA decreased compared to the same period last year. Total fuel gross profit decreased by 2.0%. Operating expenses increased by approximately 10% during the third quarter. Same-store operating expenses excluding credit card fees were up by 2.5%. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in Casey's General Stores diluted EPS and net income signifies a potential concern for investors, as earnings are a primary driver of stock valuation. The 13% decline in diluted EPS, coupled with a similar reduction in net income, could indicate pressure on the company's profitability. While the EBITDA decrease is less pronounced, it still suggests a contraction in operating performance. However, the one-time operating expense reduction in the previous year should be considered when interpreting these figures, as it inflates the comparative base. From a liquidity standpoint, the company appears to be in a strong position with approximately $1.1 billion available, which provides flexibility for future investments or to weather economic downturns. The share repurchase activity, with $30 million bought back in the quarter and a substantial amount remaining under authorization, reflects a management strategy focused on returning value to shareholders and potentially supporting the stock price. Market Research Analyst Casey's performance in the prepared food and dispensed beverage category, with a notable 7.5% increase in same-store sales, is a highlight. This suggests effective product offerings and marketing strategies in high-margin categories. The inside margin improvement by 70 basis points is also significant, as it implies effective cost management and pricing strategies, which are critical for maintaining profitability in the competitive convenience store sector. However, the 0.4% decline in same-store fuel gallons sold indicates potential challenges in the fuel segment, which may be due to broader market conditions or competitive pressures. The increase in total fuel gallons sold is likely due to the addition of new stores rather than organic growth, which could be a concern for long-term sustainability if same-store sales do not improve. Economist Casey's expansion strategy, with the addition of 167 stores, reflects a bullish approach to growth and market share acquisition. This, however, comes with increased operating expenses, which were up approximately 10% for the quarter. The company's ability to integrate these new stores efficiently while managing expenses will be critical to maintaining profitability. The reaffirmation of the annual outlook suggests management confidence in their strategy and operational targets. The company's fuel margin performance, despite being lower than the previous year, remains relatively robust in a rising cost environment. This demonstrates effective cost management and pricing strategies within the fuel segment, which is often subject to volatile market conditions. The sale of renewable fuel credits (RINs) also contributes additional revenue, highlighting the importance of alternative revenue streams in this sector. 03/11/2024 - 04:20 PM ANKENY, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (""Casey's"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: CASY) one of the leading convenience store chains in the United States, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024. Third Quarter Key Highlights Diluted EPS of $2.33, down 13% from the same period a year ago. Net income was $87 million, down 13%, and EBITDA1 was $218 million, down 2%, from the same period a year ago. In the prior year, net income, EBITDA and diluted EPS benefited from a one-time operating expense reduction of approximately $15 million, or $0.31 a share, from the resolution of a legal matter. Inside same-store sales increased 4.1% compared to prior year, and 9.9% on a two-year stack basis, with an inside margin of 41.3%. Total inside gross profit increased 11.3% to $501.5 million compared to the prior year. Same-store fuel gallons were down 0.4% compared to prior year with a fuel margin of 37.3 cents per gallon. Total fuel gross profit decreased 2.0% to $257.2 million compared to the prior year. Same-store operating expenses excluding credit card fees were up 2.5%, favorably impacted by a 1% reduction in same-store labor hours. ""Casey's delivered another solid quarter highlighted by inside gross profit growth,” said Darren Rebelez, Chairman, President and CEO. “Inside same-store sales were driven by prepared food and dispensed beverage, with whole pies and hot sandwiches performing exceptionally well. Our fuel team navigated a rising cost environment and delivered nearly flat gallon volume and a 37.3 cents per gallon fuel margin. The operations team performed exceptionally well this quarter integrating multiple acquisitions, reducing same-store labor hours while growing sales and driving positive guest satisfaction scores.""

This was partially offset by higher profitability inside the store. __________________________ 1 EBITDA is reconciled to net income below.

Operating 167 more stores than prior year accounted for approximately 6% of the increase. Total same-store employee expense contributed to approximately 1% of the increase, as the increases in labor rates were partially offset by a reduction in same-store labor hours. _____________________________ 2 Fuel category does not include wholesale fuel activity, which is included in Other.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by excluding the gain or loss on disposal of assets as well as impairment charges. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA are considered GAAP measures, and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities or other income or cash flow statement data. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities, and they are regularly used by the Company for internal purposes including our capital budgeting process, evaluating acquisition targets, assessing performance, and awarding incentive compensation. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. It therefore may not be possible to compare our use of these non-GAAP financial measures with those used by other companies. The following table contains a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023: (in thousands) Three Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income $ 86,933 $ 100,112 $ 414,952 $ 390,599 Interest, net 14,146 11,697 38,947 39,015 Federal and state income taxes 27,586 31,830 129,020 124,327 Depreciation and amortization 88,950 78,088 257,453 232,500 EBITDA 217,615 221,727 840,372 786,441 Loss on disposal of assets and impairment charges 1,124 1,186 892 5,977 Adjusted EBITDA $ 218,739 $ 222,913 $ 841,264 $ 792,418 NOTES: Gross Profit is defined as revenue less cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) Inside is defined as the combination of grocery and general merchandise and prepared food and dispensed beverage This release contains statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including those related to expectations for future periods, possible or assumed future results of operations, financial conditions, liquidity and related sources or needs, business and/or integration strategies, plans and synergies, supply chain, growth opportunities, performance at our stores.

The company expects an average daily production between 89.0 and 95.0 MBoe/d for the full year 2024, up from the previous guidance of 87.0 to 93.0 MBoe/d. The updated guidance accounts for the QuarterNorth acquisition and includes expenses related to maintenance and workover projects. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Financial Analyst The early closure of Talos Energy's acquisition of QuarterNorth Energy Inc. indicates a strategic expansion that is expected to enhance Talos's production capabilities. The upward revision of the average daily production forecast for 2024 to 89.0-95.0 MBoe/d reflects the projected positive impact of this acquisition on Talos's operational scale. Investors should note the increased production volume, as it typically correlates with higher revenue potential, assuming oil and natural gas prices remain favorable.However, the financial guidance also reveals a significant investment in capital expenditures, particularly in upstream activities and plug and abandonment (P&A) operations. The forecasted range of $570-600 million for upstream capital expenditures and $90-100 million for P&A suggests a focus on both development and decommissioning obligations. The balance between growth and compliance with environmental regulations could be a point of interest for stakeholders concerned with sustainable practices in the energy sector. Oil & Gas Market Research Analyst The inclusion of approximately ten months of QuarterNorth's contributions in Talos's financial guidance is a testament to the company's confidence in the acquired assets. This confidence may be grounded in the quality of QuarterNorth's reserves or operational efficiencies that Talos anticipates post-acquisition. Additionally, the guidance accounts for $15 million in expenses related to the HP-I drydock and maintenance, which is crucial for maintaining production efficiency and safety standards.Market trends in the oil and gas sector, such as fluctuations in commodity prices and geopolitical events, could impact the actual performance against this guidance. Therefore, while the increased production estimates are positive, the actual benefit to Talos's bottom line will depend on how these external factors play out over the year. Oil & Gas Operations Analyst The operational details provided in the guidance, such as the expected planned downtime and the potential risks associated with unplanned downtime and weather-related events, offer insights into Talos's risk management strategies. The acknowledgment of these factors is indicative of a realistic and comprehensive approach to operational planning. Workover projects aimed at increasing or reinstating production are also highlighted, which could improve the recovery rates of existing wells and extend their productive life, thus optimizing the company's asset utilization.For industry stakeholders, the efficiency of these workover operations and the management of downtime are critical factors that could influence Talos's ability to meet its production targets and control cash operating expenses within the projected range of $510-530 million. 03/11/2024 - 04:24 PM HOUSTON, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Talos Energy Inc. (""Talos"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: TALO) today provided updated 2024 operational and financial guidance to reflect the closing of the QuarterNorth Energy Inc. (""QuarterNorth"") acquisition earlier than expected. Prior guidance was based on an end-of-first-quarter 2024 close.

This updated guidance includes approximately ten months of QuarterNorth contributions, as well as expected planned downtime and risking for unplanned downtime and weather-related events. Full year 2024 Cash Expenses guidance includes approximately ten months of QuarterNorth and a full twelve-month impact of the EnVen transaction, compared to only approximately ten and a half months incurred in 2023. Talos expects approximately $15 million in expenses related to the Helix Producer I (""HP-I"") drydock and other associated maintenance. This guidance also includes multiple deepwater workover projects expected to increase and/or reinstate production. For the first quarter 2024, Talos expects average daily production between 78.0 and 80.0 MBoe/d, an increase from the previous guidance of between 70.0 and 72.0 MBoe/d. First quarter guidance includes March impacts of approximately one month of contribution from QuarterNorth, partial impact of the planned HP-I dry-dock shut-in and planned downtime at the Tarantula facility, impacting production from the Katmai field.

Environmental Engineer An Environmental Engineer would examine the implications of Fuel Tech's recent contracts from a regulatory compliance and environmental impact perspective. The adoption of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technologies reflects a growing industry trend towards meeting stricter nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions standards. SCR is a more effective but also more complex and costly technology compared to SNCR, which is generally used in smaller or less demanding applications.The EPA's Good Neighbor Rule is driving the demand for these technologies as it mandates states to address cross-state air pollution that affects downwind states' ability to meet air quality standards. As a result, utility and industrial combustion unit owners are compelled to upgrade their NOx reduction systems, which could reduce overall NOx emissions during the summer ozone season when ozone levels are at their peak.However, the implementation of these technologies comes with challenges such as the safe handling and storage of reagents like anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia and the potential need for ongoing maintenance and catalyst replacement. The environmental benefits must be carefully weighed against these operational considerations. Market Analyst A Market Analyst specializing in industrial and utility markets would focus on the financial and strategic aspects of Fuel Tech's new contracts. The aggregate value of $2.1 million, while not substantial in terms of large-cap companies, could be significant for a smaller firm like Fuel Tech, signaling potential growth and stability in its niche market. The contracts span multiple geographical regions, indicating a diversified customer base and resilience to regional economic fluctuations.In the context of the broader market, companies that provide technologies enabling compliance with environmental regulations are likely to see increased demand, especially in light of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Investors might view these contracts as indicative of Fuel Tech's competitive positioning and potential for future growth, particularly as the company secures orders from both new and existing customers.However, investors should also consider the timing of the revenue recognition from these contracts, given that equipment deliveries are scheduled for as late as 2025. This delay in revenue could affect short-term financial performance but may provide long-term stability and growth prospects. Energy Sector Analyst An Energy Sector Analyst would analyze the impact of these contracts on the energy industry's efforts to reduce emissions. The transition towards cleaner energy sources and the reduction of pollutants like NOx is a critical aspect of the industry's response to climate change. Fuel Tech's contracts for NOx reduction technologies are in line with the global push for more sustainable energy practices.It is also worth noting the role of such technologies in extending the operational life of existing fossil fuel-based plants by ensuring they comply with new regulations. This can be seen as a double-edged sword; while it helps utilities to avoid the immediate cost of plant retirement or conversion to cleaner fuels, it may also delay the transition to renewable energy sources.The long-term implications for the energy sector include a potential increase in operational costs associated with the adoption of advanced emission control technologies, but also an opportunity for companies like Fuel Tech to innovate and provide cost-effective solutions in a market that is increasingly driven by environmental considerations. 03/11/2024 - 04:25 PM WARRENVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fuel Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: FTEK), a technology company providing advanced engineering for the optimization of combustion systems, emissions control and water treatment in utility and industrial applications, today announced the receipt of air pollution control (APC) and Chemical Technologies orders from new and existing customers in Europe, the US and the Caribbean. These awards have an aggregate value of approximately $2.1 million. Two orders were received from new customers in Europe for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology, which uses a catalyst along with urea or ammonia as the reagent to provide high levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction. The first order is for a natural gas and process gas fired heater used at a chemical processing plant. The SCR system includes the catalyst and reactor and will utilize anhydrous ammonia which is already on-site. Equipment delivery is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The second order is for a natural gas fired boiler at a municipal solid waste facility. The SCR system includes the catalyst and reactor and an aqueous ammonia reagent delivery system. The scope also includes a catalyst to reduce carbon monoxide emissions from the customer process. Equipment deliveries are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. A contract was also received from an existing customer in the Caribbean for FUEL CHEM® equipment using our proprietary TIFI® Targeted In-Furnace Injection technology. The existing customer is restarting operations on a fourth heavy oil-fired unit at its metals processing facility where our FUEL CHEM program uses boiler fireside additives to help reduce boiler slagging and corrosion. The chemical injection equipment is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024. The final contract was received from an existing US customer for upgrades to an existing Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system for a coal-fired utility unit in the Midwest. Fuel Tech’s SNCR technology is a proven solution for utility and industrial combustion unit owners looking to comply with more stringent NOx control requirements. The SNCR upgrades are being driven by EPA’s Good Neighbor Rule, which requires combustion units with existing NOx reduction equipment to operate at improved efficiency throughout the summer ozone season. Deliveries are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024. Vincent J. Arnone, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased to announce these contract awards which represent continued growth using our wide range of product solutions on a global basis. Our long-time customer in the Caribbean continues to rely on our expertise to support their on-going operations. NOx reduction requirements generated by the EPA Good Neighbor Rule could create a number of opportunities for both SNCR and SCR technology over the next several years.

(CNS) reported a rise in assets under management to $79.6 billion as of February 29, 2024, driven by market appreciation despite net outflows and distributions. Institutional accounts and open-end funds contributed significantly to the increase. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported preliminary assets under management (AUM) by Cohen & Steers, Inc. reflects a marginal increase, which is a result of market dynamics and investor behavior. The net increase in AUM is a critical metric for evaluating the company's growth trajectory and potential revenue from management fees. Notably, the market appreciation contributed positively, indicating a favorable investment environment or effective asset management strategies. However, the net outflows suggest a challenge in retaining or attracting capital, which could be a concern for investors looking at long-term stability.Understanding the composition of the AUM is also essential. Institutional accounts, which often represent more stable, long-term investments, have experienced a net decrease due to outflows. This might suggest a shift in institutional investor confidence or a change in strategic asset allocations. On the other hand, open-end funds saw an increase, potentially indicating retail investor confidence and a preference for liquidity. Closed-end funds remained relatively stable. These shifts can inform investors about the changing landscape of investment preferences and risk appetites. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the slight increase in AUM for Cohen & Steers is a mixed signal. On one hand, market appreciation indicates that the firm's asset management strategies might be performing well in the current market conditions. On the other hand, the net outflows could potentially impact future revenue streams, as management fees are typically a percentage of AUM. The fact that distributions also played a role in the decrease of AUM is noteworthy, as it suggests that part of the investment returns are being paid out, which could be attractive to income-focused investors.Analyzing the AUM distribution across different types of investment vehicles can provide insights into the company's business model resilience. The stability in closed-end funds suggests a locked-in capital which might provide a more predictable revenue stream compared to the more volatile open-end funds. For investors, the balance between different types of funds and accounts can indicate the firm’s ability to weather market fluctuations and maintain a steady income. Economist Examining the AUM from an economic standpoint, the changes in AUM due to market appreciation reflect broader economic trends and the performance of the financial markets. The $1.2 billion market appreciation suggests that the underlying assets managed by Cohen & Steers are potentially well-positioned to capitalize on current market trends or have benefited from overall market growth. However, the net outflows of $683 million could be indicative of broader economic concerns, such as shifts in risk tolerance among investors, or sector-specific issues that might be prompting investors to reallocate their assets.Additionally, the AUM dynamics can be influenced by macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation and global economic events. The company's ability to navigate these factors and the subsequent impact on AUM is critical for long-term growth. It is important for stakeholders to consider how responsive the company is to economic changes and what strategies they have in place to mitigate potential negative impacts on their AUM. 03/11/2024 - 04:19 PM NEW YORK, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cohen & Steers, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The update from OptimizeRx Corp. regarding the anticipated timeline for its financial reporting and the reaffirmation of its prior revenue and adjusted EBITDA estimates for FY2023 is a significant piece of information for current and potential investors. The company's ability to meet the filing deadline for non-accelerated, smaller reporting companies, despite the complexities introduced by the acquisition of Healthy Offers, Inc. and the operational realignment, indicates a level of operational efficiency and commitment to regulatory compliance. The unchanged adjusted EBITDA guidance, despite the shift from gross to net revenue recognition for certain streams, suggests that the company's profitability metrics may remain stable, which is a positive sign for investors looking at the company's earning potential.However, the gross-to-net accounting treatment change for revenue streams could lead to a reevaluation of the company's revenue projections and possibly affect the stock's valuation. Investors will need to consider how this accounting change aligns with industry norms and whether it reflects a change in business strategy or market conditions. The preliminary FY2023 revenue exceeding the previously announced range is promising, but as these figures are unaudited, caution is advised until the final audited results are available. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the operational realignment mentioned by OptimizeRx Corp. to focus on core business lines could indicate a strategic pivot that aims to optimize resource allocation and drive growth in the most profitable segments. This realignment, coupled with the acquisition of Medicx Health, suggests an expansion of the company's capabilities in engaging healthcare professionals and patients, which could enhance its competitive position in the healthcare technology solutions market.The announcement also serves as a reminder to the market about the importance of internal controls and processes. The reference to the remediation of a previously disclosed material weakness highlights the company's efforts to strengthen its internal systems, which could improve investor confidence in the company's governance and long-term stability. Legal Expert The disclosure of the ongoing audit and the potential for adjustments to preliminary estimates emphasizes the importance of transparency in financial reporting. OptimizeRx's commitment to open communication with stakeholders, as they navigate the complexities of incorporating Medicx Health's financials and addressing internal control weaknesses, is crucial from a legal and regulatory standpoint.For stakeholders, the adherence to SEC filing deadlines and the proactive approach to remediate internal control issues are reassuring signs of the company's dedication to compliance and governance. The legal implications of such disclosures are significant as they mitigate the risk of future litigation by keeping the investors informed about the potential for changes to the financial results. 03/11/2024 - 04:30 PM WALTHAM, Mass., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OptimizeRx Corp. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPRX), the leading provider of healthcare technology solutions helping life sciences companies reach and engage healthcare professional (HCPs) and patients, today provided an update on the anticipated timeline for its financial reporting and reaffirms prior revenue and adjusted EBITDA estimates for FY2023. The Company is working to complete its year end close and audit processes by the filing deadline for non-accelerated, smaller reporting companies. As part of that work, the Company is finalizing its financial results and year end audit that includes its October 2023 acquisition of Healthy Offers, Inc. (dba Medicx Health), the November 2023 operational realignment to focus on core business lines, and performing further remediation of the previously disclosed material weakness related to the testing and validation of internal processes tied to certain third-party vendors more fully described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company plans to hold a conference call on Thursday, March 28, 2024 to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full-year periods ended December 31, 2023. During the audit of Medicx Health, it was determined that certain revenue streams for messages executed through Medicx Health’s channel partners, historically recognized on a gross basis, will now be recognized on a net basis.

(NYSE: GIL) (TSX: GIL) (“Gildan” or the “Company”) and beneficially owns approximately 5.0% of the Company’s outstanding shares, has filed a lawsuit today with the Superior Court of Quebec – Commercial Division (the “Quebec Superior Court”) against Gildan and the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) in order to ensure the rights of shareholders are preserved in connection with the May 28th, 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). Usman S. Nabi and Peter M. Lee of Browning West commented: “Rather than assume accountability for its value-destructive decisions, we believe that the Board continues to take oppressive actions against shareholders, demonstrating that its priority is self-preservation. We are concerned that the Board will seek to delay the Annual Meeting that has been set for May 28th. This is why we have filed an application with the Quebec Superior Court to ensure that the Annual Meeting proceeds on the scheduled date without delay or interference and that the rights of all shareholders are protected with respect to the vote. In addition to requesting that the Quebec Superior Court compel Gildan to hold the Annual Meeting as scheduled without employing any delay tactics or gamesmanship, we want to ensure all shareholders have their votes counted and that the Annual Meeting be conducted fairly and legally. As such, we are asking that an independent chair be appointed to oversee the Annual Meeting. While we expect Gildan to oppose Browning West’s application, we will not be deterred and will continue to do whatever is necessary to ensure that all shareholders have an opportunity to replace the directors whose decisions have destroyed shareholder value and who have failed to give due regard to the views of investors.” The lawsuit asserts that Gildan and its Board have acted in a manner that unfairly disregards the rights and interests of shareholders by pursuing a strategy of entrenchment, obfuscation and disparagement of dissenting shareholders, improperly placing their own personal interests ahead of the interests of the Company and its shareholders, contrary to the reasonable expectations of Browning West, including by: Leaking corporate documents and confidential information to journalists and sharing this information with a third-party “governance expert” hired by the Board, while refusing to share those same documents and information with shareholders; Improperly soliciting proxies prior to filing a management information circular; Pursuing a meritless litigation with the primary purpose of undermining and delaying Browning West and Gildan shareholders from exercising their rights; Launching unwarranted public attacks on Browning West and imposing costs associated with defending meritless litigation in a clear attempt to deter and silence shareholders from raising their concerns publicly; Signing a “support agreement,” which was not in the best interest of the Company and includes Board representation rights for a shareholder who has a conflict of interest due to a significant ownership stake in one of Gildan’s largest customers; Attempting to justify its decision to terminate Gildan founder Glenn Chamandy and name Vincent Tyra as Chief Executive Officer with a misleading and evolving set of explanations that directly contradict signed statements in Gildan’s prior annual reports; and Making groundless attacks on Browning West, including false accusations of acting jointly or in concert with other shareholders, and collaborating improperly with Mr. Chamandy while he was Chief Executive Officer of Gildan. All Gildan stakeholders, including its employees and shareholders, require certainty as to the future direction of the Company, which can only be determined by the Board after the Annual Meeting has been held. The primary objective of this application is to ensure that the Board holds the 2024 Annual Meeting on May 28th without delay and involves an independent third party running the Annual Meeting to ensure a fair and transparent process. In furtherance of this objective, Browning West has decided that now is the time to take active steps to communicate directly with as many Gildan shareholders as possible and to solicit their support in order to ensure that real and substantive change will come to Gildan. Accordingly, Browning West has filed and commenced the mailing of an information circular.

Reports February 2024 Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. (NYSE: APAM) reported preliminary assets under management of $156.0 billion as of February 29, 2024. The firm's AUM breakdown includes Artisan Funds, Artisan Global Funds, separate accounts, and other AUM by various investment strategies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. regarding their preliminary assets under management (AUM) of $156.0 billion as of February 29, 2024, is a critical financial indicator for investors and market analysts. AUM is a vital metric, as it reflects the scale of a firm's operations and its ability to generate fee revenue. The detailed breakdown across various strategies provides insights into the firm's diversification and areas of growth. For instance, the International Value strategy commands the largest proportion of AUM, suggesting robust investor interest or performance in international markets. On the other hand, the relatively smaller AUM in strategies like Global Equity and Sustainable Emerging Markets may indicate niche or developing areas that could be poised for growth or require strategic attention.From an investment perspective, shifts in AUM can signal changes in investor sentiment and potentially impact the firm's revenue, given that management fees are often a function of AUM. Therefore, monitoring these trends can inform decisions regarding the attractiveness of Artisan Partners' stock. Additionally, the distribution between Artisan Funds, Artisan Global Funds and separate accounts can be indicative of the firm's client base and the stability of its assets, with separate accounts often representing institutional investors, who may provide more stable inflows and outflows compared to retail investors. Market Research Analyst An analysis of Artisan Partners' AUM distribution across various investment strategies reveals market preferences and potential shifts in the asset management landscape. For example, the prominence of the International Value strategy could reflect a broader market trend of seeking value opportunities outside the U.S., possibly due to perceived market saturation or higher growth potential in international markets. Furthermore, the presence of specialized strategies such as China Post-Venture and Sustainable Emerging Markets suggests that Artisan Partners is attempting to capitalize on specific market segments that may appeal to investors with particular interests in regional growth or sustainability.Understanding the competitive positioning of Artisan Partners within the asset management industry requires comparing these AUM figures to industry peers. If Artisan's AUM growth outpaces its competitors, this could imply effective strategy performance or superior client acquisition and retention. Conversely, if growth is lagging, it may signal challenges or underperformance relative to peers. Such insights are valuable for stakeholders to assess the company's market share dynamics and strategic direction. Economist The data on Artisan Partners' AUM across different strategies can be contextualized within the broader economic environment. For instance, the AUM in the Credit Team's High Income and Credit Opportunities strategies may be influenced by the prevailing interest rate environment and investors' search for yield. In periods of low-interest rates, higher-yielding credit strategies can attract significant capital inflows. Conversely, a rising rate environment might lead to outflows as investors reassess credit risks and return expectations.Additionally, the Developing World Team's AUM reflects investor appetite for emerging market exposure, which is often correlated with global economic growth projections and risk appetite. A substantial allocation to these strategies might indicate investor confidence in the growth prospects of developing economies or a strategic diversification away from mature markets. These macroeconomic factors, along with geopolitical events, can have material implications for the inflows and outflows of funds, thereby affecting the stability and growth of Artisan Partners' AUM over time. 03/11/2024 - 04:16 PM MILWAUKEE, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc.

(FSCO) Declares Increased Distribution for March 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FS Credit Opportunities Corp. (FSCO) increases monthly distribution by 5.3% for March 2024, reflecting strong performance and positive outlook. The annualized distribution yield stands at 10.3% on NAV and 12.5% on market price. The Fund has generated a total return of 2.64% on NAV and 3.43% on market price year-to-date through February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by FS Credit Opportunities Corp. of an increased monthly distribution is a significant indicator of the fund's current financial health and future outlook. A 5.3% increase in distributions suggests that the fund's earnings are robust and management is confident in its ability to generate income for shareholders. This is further supported by the claim of fully covering the distribution with net investment income throughout 2024.From an investment perspective, the increase in distribution, which totals approximately 41% since the fund's listing, could potentially attract income-focused investors, particularly in a market environment where yield is highly sought after. The reported annualized distribution yields of 10.3% on NAV and 12.5% on market price are substantial, especially when compared to current fixed income and dividend yields. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with higher-yielding investments, which often correlate with higher credit risk. Market Research Analyst FS Credit Opportunities Corp.'s strategy of investing in event-driven credit and non-traditional credit opportunities may appeal to investors looking for diversification away from traditional fixed income assets. With $2.1 billion in assets under management, the fund is of a significant size, potentially offering liquidity and stability advantages. The fund's performance, with an estimated total return of 2.64% on NAV and 3.43% on market price year-to-date, indicates that it has been navigating the market effectively.However, the specialized nature of the fund’s investments requires investors to have a thorough understanding of event-driven strategies and the specific risks involved, such as market volatility and the complexities of private capital solutions. The fund's performance relative to its peers and benchmarks would be an additional vital metric for investors to consider. Economist The increase in monthly distributions by FS Credit Opportunities Corp. could be viewed within the broader context of the economic environment. In a scenario where interest rates are rising, the attractive yield offered by the fund may be a reflection of the current rate environment and the search for yield among investors. Moreover, the fund’s focus on private markets and special situations could be an attempt to capitalize on inefficiencies and opportunities that arise during economic shifts.It is important for stakeholders to consider economic indicators and forecasts when evaluating the sustainability of these distributions. Should economic conditions deteriorate, the fund’s ability to maintain these distributions could be impacted. Conversely, a stable or improving economic landscape could support the fund's strategy and result in continued or increased distributions. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM PHILADELPHIA, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of FS Credit Opportunities Corp. (the Fund) (NYSE: FSCO) announced today an increase to the monthly distribution for March 2024. The March distribution will be paid on March 28, 2024 at $0.06 per share, representing an increase of approximately 5.3% over the February distribution. Further information on the distribution is summarized in the charts below. ""Based on FS Credit Opportunities Corp.'s continued strong performance, we are pleased to announce an approximately 5.3% increase to the monthly distribution,"" said Andrew Beckman, Head of FS Investments' Global Credit business and Portfolio Manager for FSCO.

The dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly dividend on preferred stock by the Public Service Company of New Mexico indicates a stable financial position and a commitment to providing returns to shareholders. The dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock's price, is a critical metric for income-focused investors. In this case, the $1.145 per share dividend on the 4.58 percent series suggests a reliable income stream, particularly attractive in a low-interest-rate environment.Investors should note the impact of such dividends on the company's cash flow and whether the payout is sustainable given PNM Resources' earnings and payout ratio. Additionally, the fixed nature of preferred dividends offers a cushion against market volatility, making the stock potentially more appealing to risk-averse investors. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost, as investing in preferred shares might yield lower capital gains compared to common shares or other investment vehicles. Energy Market Analyst PNM Resources' strategic goal to achieve 100% emissions-free generation by 2040 is significant within the energy sector, reflecting the broader industry trend towards sustainable energy practices. This transition could potentially lead to long-term cost savings and operational efficiencies, as well as aligning with increasing regulatory pressures and consumer demand for clean energy.From a market perspective, PNM's investment in a diverse mix of generation and purchased power resources, totaling 3.1 gigawatts of capacity, positions the company to manage the variability in energy demand and supply. Investors should monitor the company's progress towards its emissions-free goal and assess the associated capital expenditures, regulatory risks and potential impact on profitability. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Public Service Company of New Mexico, a subsidiary of PNM Resources (NYSE: PNM), declared the regular quarterly dividend of $1.145 per share on the 4.58 percent series of cumulative preferred stock.

Positive Strong fourth-quarter 2023 revenue of $77.1 million with a net loss of $19.9 million. AEBITDA of $14.7 million, showing a 390bps increase in margins from the previous year. Full-year 2023 revenue reached $310.9 million, with a net loss of $19.4 million. Consolidated AEBITDA for the year was $62.3 million, representing a significant increase. CEO Andrew Pascal emphasized strong financial performance and strategic initiatives for growth in 2024 and beyond. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue decline and increase in net loss for PLAYSTUDIOS in the fourth quarter of 2023, alongside the year-over-year growth in Consolidated AEBITDA, present a mixed financial picture for the company. The discrepancy between revenue and AEBITDA performance suggests that while top-line growth has stalled, the company has improved operational efficiency or cost control. However, the sharp increase in net loss may raise concerns about the company's profitability and scalability, potentially affecting investor sentiment.Furthermore, the commitment to reaching parity with peers' margins indicates aggressive targets for operational improvements. The expansion of AEBITDA margins is a positive sign, reflecting better cost management or higher-quality revenue. However, achieving a 30% margin in line with industry peers will require significant efforts in optimizing operations and increasing revenue streams. Investors should monitor the company's progress towards these goals, as they could significantly impact the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The strategic realignment around playGAMES and playAWARDS and the closure of certain studios, indicate a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core competencies. This, coupled with the extension of the Tetris mobile gaming license, suggests a long-term strategy to solidify the company's position in the mobile gaming market.The introduction of new games and the expansion of the playAWARDS loyalty platform could enhance user engagement and open new revenue channels. The potential for playAWARDS to generate external revenue marks a pivotal development, which could diversify the company's income and provide a more stable financial outlook. Investors should consider the company's ability to execute on these initiatives and the market's response to new product offerings when evaluating future performance. Gaming Industry Expert The mobile gaming industry is highly competitive with rapid innovation cycles. PLAYSTUDIOS' focus on monetizing and stabilizing its social casino games is critical, as these are often high-margin products. The emphasis on DAU (Daily Active Users) and ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User) improvements for Tetris Prime suggests a data-driven approach to increasing user retention and monetization—a key factor in the industry's success.The expansion of the myVIP program and the integration of Brainium into operations could enhance the company's competitive edge by providing a more robust gaming experience and potentially increasing user lifetime value. The long-term extension of the Tetris license is also significant, as it secures a classic and popular IP that can attract and retain users. The development of new Tetris games could rejuvenate the brand and attract new players, but it's important to consider the execution risks and market reception of these new titles. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenue of $77.1 million and Net Loss of $19.9 million AEBITDA of $14.7 million and AEBITDA Margins up 390bps from Year Ago Levels Introducing FY2024 Financial Guidance LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYPS) (“PLAYSTUDIOS” or the “Company”), the creator of the playAWARDS loyalty platform and an award-winning developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile and social games, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Revenue was $77.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $79.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss was $19.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net loss of $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Consolidated AEBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $14.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $12.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue was $310.9 million during 2023, compared to $290.3 million in prior year. Net loss was $19.4 million during 2023, compared to net loss of $17.8 million in prior year. Consolidated AEBITDA,was $62.3 million during 2023, compared to $38.3 million in prior year. Andrew Pascal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PLAYSTUDIOS, commented, “We closed 2023 strongly, reporting fourth quarter results that were ahead of consensus expectations and above the midpoint of our guidance. Our profitability continued to rise at a remarkable rate, with year over year Consolidated AEBITDA growing over 20% and Consolidated AEBITDA margins expanding by 390bps vs. the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 results were even stronger with Consolidated AEBITDA expanding by over 60% and Consolidated AEBITDA margins growing nearly 700bps to 20%. Our goal remains to reach parity with our peers, whose margins are in the 30% range. Revenues in the quarter were largely inline with our expectations, with our portfolio of growth games continuing to perform strongly. playAWARDS added new partners and functionality in the quarter as well as expanding its presence across our games. We believe a full adoption of the myVIP program will meaningfully increase audience participation in our loyalty ecosystem and drive substantial value for our players, games, and reward partners.” He continued “We undertook and completed many significant initiatives in 2023, positioning the company for growth in 2024 and beyond. Notable accomplishments included the realignment of the company around our two main business lines, playGAMES and playAWARDS, relocating myKONAMI and myVEGAS to Tel Aviv, largely closing our Austin, TX and Hong Kong studios, integrating Brainium into our operations, and extending Tetris’ mobile gaming license for up to an additional 8 years. With these changes in place, we are positioned to maximize our growth and returns on capital, something I believe will begin happening in 2024. Looking across our company, I see upside potential almost everywhere. In the Core Portfolio, our focus will be to stabilize our social casino games and increase monetization in myKONAMI and myVEGAS. Sustained DAU and ARPDAU gains are expected at Tetris Prime in 2024, which alongside building momentum in Brainium, should continue to drive strong performance in our Growth Portfolio. Our Development Portfolio will be focused on Tetris where we are working on releasing one to two new games this year. We believe we can sustain this pace of new game development beyond 2024 and build Tetris into a formidable mobile franchise.“ Pascal added, “2024 will be a seminal year for playAWARDS as we expect the platform to begin generating external revenues for the first time. We continue to engage in conversations with other game publishers and strategic partners and believe 2024 is the first step in a long journey of growth. It’s still early days, but I’m excited by the conversations we’re having. To this end, we are now providing disclosures around divisional Revenue and Consolidated AEBITDA as we believe both our businesses merit their own attention. My hope is this disclosure gives you a better sense of the unique dynamics in each our businesses and also highlights the value and opportunity within PLAYSTUDIOS."" He concluded, “As we begin 2024, I am very excited about what lies ahead for PLAYSTUDIOS. Our focus this year will be on expansion and yielding gains on our many foundational efforts in 2023. This is clear in our 2024 guidance, which calls for growth in Revenues, Consolidated AEBITDA, and margins. I believe the momentum we build this year can be sustained over the long run and return us to the growth rates that have historically typified our company. At the same time, our goal remains to supplement these gains with transformative M&A. Our balance sheet affords us considerable latitude in this search and we are confident we will eventually find the right opportunity.” Recent Business Highlights Substantially increased the profitability of PLAYSTUDIOS in 2023, growing Consolidated AEBITDA by nearly 65% vs. 2022 and increasing Consolidated AEBITDA margins by 700bps from the prior year. Continued the launch of myVIP into our games and expect to be fully integrated throughout our portfolio later this year. As of December 31, 2023, PLAYSTUDIOS had a cash balance of $133 million and full availability on its $81 million loan facility. The company did not repurchase any stock in the open market during the quarter. On November 1, 2023, the Board extended the share repurchase authorization through November 10, 2024 and increased the remaining amount authorized to $50 million, up from $30 million remaining under the previous authorization. At quarter end, playAWARDS had 113 rewards partners with players making purchases of over $27 million in retail value in the quarter. Outlook The Company expects full year 2024 net revenue to be in the range of $315 - $325 million. In addition, full-year Consolidated AEBITDA is expected to be in the range of $65 - $70 million. We have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP measure for our Consolidated AEBITDA outlook because certain items that are part of the projected non-GAAP financial measure are outside of our control or cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort.

As such, an individual who plays two of these games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as one DAU. For our Brainium suite of casual games, we track DAU by app instance ID, which is assigned to each installation of a game on a particular device. As such, an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two DAU. The term “Average DAU” is defined as the average of the DAU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DAU and Average DAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a daily basis. Monthly Active Users (“MAU”): MAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game in a particular month. As with DAU, an individual who plays two different non-Brainium games in the same month is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same non-Brainium game on two different devices is counted as one MAU, and an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two MAU. The term “Average MAU” is defined as the average of the MAU, determined as described above, for each calendar month during the period presented. We use MAU and Average MAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a monthly basis. Daily Paying Users (“DPU”): DPU is defined as the number of individuals who made a purchase in a mobile game during a particular day. As with DAU and MAU, we track DPU based on account activity. As such, an individual who makes a purchase on two different games in a particular day is counted as two DPU while an individual who makes purchases in the same game on two different devices is counted as one DPU. The term “Average DPU” is defined as the average of the DPU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DPU and Average DPU to help us understand the size of our active player base that makes in-game purchases. This focus directs our strategic goals in setting player acquisition and pricing strategy. Daily Payer Conversion: Daily Payer Conversion is defined as DPU as a percentage of DAU on a particular day. Daily Payer Conversion is also sometimes referred to as “Percentage of Paying Users” or “PPU”. The term “Average Daily Payer Conversion” is defined as the Average DPU divided by the Average DAU for a given period. We use Daily Payer Conversion and Average Daily Payer Conversion to help us understand the monetization of our active players. Average Daily Revenue Per DAU (“ARPDAU”): ARPDAU is defined for a given period as the average daily revenue per Average DAU, and is calculated as game and advertising revenue for the period, divided by the number of days in the period, divided by the Average DAU during the period. We use ARPDAU as a measure of overall monetization of our active players. Available Rewards: Available Rewards is defined as the monthly average number of unique rewards available in our applications’ rewards stores. A reward appearing in more than one application’s reward store is counted only once. A reward is counted only once irrespective of the inventory available through that reward. For example, one reward for a free night in a hotel room with ten rooms available for such free night is counted as one reward. Available Rewards only include real-world partner rewards and exclude PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. We use Available Rewards as a measure of the value and potential impact of the program for an interested player. It is assumed that the greater the variety and breadth of rewards offered, the more likely players will be to ascribe value to the program. Purchases: Purchases is defined as the total number of rewards purchased for the period identified in which a player exchanges loyalty points for a reward. Purchases are not adjusted for refunds. Purchases only include purchases of real-world partner rewards and exclude any PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. The Company does not receive any compensation or revenue from Purchases. We use Purchases as a measure of audience interest and engagement with our playAWARDS platform. Retail Value of Purchases: Retail Value of Purchases is defined as the cumulative retail value of all rewards listed as Purchases for the period identified. The retail value of each reward listed as Purchases is the retail value as determined by the partner upon creation of the reward. In the case where the retail value of a reward adjusts depending on time of redemption, the average retail value is used. Retail Value of Purchases only include the retail value of real-world partner rewards and exclude the cost of any PLAYSTUDIOS branded merchandise. We use Retail Value of Purchases to help us understand the real-world value of the rewards that are purchased by our players. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with information in addition to results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company discloses Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“Consolidated AEBITDA”) as a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful information to investors. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We define Consolidated AEBITDA as net loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and related costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, and other income and expense items (including special infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). We also present Consolidated AEBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate as Consolidated AEBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. We believe that the presentation of Consolidated AEBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because the measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Consolidated AEBITDA provides an indicator of performance that is not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on this measure for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, this measure allows management to compare results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. However, other companies may define Consolidated AEBITDA differently, and as a result, our measure of Consolidated AEBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Consolidated AEBITDA” section of this press release.

Announces February 29, 2024 Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) reported $1,630.9 billion in assets under management (AUM) for February 2024, showing a 3.0% increase from the previous month. The firm experienced net long-term inflows of $1.8 billion, with money market net inflows of $3.5 billion. AUM growth was boosted by favorable market returns, offset by FX impact. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter was $1,594.5 billion. Positive Invesco Ltd. saw a significant increase in AUM to $1,630.9 billion in February 2024. The firm achieved net long-term inflows of $1.8 billion during the month. Money market net inflows reached $3.5 billion, contributing to the overall growth in AUM. AUM was positively impacted by $42 billion from favorable market returns. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter through February 29 stood at $1,594.5 billion. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) by Invesco Ltd. is a positive indicator of the firm's growth trajectory and the attractiveness of its investment products. The net inflows, particularly the long-term inflows of $1.8 billion, suggest investor confidence and a potential uptick in revenue from management fees. Money market inflows are also noteworthy, as they reflect investors' preference for liquidity under current market conditions.From a financial perspective, the favorable market returns contributing $42 billion to the AUM is significant as it indicates that the firm's investment strategies are performing well amidst market dynamics. However, the FX impact that reduced AUM by $2.6 billion underscores the risks associated with currency fluctuations, which can affect multinational investment firms like Invesco.Understanding the composition of AUM, with a mix of equity, fixed income and alternative investments, provides insight into the firm's diversification strategy and risk management. The balance between active and passive management styles, with active AUM constituting a substantial portion of the total, suggests a strategic positioning that caters to varied investor preferences. Market Research Analyst The data suggests that Invesco is maintaining a healthy balance across different asset classes, which could be appealing to a broad range of investors. The increase in equity AUM from $830.8 billion to $871.9 billion may reflect market optimism or successful stock selection, or both. The stability in fixed income AUM indicates sustained interest in bonds as a defensive asset class, which may appeal to risk-averse investors.It is also interesting to observe the growth in money market funds, which could be interpreted as a sign of investor caution, possibly due to macroeconomic uncertainties or market volatility. This shift towards liquidity can affect the firm's revenue mix, as money market funds typically generate lower fees than long-term investment vehicles.The passive AUM's growth trend reflects the broader industry's move towards cost-effective investment solutions like index-based ETFs. This shift could impact the firm's revenue model, as passive funds generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. Economist The report by Invesco provides a snapshot of investor sentiment and economic trends. The net inflows into long-term and money market funds suggest that while there is an appetite for growth, there is also a desire for safety, indicative of mixed economic signals. The increase in AUM due to market returns may correlate with broader economic performance, implying that Invesco's portfolio may have benefited from the prevailing economic conditions.The influence of foreign exchange on AUM highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the impact of exchange rate movements on investment returns. An economist would note that such currency risks are a reminder of the importance of hedging strategies and the need for investors to be aware of the potential for FX-induced volatility in their international exposures.Overall, the AUM growth reflects both micro factors, such as the firm's asset management capabilities and macro factors, such as market conditions and economic policies that influence investor behavior and asset valuations. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM ATLANTA, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd.

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Core & Main Inc. (CNM) has announced the acquisition of NW Geosynthetics Inc., known as ACF West Inc., a prominent distributor of geosynthetic materials in the western United States. The acquisition aims to expand Core & Main's geosynthetics footprint, distribution reach, and product offerings in the region. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of ACF West Inc. by Core & Main Inc. represents a strategic expansion in the geosynthetics market, which is integral to infrastructure development. Geosynthetics are synthetic products used to solve civil engineering problems, including soil stabilization, erosion control and drainage—vital for construction and environmental projects. The addition of ACF West's distribution network and expertise is likely to enhance Core & Main's product offerings and customer base in the western United States.From a market perspective, the integration of ACF West could lead to operational synergies and increased market share for Core & Main. The extended distribution reach and enhanced capabilities might offer competitive advantages in bidding for large-scale infrastructure projects. Investors should monitor the post-acquisition integration process, as successful assimilation could result in increased revenue streams and market presence, while challenges could impact the expected synergies. Financial Analyst Financially, the acquisition's impact on Core & Main's balance sheet and income statement will be a focal point for investors. The immediate costs associated with the acquisition and the long-term financial benefits, such as potential revenue growth and cost savings, need to be assessed. The deal could lead to economies of scale, with the potential for improved margins due to a broader product portfolio and increased bargaining power with suppliers.Investors should consider the acquisition's financing and its implications for Core & Main's leverage. An increase in debt to finance the acquisition could affect the company's credit rating and interest expenses. However, if the integration leads to significant revenue and cash flow improvements, the long-term benefits could outweigh the initial financial risks. Construction Industry Expert The demand for geosynthetics is closely tied to infrastructure spending, which is currently on an upswing due to various government initiatives aimed at improving national infrastructure. Given this context, Core & Main's acquisition of ACF West positions the company to capitalize on the growing market demand. The specialized expertise of ACF West in engineered solutions for soil stabilization and erosion control is particularly relevant as these issues become more pressing with climate change and increased construction activity.For stakeholders in the construction and infrastructure sectors, the merger could mean greater access to a comprehensive range of geosynthetic products and services, potentially leading to more efficient project execution. The long-term impact on the industry could include advancements in the application of geosynthetics, driven by the combined research and development efforts of the merged entities. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM ST.

(CTO) provided an update on its leasing activities, signing 16 leases totaling 112,480 square feet year-to-date. The company achieved a significant 89% comparable growth in cash base rent, signing leases at an average of $27.49 per square foot. CTO also secured a 45,000 square foot lease with a regional fitness tenant in Apex, NC, and signed new leases with prominent brands like Altar’d State, Bath & Body Works, and Occidental Petroleum. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent update from CTO Realty Growth, Inc. regarding their leasing activities is a robust indicator of the company's operational performance. The significant increase in average cash base rent per square foot, from $14.06 to $26.58, is indicative of the company's ability to enhance the value of its properties and negotiate favorable lease terms. This 89% growth in comparable cash base rent suggests effective asset management and a potentially strong positioning within the commercial real estate market.Furthermore, the diversification of tenants, including the signing of leases with companies such as Altar’d State and Occidental Petroleum, demonstrates CTO's strategic tenant mix, which can lead to a stable income stream and potentially reduce vacancy rates. The successful replacement of Regal Cinemas with a regional fitness tenant also highlights adaptability in tenant restructuring, which is crucial for maintaining occupancy levels in the face of industry-specific challenges, such as the decline in demand for traditional movie theaters. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of CTO's leasing update, the reported 89% growth in comparable cash base rent is a strong signal for revenue growth potential. This increase directly impacts the company's net operating income (NOI), as higher rents translate to higher margins, assuming operational costs remain stable. Investors should note the potential for this increased NOI to contribute positively to the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which is a key metric for evaluating a company's operational efficiency and profitability.Moreover, the addition of high-profile tenants like Total Wine & More and Sunglass Hut may enhance the perceived quality and stability of CTO's portfolio, which can be attractive to investors seeking lower-risk real estate investments. The diversity of tenants across different sectors, including retail, energy and food services, could mitigate sector-specific risks and contribute to a more resilient income profile. Real Estate Investment Analyst From a real estate investment perspective, the update provided by CTO Realty Growth, Inc. suggests that the company is actively managing its portfolio to optimize asset performance. The strategic leasing decisions, especially the replacement of a traditional cinema with a fitness tenant, reflect a proactive approach to evolving consumer preferences and the experiential retail trend. This could be a positive sign for investors looking for companies that are agile in adapting to market shifts.The opening of new venues like Politan Row and Culinary Dropout also points to a focus on creating destination spaces that can drive foot traffic and increase the attractiveness of CTO's properties. The ability to attract and retain high-quality tenants is a critical factor in real estate investment and can lead to appreciation in property values over time. The reported leasing activities may signal to investors that CTO is positioning its properties to capitalize on long-term trends in the real estate market. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM WINTER PARK, Fla., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CTO Realty Growth, Inc.

The report includes audited financial statements and can be accessed on the company's website. Shareholders can request a free hard copy. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Belite Bio's release of its audited consolidated financial statements, as per the SEC's requirements, is a critical piece of information for shareholders and potential investors. Analyzing the financial health and performance of a company through these statements is essential for making informed investment decisions. Key metrics to scrutinize include revenue growth, profit margins, R&D expenses and cash flow. These figures can reveal the company's operational efficiency and its ability to sustain and scale its business. Moreover, in the biopharmaceutical sector, the allocation of funds towards research and development is particularly telling, as it indicates the company's commitment to innovation and future growth prospects.For a clinical-stage company like Belite Bio, which does not have products on the market yet, the burn rate—or the rate at which it spends its cash reserves—is also a significant indicator. It can provide insights into how long the company can continue to operate at its current pace without additional funding. Investors should pay attention to the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) section, which often provides context for the numbers and any forward-looking statements that can impact future performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advancements. The release of financial statements by Belite Bio allows for a comparative analysis with industry benchmarks and peers. The performance of Belite Bio can be juxtaposed with that of other firms in the retinal disease space to gauge its market position and competitive edge. Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as regulatory changes, market demand for degenerative retinal disease treatments and the overall investment climate in the biotech sector, should be considered.Understanding the market dynamics and Belite Bio's position within the context of these dynamics can give investors a clearer picture of its potential for growth and profitability. For instance, if Belite Bio is outpacing the industry in terms of innovation or has a promising pipeline of therapeutics, it may be poised for significant future valuation increases, despite current financial losses typical in the clinical-stage phase. Biotech Industry Analyst Belite Bio's focus on degenerative retinal diseases, an area with significant unmet medical needs, suggests a strategic targeting of niche markets where patient demand is high and competition might be lower. The biotech industry places a premium on innovation, particularly in areas like this where there is a clear patient need. Investors will be interested in the pipeline details and any updates on clinical trial progress, partnerships, or regulatory milestones, which are often included in the annual report or subsequent filings.It is essential to assess the company's intellectual property position, the viability of its drug candidates and the regulatory pathway ahead. The latter can be fraught with challenges and any setbacks or advancements can have profound effects on the company's valuation. Furthermore, the company's strategy in addressing these needs, including its go-to-market approach and potential for strategic partnerships or licensing deals, should be carefully evaluated for long-term viability and risk assessment. 03/11/2024 - 10:28 PM SAN DIEGO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Belite Bio, Inc (NASDAQ: BLTE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting degenerative retinal diseases that have significant unmet medical needs, today announced that its annual report on Form 20-F, containing audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2024, is available through its website (https://www.belitebio.com).

The company is focused on developing oral therapies for eye diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Positive Positive results from Phase 2 trial of Tinlarebant in adolescent STGD1 subjects showing sustained lower atrophic lesion growth compared to ProgStar participants 42% of Tinlarebant-treated subjects did not develop atrophic retinal lesions during the 24-month treatment period Enrollment completed for pivotal global Phase 3 trial of Tinlarebant in STGD1 subjects with interim data expected in 4Q 2024 Initiation of pivotal global Phase 3 trial of Tinlarebant in GA subjects and approval to start PHOENIX trial in eight countries Strong financial position with $88.2 million in cash as of December 31, 2023 Completion of underwritten public offering and initiation of at-the-market offering program raising significant funds for the company Negative None. Financial Analyst The Phase 2 trial data showing sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in Tinlarebant-treated subjects is a positive indicator for Belite Bio's drug efficacy. This could potentially lead to a competitive advantage in the market for treatments of STGD1 and GA, conditions currently lacking FDA-approved therapies. The company's financial strength, with $88.2 million in cash reserves, suggests adequate funding for ongoing trials and operations. However, the increased net loss year-over-year, from $12.6 million to $31.6 million, reflects the substantial investment in R&D required for the DRAGON and PHOENIX trials. Investors should monitor the burn rate and future financing needs, as well as the potential revenue streams upon successful drug approval and commercialization. Medical Research Analyst The Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations granted by the FDA for Tinlarebant indicate a recognition of the unmet medical need in STGD1 treatment and could expedite the review process. The 42% of subjects not developing atrophic retinal lesions over 24 months is significant, suggesting Tinlarebant's potential to alter the disease course. The upcoming interim data from the DRAGON trial will be pivotal in assessing the long-term viability and safety of the drug. Given the chronic nature of GA and the aging population, a successful oral treatment could significantly impact patient quality of life and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Market Research Analyst Belite Bio's strategic focus on degenerative retinal diseases taps into a niche yet growing market driven by an aging global population. The lack of approved oral treatments for GA and STGD1 positions Tinlarebant to potentially capture a significant market share. The company's proactive approach in securing global trial enrollment and regulatory designations across the U.S., Europe and Japan demonstrates an understanding of the importance of market diversification. The market will be closely watching the interim results of the DRAGON trial for indications of the drug's efficacy and safety profile, which will be critical in shaping investor sentiment and the company's strategic direction. 03/11/2024 - 09:27 PM Tinlarebant is Belite Bio’s orally administered tablet intended to slow disease progression in patients affected with Stargardt Disease (STGD1) and Geographic Atrophy (GA) in advanced Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)Data from a 24-month Phase 2 trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects showed a sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in Tinlarebant-treated subjects compared to ProgStar participants possessing similar baseline characteristics (aged ≤18 years) (p<0.001)In the Phase 2 trial, 42% of Tinlarebant-treated subjects (5 out of 12) did not develop atrophic retinal lesions during the 24-month treatment periodEnrollment of a pivotal global Phase 3 trial of Tinlarebant in adolescent STGD1 subjects (“DRAGON”) has been completed with 104 subjects across 11 countriesInterim data from the “DRAGON” trial expected in 4Q 2024Dosed first subject in pivotal global Phase 3 trial of Tinalrebant in GA subjects (“PHOENIX”) and received approval to initiate PHOENIX trial in eight countriesAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $88.2 million in cash.Conference Call and Webcast on Tuesday, March 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET SAN DIEGO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Belite Bio, Inc (NASDAQ: BLTE) (“Belite Bio” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting degenerative retinal diseases that have significant unmet medical needs, today announced its audited financial results for full-year 2023 and the unaudited and unreviewed financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “2023 was a productive year for Belite, from the initiation of our Phase III trial in GA, enrollment completion of our Phase III Stargardt disease trial, to the exciting 24-month data from our Phase II Stargardt disease trial,” said Dr. Tom Lin, Chairman and CEO of Belite Bio. “These milestones continue to underscore the therapeutic potential of Tinlarebant, not only in Stargardt disease, for which there is still no approved treatment, but for patients suffering from GA, for which an oral treatment would be game changing. As we enter 2024, we remain focused on our mission to develop oral therapies for eye diseases with significant unmet medical needs and are well positioned to execute with our strong balance sheet. We expect to share additional analysis from our Phase 2 Stargardt disease trial at the annual meeting of The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in May, and to receive one-year interim data from our Phase 3 DRAGON trial later this year. We also look forward to sharing additional enrollment updates on our Phase III PHOENIX trial in GA as the year progresses.” Full Year 2023 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones: Clinical Highlights Tinlarebant (LBS-008) is designed to be an oral, potent, once-daily retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) antagonist that decreases RBP4 levels in the blood and reduces vitamin A (retinol) delivery to the eye without disrupting systemic retinol delivery to other tissues. Vitamin A is critical for normal vision but can accumulate as toxic byproducts in individuals affected with STGD1 and GA (the advanced form of Dry AMD) leading to retinal cell death and loss of vision. Stargardt disease (STGD1): Accumulation of cytotoxic vitamin A byproducts (bisretinoids) has been implicated in the onset and progression of STGD1. Tinlarebant has been granted Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and orphan drug designation (ODD) in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for STGD1. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for STGD1.LBS-008-CT02 Trial: Completed, open label, 24-month Phase 2 trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects and presented end of trial data at the American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO) annual meeting in November 2023 Tinlarebant was safe and well tolerated with no withdrawals due to adverse eventsThe 24-month data showed a sustained lower atrophic lesion growth in Tinlarebant-treated subjects compared to ProgStar participants possessing similar baseline characteristics (aged ≤18 years) (p<0.001)42% of Tinlarebant-treated subjects (5 out of 12) did not develop atrophic retinal lesionsVisual acuity was stabilized in the majority of subjects during the trial with a mean loss of five letters following 24 months of treatment (a loss of <10 letters is not considered clinically significant) DRAGON Trial: Ongoing, 24 month, randomized (2:1, active: placebo), double-masked, placebo-controlled, global, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects Completed enrollment with 104 subjects in 11 countriesPrimary efficacy endpoint is slowing of atrophic lesion growth rate; safety and tolerability will also be assessedInterim data expected in 4Q 2024 Geographic Atrophy (GA): GA, the advanced form of Dry AMD, is a chronic degenerative disease of the retina that leads to blindness in the elderly. Accumulation of toxic vitamin A byproducts (bisretinoids) has been implicated in the progression of GA. There are currently no FDA-approved, orally administered treatments for GA. PHOENIX Trial: Ongoing, 24-month, randomized (2:1, active: placebo; n~430 subjects), double-masked, placebo-controlled, global, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 trial in patients with GA Primary efficacy endpoint is slowing of atrophic lesion growth rate; safety and tolerability will also be assessedFirst patient dosed in the third quarter of 2023Has enrolled 56 subjectsInterim data expected at mid-point of the trial Corporate Highlights Completed an underwritten public offering of American Depositary Shares of the Company (“ADSs”) and warrants (the “Follow-on Offering”) for gross proceeds of $30 million in June 2023Initiated an at-the-market offering program of additional ADSs (the “ATM Offering”) with an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in June 2023Raised $22 million from the exercise of warrants issued in the Follow-on Offering and $29 million from ATM Offering as of December 31, 2023 Audited Full Year 2023 and Unaudited and Unreviewed Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results: Cash: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $88.2 million in cash, as compared with $42.1 million on December 31, 2022. R&D Expenses: For the three months ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses were $4.9 million compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease resulted primarily from higher R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the DRAGON trial reached certain milestones in such quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses were $24.8 million compared to $8.9 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increases in expenses related to conducting the DRAGON and PHOENIX trials. G&A Expenses: For the three months ended December 31, 2023, general and administration expenses were $2.1 million compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2022. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in share-based compensation granted in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, general and administration expenses were $6.8 million compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2022. The increase resulted also primarily from an increase in share-based compensation granted in 2023 and an increase in professional service fees. Net Loss: For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $7.0 million or ($0.25) per share compared to $6.8 million or ($0.27) per share for the same period in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $31.6 million or ($1.19) per share, compared to a net loss of $12.6 million or ($0.63) per share for the same period in 2022.

We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful measure of our performance. It is commonly used to analyze and compare media companies based on operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Nonetheless, EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indication of our financial performance, an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may compute EBITDA in a different manner; therefore, EBITDA as reported by other companies may not be comparable to EBITDA as we report it.(2) EBITDA Margin is defined as EBITDA over Total Revenues.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The new share repurchase authorization by Patterson Companies, Inc. signifies a robust signal to the market regarding the management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. By allocating $500 million towards stock repurchases, the firm is actively engaging in capital return to shareholders, which could potentially increase earnings per share (EPS) and shareholder value by reducing the number of shares outstanding. It's essential to consider the opportunity cost of this capital allocation; the funds could alternatively be invested in growth opportunities or debt reduction.Moreover, the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share reinforces the company's commitment to providing a steady income stream to its investors, which is particularly appealing to income-focused shareholders. The combination of share repurchases and consistent dividends can be indicative of a mature company with a stable cash flow. However, investors should assess the sustainability of these dividends in conjunction with the company's payout ratio and cash flow statements. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Patterson Companies' announcement could be perceived as a positive catalyst for the stock price in the short term. Repurchase programs often lead to a contraction in the equity float, potentially driving up the stock price through increased demand. This can also be a defensive move against market volatility or a perceived undervaluation by the company's management.However, it's crucial to analyze this move in the context of the company's overall market strategy and industry position. Investors should consider whether the repurchase program aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and how it compares with competitors' capital allocation strategies. A comprehensive analysis would involve examining the company's historical repurchase activities, its impact on the stock performance and the broader industry trends to gauge the effectiveness of such buyback programs. 03/11/2024 - 08:04 PM ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On March 11, 2024, the Board of Directors of Patterson Companies, Inc.

The acquisition is expected to generate $140 million in annual revenues, adding to the company's acquired revenues of $1.0 billion in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition by Group 1 Automotive of Modern Classic Motors is a strategic expansion that is poised to bolster the company's revenue and market presence. From a market research perspective, the key takeaway is the growth potential in Beaufort County, which is identified as one of the fastest-growing regions. This suggests a calculated move by Group 1 to tap into a burgeoning market with an increasing demand for automotive sales and services.Moreover, the addition of franchises such as Mercedes-Benz and Honda enhances the company's brand diversity and appeal to a broader customer base. The expected $140 million in annual revenues from this acquisition indicates a significant increment in Group 1's financial performance. This figure also contributes to the impressive cumulative acquired annual revenues of $1.0 billion in 2024, following a strong previous year's performance of $1.1 billion in acquisitions.It's important to note that the automotive retail industry is highly competitive and strategic acquisitions like this can provide Group 1 with a competitive edge in terms of market share and customer loyalty.

The fact that Group 1 is continuing to expand its relationship with reputable brands like Mercedes-Benz and Honda suggests confidence in the profitability of these franchises.Long-term, the acquisition could lead to economies of scale, improved bargaining power with manufacturers and a stronger position in the automotive retail market.

The offering aims to fund research, development, and general corporate purposes.","Cognition Therapeutics Announces Pricing of $11.5 Million Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. (CGTX) announces a public offering of 6,571,428 shares of common stock at $1.75 per share, with gross proceeds expected to be $11.5 million. The offering aims to fund research, development, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of 6,571,428 shares by Cognition Therapeutics at $1.75 per share, with the potential addition of 985,714 shares, represents a significant capital infusion for the company. The expected gross proceeds of approximately $11.5 million, before fees and expenses, will likely bolster the company's financial position. This strategic move could improve Cognition's ability to fund ongoing research and development activities, particularly in the high-stakes field of neurodegenerative disorders.Investors and analysts should note the offering's pricing in relation to Cognition's market performance and sector benchmarks. The offering price can provide insights into current market valuation and investor appetite for risk in the biotechnology sector. The use of a shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing for a more expedited offering process. This can be a double-edged sword, as it may suggest preparedness and strategic financial management, or potentially a need for rapid capital due to unforeseen cash flow challenges. Medical Research Analyst The allocation of net proceeds towards research, clinical development and manufacturing is crucial for Cognition Therapeutics, given its focus on neurodegenerative diseases—a field that requires substantial investment in long-term studies and trials. This funding could accelerate the development of their product candidates, which is vital for a clinical-stage company to move from trial phases to potential commercialization.Understanding the clinical pipeline's stage and the potential market for these therapies is essential. If Cognition's candidates address unmet needs in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, the impact on patient care and the company's market share could be significant. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials, including the possibility of failure to meet endpoints or regulatory hurdles, must be considered when evaluating the potential return on investment from this offering. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the success of Cognition's public offering and subsequent use of proceeds could influence its competitive stance within the biotech industry. By securing additional funding, Cognition may enhance its ability to compete with larger entities in the neurodegenerative space, potentially leading to strategic partnerships or collaborations. Market analysts should monitor the company's progress post-funding to assess how effectively the capital is being deployed towards value-generating activities.Additionally, the role of Titan Partners Group as the sole book-running manager could be indicative of the investment community's confidence in the offering. The firm's reputation and network might aid in attracting institutional investors, which could have a stabilizing effect on the stock's performance post-offering. Tracking the uptake of the additional share option by underwriters could also serve as a barometer for the market's reception of the offering and confidence in the company's future prospects. 03/11/2024 - 08:16 PM PURCHASE, N.Y., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cognition,” the “Company” or “We”) (Nasdaq: CGTX), a clinical stage company developing product candidates designed to treat neurodegenerative disorders, today announced that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 6,571,428 shares of its common stock at an offering price of $1.75 per share of common stock. Cognition has also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 985,714 additional shares of its common stock sold in the offering on the same terms and conditions. The Company expects to close the offering on March 14, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering are expected to be approximately $11.5 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund research, clinical development, process development and manufacturing of Cognition’s product candidates, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-268992) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 23, 2022, and declared effective by the SEC on January 3, 2023.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The formation of a joint venture by Westport Fuel Systems Inc. to expedite the commercialization of its High Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI) fuel system represents a strategic move to expand its market reach. This venture is likely to attract the attention of investors and industry stakeholders due to the potential for increased market share and revenue growth. The HPDI technology, which allows heavy-duty trucks to run on natural gas while maintaining diesel-like performance, aligns with the global push for cleaner transportation solutions. The rescheduling of the financial results could indicate that the joint venture may have material implications on the reported figures, suggesting a recalibration of financials to account for the new business arrangement. Financial Analyst Investors should note the postponement of Westport's financial results release, which could lead to speculation and volatility in the company's stock price. It is essential to monitor how the market reacts to both the announcement of the joint venture and the delayed financial disclosure. The rescheduling may also affect analysts' forecasts and investment models, requiring adjustments based on the anticipated impact of the joint venture on Westport's future earnings and cash flow. Additionally, the timing of the announcement, after the close of market, is a common practice intended to ensure all market participants have equal access to the information. Environmental Technology Expert Westport's HPDI fuel system is a significant technological advancement in the field of environmental technology, particularly for heavy-duty transportation. By enabling trucks to use natural gas, the technology contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional diesel engines. The joint venture could accelerate the adoption of this cleaner technology, potentially leading to broader environmental benefits. However, the success of this technology also hinges on the availability of natural gas refueling infrastructure and the comparative cost of natural gas to diesel, which are critical factors for widespread adoption. 03/11/2024 - 09:30 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Westport Fuel Systems Inc.

(NYSE: NYCB) (""NYCB"" or the ""Company"") announced today it completed the previously announced transactions resulting in individual investments aggregating to approximately $1.05 billion in the Company by Liberty Strategic Capital (""Liberty""), funds managed by Hudson Bay Capital Management (""Hudson Bay""), funds managed by Reverence Capital Partners (""Reverence Capital""), and other investors (collectively, the ""Investors""). Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Sandro DiNello stated, ""The completion of this major equity raise demonstrates the confidence these strategic investors have expressed in the turnaround currently underway at the Company and allows us to execute on our strategy from a position of strength. Our Company enters this next phase with an enhanced balance sheet and liquidity position.""

Mr. Berlinski, a newly appointed member of the Board and Managing Partner of Reverence Capital, added, ""We are happy to be investing alongside these strong investors. We believe NYCB has a tremendous opportunity to reposition itself as a regional bank and return to growth and profitability and we look forward to working with incoming CEO Joseph Otting and the management team."" In connection with the transactions, the Board has been reduced to ten members and the Company has added four new directors to the Board: Secretary Steven Mnuchin, former Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting; Milton Berlinski, Managing Partner of Reverence Capital; and Allen Puwalski, at the recommendation of Hudson Bay. Mr. DiNello, Marshall Lux, Lawrence Savarese, Peter Schoels, David Treadwell and Jennifer Whip remain members of the Board. Description of Transactions and Issued Securities The transactions involve the creation and issuance of additional common stock, as well as new equity securities of the Company, namely two new series of preferred stock (Series B and Series C) that were issued upon the closing, as well as a new series of preferred stock (Series D) issuable upon exercise of certain warrants issued to the Investors. Preferred stock is being issued in connection with the capital raise in part due to the fact that the Company does not have a sufficient amount of authorized but unissued shares of common stock under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the ""Certificate of Incorporation"") to permit the Company to issue only common shares to the Investors. Accordingly, we need the approval of our stockholders, as described in further detail below, in order to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to increase our total authorized shares of common shares and to permit the issuance of an amount of common stock that is 20% or more of our total common stock in compliance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""). Additionally, our issuance of non-voting preferred stock facilitates the Investors' ability to make immediate larger equity investments in the Company in a manner that complies with applicable banking laws and regulations, including the rules and limitations of Regulation Y of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (collectively, the ""Control Limitations""). Upon receipt of antitrust clearance (as described below) and the Share Issuance Approval (as defined below), and the related amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation, (i) the Series C preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock for each Investor that acquired Series C preferred stock at closing to the greatest extent permissible under the Control Limitations (unless any such Investor obtains the prior non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire an amount of our common stock above the Control Limitations) and (ii) the dividend payable on the Series B preferred stock will be eliminated, other than participating with common stock dividends on a pro rata basis and, therefore, holders of Series B preferred stock at such time will have no economic rights beyond those which holders of our common stock receive. In addition, if the Requisite Stockholder Approvals are not obtained within 180 days of the closing, the Investors will receive cash-settled warrants that become exercisable 60 days after issuance (alternatively, these warrants will be cancelled if the Requisite Stockholder Approvals are obtained during such 60-day period).

Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have the right to vote such shares on any matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, other than certain matters expressly permitted by the associated Certificate of Designations, and all of which shares of Series B Preferred Stock represent the right (on an as converted basis) to receive approximately 192 million shares of our common stock.256,307 shares of a new series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company designated as Series C Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the ""Series C Preferred Stock""), at a price per share of $2,000.

Additionally, the warrants can be exercised for up to 315 million shares of common stock; however, given the net share settlement feature of the warrant, the amount actually issued will be less than the full 315 million shares.

Receives Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Market Value Deficiency Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Arogo Capital Acquisition Corp. received a notice from Nasdaq stating it is not compliant with the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities requirement. The company has a compliance period until July 8, 2024, to regain compliance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notice received by Arogo Capital Acquisition Corp. from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the MVLS requirement is a critical financial development. The MVLS is a benchmark for assessing the financial health and market confidence in a publicly traded company. Falling below this threshold can trigger investor concerns about the company's valuation and future prospects. In Arogo's case, the redemption of shares by a significant number of shareholders could be indicative of waning investor confidence, possibly due to perceived risks or dissatisfaction with the company's strategic direction as suggested by the 'Extension Amendment Proposal' and 'Trust Agreement Proposal'.From a financial perspective, the company's ability to regain compliance by increasing its market value above US$50,000,000 for at least ten consecutive business days is crucial. Failure to do so could result in delisting, which typically leads to lower liquidity and investor interest, potentially impacting share price negatively. The company's consideration to transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market, typically home to smaller, less-capitalized companies, may reflect a strategic pivot or acknowledgment of its current market position. Market Research Analyst The SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) sector has been volatile, with many such entities facing scrutiny over their performance and the underlying value they bring to investors. Arogo's current predicament highlights broader market trends where SPACs may struggle to meet investor expectations post-merger or when seeking additional funding or extensions. Market sentiment around SPACs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the success of proposed business combinations and the general economic climate.For stakeholders, the short-term implications involve monitoring Arogo's strategic moves to regain compliance, which may include asset divestitures, cost-cutting measures, or seeking additional capital. Long-term implications could revolve around the company's ability to execute its business model and deliver value, particularly if it transitions to a different Nasdaq market tier with possibly lower visibility and investor scrutiny. 03/11/2024 - 05:41 PM MIAMI BEACH, FL, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arogo Capital Acquisition Corp. (“Arogo” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: AOGO/AOGOU/AOGOW), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that it received a notice (the ""Notice"") from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") on January 10, 2024, indicating that the Company is currently not in compliance with the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) set forth in the Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) requires companies to maintain a minimum market value of US$50,000,000 and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C) provides that a failure to meet the market value requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the market value of the Company for 38 consecutive business days from November 13, 2023, to January 9, 2024, the Company no longer meets the minimum market value requirement. This notification does not impact the listing and trading of the Company’s securities at this time. To provide context regarding the change of the Company’s market value, as previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed on September 28, 2023, the Company held a Special Meeting of shareholders to address significant proposals, including the ""Extension Amendment Proposal,"" and the ""Trust Agreement Proposal.” In connection with the votes to approve the proposals above, the holders of 3,298,311 shares of common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days (or until July 8, 2024) to regain compliance. If at any time during this compliance period the Company’s MVLS closes at US$50,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will notify the Company that it has achieved compliance with the MVLS requirement and this matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) prior to the expiration of the compliance period, it will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. Alternatively, the Company may consider applying to transfer its securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company intends to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and will evaluate its available options to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVLS rule within the compliance period.

About TriSalus Life Sciences TriSalus Life Sciences is an oncology company integrating novel delivery technology with immunotherapy to transform treatment for patients with liver and pancreatic tumors. The Company’s platform includes devices that utilize a proprietary drug delivery technology and a clinical-stage investigational immunotherapy. The Company’s two FDA-cleared devices use its proprietary Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD™) approach to deliver a range of therapeutics: the TriNav® Infusion System for hepatic arterial infusion of liver tumors and the Pancreatic Retrograde Venous Infusion System for pancreatic tumors. PEDD is a novel delivery approach designed to address the anatomic limitations of arterial infusion to the pancreas. The PEDD approach modulates pressure and flow in a manner that delivers more therapeutic to the tumor and is designed to reduce undesired delivery to normal tissue, bringing the potential to improve patient outcomes. SD-101, the Company’s investigational immunotherapeutic candidate, is designed to improve patient outcomes by treating the immunosuppressive environment created by many tumors, which can make current immunotherapies ineffective in the liver and pancreas. Patient data generated during Pressure-Enabled Regional Immuno-Oncology™ (PERIO) clinical trials support the hypothesis that SD-101 delivered via PEDD may have favorable immune effects within the liver and systemically. The target for SD-101, TLR9, is expressed across cancer types and the mechanical barriers addressed by PEDD are commonly present as well. SD-101 delivered by PEDD will be studied across several indications in an effort to address immune dysfunction and overcome drug delivery barriers in the liver and pancreas. In partnership with leading cancer centers across the country – and by leveraging deep immuno-oncology expertise and inventive technology development – TriSalus is committed to advancing innovation that improves outcomes for patients.

Attributable royalty revenue for the full year was $73.9 million ($1.56 per share) compared to $103.5 million ($2.27 per share) in 2022.

JOHN’S, Newfoundland and Labrador--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altius Minerals Corporation (TSX: ALS; OTCQX: ATUSF) (“Altius” or the “Corporation”) reports full year revenue of $69.0 million compared to $102.0 million in 2022 and $13.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $21.7 million in the same period in 2022. Full year attributable royalty revenue(1) of $73.9 million ($1.56 per share(1)) compares to $103.5 million ($2.27 per share) reported in 2022. Fourth quarter attributable royalty revenue of $16.0 million ($0.34 per share) compares to $23.1 million ($0.49 per share) in Q4 2022. Brian Dalton, CEO commented, “The decline in revenue for the year primarily reflects lower realized potash prices relative to the record levels recorded last year, the scheduled closure of the 777 mine in 2022 and fading thermal coal royalties as the Genesee power plant continued its conversion to natural gas based fueling. Our potash operators have both reported a return to higher volumes in 2024 that, if realized, will approximate requirements predicted by historic demand growth trends and is reflective of price moderation-based affordability for farmers as well as soil nutrient depletion factors. While prices now appear to have stabilized, we continue to believe that prices remain below what is required to incentivize growth investment and to offset projected medium and longer term market supply deficits as demand growth continues to compound. The most significant highlights for our royalty portfolio came after year end, with release of the Kami project study and the announcement of increased resources and expected production levels at Silicon Merlin. These two development stage royalties each hold the potential to meaningfully drive our growth profile for decades to come.""

This is in addition to the more than 4 million ounce total mineral resource estimate (121.56Mt at 0.87 g/t Indicated Mineral Resource for 3.4 Moz and 36.03Mt at 0.70 g/t Inferred Mineral Resource for 0.81 Moz) previously published for the Silicon deposit. AGA has also stated the district scale project has ""the potential for production to average more than 500Koz per year over a multi-year period"", which compares to the more than 300Koz per annum level it had previously indicated. A pre-feasibility study (""PFS"") for the Expanded Silicon Project is currently in progress. The basis of the PFS targets upper oxide ore only while AGA recently stated there is ""significant upside potential from deeper ore horizons and nearby exploration targets"" and that infill and extension drilling programs continue. At the end of January 2024, Champion Iron Limited (""Champion"") announced the results of an updated project study for the Kami project (""Kami Project Study""). The Kami Project Study evaluated the potential for Kami's high-purity iron ore concentrates (DR quality,>67.5% Fe) to supply the growing electric arc furnace steel-making segment and included various pricing and investment return scenarios. Its illustration of the economic potential of the project included various pricing scenarios including the trailing 3 year average price for 65% Fe content ore plus an estimated premium for Kami's indicated higher quality above this benchmark. Altius originated the Kami project within its Project Generation business and retains a 3% gross sales royalty interest. The Saúva deposit maiden resource estimate announced by Lundin Mining Corporation (""Lundin"") was another key highlight during the year as it adds life extension and/or production rate increase potential to Altius's copper stream and confirms the district scale potential of the Chapada project. Lundin has published an open-pit Indicated Mineral Resource of 244.6 Mt at 0.29% copper and 0.17 g/t gold (721 kt or 1.59 Blbs of copper) and an underground Inferred Mineral Resource of 53.3 Mt at 0.41% copper and 0.26 g/t gold (221 kt or 0.49 Blbs of copper) for Saúva. This compares with Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources at Chapada of 920.7 Mt at 0.24% copper and 0.12 g/t gold (2169 kt or 4.77 Blbs copper). Lundin highlighted continuing exploration work in 2024 at Saúva as it continues to advance expansion studies for the district, which have now been expanded in scope to include this new discovery. ARR continued to ramp up its royalty revenue growth trajectory and to add new operating and development stage royalties to its portfolio. It also completed a significant new debt financing package that has positioned it to better capture the opportunity presented by the more difficult status of competing equity and debt markets. On February 28, 2024 the GBR joint venture entered into a new US$30 million royalty investment with Apex Clean Energy (""Apex"") related to Apex's 195 MWac Angelo Solar project in Texas which is anticipated to achieve commercial operations in May and will begin generating revenue later this year. Altius recorded its first lithium royalty revenue on the Grota do Cirilo asset this year, with two others (Tres Quebradas and Mariana) expected to start production in 2024. Lithium Royalty Corporation, of which Altius is a minority shareholder, also completed an IPO during the year and added significant liquidity that it has been successfully turning into new royalties as lithium market deployment conditions have become more attractive. Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $56.2 million or $1.18 per share(1) during 2023 compares to $89.7 million or $1.97 per share during the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $11.0 million or $0.23 per share, which compares to adjusted EBITDA of $18.0 million or $0.38 per share in Q4 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 74% versus 82% last year reflects lower revenue against relatively stable fixed costs.

Full year 2023 adjusted operating cash flow(1) of $37.3 million or $0.78 per share(1) compares to $75.9 million or $1.65 per share in 2022. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 million or $0.16 per share compared to $19.2 million or $0.40 per share in Q4 2022.

Dividend Declaration The Corporation’s board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share. The current quarterly dividend is payable to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2024. The dividend is expected to be paid on or about April 01, 2024. This dividend is eligible for payment in common shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) available to shareholders who are Canadian residents or residents of countries outside the United States. In order to be eligible to participate in respect of the April 01, 2024 dividend, non-registered shareholders must provide instruction to their brokerage and registered shareholders must provide completed enrollment forms to the transfer agent by March 11, 2024, five business days prior to record date. Stock market purchases made under the DRIP for the April 01, 2024 payment will be satisfied by issuance from treasury at the 5 day volume weighted average price ending at the close of trading the day before payment date. Shareholders who have already provided instruction to be enrolled previously will continue to be enrolled unless they direct otherwise. For more information, please see Altius Minerals Corporation Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Participation in the DRIP is optional and will not impact any cash dividends payable to shareholders who do not elect to participate in the DRIP. The declaration, timing and payment of future dividends will largely depend on the Corporation’s financial results as well as other factors. Dividends paid by Altius on its common shares are eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes unless otherwise stated.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Cummins Inc.'s final exchange ratio for its split-off exchange offer is a significant event for both Cummins and its shareholders. The specificity of the exchange ratio at 12.0298 shares of Atmus Filtration Technologies for each share of Cummins indicates a well-structured plan to divest from Atmus. The anticipated acceptance of approximately 5,574,051 shares of Cummins stock for exchange, contingent on full subscription, highlights the scale of the transaction.Investors should be aware of the proration clause, which could affect the final number of shares exchanged if the offer is oversubscribed. This is a common practice in such transactions to ensure equitable treatment of shareholders. The involvement of reputable financial institutions, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as dealer managers may instill confidence in the process and could potentially impact Cummins' stock performance in the short-term, as the market reacts to the final terms of the offer. Market Research Analyst The strategic decision for a split-off exchange offer by Cummins reflects a move to streamline its business operations and focus on its core competencies. This transaction could signal a shift in Cummins' business strategy that might affect its market position. By divesting Atmus, Cummins could be aiming to unlock value for its shareholders and improve its financial metrics.From a market perspective, the success of the exchange offer and the subsequent performance of Atmus as an independent entity will be closely watched. The performance of Atmus post-split-off could provide insights into the filtration technology market and Cummins' valuation of this business unit. The long-term impact on Cummins' stock will depend on how the capital freed from this transaction is utilized and whether it leads to improved profitability and growth prospects. Economist The timing and conditions of the exchange offer, set to expire in March 2024, suggest Cummins is making a calculated move within a specific economic context. The decision to engage in a split-off could be a response to macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates and corporate tax implications, which could influence the timing and attractiveness of such offers.Furthermore, the exchange offer may have broader economic implications, potentially affecting employment, investment in research and development and the competitive landscape within the industry. The reallocation of resources as a result of this corporate restructuring could lead to more efficient capital distribution within the company and the market at large, which in turn could influence Cummins' economic footprint and its contribution to industrial sector growth. 03/11/2024 - 05:15 PM COLUMBUS, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Cummins Inc.

Hesai Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Unaudited Financial Results,2024-03-11T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Hesai Group (HSAI) reports strong financial performance with a 56.1% increase in full-year 2023 net revenues and a 176.1% rise in total lidar shipments. Despite positive results, the company faces challenges due to being added to the U.S. Department of Defense's list of 'Chinese Military Companies'.","Hesai Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Unaudited Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Hesai Group (HSAI) reports strong financial performance with a 56.1% increase in full-year 2023 net revenues and a 176.1% rise in total lidar shipments. Despite positive results, the company faces challenges due to being added to the U.S. Department of Defense's list of 'Chinese Military Companies'. Positive Hesai Group achieved record-high net revenues of RMB1,877.0 million (US$264.4 million) in full-year 2023, marking a significant 56.1% increase year-over-year. Total lidar shipments for the full year of 2023 reached 222,116 units, showing a remarkable 176.1% increase from the previous year. Q4 2023 saw a substantial increase in ADAS lidar shipments, reaching 80,428 units, a notable 85.5% growth compared to the same period in 2022. Hesai's Co-Founder and CEO, Yifan 'David' Li, highlighted the company's strong performance and market leadership, emphasizing the growing adoption of lidar in the automotive industry. Despite positive results, Hesai faced challenges as it was added to the U.S. Department of Defense's list of 'Chinese Military Companies', impacting the company's reputation and share price negatively. Negative Hesai's first quarter revenues for 2024 are expected to decrease due to a slowdown in the robotaxi business and seasonal effects in China's automotive industry. The company's share price fell by 30% after being added to the U.S. Department of Defense's list of 'Chinese Military Companies', affecting its business opportunities. Hesai's transition from autonomous-mobility-led revenues to ADAS-led revenues in 2024 might pose challenges in maintaining growth and market share. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in quarterly net revenues and lidar shipments by Hesai Group indicates a robust expansion in the lidar market. The significant year-over-year growth in shipments and revenues suggests that the demand for lidar technology, particularly in the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous mobility sectors, is on the rise. This growth trajectory is emblematic of the broader trend in the automotive industry towards increased safety features and the progression towards autonomous driving capabilities.From a market perspective, Hesai's ability to maintain a solid blended gross margin and achieve positive operating cash flow is noteworthy. It reflects operational efficiency and financial discipline, which are critical for sustaining growth in a competitive industry. The emphasis on ADAS-led revenues transitioning from autonomous mobility is indicative of the strategic realignment towards more commercially viable and scalable market segments.It is also important to consider the potential market saturation and competitive pressures as lidar becomes more accessible in lower-priced vehicles. As lidar technology becomes a standard feature in a broader range of vehicles, companies like Hesai may face challenges in maintaining their market share and profitability. Financial Analyst The financial results of Hesai Group reflect a strong performance with a 56.1% increase in net revenues and a 176.1% increase in lidar shipments for the full year. These figures surpass industry norms for growth rates, highlighting Hesai's competitive edge. The company's status as the first in the automotive lidar industry to exceed 300,000 cumulative shipments is a testament to its market leadership and operational capabilities.However, the designation of Hesai as a 'Chinese Military Company' by the U.S. Department of Defense and the subsequent 30% drop in share price represent significant risks to investor sentiment and the company's valuation. The market's reaction to such geopolitical tensions can have a material impact on Hesai's stock performance and investor confidence. Investors should closely monitor the legal developments and the company's ability to mitigate these risks.Looking ahead, the projection of a threefold quarter-over-quarter increase in lidar shipments for the second quarter of 2024, based on customer order forecasts, could signal a substantial revenue boost. However, this optimism must be tempered with caution, as such forecasts are contingent upon the successful execution of customer orders and the absence of external market disruptions. Legal Expert The legal challenges faced by Hesai Group due to its addition to the U.S. Department of Defense's 1260H list could have far-reaching implications. The company's assertion of its products being designed for civilian commercial use only and its independence from governmental ownership or control are central to its legal defense. The outcome of this dispute will likely influence Hesai's ability to operate in international markets and maintain its reputation.The legal uncertainty surrounding the 1260H designation may also affect the company's business relationships and future contracts, particularly in the U.S. It's important for stakeholders to understand the potential for supply chain disruptions and the loss of business opportunities that could arise from this designation. The company's proactive approach to challenging the designation through legal channels is critical in seeking to mitigate these risks. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM Quarterly net revenues were RMB561.2 million (US$79.0 million),1 an increase of 37.1% year-over-yearQuarterly lidar shipments were 87,7362 units, an increase of 84.6% year-over-yearFull Year 2023 net revenues were RMB1,877.0 million (US$264.4 million), an increase of 56.1% year-over-yearFull Year 2023 lidar shipments were 222,116 units, an increase of 176.1% year-over-year SHANGHAI, China, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hesai Group (“Hesai” or the “Company”), (NASDAQ: HSAI), the global leader in three-dimensional light detection and ranging (lidar) solutions, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023. Operational Highlights Three months endedDecember 31, 2023 Full Year2023ADAS lidar shipments80,428 194,910Autonomous Mobility lidar shipments7,308 27,206Total lidar shipments87,736 222,116 Q4 2023 ADAS lidar shipments were 80,428 units, representing an increase of 85.5% from 43,351 units in the corresponding period of 2022.Q4 2023 Total lidar shipments were 87,736 units, representing an increase of 84.6% from 47,515 units in the corresponding period of 2022.ADAS lidar shipments in the full year of 2023 were 194,910 units, representing an increase of 214.8% from 61,918 units in the corresponding period of 2022.Total lidar shipments in the full year of 2023 were 222,116 units, representing an increase of 176.1% from 80,462 units in the corresponding period of 2022. Management Remarks “2023 was another record year for Hesai as we continued to substantially outperform our lidar peers and extend our leading market share. We delivered stellar full-year financial and operational results, including robust revenue growth, soaring shipments and solid blended gross margin, all surpassing our prior expectations. Furthermore, we achieved positive operating cash flow, being the only company in the lidar industry to reach that mark,” said Yifan “David” Li, Hesai’s Co-Founder and CEO. “The EV revolution is in full swing, reaching a key inflection point for ADAS and lidar adoption. Hesai is at the forefront of this rapid transformation. As the industry advances toward L2+/L3 autonomous driving systems, OEMs are eager to distinguish themselves through intelligent navigation on autopilot (NOA) functions and consumers are increasingly recognizing lidar as an indispensable safety feature, similar to airbags. Meanwhile, the widening accessibility of lidar across more affordable price categories, encompassing vehicles even priced near the RMB150,000 range, presents a transformative opportunity for us, unveiling a potential mass market 10-20 times larger than the previously served premium sector only. These catalysts significantly contribute to the accelerated adoption of lidar in the automotive industry. With market-leading lidar technologies and strategic partnerships worldwide, Hesai is poised to capitalize on the evolution of intelligent driving, reducing accidents, saving lives and creating a safer global transportation system.” Dr. Li continued, “In a very disappointing external development, on January 31, 2024 the U.S. Department of Defense added Hesai to its 1260H list of ‘Chinese Military Companies’ without any explanation or justification. This action appears to be an outcome of a year-long media smear campaign and intense Capitol Hill lobbying effort by certain of our competitors, who have been steadily losing market share to Hesai due to our products’ superior performance and quality. We firmly believe this designation is unjust and capricious and are actively challenging it through legal channels. Our lidars are designed for civilian commercial use only. They do not meet military specifications and they are incapable of collecting or transmitting surveillance data. Furthermore, Hesai operates independently of governmental ownership or control of any country, including China. Despite these facts, this designation has significantly harmed our reputation, impeded certain business opportunities, and hurt our share price, which fell 30% after the 1260H designation. Nevertheless, we remain undaunted in our commitment to advancing the global lidar industry and reducing traffic fatalities.” Louis T. Hsieh, Hesai’s Global CFO, added, “We achieved unprecedented milestones in 2023, affirming and extending our leadership of the global lidar market. For 2023, we delivered record-high net revenues of RMB1,877.0 million (US$264.4 million), an impressive increase of 56.1% from the previous year. Meanwhile, we achieved a full-year blended gross margin of 35.2% and delivered positive operating cash flow for the first year. Our 2023 total lidar shipments topped 222,000, up 176.1% year-over-year, and our cumulative lidar shipments exceeded 300,000 units, making Hesai the first automotive lidar company to hit this milestone.” Mr. Hsieh continued, “Entering 2024, we expect lower first quarter revenues reflecting a significant slowdown in our robotaxi business compared to last year and the traditional seasonal pull-forward effect to the fourth quarter in China’s automotive industry, as well as the temporary decrease in demand during the two-week Chinese New Year holiday in February. As ADAS lidar shipments accelerate, our revenue mix will transition from autonomous-mobility-led (including robotaxi and industrial robotics) to ADAS-led in 2024. ADAS revenues are projected to increase from below 40% of our revenues in 2023 to approximately 60% in 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be the transitioning quarter with steady growth in robotics and strong growth in ADAS, where we are targeting shipment of 50,000 lidars for the quarter, an approximately 50% increase over last year, accompanied by a drop in robotaxi contribution. Thereafter, our outlook for 2024 is highly optimistic, driven by the addition of 13 SOP vehicle models and 6 SOP ADAS OEM customers in the second quarter of 2024 based on our customers’ order forecasts. We believe this will lead to an approximate 3x quarter-over-quarter increase in total lidar shipments, or about 150,000 units, in the second quarter of 2024. We expect the third and fourth quarters orders to jump even further to about 200,000 units per quarter, a 4x increase from our expected first quarter shipments. By the end of 2024, we expect to be SOP with 12 ADAS OEMs covering approximately 40 vehicle models. Our revenue guidance for full-year 2024 stands firm in the range of USD$400-450 million, an increase of 50-70% year-over-year.” Business Developments Business Updates: Global: Selected by two top global automotive OEMs to provide ADAS lidars for their new EV model series production programs.Currently engaged in 13 RFI/RFQ discussions with 9 leading global OEMs from North America, Europe, and Asia ex-China. Domestic: Expanded collaboration with one of the world's largest EV manufacturers, based in China, which encompasses a new lineup of vehicle models set to debut starting in 2024.Recently selected by Li Auto as the exclusive lidar provider for their MEGA MPV platform. Li Auto also made ADAS standard equipment on their popular L7 and L8 Pro versions, immediately adding hundreds of thousands of lidar units to Hesai’s growing order book.Recently deepened cooperation and forged strategic partnerships with Great Wall Motor, one of China's largest auto brands, and Leapmotor, who has recently formed a joint venture with Stellantis, including joint research and the integration of a variety of lidars into their vehicle models, with SOP scheduled in 2024. The Company has secured ADAS design wins with 16 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers globally across more than 60 vehicle models. Product Updates: Announced next-generation flagship product, the AT512 ultra-long-range ADAS lidar, boasting industry-record performance across every key metric including a detection range of over 300 meters at 10% reflectivity and image quality with a point rate of 12.3 million points per second. AT512 is expected to commence mass production in 2025. Also, the Company’s groundbreaking ultra-thin long-range in-cabin lidar, ET25, won the prestigious 2024 Innovation Award at CES in Las Vegas.

As explained in the management remarks, the decrease in first-quarter revenues is primarily attributable to the slow down in the robotaxi business compared to last year. With expected strong demand from ADAS and sustained growth in robotics revenues, we project a return to robust revenue growth in the second quarter and the remainder of 2024.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this release. Hesai believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses and deemed dividends that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. Hesai believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Hesai's historical performance and liquidity. Hesai believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP measures is that they exclude share-based compensation expenses and deemed dividends that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.

Everspin Technologies Submits Application for U.S. CHIPS and Science Act Funding,2024-03-11T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,Everspin Technologies Inc. (MRAM) has applied for the CHIPS Incentives Program to increase MRAM capacity and R&D IP capability. The potential funding from the CHIPS Act will empower Everspin to advance MRAM technology and strengthen its position in the semiconductor landscape.,"Everspin Technologies Submits Application for U.S. CHIPS and Science Act Funding Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Everspin Technologies Inc. (MRAM) has applied for the CHIPS Incentives Program to increase MRAM capacity and R&D IP capability. The potential funding from the CHIPS Act will empower Everspin to advance MRAM technology and strengthen its position in the semiconductor landscape. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Applying for the CHIPS Incentives Program indicates Everspin Technologies Inc.'s strategic move to expand its manufacturing capabilities and R&D efforts in the MRAM sector. This could potentially increase the company's market share and competitive edge in the semiconductor industry, which is experiencing growing demand for non-volatile memory solutions. MRAM, being faster and more durable than traditional memory types, positions Everspin favorably within the tech industry's ongoing evolution towards more efficient and reliable memory technologies.The application's success could lead to increased investor confidence, potentially reflected in stock price appreciation. However, the uncertainty of the funding approval process and the time frame for capacity expansion means that any potential financial impact is not immediate and would materialize over the long term. Stakeholders should monitor the company's progress with the CHIPS Incentives Program as it will be a critical factor in Everspin's ability to scale operations and innovate. Financial Analyst The announcement by Everspin Technologies Inc. regarding the CHIPS Incentives Program application may have significant implications for its financial health. If approved, the funding could alleviate capital expenditure requirements for expanding the 200mm MRAM capacity, thus potentially improving the company's balance sheet and reducing the need for external financing. Additionally, bolstering R&D capabilities could lead to the development of new MRAM technologies, which might result in future revenue streams and strengthening of intellectual property assets.Investors should consider the potential for increased operational efficiency and reduced costs associated with the expansion of in-house production capabilities. However, it's important to analyze the company's current financials against the backdrop of this potential investment to understand the full scope of its impact on profitability and earnings per share. Semiconductor Industry Expert The application for the CHIPS Incentives Program by Everspin Technologies Inc. is a significant step in the context of the U.S. government's efforts to bolster domestic semiconductor production. The CHIPS for America initiative is designed to support the semiconductor industry, which is critical for national security and economic competitiveness. Everspin's focus on MRAM technology, which is pivotal for applications requiring high-speed and energy-efficient memory, such as in automotive and industrial markets, aligns with the broader industry trend towards advanced memory solutions.Understanding the technical aspects of MRAM, such as Toggle and STT-MRAM, is crucial. Toggle MRAM is known for its durability and high-endurance, while STT-MRAM offers high density and low power consumption, making them suitable for different applications. Everspin's potential capacity expansion in these areas could meet the increasing demand for specialized memory technologies and enhance its role in the global semiconductor supply chain. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM CHANDLER, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Everspin Technologies Inc., (NASDAQ: MRAM), the market leader and singular domestic volume producer of MRAM, announced it has applied for the CHIPS Incentives Program, which is part of CHIPS for America, with a full application submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The submitted application is for additional 200mm MRAM capacity and will increase long term R&D IP capability. “We are pleased to announce that we have recently submitted our proposal for the CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting our dedication to advancing MRAM technology. While the exact timing of the decision remains uncertain, we approach it with optimism, believing that the potential funding will further empower Everspin to contribute significantly to the semiconductor landscape,” said Sanjeev Aggarwal, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The potential funding from the CHIPS Act will be instrumental in further enhancing our capabilities, particularly in expanding our 200mm Toggle and STT-MRAM capacity. As we continue to pursue additional grant opportunities, we are optimistic that these initiatives will help fuel our growth and strengthen Everspin's position as a leader in MRAM technology.” About Everspin Technologies Everspin Technologies, Inc. is the world’s leading provider of Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM).

Prominent clients like Truth Social and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign endorse Rumble Cloud for its neutrality and affordability. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Rumble Cloud by Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM) represents a strategic move in the cloud services industry, which is currently dominated by a few major players, namely Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The claim of offering cost-effective solutions and predictable pricing is particularly significant as it addresses a common pain point for businesses: the complexity and unpredictability of cloud service costs.Furthermore, Rumble's positioning as a champion of a free and open internet is designed to appeal to businesses and organizations that prioritize independence from the perceived control exerted by the current market leaders. By attracting high-profile clients such as Truth Social and the campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Rumble Cloud is signaling not just its technical capabilities but also its alignment with certain values and ideologies. This could potentially carve out a niche market segment that feels underserved by the existing cloud infrastructure options.The success of such a venture will hinge on Rumble Cloud's ability to deliver on its promises of performance and reliability, which are non-negotiable in the cloud industry. Should Rumble Cloud gain traction, it could introduce competitive pressures on pricing and service offerings across the market, benefiting consumers but potentially squeezing margins for established players. Financial Analyst Rumble's public launch of its Rumble Cloud service marks a pivotal moment for the company's financial outlook. The move diversifies Rumble's revenue streams beyond its video-sharing platform and positions it within the lucrative cloud computing market. As investors assess Rumble's stock (NASDAQ: RUM), they will likely focus on the company's ability to scale its infrastructure and attract a broader customer base.Given the fixed-price 'Resource Tiers' model, Rumble is attempting to disrupt the traditional consumption-based billing, which might appeal to organizations with variable cloud compute needs. This pricing strategy could potentially lead to more stable and predictable revenue for Rumble, assuming they can manage their cost structure effectively. However, investors should monitor the company's capital expenditures and operating costs closely, as the infrastructure to support such a service is typically capital intensive.The announcement may have immediate effects on Rumble's stock price, as markets react to the potential for increased revenue and market share. Long-term value, however, will depend on the company's execution and ability to maintain service quality while scaling. Technology Industry Analyst Rumble's entry into the cloud services market with Rumble Cloud is a notable development considering the technical and competitive aspects of the industry. The offering of virtual machines, Kubernetes orchestration and storage solutions indicates that Rumble is targeting core infrastructure needs, which are fundamental services for many businesses.The emphasis on network speed and quality is crucial, as these are key performance indicators for cloud service providers. Rumble's ability to compete on these fronts will be critical to its success. Moreover, the company's bet on disrupting the market through pricing strategies is ambitious, given the significant economies of scale enjoyed by the incumbents. The oligopolistic nature of the current cloud market means that Rumble will need to offer substantial differentiators beyond cost savings to gain significant market share.An important aspect to watch will be Rumble Cloud's adoption rate and how it scales its customer support and service reliability to match the growth. The technical prowess of the service, as well as the security and privacy assurances, will be under scrutiny, especially given the company's mission to protect a free and open internet. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM Rumble CloudTM offers the first cost-effective opportunity for businesses to run on a scaled infrastructure secured by a mission to protect a free and open internet.LONGBOAT KEY, Fla., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM), the video-sharing platform and cloud services provider, announced today the public launch of Rumble Cloud, a new infrastructure as a service offering that champions the free and open internet. Rumble Cloud is designed to empower businesses to become independent from incumbent hyperscalers’ unfair pricing, vendor lock-in strategies, and censorship. Rumble Cloud, which provides the backbone for rumble.com, includes a portfolio of essential cloud computing services, available by self-service, including virtual machines and Kubernetes orchestration, block and object storage, load balancers, and a virtual private cloud option. Rumble Cloud’s vision is to provide the most predictable and affordable pricing in the market to allow businesses to regain control of their IT budgets. To that end, ‘Resource Tiers’ for compute resources offer monthly plans at a fixed price with unlimited usage to combat the price predictability pain points that are commonly felt with a consumption-based model. By providing an independent and neutral alternative to Big Tech, Rumble Cloud has already attracted prominent clients through its successful beta program, including Truth Social, which surged to number one in the Apple App Store last year while hosted on Rumble Cloud. “Rumble Cloud is essential in today’s market,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and Technology Group. “A trusted partner since day one, Rumble Cloud’s incredible service and unrivaled performance have paved the way for Truth Social’s rapid growth,” he continued. Another high-profile Rumble Cloud customer is the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. According to campaign manager Amaryllis Kennedy, “Partisanship and censorship are threats to uniting the country. In almost every aspect of the campaign, we ask ourselves how do we make choices that are the most inclusive and neutral so that everyone feels welcome. This includes our choices of business services to run the campaign. The new Rumble Cloud provides a neutral and independent cloud infrastructure to run our essential campaign applications, free of Big Tech and government censorship.” “The cloud market is desperate for real competition that isn't controlled by an oligopoly. Our cloud will bring top network speed and quality, but most importantly, we plan to disrupt the market with our pricing strategy,” said Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski. “Just as our video platform has taken market share away from YouTube, we plan to do the exact same in the cloud market that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have cornered,” he added.

The Funds' monthly distributions for BGB are $0.093 per share, with Ex-Dates on March 20, 2024, April 22, 2024, and May 22, 2024.

The dynamic distribution strategy aims to maintain portfolio credit quality in changing market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Blackstone Liquid Credit Strategies LLC regarding the monthly distributions for their closed-end funds represents a pivotal data point for current and potential investors. The distributions, which are a measure of the funds' performance, directly affect investor income and can influence investor sentiment. The variability of these distributions, as indicated, suggests a responsive strategy to market conditions, which can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it may reflect a prudent management approach that seeks to preserve capital during downturns. On the other, it could lead to investor uncertainty if distributions fluctuate widely.Analyzing the disclosed distribution amounts, one can infer that the funds are currently generating sufficient income to support these payments. However, investors should be aware that a portion of the distribution could be a return of capital, which is not derived from the fund's earnings but from the invested capital itself. This could potentially erode the fund's asset base if it becomes a regular practice.It is also worth noting the size of Blackstone Credit & Insurance's assets under management (AUM), which at $319 billion, positions it as a significant player in the credit market. This scale can provide diversification benefits but also necessitates careful monitoring of the credit quality within their portfolios, especially during economic shifts. Tax Expert The tax implications of the distributions from Blackstone's funds are noteworthy for investors. The final determination of the source of these distributions, whether from net investment income or capital gains, will be made after the fund's fiscal year end. This classification affects how investors will report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The issuance of Form 1099-DIV will provide clarity, but until then, investors are in a state of uncertainty regarding the tax efficiency of their investments.Investors should consult with their tax advisors to understand the potential tax consequences of these distributions, as different sources of income are taxed at varying rates. For example, long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, which could be advantageous for investors. Conversely, a return of capital is not taxed immediately but reduces the investor's cost basis, potentially leading to higher capital gains taxes in the future. Market Research Analyst The strategic approach of Blackstone Credit to dynamically adjust monthly distributions based on the average monthly net income is indicative of a broader industry trend towards flexible distribution policies. This flexibility can be attractive to investors who prefer investment vehicles that can adapt to changing economic landscapes. However, it also places an emphasis on the quality of Blackstone's credit analysis and portfolio management capabilities.Given the size of Blackstone's AUM in the credit segment, the performance of these funds can serve as a barometer for the health of the corporate credit market. The funds' ability to maintain distributions, or the necessity to adjust them, may reflect wider credit market conditions. This is especially relevant in a market that has experienced volatility in recent years due to geopolitical tensions, changes in interest rates and pandemic-related disruptions.Investors may consider the funds' distribution policies as a factor in their investment decisions, weighing the potential for income against the risks associated with credit investments. The announcement of monthly distributions can thus have a material impact on investor perception and the funds' market performance. 03/11/2024 - 04:45 PM NEW YORK, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackstone Liquid Credit Strategies LLC, an affiliate of Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP (collectively, and together with their affiliates in the credit-focused business of Blackstone, Inc., ""Blackstone Credit & Insurance""), announced monthly distributions for the three listed closed-end funds it advises, Blackstone Senior Floating Rate 2027 Term Fund (NYSE: BSL), Blackstone Long-Short Credit Income Fund (NYSE: BGX), and Blackstone Strategic Credit 2027 Term Fund (NYSE: BGB) (each a ""Fund"" and together the ""Funds""). The Funds' monthly distributions are set forth below. The following dates apply to the distribution declarations for the Funds: Ticker Fund Monthly Distribution Per Share BSL Senior Floating Rate 2027 Term Fund $ 0.114 BGX Long-Short Credit Income Fund $ 0.105 BGB Strategic Credit 2027 Term Fund $ 0.093 Ex-Date: March 20, 2024 April 22, 2024 May 22, 2024 Record Date: March 21, 2024 April 23, 2024 May 23, 2024 Payable Date: March 28, 2024 April 30, 2024 May 31, 2024 The Funds declare a set of monthly distributions each quarter in amounts closely tied to the respective Fund's recent average monthly net income. As a result, the monthly distribution amounts for the Funds typically vary quarter-to-quarter, and shareholders of any Fund should not expect that Fund to continue to pay distributions in the same amounts shown above. The dynamic distribution strategy provides Blackstone Credit with greater flexibility to maintain portfolio credit quality in varying market conditions. In addition, the dynamic distribution strategy reduces the need to retain reserves from net investment income to support the stability of future distributions. A portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net investment income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain, or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of these distributions will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and will be made after the Fund's year end. Each Fund will send to investors a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders: • Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC™): Our lead cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure. The BRTX-100 production process utilizes proprietary technology and involves collecting a patient’s bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, BRTX-100 is to be injected by a physician into the patient’s damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain arising from degenerative disc disease. • Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing a cell-based therapy candidate to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in animals may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

The company aims to bring transformational medicines for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with top-line data expected for various trials by 2024 and 2025. Positive Strong cash position with $417 million in cash and investments by year end 2023. Ongoing enrollment in global Phase 2b trials for ANB032 in atopic dermatitis, rosnilimab in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Anticipated top-line data readouts for ANB032 Phase 2b trial in atopic dermatitis by year end 2024 and for rosnilimab Phase 2b trial in rheumatoid arthritis by mid 2025. Plans to move ANB033 and ANB101 into the clinic with IND filings expected in 2024. Acquisition of rights to ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, to expand the portfolio. Positive results from GEMINI-1 Phase 3 trial of imsidolimab in generalized pustular psoriasis. Updates on GSK Immuno-Oncology Financial Collaboration with anticipated top-line data in 2024 from COSTAR Lung and FIRST Phase 3 trials. Net loss of $42.2 million for Q4 2023 and $163.6 million for the full year 2023. Negative Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments from 2022 to 2023. Increase in research and development expenses for rosnilimab, ANB032, and ANB033. Significant net loss reported for Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Financial Analyst When evaluating AnaptysBio's recent financial report, the decrease in cash and investments from $584.2 million to $417.9 million is notable. This reduction reflects the company's investment in its product pipeline, including ongoing clinical trials and the acquisition of new compounds. The reported increase in collaboration revenue, primarily from Jemperli royalties, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its developments. However, the increased R&D expenses, which rose significantly from the previous year, underscore the company's aggressive investment in its pipeline. This strategy is indicative of a long-term growth focus but does carry inherent risks, as substantial resources are allocated to clinical trial outcomes that are uncertain. The net loss figures also widened year-over-year, which may raise concerns among investors about the company's profitability trajectory. Medical Research Analyst AnaptysBio's pipeline progress is of particular interest, with multiple Phase 2 trials for ANB032 and rosnilimab underway. The company's focus on immune cell modulators (ICMs) to address autoimmune and inflammatory diseases positions it within a high-need medical area. The anticipated top-line data readouts for these trials by the end of 2024 and mid-2025 could be significant catalysts for the company's valuation. The therapeutic areas targeted, including atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, represent markets with substantial patient populations and unmet medical needs. The successful development of these compounds could lead to considerable market penetration and revenue generation. However, the complexity of these diseases and the competitive landscape must be considered, as these factors can influence the clinical trial outcomes and the potential for regulatory approval and market success. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The strategic decision by AnaptysBio to out-license imsidolimab following positive Phase 3 trial results reflects a calculated move to leverage external expertise and resources for commercialization. This approach allows the company to focus on its core pipeline while potentially benefiting from milestone payments and royalties. The exclusive licensing of ANB101 from Centessa Pharmaceuticals, along with the rights to ANB102, indicates a deliberate expansion of their portfolio with a one-time upfront payment that aligns with their financial strategy. The potential of ANB101 to enable less frequent dosing could offer a competitive advantage in patient compliance and market differentiation. The company's financial collaboration with GSK on immuno-oncology programs, with anticipated data in the near term, further diversifies AnaptysBio's potential revenue streams and mitigates some of the risks associated with its own pipeline's clinical outcomes. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM Enrollment ongoing for global Phase 2b trial to treat atopic dermatitis (AD) with ANB032, our BTLA agonist, with top-line data anticipated by year-end 2024Enrollment ongoing for global Phase 2b trial to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and global Phase 2 trial to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) with rosnilimab, our PD-1 agonist, with top-line data anticipated by mid 2025 and H1 2026, respectivelyIND filings for ANB033 (anti-CD122 antagonist) and ANB101 (BDCA2 modulator) anticipated Q2 2024 and H2 2024, respectivelyYear end 2023 cash and investments of $417 million and reiterating cash runway through year-end 2026 SAN DIEGO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AnaptysBio, Inc.

(AMK) reported strong results in its 'AssetMark Monthly Knowledge' Report for February 2024. Platform assets reached $113.3 billion, up 20.1% YoY. Net flows increased by 6.9% YoY to $577 million. However, client cash decreased by 13.0% YoY to $2.89 billion. The number of households grew by 5.4% YoY to 255,908. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in platform assets by 20.1% year-over-year for AssetMark Financial Holdings signifies a robust expansion in the company's asset base, indicative of a growing trust and investment from clients. This growth trajectory can have positive implications for the company's revenue stream, as higher assets under management (AUM) often correlate with increased management fees, potentially boosting the company's profitability. However, the reported decline in client cash by 13.0% year-over-year could suggest a shift in client behavior, possibly indicating a move towards investment in higher-yielding assets or a response to changing interest rates.It is also worth noting the modest year-over-year increase in net flows of 6.9%, which reflects the net balance of money moving in and out of the company's platform. This figure, while positive, is relatively modest and warrants attention to ensure that it aligns with industry growth rates. The slight decrease in the number of households in the short term is not necessarily a red flag but should be monitored for trends that could affect future net flows and revenue.Investors should interpret these metrics with caution, as monthly data can be volatile and subject to revisions. The upcoming quarterly and annual reports will provide a more comprehensive view of the company's financial health and performance. Market Research Analyst The data provided by AssetMark highlights a significant year-over-year growth in platform assets, which could be a reflection of broader market trends or successful company-specific strategies such as effective marketing and client acquisition. The increase in the number of households served by AssetMark, albeit at a slower pace, suggests a steady market penetration and client base growth. This is a vital metric for assessing the company's market position and potential for future expansion.However, the static client cash levels over the past month and the year-over-year decrease may indicate a shift in investment strategy or client preference, which could have implications for the company's cash management services and interest revenue. It's crucial to understand the factors driving these changes, as they may affect the company's strategic direction and product offerings.Given the competitive nature of the financial services industry, AssetMark's performance must be benchmarked against peers to evaluate its market competitiveness. Any deviations from industry norms could signal strategic opportunities or challenges that the company may need to address. Economist In the context of the broader economic environment, AssetMark's reported asset growth could be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and stock market performance. The increase in platform assets suggests that the company may be benefiting from an overall positive investment climate or effective asset accumulation strategies. Conversely, the decrease in client cash could be a response to low interest rates, prompting clients to seek higher returns through other investment vehicles.The economic outlook and monetary policy will continue to play critical roles in shaping investor behavior. AssetMark's ability to navigate these macroeconomic conditions and adapt to shifts in client preferences will be crucial for sustaining growth. Moreover, the company's performance metrics should be analyzed against economic indicators to understand their relative performance and to anticipate future trends in asset management. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM CONCORD, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AssetMark Financial Holdings, Inc.

Announces Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary BRT Apartments Corp. (BRT) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on April 4, 2024. The company anticipates a substantial portion of 2024 dividends to be classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by BRT Apartments Corp. at $0.25 per share signals the company's current financial health and its ability to generate enough cash flow to return value to shareholders. Dividends are a tangible reflection of a company's profitability and management's confidence in its financial stability. The commitment to pay dividends can also be a positive signal to the market, potentially influencing the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors.However, the company's estimation that a significant portion of the dividends may be treated as a return of capital rather than earnings is an unusual situation. This implies that the company might not be generating sufficient taxable income and is returning capital to shareholders instead. This could indicate that the company's earnings are lower than its payout, which might be a red flag for investors looking for sustainable dividend policies. It's important to monitor the company's future earnings reports to assess the sustainability of its dividend payments. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the classification of dividends as a return of capital rather than ordinary income can have significant implications for investors. A return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the stock, which could defer taxes until the stock is sold. However, it does not provide the favorable tax treatment that qualified dividends enjoy. Investors may need to adjust their tax strategies accordingly.It is essential for investors to understand the tax treatment of their dividend income, as it affects their after-tax return on investment. The statement by BRT Apartments Corp. suggests that the company's current operations may not be generating significant taxable income, which could lead to a reassessment of the company's growth prospects and profitability. 03/11/2024 - 04:15 PM GREAT NECK, N.Y., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRT Apartments Corp.

BRT estimates that if it does not sell any multi-family properties this year, that a significant portion of its dividends to be paid in 2024 will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a return of capital.

Cango had repurchased 26.1 million ADSs with cash and settled transactions with institutional investors in January 2024. A conference call to discuss financial results will be held on March 11, 2024. Negative Total revenues saw a significant decrease in Q4 and full year 2023 compared to the previous year. Operating costs and expenses remained high in relation to total revenues. Net loss in Q4 2023 was substantial, impacting the company's financial performance. Impairment loss from goodwill in 2023 was RMB148.7 million, reflecting potential challenges. The company's forecast for Q1 2024 revenues indicates uncertainty in market conditions. Market Research Analyst The financial results of Cango Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a significant revenue decline year-over-year, with total revenues dropping from RMB487.1 million in Q4 2022 to RMB130.2 million in Q4 2023. This decrease reflects broader industry challenges and potentially signals a need for strategic reassessment. The automotive sector is highly sensitive to economic conditions and Cango's performance may be indicative of larger market trends, including decreased consumer confidence and intensified competition. The reduction in costs and expenses across various categories, such as sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, suggests that the company has implemented cost-saving measures to mitigate the revenue shortfall. However, the increased percentage of general and administrative expenses relative to total revenues raises questions about the scalability of current cost structures in the face of declining sales. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Cango's liquidity position, with an improved total balance of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, provides some cushion against short-term market fluctuations. However, the net loss reported for both the fourth quarter and the full year is concerning. The company's strategy to repurchase shares could be viewed as a move to consolidate value for shareholders, but it also reflects management's belief that the stock is undervalued. The forecast for Q1 2024 with expected revenues of RMB50 million to RMB100 million suggests a continuation of the downward trend, which could further impact investor sentiment. The repurchase of shares from institutional investors at what appears to be a premium could be a strategic move to consolidate ownership and signal confidence to the market, but it also uses liquidity that could be needed to navigate ongoing market challenges. Automotive Industry Analyst Cango's operational strategy, including the consolidation of their new and used car service platforms into 'Cango U-car', reflects an attempt to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in a challenging market. The automotive transaction service industry is rapidly evolving, with technology playing a key role in shaping consumer preferences and competitive dynamics. The shift towards a comprehensive service model, including vehicle appraisal, logistics and financing facilitation, indicates an effort to capture more value from each transaction. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in the face of declining revenues and market share will need to be closely monitored. Additionally, the plan to target overseas buyers for Chinese used cars opens new revenue streams but also introduces complexities related to international trade and market entry barriers. 03/11/2024 - 05:30 PM SHANGHAI, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (""Cango"" or the ""Company""), a leading automotive transaction service platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights Total revenues were RMB130.2 million (US$18.3 million), compared with RMB487.1 million in the same period of 2022. The total outstanding balance of financing transactions the Company facilitated was RMB10.0 billion (US$1.4 billion) as of December 31, 2023. M1+ and M3+ overdue ratios for all financing transactions that remained outstanding and were facilitated by the Company were 2.66% and 1.37%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, compared with 2.42% and 1.24%, respectively, as of September 30, 2023.Total balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash - current - bank deposits held for short-term investments were RMB 3.3 billion (US$ 468.4 million) as of December 31, 2023.

Car trading transactions revenues were RMB1.3 billion (US$184.5 million), or 77.0% of total revenues in the full year of 2023, compared with RMB1.6 billion in the full year of 2022.In 2023, the company seamlessly merged new car service platform ""Cango Haoche,"" into ""Cango U-car,"" a specialized platform for used car transaction, to optimize resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency. The upgraded ""Cango U-car"" APP covers historical vehicle condition reports, vehicle appraisal and inspection, logistics and delivery services, insurance and supply chain financing facilitation, etc.Mr. Jiayuan Lin, Chief Executive Officer of Cango, commented, ""2023 was a challenging year. Despite a long-term recovery trend, short-term influences resulted in a slower-than-expected recovery pace and depressed consumer confidence. In the automobile sector, intense competition hastened the survival of the fittest, transforming the industry landscape."" ""With keen insight into market conditions and industry trends, Cango strategically consolidated its two platforms, 'Cango Haoche' for new cars and 'Cango U-car' for used cars, into a single integrated 'Cango U-car' APP in 2023. Servicing as an online marketplace, 'Cango U-car' connects upstream vehicle suppliers, aftermarket service providers, and downstream small car dealers in lower-tier cities and provides comprehensive services across three major scenarios, including online auctions, dealer transaction facilitation, and deal assistance to brokers."" ""Our dynamic online marketplace featuring third-party and self-operated stores continues to drive progress across the platform. In the fourth quarter, the total number of upstream third-party seller stores on the platform reached 38, offering new cars, used cars, and traffic generation services. In the fourth quarter, 'Cango U-car' provided services to 3,499 small online car dealers and facilitated a total of 530 used car transactions."" ""Beyond 'Cango U-car', we plan to establish a preferred website for overseas buyers seeking Chinese used cars. Leveraging Cango's rich experience and market know-how, we established an interactive and export service website for used car information in March 2024, catering to auto dealers in emerging and developing countries to provide them with easy access to China's abundant automobile-related resources."" ""Moving into 2024, we will continue to leverage technology to broaden our presence across the domestic and international automotive value chain. With our comprehensive, end-to-end service model and efficient operations, we will explore business opportunities inside and outside of China,"" concluded Mr. Lin. Mr. Yongyi Zhang, Chief Financial Officer of Cango, stated, ""China's uneven economic recovery impacted our business throughout 2023. In addition to our integration of 'Cango Haoche' and 'Cango U-car', we implemented various cost optimization measures to address the automotive market's evolution. We are confident that our streamlined model and online marketplace will increase our competitiveness across the industry value chain. For 2024, we will continue refining and building 'Cango U-Car' while exploring international growth opportunities.""

Definition of Overdue Ratios The Company defines ""M1+ overdue ratio"" as (i) exposure at risk relating to financing transactions for which any installment payment is 30 to 179 calendar days past due as of a specified date, divided by (ii) exposure at risk relating to all financing transactions which remain outstanding as of such date, excluding amounts of outstanding principal that are 180 calendar days or more past due. The Company defines ""M3+ overdue ratio"" as (i) exposure at risk relating to financing transactions for which any installment payment is 90 to 179 calendar days past due as of a specified date, divided by (ii) exposure at risk relating to all financing transactions which remain outstanding as of such date, excluding amounts of outstanding principal that are 180 calendar days or more past due. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss), a Non-GAAP measure, as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the Non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company presents the Non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) enables the management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the use of the Non-GAAP measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This Non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss). Further, the Non-GAAP measure may differ from the Non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the Non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of Cango's Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.

Together, Ferroglobe and Coreshell expect to produce the first battery-ready metallurgical silicon for the development of low-cost, high-range EV batteries in compliance with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. The partnership will enable the leapfrogging of silane-based silicon and the replacement of graphite in EV batteries, which have bottlenecked the auto industry since the introduction of electric vehicles, creating cost and range limitations. Electric vehicles suffer from significant cost disadvantages for consumers and automakers alike, with batteries comprising 30-40% of the total cost of electric cars1. Car manufacturers are interested in using silicon in batteries because it can store up to 10 times more energy in the anodes than graphite. This could potentially result in a 30 percent increase in driving range. Coreshell’s proprietary battery technology, featuring a unique nanomaterial electrode coating, is the only proven solution to mitigate the degradation of micrometric silicon, preventing its rapid loss of life while still allowing lithium ions to pass through. Ferroglobe’s proprietary metallurgical purification process to produce up to 99.995% silicon is cost-effective and does not use any chemical reagent, a key technology for producing affordable silicon active material. These innovations enable, for the first time, the development of lithium-ion batteries with metallurgical silicon dominant anodes that meet product requirements for lifetime across a range of applications. “We believe battery-grade, micrometric silicon is the fastest path to decarbonizing the mobility industry,” said Benoist Ollivier, Chief Technology & Innovation Officer of Ferroglobe. “When the right battery technology partner and the leading supplier of silicon to the U.S. come together, breakthroughs can happen. Coreshell is a leading technology company that has been able to solve the raw metallurgical silicon degradation problem and unlock the true performance of this element. We are thrilled to partner with the battery material innovators at Coreshell and play our part in accelerating the transition to clean energy in the automotive industry for everyone.” “Silicon stores 10 times the energy of graphite and it is available in sufficient quantity and quality. It is the only viable pathway to low-cost, long-range electric vehicle batteries that can be scaled rapidly using a 100% domestic supply chain,” said Jonathan Tan, CEO of Coreshell. “The issue to date is that no one has been able to unlock the power of metallurgical silicon, and the high cost and scaling challenges of highly engineered or silane-based synthetic Silicon anodes have prevented the industry from benefiting from its true potential. With Ferroglobe’s silicon and Coreshell’s technology, we have unlocked that power. We are simplifying silicon and stripping out the costs so we can deliver the lowest cost, long range EV batteries in existence.” _______________1 IEA. Global Supply Chains of EV Batteries.

Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND) reported strong full-year 2023 results with total revenue of $296.0 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. The company achieved record sales volumes and expanded operations. However, lower sales volumes in Q4 2023 impacted financials. Despite this, Smart Sand expects improved results in Q1 2024. Positive Smart Sand achieved record sales volumes and revenue in 2023. The company expanded operations into the Canadian frac sand market and enhanced logistics capabilities in key basins. Net income for 2023 was $4.6 million, a significant improvement from a net loss in 2022. Positive free cash flow of $8.0 million for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $34.1 million in 2023 from $29.3 million in 2022. Negative Lower sales volumes in Q4 2023 impacted financial results negatively. Fourth quarter 2023 saw a net loss of $(4.8) million compared to net income in previous quarters. Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA decreased sequentially and year-over-year due to lower revenue. Negative free cash flow of $(9.6) million in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results indicate a significant year-over-year revenue increase for Smart Sand, Inc., signaling robust growth in the company's core business operations. The 16% rise in both total revenue and sand sales revenue reflects a strong market demand, particularly noting the expanded operational footprint in the Canadian market and enhanced logistics capabilities. This growth trajectory is underpinned by a 4% increase in total tons sold, which suggests efficient scaling of operations and potentially improved market share.From a financial health perspective, the positive free cash flow for the full year, despite a negative free cash flow in the fourth quarter, points to a solid underlying operational efficiency. However, the fourth quarter's negative cash flow and net loss raise concerns about seasonal volatility and its impact on liquidity. The company's ability to maintain a positive cash position, with $6.1 million in cash and $12.0 million in undrawn credit, provides a cushion against short-term headwinds and underscores a stable liquidity position. Market Research Analyst Smart Sand's expansion into the Canadian frac sand market and the operational enhancements in the Appalachian Basin are strategic moves that align with industry trends towards localized supply chains and integrated service offerings. The increase in industrial sand opportunities and expansion of last-mile services are particularly noteworthy, as these segments are critical in supporting the broader energy sector's drive for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.Despite the overall positive annual performance, the fourth-quarter slowdown due to seasonal weather and budget exhaustion among customers reflects the cyclical nature of the frac sand industry. The company's expectation of a rebound in sales volumes and improved financial results in the first quarter of 2024 suggests confidence in the industry's resilience and the potential for a rapid recovery from temporary downturns. Energy Sector Analyst The reported results provide insight into the frac sand and proppant market, which is closely tied to the energy sector, specifically oil and gas exploration and production activities. Smart Sand's performance, with record sales volumes, indicates an uptick in drilling activities, particularly in the operating basins served by the company. The strategic investments in cooling and blending capabilities, as well as the acquisition of rights to operate additional terminals, suggest a forward-looking approach to capitalizing on the anticipated growth in the energy sector.However, the fourth-quarter results reflect the inherent volatility in the energy industry, with external factors such as weather and customer budget cycles impacting operational performance. The disclosed net loss and reduced contribution margin during this period underscore the need for companies in this sector to maintain flexible operational strategies to navigate such fluctuations. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM 4Q 2023 and full year 2023 revenue of $61.9 million and $296.0 million, respectively.4Q 2023 and full year 2023 total tons sold of approximately 1,016,000 and 4,514,000, respectively.4Q 2023 and full year 2023 net cash (used) provided by operating activities of $(2.7) million and $31.0 million, respectively.4Q 2023 and full year 2023 free cash flow of $(9.6) million and $8.0 million, respectively.SPRING, Texas, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND) (the ""Company"" or ""Smart Sand""), a fully integrated frac and industrial sand supply and services company, a low-cost producer of high quality Northern White sand, and a proppant logistics solutions provider through both its in-basin transloading terminals and SmartSystems™ products and services, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""Smart Sand delivered strong operating and financial results for the full year 2023"" stated Charles Young, Smart Sand's Chief Executive Officer. ""Sales volumes for the year were a record for the Company. During the year we gained access to the Canadian frac sand market through the commencement of operations at our Blair, Wisconsin facility. We improved our logistics capabilities in the Marcellus and Utica formations of the Appalachian Basin by expanding our Waynesburg, Pennsylvania terminal . We invested in cooling and blending capabilities at our Utica, Illinois facility to support increased industrial sand opportunities and expanded our last mile service presence in the Bakken and Appalachian Basins. Additionally, we recently obtained the rights to operate two additional terminals in Northeast Ohio, which we believe will support growing activity in the Appalachian Basin."" ""Lower sales volumes, due primarily to seasonal weather-related issues and a general slowdown in overall market activity from lower customer spending due to year-end budget exhaustion, negatively impacted our operating and financial results in the fourth quarter. However, market activity has picked up considerably since the start of 2024 with current monthly sales volumes trending back to third quarter 2023 levels or better and we expect to see improved operating and financial results in the first quarter 2024."" Full Year 2023 Highlights Total revenue was $296.0 million for the full year 2023, compared to $255.7 million for the full year of 2022. Sand sales revenue in 2023 was $283.2 million compared to $243.2 million in 2022. Total revenue and sand sales both increased by 16% year-over-year, as a result of increased sand sales volumes and higher prices primarily driven by increased market activity in the operating basins that the Company serves. Total tons sold were 4,514,000 for the full year 2023, compared to full year 2022 total tons sold of 4,333,000, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Net income was $4.6 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, for the full year 2023, compared with net loss of $(0.7) million, or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the full year 2022. The increase in net income was primarily from increased total volumes sold and higher average sales prices for our sand. Net cash provided by operating activities was $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, derived from net income of $4.6 million, which includes net non-cash items of $27.8 million and $(1.4) million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was $5.4 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily due to higher net income and reduced use of cash from changes in assets and liabilities. Contribution margin was $67.0 million, or $14.85 per ton sold, for the full year 2023 compared to $54.6 million, or $12.61 per ton sold, for the full year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $34.1 million for the full year 2023 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $29.3 million for the full year 2022. The increase in contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in pricing and higher overall tons sold in the current period. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Total revenue was $61.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to third quarter of 2023 revenue of $76.9 million. Total revenue decreased 19% sequentially due to lower sand sales volumes and lower shortfall revenue. Fourth quarter 2023 total revenue decreased by 16% compared to fourth quarter 2022 revenues of $73.8 million. Lower revenue year-over-year was due primarily to lower tons sold. Tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2023 were 1,016,000, a 17% decrease compared to third quarter 2023 tons sold of 1,219,000. Tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 14% compared to 1,175,000 tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales volumes were lower in the current period due primarily to lower market activity from weather-related slowdowns and reduced customer spending as accelerated spending earlier in the year led to reduced activity in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company had a net loss of $(4.8) million, or $(0.12) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $6.7 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023, and net income of $2.6 million, or $0.06 per basic share and diluted share for the fourth quarter 2022. Contribution margin was $9.2 million, or $9.07 per ton sold, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $21.0 million, or $17.20 per ton sold, for the third quarter of 2023 and $17.4 million, or $14.77 per ton sold, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $10.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower net income, contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA sequentially and year-over-year were primarily due to lower revenue from decreased tons sold, partially offset by lower cost of goods sold. Capital and Liquidity For the full year 2023, we had positive free cash flow of $8.0 million, generating $31.0 million in cash flow from operations while spending $23.0 million on capital expenditures. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we had negative $9.6 million in free cash flow, spending $2.7 million in cash flow on operations and $6.9 million on capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $6.1 million and $12.0 million in undrawn availability on our existing credit facility.

Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of the Company's business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities. Historically, we have reported production costs and production cost per ton as non-GAAP financial measures. As we expand our logistics activities and continue to sell sand closer to the wellhead, our sand production costs will only be a portion of our overall cost structure. Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities;our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; andour debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the ABL Credit Facility.We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP.

(AHT) announced the sale of the Residence Inn in Salt Lake City for $19.2 million, reflecting a 4.6% capitalization rate on 2023 net operating income. The proceeds were used to pay down debt, with future updates on more asset sales expected. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The disposal of the Residence Inn in Salt Lake City by Ashford Hospitality Trust at a 4.6% capitalization rate post-adjustment for anticipated capital expenditures is a strategic move that can be interpreted as a positive signal to the market. The capitalization rate, or cap rate, is a key metric in real estate investment that indicates the return on investment assuming the property is paid for in cash. A cap rate of 4.6% is relatively low, which often suggests that the property is less risky or that it's located in a more desirable market. However, this figure must be compared against the average cap rates within the specific market segment of upper upscale hotels to gauge its attractiveness accurately.Turning to the financial implications, the 18.2x Hotel EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple pre-adjustment and 14.0x post-adjustment is indicative of the premium that Ashford Trust was able to command for this asset. EBITDA multiples provide insight into how many years it would take for the investment to pay for itself in profit, assuming no growth or decline. The use of all proceeds to pay down debt will likely improve the company's leverage ratios, potentially leading to a more favorable credit rating and reduced interest expense, which in turn could enhance shareholder value. Hospitality Industry Analyst The sale of the Residence Inn reflects a broader trend within the hospitality industry where REITs are optimizing their portfolios for better financial health and strategic positioning. The transaction allows Ashford Trust to reallocate resources and focus on assets that align more closely with their strategic objectives. The reference to 'several assets in the market at various stages of the sales process' suggests a proactive approach to portfolio management, which can be crucial in the highly cyclical hospitality sector. This sector is significantly influenced by economic factors, travel trends and consumer preferences, all of which require REITs to remain agile and responsive.Moreover, the mention of the sale's 'very attractive cap rate' by Ashford Trust's President and CEO underlines the company's confidence in the deal's value. This could be a signal to investors that the management is adept at capitalizing on market conditions to negotiate favorable terms, which is a critical competency in the competitive hospitality market. Such transactions can also serve as a benchmark for valuing similar properties within the industry, offering insights into asset valuations and investment opportunities. Debt Analyst From a debt management perspective, the use of sale proceeds to pay down debt is a prudent financial strategy that can significantly impact a company's balance sheet and overall financial stability. By reducing debt, Ashford Trust is likely aiming to lower its debt-to-equity ratio, a move that is generally well-received by investors as it indicates a stronger equity position and may reduce the risk profile of the company. Furthermore, the reduction in debt can lead to lower interest expenses, which can improve net income and cash flow available for distribution to shareholders or reinvestment into the business.However, it is also important to consider the potential impact of such a sale on the company's future revenue streams. The sold property will no longer contribute to Ashford Trust's income, which could have a dilutive effect on earnings if not offset by the benefits of reduced debt and interest expenses or by reinvesting the capital in higher-yielding opportunities. The company's strategy and ability to execute further asset sales or acquisitions will be crucial in determining the long-term effects of this transaction on its financial health and performance. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM DALLAS, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) (""Ashford Trust"" or the ""Company"") today announced that it has closed on the sale of the 144-room Residence Inn located in Salt Lake City, Utah (the ""Hotel"") for $19.2 million.

These models celebrate Italian culture with unique features like a JBL audio system, Rose Gold coloring, and Level 2 active driving assist system. Pricing starts at $36,000.

The Inspired By models will hit dealers in the third quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The introduction of the new Fiat 500e 'Inspired By' models marks a significant advancement in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, particularly with the inclusion of Level 2 active driving assist system (ADAS) technology. This enhancement positions the Fiat 500e as a leader in its class, offering a competitive edge in terms of safety and driver assistance features. The ADAS system, which includes adaptive cruise control and Lane Keep Assist, could increase the vehicle's appeal to safety-conscious consumers and potentially drive sales growth in the North American market.The strategic branding of the 'Inspired By Music' and 'Inspired By Beauty' models, leveraging Italian cultural symbols, is likely to enhance the brand's identity and could resonate well with a demographic that values design and cultural heritage. This approach may also contribute to brand loyalty and customer retention. The pricing strategy, starting at $36,000, positions the 500e in a relatively accessible segment, potentially widening its customer base.From a business perspective, the timing of the release in the third quarter of 2024 aligns with the increasing demand for EVs, suggesting that Fiat is capitalizing on market trends. The inclusion of a JBL audio system and unique coloring options may also create a differentiated product offering, potentially attracting a niche market segment interested in premium features. Market Research Analyst The Fiat 500e's estimated range of 149 miles positions it within the competitive landscape of city EVs, offering a balance between range and urban maneuverability. The vehicle's light weight and quick charging capabilities address common consumer concerns regarding EVs, such as range anxiety and charging convenience. The inclusion of a Level 2 charging wall unit or charge credits with Free2move Charge could be a decisive factor for consumers considering the switch to electric mobility.Furthermore, the 'Inspired By' models' release strategy could generate anticipation and create a buzz in the market, potentially increasing consumer interest and driving pre-orders. The collaboration with cultural icons like Andrea Bocelli for the 'Inspired By Music' model adds a unique marketing angle that could appeal to a broader audience beyond traditional EV buyers.The EV market is growing and Fiat's launch of the 500e 'Inspired By' models is a timely move to capture a share of this expanding segment. However, it will be important to monitor consumer reception and sales data following the release to gauge the effectiveness of Fiat's marketing and product differentiation strategies. Environmental Analyst The Fiat 500e's release is a positive development in terms of environmental impact, as the shift towards electrification in the automotive industry is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The 500e's lightest passenger BEV claim and its efficient charging system contribute to a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.The vehicle's 'singing' acoustic vehicle alert system (AVAS), which plays 'The Sound of 500,' is not only a nod to Italian culture but also serves an important safety function by alerting pedestrians of the vehicle's presence, a feature that is particularly relevant in urban environments where EVs' quiet operation can pose risks to those on foot.By offering a stylish and culturally rich EV experience, Fiat may influence consumer perceptions of electric vehicles, encouraging wider adoption and contributing to environmental sustainability. The impact of the 500e on Fiat's overall carbon footprint will depend on the scale of its adoption and the company's commitment to sustainable practices across its operations. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM AUBURN HILLS, Mich., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- New Fiat 500e Inspired By models align with symbols of Italian culture – music and beautyTwo new models have unique content, including JBL audio system and brilliant Rose Gold coloringInspired By models introduce Level 2 active driving assist system (ADAS) to the Fiat 500e in North America — only EV in the segment to offer Level 2 ADASInspired By Music and Inspired By Beauty are available to order today and will hit dealers in the third quarter of 2024Pricing starts at $36,000 for Inspired By Music and $36,000 for Inspired By Beauty, including destinationToday FIAT announced the brand's next drop for the all-electric 500e.

Yalla Group Limited Announces Unaudited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results,2024-03-11T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Yalla Group Limited (NYSE: YALA) reported strong financial performance for Q4 2023 with revenues of US$80.9 million, a 7.7% increase from Q4 2022.

Net income surged by 79.0% to US$29.7 million. Non-GAAP net income also rose by 53.8% to US$33.4 million. Despite a decrease in paying users, average MAUs increased by 13.3% to 36.2 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent financial results from Yalla Group Limited indicate a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, with a 7.7% revenue increase compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth is particularly noteworthy in the context of the social networking and gaming sectors, which are known for their volatility and competition. The reported increase in Net Income by 79.0% is a robust indicator of the company's profitability and operational efficiency.However, the decrease in the number of paying users by 4.2% could signal a potential challenge in user monetization, especially given that this decline occurred despite a 13.3% increase in average monthly active users (MAUs). This suggests that while the platform's user base is growing, its ability to convert these users into consistent revenue streams may be under pressure, possibly due to the mentioned game mechanism adjustments. This could have implications for the company's future revenue growth and should be monitored closely by stakeholders. Financial Analyst Yalla Group's financial results reveal a substantial improvement in net margins, with a reported 36.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. When adjusted for non-GAAP measures, which exclude share-based compensation, the net margin climbs even higher to 41.3%. These figures suggest that Yalla Group is not only increasing its revenues but is also effectively managing its expenses, leading to greater profitability. The distinction between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is crucial for investors as it provides a clearer picture of a company's operational performance by excluding potentially volatile and non-cash expenses.Investors might also take note of the company's performance in different segments, with chatting services contributing a larger share of the revenue compared to gaming services. This diversification in revenue streams could be seen as a positive attribute, providing a buffer against market fluctuations in any single segment. Economist From an economic perspective, Yalla Group's performance is reflective of the broader digital economy trends in the MENA region. The growth in revenues and net income indicates that the company is capitalizing on the increasing digital adoption and internet penetration rates in the region. However, the reduction in paying users amidst overall user growth may point to broader economic factors at play, such as changes in consumer spending habits or competitive dynamics within the industry.Long-term, the company's ability to maintain high net margins and grow its user base will be critical for sustaining its competitive position in the MENA market. The company's strategic adjustments, such as the game mechanism changes that impacted paying users, will need to be assessed over time to determine their effectiveness in balancing user engagement with monetization. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM DUBAI, UAE, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Yalla Group Limited (""Yalla"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: YALA), the largest Middle East and North Africa (MENA)-based online social networking and gaming company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Our average MAUs increased by 13.3% from 32.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding share-based compensation. We define non-GAAP net income as net income excluding share-based compensation. We define non-GAAP net margin as non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenues. We define non-GAAP net income attributable to Yalla Group Limited's shareholders as net income attributable to Yalla Group Limited's shareholders, excluding share-based compensation. We define non-GAAP earnings per ordinary share as non-GAAP net income attributable to Yalla Group Limited's shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. Investors can better understand the Company's operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess its core operating results, as they exclude share-based compensation expenses, which are not expected to result in cash payments. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using the non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation has been and may continue to be incurred in the Company's business and is not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its non-GAAP financial measures in the reconciliations to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating its performance. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are set forth at the end of this press release.

"Aeva Technologies, Inc. Announces Effective Date of Reverse Stock Split",2024-03-11T21:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Aeva (NYSE: AEVA) announces a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effective March 18, 2024, to increase per share trading price and meet NYSE listing criteria.","Aeva Technologies, Inc. Announces Effective Date of Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Aeva (NYSE: AEVA) announces a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effective March 18, 2024, to increase per share trading price and meet NYSE listing criteria. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Aeva's reverse stock split is a strategic move aimed at addressing the NYSE's minimum price criteria, which is a common practice among public companies facing potential delisting due to their stock price. By consolidating shares, the company is effectively increasing the price per share, which may help it to maintain its listing status. However, this action does not inherently change the company's market capitalization or its underlying financial health.Investors should consider the implications of such a reverse split on liquidity and market perception. While the reduced number of shares could lead to decreased liquidity, the higher share price might attract institutional investors who are often restricted from investing in lower-priced stocks. It's also worth noting that the market sometimes views reverse splits as a sign of distress, which could impact investor confidence. Market Research Analyst Aeva's reverse stock split may influence investor sentiment as it alters the stock's visibility in the market. Historically, reverse splits have been associated with struggling companies and although this is a tactical decision to meet listing requirements, it could be perceived negatively by the market. The adjustment in the number of shares underlying equity awards and warrants will also affect the stakeholder's interests proportionally, potentially impacting employee morale and investor relations.From a market dynamics perspective, the post-split trading period will be critical to observe. The stock's performance following the split will provide insights into market reception and could influence the company's ability to raise capital in the future. Additionally, the split-adjusted basis trading will require adjustments in the valuation models used by analysts and investors, which could lead to short-term volatility. Legal Expert The reverse stock split requires meticulous legal compliance, particularly with the NYSE listing standards and securities regulations. Aeva's adherence to the shareholder-approved amendment to its certificate of incorporation demonstrates governance following due process. The company's disclosure of the split ratio, effective time and new CUSIP number reflects transparency, which is essential for maintaining investor trust.Furthermore, the role of Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as the exchange agent ensures that the transition for registered stockholders and those holding shares in certificate form is managed efficiently. The legal intricacies of adjusting the underlying equity awards and warrants also highlight the company's commitment to equitable treatment of all stakeholders during such corporate actions. 03/11/2024 - 05:00 PM Aeva Common Stock Expected to Begin Trading on a Split-adjusted Basis on March 19, 2024 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aeva® (NYSE: AEVA), a leader in next-generation sensing and perception systems, today announced that it expects a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock will be effective as of March 18, 2024 at approximately 4:01 p.m. Eastern Time. Aeva’s common stock will continue trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the existing symbol (AEVA) and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on March 19, 2024, with the new CUSIP number 00835Q202. As of the effective time of the reverse stock split, every five issued and outstanding shares of Aeva’s common stock will be automatically reclassified into one issued and outstanding share of Aeva’s common stock. This will reduce the number of shares outstanding from approximately 263.8 million shares to approximately 52.8 million, subject to adjustment for fractional shares. Proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of common stock underlying the company’s outstanding equity awards, warrants, the number of shares issuable under its equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable. The reverse stock split will not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value of the common stock. Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company is acting as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of Aeva’s common stock are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to such broker’s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding shares of Aeva’s common stock in certificate form will receive a transmittal letter from Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company with instructions as soon as practicable after the effective date. The reverse stock split is primarily intended to increase the per share trading price of Aeva’s common stock in order to meet the NYSE’s price criteria for continued listing. An amendment to Aeva’s certificate of incorporation to provide Aeva’s Board of Directors with the right to decide at its discretion to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not greater than 1-for-30, with the exact ratio and effective time of such reverse stock split, if any, to be determined by Aeva’s Board of Directors within one year of the meeting date, was approved by Aeva’s stockholders at its special meeting of stockholders held on December 18, 2023. Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in Aeva’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 18, 2023, which is available free of charge at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov, and on Aeva’s website at www.aeva.com.

From the basics of using artificial intelligence to translate our speech, I am researching how machines can better comprehend our jargon. More specifically, discovering ways, for we as programmers, to improve these machines and increase their capabilities.""Ecy King,Stanford University""My educational computer science comic book, Bit by Bit, will be published globally by the Stanford University Press on June 4, 2024. I am very much looking forward to being more involved with that post-grad. Ideally, I would pursue something that is technical, creative, and educational, maybe in the tech, EdTech, or educational sector. In the meantime, I am on the lookout for opportunities, spaces, and places that inspire me to continue to grow while making a positive impact in the world.""Hyunsu Chae,University of Texas at Austin""After graduation, I would like to secure an industry position, preferably in R&D. I would like to apply my research and the knowledge I've gained through academics to real-world scenarios and provide insight to practical challenges within the field, leading to innovation. In the long term, I would like to contribute to the academic community, particularly back in Korea. I hope to engage with young aspiring engineers, share my experiences, and provide guidance serving as a mentor while representing women in engineering.""Iwinosa Aideyan,Clemson University""Embrace your uniqueness and leverage it as a source of strength. Don't be discouraged by challenges or stereotypes. Seek mentors and allies who can provide guidance and support. Be proactive in finding opportunities, whether through internships, clubs, or research projects. Your perspective is valuable, and your presence can drive positive change in the field. Stay resilient, believe in yourself, and remember that diversity and inclusion are essential for innovation and progress in the world of engineering. Your journey will inspire others.""Layla Ghalayini,Georgia Institute of Technology""I was inspired [to study a technical field] by the seemingly infinite possibilities to enact positive change in my community and the world! There are many resources available to support you on your journey-you just have to find them and take advantage of the opportunities. Do not be afraid to ask for help.""Lily Chen,Massachusetts Institue of Technology""I've loved math since I was young, which led me to study mathematics and computer science in college.

Looking back on my academic journey, I would advise future students in STEM to find experienced mentors, as well as connect and collaborate with peers.""Mansi Sood,Carnegie Mellon University""The scholarship will provide immense support in my academic journey, and it will also help me pursue initiatives aimed at making educational opportunities and resources accessible to all. It is helpful to invest in building a strong support network. Actively seek mentors who can guide and inspire you and, in turn, become a mentor to others, creating a cycle of support and growth.""Nishith Chakraborty,University of Tennessee, Knoxville""Upon completing my studies, my intention is to assume the role of an assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering. I perceive this as the most effective avenue for me to engage in cutting-edge research and positively influence the lives of students, particularly those hailing from underrepresented communities. I am confident that my personal experiences can offer valuable support to individuals facing challenges in this field.""Precious Kolawole,Carleton University""Unlike many other people's stories, I wasn't exposed to technology while growing up, which was influenced by my family's inability to afford electronics and gadgets. Studying medicine has been my childhood dream, but I subsequently was accepted to study physiotherapy at a Nigerian university three years after high school. However, my brother introduced me to technology during the three-year waiting period. My interest in studying a technical field was sparked and started to take shape when I saw the possibilities of combining medicine with technology. I also realized the extent to which healthcare could be made more accessible via the applications of artificial intelligence. Therefore, I left my medical degree program to pursue a bachelor's in computer science at Carleton University in Canada.""Promise Ekpo,Cornell University""My PhD research investigates techniques to enable safe cooperation and ensure alignment between humans and robots while collaborating in team settings. My long-term goal is to evolve into a reinforcement learning researcher who actively contributes to addressing safety concerns in robotic systems by developing algorithms. Post-graduation, I plan to pursue a robotics research career in the industry.""Saba Mansour,Cornell University""I believe that academia plays one of the most decisive roles in reducing inequality. Thus, my advice for students from underrepresented groups is to not let any negative thoughts affect what major they choose to study or how big they dream. Instead, they should feel encouraged to participate more in all aspects of society. Everyone has the right to choose their desired academic journey and higher education is available to all talented students.""Sneha Narasimhan,North Carolina State University""My post-graduation plans involve pursuing a research-oriented position working on real-world engineering problems. I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I've gained during my studies to contribute to advancements in my field. Furthermore, I aim to actively volunteer within the power electronics community, working towards fostering inclusivity and generating additional opportunities for underrepresented groups, as giving back is important to me.""Learn more about the Diversity in Technology Scholarship Program and check out our past recipients.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cadence Design Systems on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cadence Design SystemsWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cadence-design-systemsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cadence Design SystemsView the original press release on accesswire.com How many recipients were awarded the 2023 Women in Technology Scholarship by Cadence?

DaVita contributes $1.5 million to support ADA initiatives targeting at-risk individuals. Efforts include creating educational materials, piloting a registered dietitian program, and sponsoring State of Diabetes events. Positive None. Negative None. Health Policy Expert The expanded partnership between the ADA and DaVita represents a strategic move to address health disparities and improve chronic disease management, particularly in communities of color disproportionately affected by diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This initiative could potentially lead to a reduction in long-term healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. By focusing on hyperlocal and culturally relevant education, the collaboration addresses a critical gap in current healthcare delivery systems. However, the success of such programs depends on their effective implementation and the ability to measure their impact on community health metrics. Medical Research Analyst DaVita's additional $1.5 million investment in the ADA's initiatives signifies a substantial commitment to health education and prevention. This move not only enhances DaVita's corporate social responsibility profile but also aligns with the company's business interests by potentially reducing the incidence and severity of CKD, which could lead to a decreased need for dialysis services. From an investor's perspective, this could indicate a strategic shift towards preventive care models that might affect long-term revenue streams. It's essential to monitor the outcomes of such investments in terms of their efficacy in reducing the prevalence of diabetes and CKD. Healthcare Market Analyst With over 38 million Americans living with diabetes and a significant overlap with CKD, the market for education and preventive care in these areas is substantial. The collaboration's focus on creating a digital home base and a pilot program for registered dietitians (RDs) could lead to the development of new digital health tools and services, potentially opening up new revenue streams for both organizations. The emphasis on culturally sensitive materials and addressing clinical biases is also in line with current trends towards personalized medicine. The impact on DaVita's stock could be positive if these efforts lead to improved health outcomes and patient engagement. 03/11/2024 - 04:40 PM Efforts to advance chronic disease prevention through enhanced education, awareness and support — kicking off during National Kidney Month DENVER, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, The American Diabetes Association ® (ADA) and DaVita (NYSE: DVA), a leading provider of kidney care services, announced the expansion of a multi-year collaboration, focused on advancing chronic disease prevention, specifically addressing two of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the U.S. — diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The kick-off for this expanded effort coincides with National Kidney Month, a time when both organizations bolster efforts to increase kidney health awareness and education. Chronic disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States.[1] More than 38 million Americans are living with diabetes, and approximately one in three American adults with diabetes has CKD.[2] Because the symptoms of CKD are often mild and go undetected, it's critical for individuals to understand their risk factors and take necessary steps to protect their health. ""At DaVita, we say we're a community first and a company second, underscoring our deep-rooted commitment to creating healthier communities,"" said Dr. Jeff Giullian, chief medical officer for DaVita. ""By combining our expertise in kidney care with the ADA's leadership in diabetes education, we aim to make a lasting impact on chronic disease prevention, specifically in the communities that need it most."" As part of this expansion, DaVita has contributed an additional $1.5 million to bolster the ADA's initiatives targeting individuals at risk of or who have diabetes and CKD, focused on driving hyperlocal and culturally relevant awareness and engagement in particular within communities of greater need. Diabetes and CKD disproportionately affect many communities of color, including Black and Hispanic or Latino populations. The two organizations are dedicated to improving health equity by uncovering new ways to drive awareness in underserved communities, addressing disparities and barriers to care, and mitigating clinical biases. The efforts include developing materials in multiple languages, learning personal cultural context for lifestyles and dietary considerations, and identifying barriers that these communities face. Together, the ADA and DaVita will: Create a digital home base with new educational materials that are easily accessible for patients and health care professionals.Pilot a registered dietitian (RDs) program enabling greater access to diabetes education and resources to keep RDs well-informed to better care for patients.Sponsor the ADA's State of Diabetes events in high-priority markets where DaVita and ADA leaders will lead discussions around some of the most important topics facing their shared patient populations in today's health care system.""Through our work with DaVita, we have informed and educated millions of Americans — but our work isn't finished,"" said Charles ""Chuck"" Henderson, chief executive officer at the ADA. ""We must continue the momentum and create more opportunities to promote diabetes and CKD education, especially in high-need communities with marginalized populations."" To further celebrate National Kidney Month in March, DaVita has launched a campaign that focuses on ""Connecting the Dots"" between kidney health and other chronic conditions, including diabetes. On March 26, DaVita dietitians will join the ADA for a live cooking class featuring a tasty diabetes- and kidney-friendly meal. Learn more and register here.

CEO Matt Schatzman emphasized maximizing long-term value for shareholders through efficient business strategies. Progress on Phase 1 at the Rio Grande LNG Facility, expansion capacity, and financial updates were highlighted. Positive CEO's commitment to maximizing shareholder value through efficient business strategies. Progress on Phase 1 construction at the Rio Grande LNG Facility in line with schedules. Positive developments in Train 4 and 5 expansion capacity to meet global LNG demand. Financial updates including debt reduction and new credit agreements for construction funding. Positive outlook for sustained growth and value creation for shareholders. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial structuring and risk management strategies outlined by NextDecade Corporation reveal a prudent approach to financing its Phase 1 construction for the Rio Grande LNG Facility. The use of fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate fluctuations for approximately 84% of the projected debt demonstrates a conservative financial posture. This risk mitigation tactic is crucial given the long-term nature of the project and the potential for interest rate volatility over time. The senior secured loans and notes issued with fixed interest rates further stabilize the company's financial obligations, providing predictability in cash flow management.From an investment perspective, the amortization schedule commencing in mid-2029 suggests a long-term horizon for return on capital, which could appeal to investors with a similar investment profile. The syndication of bank credit facility commitments, resulting in a broad lender group, indicates confidence in the project from the financial community. However, the fixed interest rates of 7.11% and 6.85% on the senior secured loans and notes, respectively, should be evaluated against the industry's average cost of capital for similar projects to assess competitiveness. Market Research Analyst The global LNG market dynamics are critical in evaluating NextDecade's strategic positioning. The company's focus on expanding operational footprint to meet the growing demand for cleaner energy sources aligns with current market trends towards sustainable energy solutions. The strategic decision to pursue a positive final investment decision (FID) for Train 4 reflects an anticipation of continued market demand for LNG. Additionally, the company's engagement in commercial discussions and progress in the FEED and EPC contracting processes indicates a proactive approach to securing buyers and contracts, which is essential for the viability of Train 4.Investors should consider the potential market size and growth trajectory of global LNG demand, as well as the competitive landscape in which NextDecade operates. The company's ability to secure long-term contracts for Train 4 and Train 5 will be a significant factor in the project's success and could influence the stock's performance. Additionally, the timing of the FID relative to market conditions and competitor actions will be critical in determining the project's competitive advantage and potential market share capture. Energy Sector Analyst NextDecade's construction progress and strategic updates indicate a significant advancement in the Rio Grande LNG Facility's development. The reported project completion percentages for Trains 1, 2 and 3, as well as the common facilities, suggest that the project is on schedule. This on-track progress is essential for maintaining investor confidence and meeting contractual obligations. The company's emphasis on safety, excellence in project management and collaboration with Bechtel exhibits a commitment to operational integrity, which is paramount in the energy sector.Investors should also note the regulatory approvals and authorizations received from the FERC and DOE, which are critical hurdles in the development of energy infrastructure projects. The long-term land lease and extensive frontage on the Brownsville Ship Channel provide strategic advantages for shipping logistics and potential future expansion. The equity interest structure in the Phase 1 joint venture and the options for equity partners to invest in Train 4 and Train 5 indicate a shared risk and reward model, which could be attractive to potential investors and partners. 03/11/2024 - 04:35 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NextDecade Corporation (NextDecade or the Company) (NASDAQ: NEXT) today provided an update on developmental and strategic activities for the fourth quarter 2023 and early 2024. CEO Commentary ""We are committed to maximizing long-term value for NextDecade's shareholders by executing our business strategy efficiently and effectively,"" said Matt Schatzman, NextDecade's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We are focused on constructing Phase 1 at the Rio Grande LNG Facility safely, on time, and on budget, and delivering a positive FID of our fully permitted expansion capacity to meet growing global demand for cleaner energy sources including LNG."" ""We have a steadfast commitment to upholding the highest standards of safety and excellence in project management and are working alongside our EPC partner, Bechtel, and other counterparties to ensure that construction activities proceed smoothly and in line with contractual schedules. Through rigorous planning, diligent execution, and proactive risk management, together we are seeking to maximize the efficiency of construction efforts."" ""We are also actively working to capitalize on market opportunities and position the Company for sustained growth through expansion of our operational footprint. With regulatory approvals in place, our Train 4 and 5 expansion capacity is well-positioned to meet growing global demand for LNG. Supportive market conditions provide tailwinds to continue progressing toward FID of Train 4, which is well underway. Commercial discussions with various potential counterparties and the FEED and EPC contracting processes are proceeding well. Our progress remains aligned with our goal of reaching a positive final investment decision for Train 4 in the second half of this year."" ""Through disciplined execution on Phase 1 and our expansion capacity at the Rio Grande LNG Facility, we are poised to achieve our long-term objective of becoming a leading provider of LNG to customers around the globe while also delivering sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders."" Significant Recent Developments Development and Construction Under the EPC contracts with Bechtel Energy Inc. (Bechtel), Phase 1 progress is tracked for Train 1, Train 2, and the common facilities on a combined basis and Train 3 on a separate basis. As of January 2024: The overall project completion percentage for Trains 1 and 2 and the common facilities of the Rio Grande LNG Facility was 14.3%, which is in line with the schedule under the EPC contract. Within this project completion percentage, engineering was 47.9% complete, procurement was 26.8% complete, and construction was 1.0% complete. The overall project completion percentage for Train 3 of the Rio Grande LNG Facility was 4.4%, based on preliminary schedules, which is also in line with the schedule under the EPC contract. Within this project completion percentage, engineering was 3.4% complete, procurement was 10.6% complete, and construction was 0.0% complete. Strategic and Commercial The Company has started the front-end engineering and design (FEED) and EPC contract processes with Bechtel for Train 4 and are progressing numerous discussions with potential buyers of LNG to provide commercial support for Train 4. The EPC contracting process and commercial discussions are progressing at a pace consistent with the Company's target of reaching a positive final investment decision (FID) of Train 4 in the second half of 2024. Financial As of December 2023, Rio Grande’s outstanding fixed-rate debt and executed interest rate swaps have reduced its exposure to movements in interest rates for approximately 84% of the debt currently projected to be incurred in support of Phase 1 construction. In December 2023, Rio Grande LNG, LLC (Rio Grande) entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for $251 million of senior secured loans to finance a portion of Phase 1. The senior secured loans were disbursed in one advance of $251 million on December 28, 2023, which resulted in a reduction in the commitments outstanding under Rio Grande's existing bank credit facilities for Phase 1. These senior secured loans will be amortized over a period of approximately 18 years beginning in mid-2029, with a final maturity in September 2047. These senior secured loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.11% and rank pari passu to Rio Grande's existing senior secured financings. In January 2024, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary NextDecade LNG, LLC entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility with additional capacity of $12.5 million to cover interest. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including development costs related to Train 4 at the Rio Grande LNG Facility. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR or the base rate plus an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement. The revolving credit facility and interest term loan mature at the earlier of two years from the closing date or 10 business days after a positive FID on Train 4. In February 2024, Rio Grande issued and sold $190 million of senior secured notes in a private placement transaction to finance a portion of Phase 1. The senior secured notes were issued on February 9, 2024 and resulted in a reduction in the commitments outstanding under Rio Grande's existing bank credit facilities for Phase 1. These senior secured notes will be amortized over a period of approximately 18 years beginning in mid-2029, with a final maturity in June 2047. The senior secured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.85% and rank pari passu to Rio Grande's existing senior secured financings. Rio Grande has syndicated a portion of its bank credit facility commitments, resulting in a supporting lender group of approximately 40 international banks. Rio Grande LNG Facility NextDecade is constructing and developing the Rio Grande LNG Facility on the north shore of the Brownsville Ship Channel in south Texas through its partially-owned subsidiary Rio Grande. The site is located on 984 acres of land which has been leased long-term and includes 15,000 feet of frontage on the Brownsville Ship Channel. The Rio Grande LNG Facility has received necessary approvals and authorizations required for construction, including those from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), which allow for development, construction, and operation of up to five trains and 27 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG exports. Phase 1 (Trains 1-3) Phase 1 at the Rio Grande LNG Facility is under construction. Phase 1 includes three liquefaction trains with a total nameplate capacity of 17.61 MTPA of LNG production, two 180,000 cubic meter full containment LNG storage tanks, and two jetty berthing structures designed to load LNG carriers up to 216,000 cubic meters in capacity. Phase 1 also includes associated site infrastructure and common facilities including feed gas pretreatment facilities, electric and water utilities, two totally enclosed ground flares for the LNG tanks and marine facilities, two ground flares for the liquefaction trains, roads, levees surrounding the entire site, and warehouses, administrative, operations control room, and maintenance buildings. As of January 2024, progress on Trains 1 through 3 is in line with the schedule under the EPC Contracts. Recent construction activities have included the start of Train 1 foundation concrete pours, piling activity for the LNG tanks, and construction of the levee and marine offloading facility. Additionally, the civil works program has progressed via the deep soil mixing program, and meaningful progress has been made on the shoreline restoration program, with the majority of shoreline reclamation nearing completion, and shoreline protection work has commenced. Bechtel has also made meaningful progress on purchase orders for Train 3. NextDecade holds equity interests in the Phase 1 joint venture that entitle it to receive up to 20.8% of the distributions of available cash during operations. Final Investment Decision on Train 4 and Train 5 NextDecade is targeting a positive FID and commencement of construction of Train 4 and related infrastructure at the Rio Grande LNG Facility in the second half of 2024, and subsequently Train 5 and related infrastructure. Achieving a positive FID of this fully permitted expansion capacity at the Rio Grande LNG Facility will be subject to, among other things, finalizing and entering into EPC contracts, entering into appropriate commercial arrangements, and obtaining adequate financing to construct each train and related infrastructure. The Company has commenced certain pre-FID activities for Train 4, including the FEED and EPC contract processes with Bechtel. The Company expects to finalize the Train 4 EPC contract in the first half of 2024. TotalEnergies SE (TotalEnergies) has LNG purchase options of 1.5 MTPA for each of Train 4 and Train 5. If TotalEnergies exercises its LNG purchase options, the Company currently estimates that an additional approximately 3 MTPA of LNG must be contracted on a long-term basis for each of Train 4 and Train 5 prior to making a positive FID for the respective train. The Company continues to advance commercial discussions with various potential counterparties and expects to finalize commercial arrangements for Train 4 in the coming months to support an FID of Train 4 in the second half of 2024. The Company expects to finance construction of Train 4 utilizing a combination of debt and equity funding. The Company expects to enter into bank facilities for the debt portion of the funding. In connection with consummating the Rio Grande Phase 1 equity joint venture, the Company's equity partners each have options to invest in Train 4 and Train 5 equity, which, if exercised, would provide approximately 60% of the equity funding required for each of Train 4 and Train 5. Inclusive of these options, NextDecade currently expects to fund 40% of the equity commitments for each of Train 4 and Train 5, and to have an initial economic interest of 40% in each of Train 4 and Train 5, increasing to 60% after its equity partners achieve certain returns on their investments in each of the respective trains. The Company expects to undertake the financing process for Train 4 after the EPC contract and commercial arrangements are finalized.

(AMTX) Q4 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Stonegate Capital Partners updates coverage on Aemetis, Inc. (AMTX) highlighting the biodiesel plant's operation at 60m gallons per year, completion of 9 dairy digesters, and an awarded Air Permit for the aviation plant from the City of Riverbank. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent update from Stonegate Capital Partners regarding Aemetis, Inc. provides critical information that could influence the company's market performance. The fact that the biodiesel plant is operating at a capacity of 60 million gallons per year is significant. This figure not only showcases the company's production capabilities but also its potential to meet the growing demand for renewable fuels. The expansion of the biodiesel industry is a response to global environmental concerns and the push for sustainable energy sources, which could lead to increased investor interest in companies like Aemetis.Furthermore, the completion of 9 dairy digesters, with plans to double this number by the end of the year, indicates a strategic move towards diversification and sustainability. These digesters contribute to the production of renewable natural gas, a crucial component in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The scaling up of operations could potentially lead to an uptick in revenue and profitability, which would be an attractive point for stakeholders.The aviation plant being awarded an Air Permit from the City of Riverbank is another pivotal development. This permit is a regulatory milestone that allows the plant to proceed with operations. Considering the aviation industry's need for sustainable fuel alternatives, this could position Aemetis at the forefront of a niche market with substantial growth potential. The entry into the aviation biofuel sector could diversify the company's revenue streams and possibly lead to strategic partnerships or contracts with airlines seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of Aemetis, Inc.'s operational updates, the current production capacity and expansion plans could have a notable impact on the company's financials. The biodiesel production capacity of 60 million gallons per year suggests a robust supply capability, which, assuming consistent demand, could translate into a stable revenue base. Investors will be looking at the margins on biodiesel production, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the dairy digesters, to assess the potential impact on the company's bottom line.The additional 9 dairy digesters expected by year-end could significantly enhance the company's renewable natural gas output, potentially offering a hedge against volatility in traditional fuel markets. This expansion might also attract ESG-focused investors, who are increasingly seeking out companies with a clear commitment to sustainability.With the aviation plant's Air Permit, Aemetis may be entering a market with less competition and higher barriers to entry, which could lead to favorable pricing power. The long-term contracts typical in the aviation industry might provide predictable cash flows, enhancing the company's financial stability. However, investors should consider the capital expenditures required for these expansions and the time needed to realize returns on these investments. Environmental Policy Expert From an environmental policy standpoint, Aemetis, Inc.'s operational developments are aligned with broader regulatory trends that favor low-carbon energy sources. The operation of a biodiesel plant at such a significant capacity indicates the company's alignment with policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel dependence. The dairy digesters represent a commitment to reducing methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, from livestock operations, which is in line with international climate goals.The award of an Air Permit for the aviation plant is not just a regulatory compliance achievement but also a strategic positioning within environmental policy frameworks. As governments and international bodies impose stricter regulations on aviation emissions, Aemetis could benefit from early adoption and potentially receive governmental incentives or subsidies designed to promote cleaner aviation fuels.Investors with an interest in environmentally responsible companies might see Aemetis as an increasingly attractive option. The company's initiatives could lead to a favorable public perception and brand value, potentially influencing consumer and investor decisions. Understanding the interplay between environmental policies and business operations will be essential for stakeholders evaluating the long-term prospects of Aemetis. 03/11/2024 - 04:40 PM Dallas, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - March 11, 2024) - Aemetis, Inc.

(VCTR) reported Total Assets Under Management of $164.9 billion, Other Assets of $5.5 billion, and Total Client Assets of $170.3 billion as of February 29, 2024. The company's Average Total Assets Under Management for February were $162.8 billion. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. detailed the breakdown of Total Client Assets by asset class, showing growth across various categories. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in Victory Capital Holdings' Total Assets Under Management (AUM) from $160.174 billion to $164.863 billion indicates a positive trend in the company's asset accumulation over the month. A rise in AUM is often seen as a sign of investor confidence and can lead to an increase in management fee revenue, a critical component of an asset management firm's earnings. Furthermore, the growth across various asset classes, particularly in 'Solutions' and 'U.S. Mid Cap Equity', suggests a diversification in the company's portfolio, which can be appealing to investors seeking balanced exposure.Analyzing the distribution of assets by vehicle, the majority remains in Mutual Funds, which is consistent with the industry norm for retail investors. However, the growth in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is notable, as these products have been gaining popularity due to their lower costs and liquidity. The shift towards ETFs could signal a strategic response to changing market demands.It is also important to recognize the restatement of 'Other Assets', which now includes low-fee institutional assets. This reclassification may affect the perceived revenue potential from these assets, given the lower fee structure. Stakeholders should monitor how this restatement impacts future earnings reports and whether it aligns with industry practices on reporting regulatory AUM. Financial Analyst The financial health of Victory Capital can be partially inferred from the reported AUM, as it directly impacts revenue through management fees. The reported month-over-month increase in AUM and Other Assets suggests a positive inflow or appreciation in asset values, which could translate to higher revenue in the upcoming quarters. For investors, this could potentially mean an improved earnings outlook for the company.It is also critical to assess the Average Total AUM, which provides a more stable view of the company's performance, smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The reported average suggests that the company maintained a relatively steady asset base throughout the month, which could indicate stability in the underlying business model.From a financial analysis standpoint, the key figures to watch in subsequent earnings reports will be the management fee margins derived from the AUM and the operating expenses associated with managing the increased asset base. Any significant deviation from expected margins or cost structures could impact the company's profitability. Economist The reported figures by Victory Capital reflect broader economic trends, such as market performance and investor sentiment. The increase in AUM suggests a favorable economic environment or effective company strategies that attract capital. The allocation of assets across different classes and vehicles also provides insight into current market trends, such as the preference for mid-cap equities, which may be perceived as a middle ground between the growth potential of small caps and the stability of large caps.The company's performance in the context of economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation and GDP growth can also be significant. For example, fixed income assets may be influenced by interest rate changes, while equity classes respond to corporate earnings and economic forecasts. Understanding these relationships can help stakeholders anticipate how Victory Capital's AUM might be affected by economic shifts.Long-term, the ability of Victory Capital to adapt to economic cycles and maintain AUM growth will be crucial for sustained success. The economic landscape will dictate the strategies the company must employ to continue attracting and managing investor assets effectively. 03/11/2024 - 04:30 PM SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: VCTR) (“Victory Capital” or the “Company”) today reported Total Assets Under Management (AUM) of $164.9 billion, Other Assets of $5.5 billion, and Total Client Assets of $170.3 billion, as of February 29, 2024.

The Series A Preferred Shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol ACP PRA, with an annual dividend rate of $1.3125 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash distribution for abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund's Series A Perpetual Preferred Shares represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. Given the 5.250% dividend rate and the A2 rating by Moody's, this indicates a stable income-generating asset with a moderate level of credit risk. Investors typically view such announcements positively, as they demonstrate the fund's ability to generate and distribute income.However, it is essential to assess the sustainability of these distributions. If they are frequently derived from capital gains or return of capital rather than ordinary income, it could suggest the fund is selling assets or returning investor's own money instead of generating income through its operations. This could impact the fund's long-term value and should be monitored closely by investors. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the nature of the distributions is significant. Distributions that are classified as ordinary income are taxed at different rates than those classified as capital gains. The tax treatment affects the after-tax return for investors, which is a crucial consideration for income-focused strategies. The Fund's notice that the actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend on the Fund's investment experience and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations underscores the need for investors to stay informed about the tax implications of their investments.It is also important for investors to note the timeline for receiving the Form 1099-DIV, which will clarify the composition of the distributions for tax purposes. Investors should plan for potential tax obligations associated with the distributions received throughout the 2024 calendar year. Market Research Analyst The Series A Perpetual Preferred Shares issuance and subsequent distributions highlight the fund's strategy to attract and retain investors seeking steady income streams. The quarterly distribution frequency is a common practice that aligns with investor expectations for regular income. The market's reception to such announcements can be influenced by current economic conditions, interest rate trends and market liquidity.Furthermore, the Moody's A2 rating places the fund within an investment-grade category, which may appeal to risk-averse investors. However, shifts in market sentiment or changes in the fund's creditworthiness could influence the trading price of the preferred shares. Monitoring the fund's performance relative to the broader market and its peer group provides context to the fund's competitive position and potential market impact. 03/11/2024 - 04:45 PM PHILADELPHIA, PA / ACCESSWIRE / March 11, 2024 / The Board of Trustees of abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (the ""Fund""), has declared a cash distribution of $0.328125 per share of the Fund's 5.250% Series A Perpetual Preferred Shares (NYSE:ACP PRA) (""Series A Preferred Shares"").

Financial Analyst Telecom Argentina's financial results for FY23 reveal a net loss of P$249,687 million, an improvement from the previous fiscal year's net loss of P$640,379 million. Despite the challenging economic environment, characterized by a significant inflation rate of 211.4% as of December 2023, the company managed to improve its margin over revenues to 28.1% in FY23, up from 27.5% in FY22. This was achieved through effective management of operating costs, which declined by 10.1% in real terms compared to FY22.However, the company's net financial debt increased by 41.1% in constant currency compared to FY22, largely due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso against the US dollar. The acquisition of a 100MHz block of 5G spectrum in the 3.5GHz band represents a significant investment in future growth, accounting for 27.6% of the company's consolidated revenues. This strategic move positions Telecom Argentina to capitalize on the next generation of mobile technology, although it also contributes to the increase in net financial debt.Investors should note the company's resilience in maintaining service revenues, with a smaller decrease of 10.1% compared to FY22's 11.7% drop. This suggests that despite the economic headwinds, Telecom Argentina is maintaining its competitive position in the market. The company's performance, particularly the improvement in margin over revenues and the reduction in operating costs, indicates a robust operational strategy that may mitigate some of the negative impacts of the inflationary environment on the business. Market Research Analyst The telecommunications sector in Argentina is highly competitive and subject to economic fluctuations. Telecom Argentina's FY23 results show a mixed performance with stable customer bases in the fixed segment and a growth in mobile subscribers by 760 thousand compared to FY22. The decrease in broadband and cable TV subscribers, albeit marginal, reflects a challenging market environment and possibly a shift in consumer preferences towards alternative digital platforms.The strategic acquisition of 5G spectrum is a forward-looking investment that could enhance the company's service offerings and potentially lead to increased market share. However, it is essential to monitor how effectively the company can monetize this investment amidst the country's economic volatility. The award by Ookla for the fastest mobile network in Argentina for the fifth consecutive time is a positive indicator of the company's service quality, which can be a differentiator in retaining and attracting customers.Furthermore, the expansion in the company's virtual wallet service, Personal Pay, suggests a diversification of revenue streams, which could be crucial in a landscape where traditional telecommunications services are becoming commoditized. The growth of over 2 million customers in Personal Pay demonstrates the potential for cross-selling and increased customer engagement through digital financial services. Economist Telecom Argentina's financial statements, adjusted for inflation in accordance with IAS 29, reflect the broader economic challenges faced by Argentina, including a significant annual inflation rate of 211.4% by the end of 2023. The company's revenue decline in constant currency terms and the substantial devaluation of the Argentine peso underscore the volatile macroeconomic conditions.The improvement in operating margins despite these conditions is notable, but it is crucial to consider the sustainability of such margins in the long run, especially if inflation continues to erode purchasing power and consumer demand. The company's increasing net financial debt is a concern, as it may limit future investment capacity and increase vulnerability to further currency fluctuations.Investors should remain cautious about the potential risks associated with high inflation, currency devaluation and regulatory changes, such as the nullity of Decree 690/2020, which could impact the company's pricing strategies and cost structures. The company's ability to navigate these economic and regulatory challenges will be critical to its long-term financial health and stock performance. 03/11/2024 - 04:31 PM Note: For the figures included in the FFSS, the Company has accounted for the effects of inflation adjustment adopted by Resolution 777/18 of the Comisión Nacional de Valores (""CNV""), which establishes that the restatement will be applied to annual financial statements, interim and special periods ending as of December 31, 2018 inclusive. Accordingly, the reported figures corresponding to FY23 include the effects of the adoption of inflationary accounting in accordance with IAS 29. Finally, comments related to variations of results of FY23 and vs. FY22 mentioned in this press release correspond to ""figures restated by inflation"" or ""constant"".It should be noted that the results presented on a comparative basis (December 2022) include the effect of the year-over-year inflation as of December 2023, which was 211.4%.Even with a scenario of strong inflationary acceleration, Service Revenues improved in real terms. In FY22 was observed a variation of -11.7% vs. FY21, while in FY23 was observed a variation of -10.1% compared to FY22, amounting $1,905,932. The Company's Consolidated Revenues amounted to $2,059,101 million in FY23 (-9.3% in constant currency compared to FY22).The fixed segment customer base remained stable during the last quarters of 2023, reversing the trend observed at the beginning of the year. Mobile subscribers in Argentina reached 21 million in FY23 (+760 thousand vs. FY22), cable TV subscribers totaled 3.1 million in the same period (-115 thousand vs. FY22), while broadband accesses amounted to 4.1 million (-42 thousand vs. FY22).The margin over revenues has improved, even in the challenging context in Argentina, registering 28.1% in FY23 (compared to 27.5% in FY22). This variation is due to the effective management of Operating Costs before Depreciation, Amortization, and Impairment of Fixed Assets, which experienced a strong decline in real terms during FY23 (-10.1% vs FY22). In FY23, Operating Income before Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment of Fixed Assets (""Operating Income Before D, A & I"") amounted to P$579,396 million (-7.1% vs. FY22).As a result of the strong devaluation of the Argentine peso against the US dollar in real terms, during the FY23, the Company recorded a net loss of P$249,687 million (vs. a loss of P$640,379 million in FY22) mainly explained by exchange differences losses included in Financial Results.Investments in 2023 include the acquisition of the 100MHz block of 5G spectrum in the 3.5GHz band during October. As a result, investments (including right-of-use assets) amounted to P$568,817 million in FY23, which represents 27.6% of our Consolidated Revenues. CAPEX (excluding right-of-use assets) during the FY23 represented 23.5% of Consolidated Revenues.Net Financial Debt increased due to the strong devaluation in real terms that occurred in December 2023 amounting to P$1,849,559 million in FY23 (+41.1% in constant currency vs. FY22). Additionally, this increase is partially attributed to the acquisition of funds for 5G spectrum financing.*Market capitalization as of March 8, 2024 **Unaudited non-financial informationBUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA / ACCESSWIRE / March 11, 2024 / Telecom Argentina S.A.

These loans establish, among other provisions, the obligation to comply with certain financial ratios, which are calculated based on contractual definitions: i) ""Net Debt/EBITDA"" and ii) ""EBITDA/Interest Net"" on a quarterly basis, along with the presentation of the Company's financial statements.Considering the complexity of Argentina's economic situation (for further reference, refer to note 29 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023) which prevented the early and accurate estimation of the ratios, the Company requested and obtained from its lenders a waiver with respect to its obligation to present the calculation of the Net Debt/EBITDA ratio until March 15, 2024. This waiver was conditioned upon certain obligations during such period, which have been met to date.During March 2024, the Company requested and obtained from the lenders new waivers effective until March 31, 2025, which allowed to increase the Net Debt/EBITDA maintenance ratio above the originally established level (raising it to 3.75), for the calculation period between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, inclusive, establishing a maximum Net Debt of US$2,700 billion on each calculation date, among other matters.Additionally, during the term of the waivers, the payment of dividends will be allowed during the period between October 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024, establishing a maximum distribution amount of up to US$100 million, as long as a Net Debt/EBITDA maintenance ratio of less than 3 is met.As of December 31, 2023, the Company is in compliance with the Net Debt/EBITDA maintenance ratio established in the waivers obtained in March 2024, as well as with the rest of the commitments assumed and in force as of the date of submission of these earnings reports.******* Telecom Argentina is a leading telecommunications company in Argentina, where it offers, either itself or through its controlled subsidiaries local and long distance fixed-line telephone, cellular, data transmission, and pay TV and Internet services, among other services.

Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting https://www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Principal Risk Factors: You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. ETF shares may trade at a discount to net asset value and possibly face delisting. All or a portion of a fund's otherwise tax exempt interest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal and state alternative minimum tax. Securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility and be less liquid than larger, more established companies whereas large capitalization companies may grow at a slower rate than the overall market. A fund that effects all or a portion of its creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind may be less tax efficient. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. A fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss. In managing a fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, country, region, industry, or sector may be more affected by an adverse economic or political development than a broadly diversified fund. Commodity prices can have a significant volatility and exposure to commodities can cause the value of a fund's shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and unpredictable manner. Certain securities are subject to call, credit, extension, income, inflation, interest rate, prepayment and zero coupon risks. These risks could result in a decline in a security's value and/or income, increased volatility as interest rates rise or fall and have an adverse impact on a fund's performance. The use of listed and OTC derivatives, including futures, options, swap agreements and forward contracts, can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. Securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risk may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A fund may invest in the shares of other funds, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying funds. First Trust Advisors L.P. (FTA) is the adviser to the First Trust fund(s). FTA is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the distributor of the fund(s).

(AMST) announces a five-year partnership with Joliet Junior College (JJC) to enhance educational capabilities and drive economic impact. This collaboration aims to generate significant revenue through partnerships across the country. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Amesite Inc. and Joliet Junior College (JJC) represents a strategic initiative to expand Amesite's market penetration within the educational sector. By aligning with a respected institution like JJC, Amesite is leveraging the college's established reputation and community trust to foster growth and enhance its service offerings. This move is likely to be observed positively by investors, as it reflects the company's proactive approach to capturing new market segments and diversifying revenue streams.From a market perspective, the education technology (EdTech) sector has been experiencing significant growth, driven by the increasing demand for digital and remote learning solutions. Amesite's cloud-based platform is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The five-year duration of the partnership indicates a long-term commitment, which could provide stable and recurring revenue for Amesite, offering a potential uplift in its financial projections and stock valuation over time. Financial Analyst Amesite's announcement of a 'no setup-fee offer' is an aggressive market penetration strategy, which seems to be yielding results with JJC being the fourth announced partnership. This strategy may lead to an initial increase in operational costs due to the waived fees, but it could also result in a higher volume of long-term contracts. The focus on generating 'significant revenue' suggests that Amesite is confident in its ability to monetize these partnerships effectively.Investors should monitor the impact of these partnerships on Amesite's balance sheet, particularly the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer. If the LTV significantly exceeds the CAC, this would indicate a healthy return on investment. However, investors must also consider the risk of dilution if Amesite requires additional capital to support its expansion before these partnerships become profitable. Educational Technology Expert The collaboration between Amesite and JJC highlights the importance of technology in modernizing educational institutions and meeting the evolving needs of the workforce. Amesite's AI-driven platform could offer JJC the tools to deliver personalized and scalable learning experiences, which is a competitive advantage in the EdTech space. The potential economic impact mentioned by JJC's representative suggests that the partnership is not only a business venture but also aims to contribute to community development through enhanced educational services.Understanding the specifics of the platform's capabilities, such as adaptive learning algorithms and data analytics, is crucial for stakeholders. These features could improve student engagement and outcomes, thereby strengthening JJC's position as a leading educational provider and, by extension, enhancing Amesite's reputation and market share. The success of this partnership could serve as a case study for Amesite's platform efficacy, influencing future deals with other educational institutions. 03/11/2024 - 05:11 PM DETROIT, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ: AMST), a leading artificial intelligence software company offering a cloud-based learning platform for business and education markets, announces a five-year partnership with Joliet Junior College (JJC).

This exclusivity covers all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression, reflecting a significant clinical benefit on kidney function.","Everest Medicines' Partner Calliditas Therapeutics Announces U.S. FDA Grants an Additional Seven-Year Orphan Drug Exclusivity Period for Nefecon® Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Everest Medicines' licensing partner, Calliditas Therapeutics, has received a seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period from the U.S. FDA for Nefecon®, a drug to reduce kidney function loss in adults with primary IgAN. This exclusivity covers all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression, reflecting a significant clinical benefit on kidney function. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The orphan drug exclusivity granted to Nefecon® by the U.S. FDA is a significant competitive advantage, as it prevents the FDA from approving generic versions of the drug for the same indication until December 2030. This exclusivity could potentially lead to higher pricing power and market control for Calliditas Therapeutics and its licensing partner Everest Medicines in the U.S. market. For investors, this development is promising as it may translate into steady revenue streams over the exclusivity period for the companies involved.Given the 5 million IgAN patients in mainland China and the drug's successful commercialization in Macau, the imminent launch in mainland China represents a substantial market opportunity. The commercial success in China, however, will depend on factors such as pricing, market access and reimbursement policies. Additionally, the orphan drug status in South Korea could indicate an expansion strategy for Nefecon® in other Asian markets, which could further increase the drug's revenue potential. Medical Research Analyst Primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a chronic kidney disease that can lead to end-stage renal failure. The therapeutic market for IgAN has been limited due to a lack of effective treatments, making Nefecon®'s FDA approval for this indication a significant breakthrough. The clinical benefit of reducing kidney function loss in adults with IgAN addresses a high unmet medical need, which could lead to a strong uptake among healthcare providers and patients.The clinical benefit of preserving kidney function and delaying disease progression is critical for patient outcomes and can potentially reduce the long-term healthcare costs associated with kidney transplants and dialysis. This aspect may resonate with payers and insurance companies, possibly facilitating favorable reimbursement decisions. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the FDA's orphan drug exclusivity are multifaceted. Firstly, the exclusivity period allows Calliditas and Everest Medicines to recoup R&D investments and capitalize on the drug's market potential without immediate generic competition. Secondly, the approval with a new indication could lead to patent life extension strategies, further strengthening the companies' intellectual property portfolio.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Nefecon® in the U.S. and China, as these are key markets that will drive revenue growth. The financial performance of both Calliditas and Everest Medicines could see a significant impact from sales of Nefecon®, which should be reflected in future earnings reports and potentially in the companies' stock valuations. 03/11/2024 - 09:28 PM SHANGHAI, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Everest Medicines (HKEX 1952.HK, ""Everest"", or the ""Company"")'s licensing partner Calliditas Therapeutics AB (Nasdaq: CALT, Nasdaq Stockholm: CALTX) (""Calliditas"") announced that the U.S. FDA has granted an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years for Nefecon®, expiring in December 2030 based on Calliditas obtaining full approval with a new indication for this drug product in December 2023. Following full approval in December 2023, Nefecon® is indicated ""to reduce the loss of kidney function in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk for disease progression"". The exclusivity period reflects the new indication covering all adult patients with primary IgAN at risk of disease progression based on a confirmed reduction of kidney loss reflecting a clinical benefit on kidney function for adult patients with primary IgAN. ""We congratulate our partner for receiving seven more years of market exclusivity for Nefecon® in the US, which is a further testament of FDA's recognition of the drug's capability to preserve kidney function and significantly delay disease progression for all adult patients,"" said Rogers Yongqing Luo, Chief Executive Officer of Everest Medicines. ""Nefecon® represents a revolutionary first-in-disease therapeutic option for Chinese patients who have more rapid disease progression in IgAN with no effective treatment options. Following its NDA approval in mainland China in November and successful commercialization in Macau in December, we now look forward to Nefecon®'s imminent commercial launch in mainland China to make the drug available to 5 million IgAN patients as soon as possible."" South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety granted Orphan Drug Designation status for Nefecon® in November 2022. About Nefecon® Nefecon® is a patented oral, delayed release formulation of budesonide, a corticosteroid with potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity that undergoes substantial first pass metabolism. The formulation is designed as a delayed release capsule that is enteric coated so that it remains intact until it releases budesonide to the distal ileum. Each capsule contains coated beads of budesonide that target mucosal B-cells present in the ileum where the disease originates, as per the predominant pathogenesis models. In June 2019, Everest Medicines entered into an exclusive, royalty-bearing license agreement with Calliditas, which gives Everest Medicines exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Nefecon® in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. The agreement was extended in March 2022 to include South Korea as part of Everest Medicine's territories.

Humana Prices $2.25 Billion Debt Offering,2024-03-12T00:21:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) priced a public offering of $2.25 billion in senior notes, with $1.25 billion due in 2031 and $1.00 billion due in 2054. The company expects net proceeds of approximately $2.226 billion for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment.","Humana Prices $2.25 Billion Debt Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) priced a public offering of $2.25 billion in senior notes, with $1.25 billion due in 2031 and $1.00 billion due in 2054. The company expects net proceeds of approximately $2.226 billion for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Humana Inc.'s public offering of $2.25 billion in senior notes is a significant financial event that will likely have a material impact on the company's capital structure. The senior notes, with fixed interest rates of 5.375 percent and 5.750 percent and varying maturities, represent a substantial influx of capital. The immediate effect of this capital raise could lead to a reevaluation of Humana's creditworthiness and debt profile by credit rating agencies and investors.From a financial perspective, the pricing of the notes at just below par suggests a relatively standard market appetite for such debt instruments. The use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential repayment of existing indebtedness, indicates a strategic move by Humana to optimize its debt portfolio, potentially lowering interest expenses and extending maturities of its liabilities, which can improve financial flexibility.Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the impact of this debt issuance on Humana's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics, as these are critical indicators of financial health in the healthcare insurance industry. A successful offering could enhance Humana's liquidity position, but it also increases the firm's long-term obligations, which requires careful management to maintain financial stability. Market Research Analyst The health insurance industry is capital-intensive, with companies like Humana Inc. requiring significant funding to manage operational costs and strategic investments. The announcement of the senior notes offering might be interpreted as a signal of Humana's growth intentions or a need to refinance existing debt at more favorable terms. Market research indicates that the appetite for corporate debt is influenced by macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates and market liquidity. Given the fixed interest rates on the senior notes, the offering's timing might reflect an attempt to lock in rates before potential increases.Moreover, the involvement of prominent financial institutions as active joint book-running managers could be seen as a vote of confidence in Humana's creditworthiness and the attractiveness of the offering. The market's reception to this offering will provide insights into investor sentiment towards the healthcare sector and debt market conditions. A successful closing of the offering could also set a benchmark for other companies in the industry considering similar capital-raising activities. Legal Expert The legal implications of Humana's senior notes offering are rooted in compliance with SEC regulations. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, which allows for a more streamlined process and quicker access to the capital markets when needed. This suggests that Humana's management is strategically prepared for capital raising activities, adhering to the necessary legal frameworks to facilitate timely financial transactions.The cautionary statement included in the announcement is a standard disclaimer to mitigate legal risk, emphasizing that the offering is not an attempt to bypass securities law requirements. It ensures that the offering is only conducted in jurisdictions where it is lawful and underlines the importance of registration and qualification under relevant securities laws. Potential investors are directed to the prospectus and related prospectus supplement for detailed information, which is a critical legal step to ensure transparency and investor protection. 03/11/2024 - 08:21 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Humana Inc. (the “company”) (NYSE: HUM) announced today that it has priced a public offering of $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. These senior notes are comprised of $1.25 billion of the company’s 5.375 percent senior notes, due 2031, at 99.940 percent of the principal amount and $1.00 billion of the company’s 5.750 percent senior notes, due 2054, at 99.949 percent of the principal amount (collectively, the “Senior Notes Offerings”). The Senior Notes Offerings are expected to close on March 13, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The company expects net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings will be approximately $2.226 billion after deducting underwriters’ discounts and estimated offering expenses. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under its commercial paper program. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, PNC Capital Markets LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as active joint book-running managers for the Senior Notes Offerings.

An electronic copy of the registration statement and prospectus supplement, together with the base prospectus, is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Cautionary Statement This news release includes forward-looking statements regarding Humana within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, SEC filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana’s executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following: If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana’s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. The company continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary adjustments to its reserves, including premium deficiency reserves, where appropriate. These estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. Accordingly, Humana’s reserves may be insufficient. If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, which are of particular importance given the concentration of the company's revenues in these products, state-based contract strategy, the growth of its CenterWell business, and its integrated care delivery model, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected. In addition, there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its Star ratings in future years. If Humana, or the third-party service providers on which it relies, fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically maintain existing or implement new information systems, to protect Humana’s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, contain such attacks when they occur, or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt the company’s operations or in the unintentional dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected. Humana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government), governmental and internal investigations, and routine internal review of business processes any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company’s cost of doing business. As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government healthcare programs including, among other things, loss of material government contracts; governmental audits and investigations; potential inadequacy of government determined payment rates; potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company’s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business; or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates. Changes to the risk adjustment model utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to adjust premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans or retrospective recovery by CMS of previously paid premiums as a result of the final rule related to the risk adjustment data validation audit methodology published by CMS on January 30, 2023 (Final RADV Rule), which Humana believes fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and violates the Administrative Procedure Act due to its failure to include a “Fee for Service Adjuster”, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results, financial position and cash flows. Humana’s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company's cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on Humana’s results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company’s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company’s medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company’s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company’s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments); the company’s financial position (including the company’s ability to maintain the value of its goodwill); and the company’s cash flows. Humana’s failure to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company’s business may be adversely affected. Humana faces significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to the company’s success, and its failure to do so could adversely affect the company’s businesses, operating results and/or future performance. Humana’s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations and supply chain risks in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses. Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana’s financial performance. Humana’s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations. Downgrades in Humana’s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Volatility in the securities and credit markets, including changes in interest rates, may significantly and adversely affect the value of Humana’s investment portfolio and the investment income that Humana derives from this portfolio. In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Humana advises investors to read the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance.

Negative None. 03/11/2024 - 11:23 PM Company Aims to Lead Shift to Software-Defined Robotics SEOUL, South Korea, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- LG Electronics (LG) is making a strategic investment move to expedite the advancement of its capabilities in service robotics, a key new business area of the company. LG has executed a stock purchase agreement to acquire a stake in Bear Robotics, a prominent Silicon Valley-based startup specializing in AI-driven autonomous service robots, through an investment of USD 60 million. Rather than seeking short-term returns, this strategic investment is aimed at bolstering LG's portfolio for long-term growth. Upon closing the stock purchase, the company will hold the largest portion of shares in Bear Robotics on a single-shareholder basis. At CES 2024, LG's CEO William Cho had discussed such potential equity investments, stating, ""In the service robotics market, we're focusing primarily on areas such as delivery and logistics. However, we are carefully considering future directions, keeping open the possibility of equity investments or mergers and acquisitions."" Founded in 2017 under the leadership of CEO John Ha, a former Senior Software Engineer and Technical Lead at Google, Bear Robotics has gained recognition for its AI-powered indoor delivery robots catering to markets in the United States, South Korea and Japan. The company boasts a team of skilled engineers, including its co-founder and CTO, with backgrounds in prominent tech companies. Notably, Bear Robotics is drawing attention for its expertise in platformizing service robotics software, robot fleet management technology and cloud-based control solutions. Leading the Shift to Software-Defined Robotics and Enhancing Synergy in Robot Business LG is preparing for a transition towards Software-defined Robotics (SDR), a shift from hardware to software emphasis, similar to what has been observed in the mobility industry. In anticipation of future growth, the company is committed to developing scalable service robots on an open architecture software platform so that it may cater to a variety of environments, recognizing the critical importance of standardizing AI-based autonomous robot platforms. With this understanding, LG views this strategic investment as a pivotal opportunity to propel its robot business capabilities. With years of experience in the robot business, LG has accumulated expertise in deploying robot solutions across various commercial spaces such as airports, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, retail stores, museums, smart warehouses and golf courses. LG operates a facility dedicated to the production of service robots at the LG Future Park in Gumi and boasts world-class capabilities in management of quality, supply chain and customer services. By combining Bear Robotics' world-class R&D talents and software platform expertise with its own strengths, LG aims to spearhead efforts in standardizing robot platforms to significantly reduce market-entry costs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and fostering synergies. ""Just as Android revolutionized the smartphone era, standardized open platforms are essential for the activation of the robot market,"" remarked Bear Robotics CEO John Ha. Charting a Course for Future Growth in the Service Robotics Market In recent years, LG has strategically reallocated resources towards high-growth sectors for the future, aligning with market dynamics and the strategic significance of its business models. The investment in Bear Robotics epitomizes LG's dedication in accelerating the advancement of its service robot sector, a pivotal component of its future growth strategy. LG has been nurturing its robot business as one of its future core pillars. From the deployment of guide robots at Incheon International Airport in 2017, it has progressively introduced tailored solutions for diverse commercial settings, encompassing delivery and disinfection functionalities. Since the preceding year, LG has actively pursued expansion into international markets including the United States, Japan and Southeast Asia. The service robotics market is expected to experience rapid growth, propelled by the rapid advancement of technologies such as AI and communication. On a global scale, the market is anticipated to grow from USD 36.2 billion in 2021 to USD 103.3 billion by 2026. Last year, LG unveiled its Future Vision 2030, outlining its goal of evolving into a Smart Life Solution Company that can seamlessly connect and expand customer experiences across various domains, including home, commercial, mobility and virtual spaces. Aligned with this vision, LG aims to achieve the 'Triple Seven' goal: an average growth rate and operating profit of seven percent or more, alongside an enterprise value translating into an EBITDA ratio of seven. ""As the service robot market enters a period of growth, this equity investment will significantly contribute to securing a 'Winning Competitive-edge' for the company,"" emphasized Lee Sam-soo, chief strategy officer at LG Electronics. ""From a mid- to long-term perspective, we will seek to develop our robot business into a new growth engine, exploring various opportunities through the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Embodied AI and robotic manipulation.""

Financial Analyst The recent financial results and funding activities of enGene Holdings Inc. highlight several key aspects that are of interest to investors and market analysts. The oversubscribed private financing of $200 million at a significant premium is a strong indicator of investor confidence in the company's prospects, particularly in the development of EG-70 for NMIBC. The capital raise is expected to extend the company's cash runway into 2027, which is a critical factor in assessing the company's financial health and ability to continue operations without the immediate need for additional funding.The increase in operating expenses, primarily in research and development, is consistent with the company's focus on advancing its lead product candidate through pivotal studies. This investment in R&D is necessary for the progression of EG-70 and can potentially lead to a successful BLA filing, which is a significant milestone for any biotech company. However, the increase in net loss year-over-year, despite higher cash reserves, reflects the costly nature of clinical development and underscores the importance of the recent financing in maintaining the company's trajectory. Medical Research Analyst The interim data from the LEGEND study of EG-70 in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, anticipated in mid-2024, is a critical event that could significantly impact the company's valuation and future prospects. A 73% complete response rate reported in Phase 1 trials is promising and above industry norms for NMIBC treatments. The success in this study could not only lead to potential FDA approval but also set a new standard in the treatment for NMIBC. The company's non-viral approach to genetic medicines also differentiates it from competitors and may offer advantages in terms of scalability and ease of use.It is also important to consider the implications of the CEO's announced resignation. Leadership transitions can introduce uncertainty, but the company's proactive approach to succession planning and the retention of the outgoing CEO as a strategic advisor may mitigate potential negative impacts on the company's strategic direction and investor confidence. Market Research Analyst enGene's strategic focus on expanding its pipeline and exploring new R&D programs is indicative of a long-term growth strategy. The company's ability to attract top-tier investors and expand its debt facility with Hercules Capital suggests a favorable market perception and financial flexibility. It is important to monitor how these funds are allocated towards pipeline expansion and whether the company can maintain its momentum in a competitive landscape.Furthermore, the announcement of a new indication for EG-70 in the first half of 2024 could open additional market opportunities and diversify the company's portfolio. This expansion into new indications is a common strategy to maximize the potential of a lead asset and can be a significant driver of future revenue. 03/11/2024 - 05:16 PM Pivotal phase 2 LEGEND study of EG-70 in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) remains on track with interim data anticipated in mid-2024 Closed a $200 million oversubscribed private financing, expected to extend cash runway into 2027 BOSTON and MONTREAL, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - enGene Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: ENGN or ""enGene"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company whose non-viral, intravesical lead product candidate, EG-70, is in a pivotal study for BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended January 31, 2024. ""This is an exciting time for the Company as we move closer to realizing our vision of mainstreaming genetic medicines to address diseases with high unmet clinical needs. EG-70 was designed from the ground up to achieve this vision as a readily scalable, easy to use product candidate without the onerous storage and handling requirements typical of viral approaches. Our previously announced Phase 1 data for EG-70 in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC demonstrated an encouraging safety profile and a 73% complete response rate at any time, which has garnered significant enthusiasm from patients, the urology community, and investors,"" said Jason Hanson, Chief Executive Officer of enGene. ""We are proud to enter our second quarter as a public company with significant momentum, having raised $200 million from top tier investors in a private financing in February. With existing cash and cash equivalents expected to fund the current operating plan into 2027, we believe enGene is well-positioned to complete the ongoing pivotal-stage LEGEND study of EG-70 in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, execute on our plan to file our BLA in the first quarter of 2026, and pursue pipeline expansion via additional EG-70 development opportunities and potential new R&D programs."" Recent Business Highlights: Completed $200 Million Oversubscribed Private Placement: On February 20, 2024, enGene completed the private placement of 20 million common shares at a price per share of $10.00, representing a 31% premium over the closing price prior to pricing the transaction (the ""February 2024 PIPE Financing""). The financing included participation from new and existing investors.Expanded Hercules Capital Debt Facility: On December 22, 2023, enGene announced the expansion of its existing debt facility with Hercules to up to $50 million, subject to certain milestones, with $22.5 million advanced at closing, of which approximately $8.6 million was applied to refinance in full the term loans outstanding under the prior loan agreement with Hercules.Key Leadership Hires, Board Additions and Succession Planning: enGene continued to build out its executive leadership with the appointment of Ryan Daws as Chief Financial Officer and Lee Giguere as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Additionally, Lota Zoth, CPA, was appointed to the Company's Board of Directors and serves as the Company's Audit Committee Chair.On February 14, 2024, enGene announced that due to personal family and health reasons, Jason Hanson intends to resign from his role as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors upon the appointment of a successor CEO.

Anticipated Milestones and Corporate Updates Announce a new indication and development plans for EG-70 in the first half of 2024.Interim data readout from the ongoing pivotal Phase 2 LEGEND study of EG-70 in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma-in-situ (Cis) in mid-2024.Initial efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 2 LEGEND study in a BCG-naive NMIBC cohort in the second half of 2024.First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Cash and cash equivalents, as of January 31, 2024, were $85.6 million, compared to $81.5 million as of October 31, 2023. The Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents together with the recent net proceeds of $187.5 million from its February 2024 PIPE Financing will fund operating expenses and capital expenditures into 2027. Three Months ended January 31, 2024 Total operating expenses were $10.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to $4.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Research and development expenses increased by $2.0 million, mainly due to increasing CMC and clinical costs related to our pivotal EG-70 study. General and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million, primarily driven by headcount costs and professional fees such as legal, accounting and audit as the Company scales its G&A function to support the operation of a public company.For the three months ended January 31, 2024, net loss attributable to common shareholders was $10.7 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $8.6 million, or $13.29 per share, for the same period for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The increase in net loss is mainly attributed to the increase in operating expenses partially offset by net interest income earned during the period.About enGeneenGene is a clinical-stage biotechnology company mainstreaming genetic medicines through the delivery of therapeutics to mucosal tissues and other organs, with the goal of creating new ways to address diseases with high clinical needs. enGene's lead program is EG-70 for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (Cis) who are unresponsive or naïve to treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) – a disease with a high clinical burden.

Such a revision typically reflects an agency's confidence in a company's future performance and its ability to meet financial commitments. The affirmation of the 'Baa3' Issuer Credit Rating suggests a moderate credit risk, which is relevant for investors considering the risk-return profile of the company's debt instruments.From a market research perspective, the emphasis on PECO's high-quality portfolio of grocery-anchored open-air neighborhood and community shopping centers is crucial. The retail real estate sector has faced challenges due to the rise of e-commerce, but grocery-anchored centers tend to be more resilient, as they provide essential services that are less prone to online competition. The portfolio lease rates and tenant retention figures cited, which are indicative of operational strength, are particularly important for potential investors and current shareholders to consider. Financial Analyst The positive outlook revision by Moody's, accompanied by moderate leverage metrics and sound fixed charge coverage, paints a favorable picture of PECO's financial prudence and liquidity management. For investors, these factors are critical as they suggest the company is well-positioned to manage its debt and financial obligations, even in a slowing macroeconomic environment. The reference to good liquidity is also reassuring, as it implies that PECO has sufficient resources to cover short-term liabilities, which can be a buffer against market volatility.Investors should also take note of the consistency in ratings and outlook between Moody's and S&P Global Ratings, which affirmed a 'BBB-' Issuer Credit Rating earlier. Such consensus between major rating agencies can often strengthen investor confidence in the company's financial stability. Real Estate Investment Analyst The resilience of PECO's operating cash flows is a critical factor for long-term investment considerations in the real estate sector. The high proportion of revenue derived from grocery-anchored shopping centers, which historically exhibit stable demand, is a buffer against economic downturns. The strong tenant retention and high lease rates mentioned by Moody's are indicative of the company's competitive advantage within the retail real estate market.However, investors should also consider the potential risks associated with a heavy reliance on a single type of property, as shifts in consumer behavior or unforeseen events affecting the grocery sector could have a disproportionate impact on PECO's performance. Nonetheless, the positive rating outlook suggests that such risks are currently well-managed and do not outweigh the company's strengths. 03/11/2024 - 04:30 PM CINCINNATI, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phillips Edison & Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: PECO) (“PECO”), one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers, today announced that Moody's Ratings (""Moody's"") revised its rating outlook for PECO to ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable’ and affirmed the Company’s ratings, including the ‘Baa3’ Issuer Credit Rating. In its public announcement, Moody’s stated: “PECO’s ratings reflect its high-quality portfolio of open-air neighborhood and community shopping centers, the resilient operating cash flows generated by its grocery-anchored centers, moderate leverage metrics, sound fixed charge coverage and good liquidity.” In addition, Moody’s stated: “Moody’s expects PECO to continue reporting good operating performance over the next few quarters despite the slowing macroeconomic environment because of its portfolio mix. The high proportion of grocery-anchored shopping centers, 97.2% of PECO’s rental revenue in 2023, and the large share of the top grocers in its tenant mix have resulted in consistently high portfolio lease rates and strong tenant retention.” As previously announced, S&P Global Ratings revised in January 2024 its rating outlook for PECO to ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable’ and affirmed the Company’s ratings, including the ‘BBB-’ Issuer Credit Rating.

Adjusted net loss per diluted share was $0.10 in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from NN, Inc. show several key takeaways that are significant for investors and market analysts. Firstly, the reported record new business wins totaling $62.6 million in 2023 is a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory and ability to secure new contracts. This is a positive sign for future revenue streams and could potentially lead to upward revisions in the company's valuation.Secondly, the focus on free cash flow, with an increase of more than $21 million year-over-year, reflects the company's improved cash management and operational efficiency. Free cash flow is a critical metric as it shows how much cash the company is generating after accounting for capital expenditures, which can be used for paying down debt, dividends, or reinvesting in the business for further growth.Lastly, the outlook for 2024, with revenue projections between $485 million to $510 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $47 million to $55 million, provides a forward-looking perspective on the company's expected performance. This guidance is essential for analysts to project future earnings and assess the company's potential in meeting those targets. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the reported decline in fourth-quarter net sales by 4.6% and the overall decrease in net sales year-on-year by 1.9% may raise concerns about the company's market position and competitive dynamics. However, the increase in adjusted EBITDA margins from 6.6% to 8.9% suggests that NN, Inc. is becoming more efficient in its operations, which could offset concerns about top-line growth.The segment performance, with Power Solutions showing improved adjusted income from operations and Mobile Solutions experiencing a reduced adjusted loss, indicates differing trends within the company's portfolio. These insights are crucial for understanding the strengths and weaknesses across the company's product lines and can inform strategic decisions on where to focus investment and improvement efforts. Economist Considering the broader economic context, NN, Inc.'s performance and outlook must be contextualized within the current industrial manufacturing sector and macroeconomic conditions. The mention of favorable foreign exchange effects suggests that currency movements have had an impact on the company's financials, which is a factor that can vary significantly over time and must be monitored closely.Moreover, the company's ability to generate positive free cash flow during a period of economic uncertainty speaks to its resilience and operational agility. The management's focus on a capital efficient model and low-risk strategy to improve operations is particularly relevant in an environment where businesses are seeking to navigate inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and potential shifts in consumer demand. 03/11/2024 - 05:05 PM Business transformation continues; delivering record-setting new business wins in 2023 and significantly improved free cash flow performance Company provides sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow outlook for 2024 CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NN, Inc.

Additionally, we reset the bar on customer performance and already we are performing better with our customers. This is a tried and true path to future business expansion. We are really proud of our global team and our JV business as we are working as one team to reestablish leadership positions in multiple areas.” Bevis continued, “For the full year, we delivered approximately $12 million in free cash flow, which is an increase of more than $21 million year-over-year. Notably, we were able to achieve improved operating income and fairly flat adjusted EBITDA with a strong second half performance with the new game plan. Specific to the fourth quarter, we were also pleased with our big new business award performance. We are already in development and ramp up mode on many of these awards and are making technical advancements in many areas. This momentum has carried right into 2024, as our financial results showed step-change improvement in the second half of the year.

These efforts will ultimately help optimize our balance sheet. While we are encouraged by the early success across our transformation efforts, our improvements are just beginning. We remain committed to advancing and expanding our progress as we move forward. Our decisive actions are taking hold and I would like to thank all our NN team globally, whose dedication and hard work are driving our transformation.” Fourth Quarter GAAP Results Net sales were $112.5 million, a decrease of 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was primarily due to reduced volume, partially offset by higher customer pricing and favorable foreign exchange effects.

Adjusted income from operations for 2023 was $23.9 million compared to $20.1 million in 2022. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to facility closure savings and a legal settlement reached during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower volume. Mobile Solutions Net sales for 2023 were $303.3 million compared to $293.5 million in 2022, an increase of 3.3% or $9.8 million.

operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, and free cash flow. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplementary information about the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and integration related expenses, foreign-exchange impacts on inter-company loans, reorganizational and impairment charges. Over the past five years, we have completed several acquisitions, one of which was transformative for the Company, and sold two of our businesses. The costs we incurred in completing such acquisitions, including the amortization of intangibles and deferred financing costs, and these divestitures have been excluded from these measures because their size and inconsistent frequency are unrelated to our commercial performance during the period, and which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs. We exclude the impact of currency translation from these measures because foreign exchange rates are not under management’s control and are subject to volatility. Other non-operating charges are excluded as the charges are not indicative of our ongoing operating cost. We believe the presentation of adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, and free cash flow provides useful information in assessing our underlying business trends and facilitates comparison of our long-term performance over given periods.

The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. (a) Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations represents GAAP income (loss) from operations, adjusted to exclude the effects of restructuring and integration expense; non-operational charges related to acquisition and transition expense, intangible amortization costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, and when applicable, our share of income from joint venture operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from operations. (b) Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted to include income taxes, interest expense, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, interest rate swap payments and change in fair value that was recognized in earnings, change in fair value of preferred stock derivatives and warrants, depreciation and amortization, charges related to acquisition and transition costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans, restructuring and integration expense, costs related to divested businesses and litigation settlements, income from discontinued operations, and non-cash impairment charges, to the extent applicable. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry.

NN, Inc. estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the applicable statutory rates by tax jurisdiction unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment.

Independence Realty Trust Announces First Quarter 2024 Dividend,2024-03-11T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Independence Realty Trust, Inc. (IRT) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on April 19, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 29, 2024.","Independence Realty Trust Announces First Quarter 2024 Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Independence Realty Trust, Inc. (IRT) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on April 19, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Dividend declarations are a pivotal aspect of a company's financial health and investor relations strategy. In the case of Independence Realty Trust, Inc., the announcement of a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share represents not only a return of capital to shareholders but also signals the company's confidence in its ongoing cash flows and financial stability. This level of dividend can be assessed against the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, to determine sustainability. Moreover, consistent dividends or an increasing trend over time can be indicative of a company's mature stage in its business cycle, suggesting a steady income stream as opposed to a focus on growth and reinvestment.Investors typically view dividend-paying stocks as a source of steady income and such announcements can influence the stock's attractiveness, particularly among value investors. It's important to compare the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, to industry averages and fixed income alternatives to evaluate the relative investment appeal. However, it's also crucial to consider the opportunity cost of the capital being distributed as dividends, as opposed to being reinvested back into the company for potential growth opportunities or debt reduction. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Independence Realty Trust's dividend declaration can have several implications. Firstly, it may affect the stock's demand dynamics, as dividend announcements often attract income-focused investors. This can potentially increase trading volume around the ex-dividend date, which is the cutoff date to be eligible for the dividend payment. Additionally, the size and timing of the dividend can reflect the company's sector performance, especially in the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry, where regular income distributions are a key characteristic.Furthermore, the market will likely monitor the dividend coverage ratio, which measures a REIT's ability to pay dividends from its operating cash flow. A robust coverage ratio can reassure investors of the dividend's sustainability, while a lower ratio might raise concerns about future payouts. It's also essential to analyze the dividend in the context of the company's capital allocation strategy, including acquisitions, development projects and capital improvements, which can all impact long-term shareholder value. 03/11/2024 - 04:30 PM PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Independence Realty Trust, Inc.

Provides Operations Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Gran Tierra Energy Inc. announces a 6% increase in year-to-date production, with a strong operational update highlighting successful drilling campaigns in Colombia. The company is well-positioned to achieve its 2024 production guidance, with a focus on development and exploration programs. Positive 6% increase in year-to-date production to approximately 33,100 BOPD Successful drilling campaigns in Acordionero and Costayaco fields 2024 production guidance of 32,000 to 35,000 BOPD Costayaco development wells show promising results, with highest production since May 2019 Plans for near-field, high-impact exploration program in Ecuador Strong operational safety record with top safety metrics in Colombia Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported production increase of Gran Tierra Energy Inc., with a 6% rise from the previous quarter, is a significant metric for investors and market observers. This uptick reflects not only the success of the company's operational strategies but also its potential impact on future revenue streams. Given that production levels directly correlate with potential sales, this increase could imply an upward trajectory for Gran Tierra's financial performance, provided that oil prices remain stable or improve. It is also indicative of effective cost management, as the company has achieved these results with drilling costs below budget.Furthermore, the company's exploration updates suggest a strategic expansion into new territories, such as Ecuador, which could diversify its asset portfolio and mitigate geographical risks. The mention of material free cash flow generation from the Acordionero region underscores the company's ability to self-fund its growth initiatives, a positive indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. Investors might interpret these developments as a sign of robust management and a solid growth plan, which could influence the company's valuation and stock performance positively. Financial Analyst Gran Tierra's operational update, particularly the cost-effective drilling achievements, could have a material impact on the company's margins and profitability. Drilling wells below budget and in less time than anticipated, can significantly reduce capital expenditures, which is crucial for energy companies that face volatile commodity prices. The reduction in drill costs by approximately 51 percent since 2016 showcases the company's focus on operational excellence and cost reduction.The ability to generate free cash flow is a key metric for assessing a company's financial stability and its capacity to invest in growth without relying on external funding. This financial flexibility can be advantageous, especially in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Gran Tierra's emphasis on its 'Beyond Compliance' philosophy and the 'A' rating from MSCI might attract ESG-focused investors, potentially broadening the investor base and providing additional support to the stock's value. Energy Sector Analyst The operational update from Gran Tierra Energy Inc. reflects significant advancements in both production and exploration within the energy sector. The successful drilling campaigns in the Acordionero and Costayaco fields, coupled with the implementation of waterflood and polymer projects, demonstrate Gran Tierra's commitment to enhanced oil recovery techniques. These techniques are essential for maximizing output from mature fields and can lead to increased reserves and extended field life, which are critical for long-term sustainability in the oil sector.The move to replace jet pumps with electronic submersible pumps is a strategic decision aimed at increasing production efficiency. Such technological advancements are vital for maintaining competitiveness in the industry. Additionally, the company's expansion into Ecuador with a high-impact exploration program could signal a strategic move to capitalize on untapped resources, potentially leading to significant reserve additions and long-term growth prospects for the company and its stakeholders. 03/11/2024 - 05:19 PM 2024 Year-to-Date Total Company Average Production1 of Approximately 33,100 BOPD, 6% Percent Increase from Fourth Quarter 2023Total Current2 Company Average Production of Approximately of 35,200 BOPD CALGARY, Alberta, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:GTE)(TSX:GTE)(LSE:GTE) today announced an operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States dollars, and production amounts are on an average working interest before royalties (“WI”) basis unless otherwise indicated. Per barrel (“bbl”) and bbl of oil per day (“BOPD”) amounts are based on WI sales before royalties. Message to Shareholders Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented: “We are thrilled by the outcome to the start of our development drilling program so far in 2024. In particular, the performance of the Costayaco development wells serve as clear evidence of the field’s ongoing development potential, and confirming our geologic and reservoir modeling continues to be a predictive tool identifying development drilling opportunities that enhances oil recovery in a high-quality mature oil field. The current production in the Costayaco field is the highest achieved since May 2019. This positions the Company favorably as we enter 2024, as we eagerly initiate our near-field, high-impact exploration program in Ecuador, scheduled to commence in April.” Operations Update: Production: Gran Tierra’s average production year to date is approximately 33,100 BOPD as a result of successful drilling campaigns in both Acordionero and Costayaco, representing a 6% percent increase from Q4.Total company average production of approximately: January 2024: 31,300 BOPDFebruary 2024: 34,200 BOPDMarch2 2024: 35,200 BOPD Based on the 2024 budget, previously released on January 23, 2024, and these encouraging results, Gran Tierra is well positioned to achieve its 2024 production guidance of 32,000 to 35,000 BOPD. Colombia Development: Costayaco Development Campaign (Putumayo Basin): Since December 2023, Gran Tierra has drilled 5 wells of which 4 are oil producers and 1 is a water injector: The first well, CYC-56, has been on production with jet pump since early January 2024. During the period of January 6 to March 6, 2024, CYC-56 produced on jet pump at a stable average rate of 1,821 BOPD (30-degree API gravity) with a water-cut of 1% and a gas-oil ratio of 151 standard cubic feet (“scf”) per stock tank barrel.The second well, CYC-57, was spud on January 6, 2024, and reached final total depth on January 13, 2024. It was completed in the Villeta and Caballos formations and started production testing on January 22, 2024. During the period of January 22 – March 6, 2024, CYC-57 produced on jet pump at a stable average rate of 1,086 BOPD (29-degree API gravity) with a water-cut of 7% and a gas-oil ratio of 119 scf per bbl (“scf/bbl”).The third well, CYC-58, was spud on January 23, 2024, and reached final total depth on January 29, 2024. It was completed in the Villeta and Caballos formations and started production testing on February 8, 2024. During the period of February 8 – March 6, 2024, CYC-58 produced on jet pump at a stable average rate of 1,892 BOPD (29-degree API gravity) with a water-cut of 6% and a gas-oil ratio of 188 scf/bbl.The fourth well, CYC-59 was spud on February 8, 2024, and reached final total depth on February 19, 2024. It was completed in the Villeta and Caballos formations and started production testing on February 25, 2024. During the period of February 25 - March 6, 2024, CYC-59 produced on jet pump at a stable average rate of 694 BOPD (29-degree API gravity) with a water-cut of 42% and a gas-oil ratio of 289 scf/bbl.The fifth well, CYC-60, an injector, was spud on February 26, 2024, and reached final total depth on March 3, 2024. It will be completed in the Villeta and Caballos formations in Q2-2024 as a water injector.All 5 wells were drilled 13% below budget, on average for approximately $2.3 million, in approximately 11.5 days from spudding the well to final rig release. Notably, CYC-58 set a new field record for cost and time of approximately $1.9 million and in 8.7 days respectively.All wells are currently produced on a jet pump and in the third quarter the Company plans on replacing the jet pumps with electronic submersible pumps to increase drawn down and production. As a follow-up to the successful development program in the north of Costayaco, Gran Tierra will drill two additional development wells in the southern region based on the same concepts applied in the north which targeted un-swept/unrecovered oil. Drilling is expected to commence the second quarter of 2024. Acordionero Development Campaign (Middle Magdalena Valley Basin): An 11-well development drilling program was started in December 2023. All 11 wells have been drilled to date including 9 producers and 2 water injection wells. All wells are on production and the final injection well completion is underway. All 11 wells were drilled 17% below budget, on average for approximately $1.3 million, in approximately 6.1 days on average from spudding the well to final rig release. Notably, AC-122 was pacesetter and drilled for $1 million and in 4.2 days. The drill costs have decreased by approximately 51 percent since 2016.Production results were as expected and in line with our 2024 budget. With the successful implementation of the waterflood and encouraging results from the polymer project, Acordionero is expected to generate material free cash flow for years to come and will fund high growth assets such as Suroriente and the high impact, near field exploration program. Exploration Update: Following the completion of the Acordionero drilling program, Gran Tierra is now in the process of moving the drilling rig to Ecuador to commence its 2024 near-field high impact exploration program. Drilling is expected to commence in April in the Chanangue Block.The acquisition of a 238 square kilometers 3D seismic program on the Charapa block began in January.

The program aims to convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated, optimizing the pit and expanding potential. The discovery of a high-grade zone in the southern part of Abore showcases excellent results, with significant gold intercepts. The Company plans to update Mineral Reserves and provide 2024 production guidance. Positive None. Negative None. Geologist The discovery of a new high-grade gold zone at the Abore deposit by Galiano Gold Inc. is a significant geological event that has the potential to impact the company's resource estimates and future production capabilities. The presence of visible gold and high-grade intercepts such as 45 meters at 12.4 g/t gold suggests a substantial concentration of mineralization that could enhance the economic viability of the Asanko Gold Mine (AGM). The geological characteristics described, including hydrothermal alteration, quartz veining and arsenopyrite mineralization, are typical of orogenic gold deposits, which are known for their potential to host large, high-grade gold systems.From a geological perspective, the reported results could lead to an expansion of the mine's life and an increase in the asset's value. The fact that the mineralization remains open along strike and at depth indicates excellent prospects for further resource expansion, which is a common goal in the mining industry to extend the life of mines and improve project economics. Mining Analyst The reported drill results from Galiano Gold Inc. have immediate implications for the company's stock valuation and operational planning. High-grade intersections, such as those reported, are likely to be perceived positively by the market, as they indicate the potential for higher yield and lower production costs per ounce of gold, given the richer ore. The announcement of an upcoming update to the Abore Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, along with 2024 production and cost guidance, is of particular interest to investors and analysts who will be keen to understand how these results translate into tangible financial metrics.The strategic location of the Abore deposit, being directly on the haul road and near the AGM's processing plant, suggests lower capital and operational expenditure implications for the development of this resource. However, the actual impact on the company's financials will depend on the results of the pit optimization and redesign that are currently being evaluated. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Galiano Gold Inc.'s drilling results are multifaceted. The discovery of a new high-grade zone could lead to a revaluation of the company's assets and an increase in the net present value (NPV) of the AGM project. The market will also anticipate the effect of these results on the company's future cash flows and profitability. A potential increase in Mineral Reserves could result in a more robust production profile, positively influencing the company's revenue streams in the medium to long term.It is important to note that the costs associated with the follow-up drilling program and any necessary mine redesign will affect the company's short-term expenditures. Investors will need to balance the excitement of the discovery with the realities of the additional investment required to realize its full value. The upcoming update on Mineral Resources and Reserves, along with production and cost guidance, will be critical for evaluating the company's performance and growth potential. 03/11/2024 - 05:15 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Galiano Gold Inc. (""Galiano"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: GAU) (NYSE American: GAU) is pleased to provide an update on the 2023 drilling results at Abore following completion of an infill program at the Asanko Gold Mine (""AGM""), located in Ghana, West Africa. This drill program is highlighted by the discovery of a new high grade zone in the southern portion of the deposit and better than expected results spanning the entire 1,600 metre strike length of Abore. The Abore infill drilling programme consisted of 84 holes totalling 22,470 metres. It was designed to convert Inferred Mineral Resources below the current Mineral Reserve pit shell1 to the Indicated Mineral Resource category and evaluate the potential to optimize and/or expand the pit. Earlier positive results from this campaign were highlighted in a news release ""Galiano Gold Provides Asanko Gold Mine 2023 Exploration Program Update"" (see press release dated October 25, 2023). This program resulted in the discovery of a new high grade zone within the southern portion of Abore which was intersected in four drill holes over approximately 120 metres of strike length as shown in a series of cross sections in Figures 2 to 5 below. Intercepts in this zone are amongst the best ever intercepted at the AGM and include: Hole ABPC23-224: 45 metres @ 12.4 g/t gold from 191mHole ABPC23-226: 37 metres @ 10.6 g/t gold from 199mHole ABPC23-239: 54 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 207m Hole ABPC23-228: 41 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 191mThis new zone of mineralization is hosted primarily within the Abore granite and is characterized by significant hydrothermal alteration along with high density quartz veining, intense localized brecciation, disseminated arsenopyrite and visible gold. It remains open along strike in both directions and is untested at depth. A follow-up drill program is currently underway to test the extent of this zone. Robust mineralization was also intersected across the deposit as demonstrated by the following highlighted intercepts: Hole ABPC23-246: 18 meters @ 8.2 g/t gold from 172m Hole ABPC23-259: 24 meters @ 5.4 g/t gold from 263m Hole ABPC23-223: 27 meters @ 4.2g/t gold from 246mHole ABPC23-228: 41 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 191mHole ABPC23-213: 20 meters @ 4.5 g/t gold from 166mHole ABPC23-241: 23 meters @ 3.8 g/t gold from 156m Hole ABPC23-249: 19 meters @ 4.0 g/t gold from 273m ""These excellent results demonstrate that Abore has significant upside potential beyond the current Reserves,"" stated Chris Pettman, Galiano's Vice President of Exploration. ""Seeing significant intervals of high grade gold along the entire 1,600 metre strike length of the deposit, and the discovery of the new high grade south zone, gives us confidence that Abore will continue to grow and add considerable value to the AGM life of mine."" Matt Badylak, Galiano's President and Chief Executive Officer added, ""The results of this program are expected to affect the size and geometry of the Abore Reserve pit. The impact this will have on Mineral Reserves and ore delivery in 2024 is currently being evaluated through pit optimization and redesign. The Company plans to update Abore Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and provide 2024 production and cost guidance following the completion of this work in April."" Abore is located directly on the haul road approximately 13 kilometres north of the AGM's processing plant and has current Measured and Indicated Resources of 477,000 ounces @1.16 g/t gold and Inferred Resources of 131,000 ounces @1.14 g/t gold, as described in the Technical Report entitled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report and Feasibility Study for Asanko Gold Mine, Ghana"" with an effective date of December 31, 2022, and is available on SEDAR+1. The deposit sits along the Esaase shear corridor, which also hosts the Esaase deposit, and forms part of the northeast striking Asankrangwa gold belt. The geology of the deposit is characterized by a sedimentary sequence composed primarily of siltstones, shales and thickly bedded sandstones that has been intruded by a granite which lies parallel to the shear and dipping steeply to the northwest. The majority of mineralization is constrained to the granite, hosted in west dipping quartz vein areas developed primarily along the eastern margin of the granite/sediment contact.

(NASDAQ: IONM) announces the sale of certain IONM assets to MPOWERHealth for up to $4.5 million, with $2.5 million paid at closing. The deal includes healthcare contracts, clinical equipment, and employees, with a potential earnout payment. The sale aims to repurpose the business and facilitate the merger with Danam Health. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) assets by Assure Holdings to MPOWERHealth for up to $4.5 million represents a strategic divestiture that could reshape Assure's financial landscape. The immediate cash infusion of $2.5 million provides liquidity, which could be leveraged to streamline operations or reduce debt. The additional earnout of up to $2 million based on case volume indicates a performance-based agreement that aligns both parties' interests in the seamless transition of services and retention of case volume.From a valuation perspective, the transaction is significant given the scale of the payment relative to Assure's market capitalization and financials. It is essential to consider the impact on revenue streams, as the sale includes substantial healthcare facility contracts. Investors should scrutinize the company's next quarterly report to assess the financial implications, such as changes in revenue composition and potential cost savings from the reduced operational scope.Long-term, the strategic pivot towards merging with Danam Health suggests a reorientation of the company's business model. Stakeholders should monitor how this repurposing aligns with Assure's core competencies and growth prospects in the evolving healthcare services sector. Healthcare Industry Analyst The transaction reflects a consolidation trend within the healthcare industry, particularly in niche services like IONM. By acquiring Assure's IONM assets, MPOWERHealth is poised to enhance its market position as a leading provider. This could lead to improved bargaining power with healthcare facilities and payers, potentially driving down costs and improving margins.For Assure, retaining accounts receivable and the revenue cycle management team suggests a strategic focus on maintaining cash flow efficiency during the transition. However, the loss of clinical equipment and personnel could indicate a retreat from direct service provision in favor of a partnership or management model post-merger.Industry observers will be interested in how the asset sale impacts the competitive dynamics of the IONM market, including service pricing, technology adoption and quality of care. The ability of MPOWERHealth to integrate Assure's assets and maintain service quality will be critical to realizing the value of the acquisition. Market Research Analyst Assure's decision to sell its IONM assets aligns with broader market trends where companies are increasingly focusing on core competencies and divesting non-core assets. The transaction could signal to investors and competitors alike that Assure is seeking to optimize its portfolio in preparation for the merger with Danam Health.The market's reaction to this sale will depend on the perceived strategic fit of the merger with Danam Health and the potential for Assure to leverage its retained assets effectively. An analysis of the IONM market size, growth rates and competitive landscape is crucial to understand the implications of this divestiture for Assure's market position and future revenue potential.Additionally, the earnout component of the deal suggests confidence in the continued performance of the sold assets. This could be an indicator of the underlying health of the IONM market segment and its resilience in the face of industry changes. 03/11/2024 - 06:17 PM DENVER, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Assure Holdings Corp.

The transaction is set to be completed in the third quarter of 2024, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Alumina Limited by Alcoa represents a strategic consolidation within the metals sector, specifically impacting the bauxite and alumina markets. By acquiring Alumina Limited, Alcoa is poised to strengthen its position as a leading producer, which could lead to enhanced economies of scale and potentially lower production costs. The increase in market share and the combined entity's increased operational efficiency may provide a competitive advantage over other players in the industry.From a shareholder perspective, the transaction's all-scrip nature suggests a belief in the merged entity's future performance, as Alumina Limited's shareholders will receive Alcoa shares instead of cash. This could be indicative of a shared optimism regarding the future growth and profitability of the combined company. However, the dilution of Alcoa's current shareholders' equity must be considered, as they will now own a smaller percentage of a larger company.The long-term commitment to maintain the CDI listing on the ASX for at least 10 years demonstrates Alcoa's dedication to ensuring liquidity and accessibility for Alumina's Australian shareholder base. Additionally, the inclusion of Australian directors from Alumina Limited to Alcoa's Board may provide valuable insights into the Australian market and ensure a smooth integration of the companies' operations and cultures. Financial Analyst The agreed ratio of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share implies a valuation that investors will scrutinize closely, comparing it to industry benchmarks and historical performance metrics. The equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited, based on Alcoa's share price prior to the announcement, offers a quantifiable measure for evaluating the transaction's financial fairness.Investors will also be interested in the impact of the transaction on Alcoa's financials, including potential synergies that could lead to cost savings and revenue enhancement. The liquidity support agreement with Alumina Limited could be seen as a short-term risk mitigator, ensuring Alumina's participation in the AWAC joint venture remains stable during the transaction period.Regulatory approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board and antitrust regulators in Australia and Brazil is a critical hurdle that cannot be overlooked. Any delays or complications in this process could affect the transaction timeline and potentially the perceived benefits of the deal. Legal Expert The Scheme Implementation Deed between Alcoa and Alumina Limited is a legally binding agreement that sets the stage for the acquisition process. This type of agreement is typical in cross-border transactions and requires a thorough legal review to ensure compliance with the regulatory frameworks of all jurisdictions involved.The transaction is subject to the approval of both companies’ shareholders, which underscores the importance of corporate governance and shareholder rights in major corporate actions. The role of independent directors and the CEO of Alumina Limited in recommending the transaction highlights the need for impartial advice in assessing the deal's merits.Lastly, Alcoa's commitment to provide liquidity support to Alumina Limited, if required, is an interesting facet of the deal, showcasing the strategic use of corporate finance tools to facilitate a smooth transition and maintain operational stability. 03/11/2024 - 06:42 PM Alcoa enters into Scheme Implementation Deed with Alumina Limited on terms consistent with previously agreed and announced Process Deed Both Alcoa and Alumina Limited Boards of Directors recommend that its shareholders vote in favor of the transaction Expected to result in long-term value creation for both companies’ shareholders PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa (NYSE: AA or “Alcoa”) today announced that it has entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed (the “Agreement”) with Alumina Limited (ASX: AWC), under which Alcoa will acquire Alumina Limited in an all-scrip, or all-stock, transaction. The Agreement terms are consistent with the previously agreed and announced transaction process deed (“Process Deed”). Consistent with the Process Deed, the Alumina Limited Board of Directors has recommended that Alumina Limited shareholders vote in favor of the Agreement in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the transaction is in the best interests of Alumina Limited shareholders. The Independent Directors of Alumina Limited, and its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer intend to vote all shares of Alumina Limited held or controlled by them in favor of the Agreement. “Entering into the Scheme Implementation Deed to acquire Alumina Limited is a milestone on our path to deliver value for both Alcoa and Alumina shareholders,” said William F. Oplinger, Alcoa’s President and CEO. “This transaction provides enhanced opportunities for value creation, including strengthening Alcoa’s position as one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers and providing Alumina Limited shareholders the opportunity to participate in a stronger, better-capitalized combined company with upside potential. We look forward to building on Alcoa’s success and continuing to execute our long-term strategy.” Agreement Details The terms of the Agreement are consistent with the Process Deed. Accordingly, under the Agreement, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive consideration of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share (the “Agreed Ratio”). Upon completion of the transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders would own 31.25 percent, and Alcoa shareholders would own 68.75 percent of the combined company.1 Based on Alcoa’s closing share price as of February 23, 2024, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Process Deed, the Agreed Ratio implies a value of A$1.15 per Alumina Limited share and an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited. 2 As part of the Agreement, interests in Alcoa shares would be delivered in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDIs”) that represent a unit of beneficial ownership in a share of Alcoa common stock 3, which would allow Alumina Limited shareholders to trade Alcoa common stock via CDIs on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). In order to allow the trading of Alcoa CDIs, Alcoa will apply to establish a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. Alcoa has committed to maintain the CDI listing for at least 10 years. In addition, two new mutually agreed upon Australian directors from Alumina Limited’s Board would be appointed to Alcoa’s Board of Directors upon closing of the transaction. Under the terms of the Agreement and at Alumina's request, Alcoa has agreed to provide short-term liquidity support to Alumina Limited to fund equity calls made by the AWAC joint venture if Alumina Limited’s net debt position exceeds $420 million. Based on AWAC's current 2024 cashflow forecast, Alcoa does not expect any support to be required in the 2024 calendar year. Subject to certain accelerated repayment triggers, Alumina Limited would be required to pay its equity calls (plus accrued interest) not later than September 1, 2025 in the event the transaction is not completed. Allan Gray Australia, currently the largest substantial holder in Alumina Limited, has confirmed it continues to be supportive of the proposed transaction. Transaction Timing & Conditions The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions as well as approval by both companies’ shareholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals. The required regulatory approvals include approvals from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board and from the antitrust regulators in Australia and Brazil. The transaction is not conditional on due diligence or financing.

Positive: Net loss ratio improved by 11.4 points to 51.0%. Positive: Continued exposure management strategy with a decline in personal lines policies-in-force by 15.0%. Negative: Suspension of quarterly dividends to shareholders. Negative: No shares of common stock were repurchased during the quarter. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. show a substantial improvement in profitability, with a notable increase in net income and earnings per share. The net income leap from $12.5 million to $30.9 million, representing a 147.5% year-over-year increase, is particularly significant. This enhancement is likely attributed to strategic underwriting and rate adjustments, which have led to an increase in net premiums earned by 6.9%. Additionally, the net combined ratio's improvement to 84.9% from 96.1% suggests more efficient operations, as this metric indicates the profitability of the insurance operations after accounting for claims and expenses.Investors should note the intentional decrease in personal lines policies-in-force by 15%, which reflects a strategic shift to improve the quality of the business and manage reinsurance costs. While this may reduce short-term revenue potential, it could lead to a more stable and profitable business model in the long run. The book value per share increase by 42.1% year-over-year also indicates a stronger balance sheet, which could be a positive signal for investor confidence and company stability. Market Research Analyst Heritage's focus on selective growth and diversification is evident in their strategy to increase commercial residential premium by 63.9% year over year. This move is likely to reduce volatility in their portfolio, as commercial lines can offer more stable returns compared to personal lines, which are often more susceptible to loss events such as natural disasters. The strategic reduction in personal lines exposure in Florida by 16.3% aligns with the company's risk management strategy, given the state's high exposure to catastrophic events.Investors should be aware of the impact of these strategic decisions on the company's long-term growth prospects. By concentrating on underwriting profitability and rate adequacy, Heritage is positioning itself to potentially deliver consistent returns. However, the decline in policy count could impact market share and investor perceptions of growth potential in the short term. Economist The capital raise through a primary offering and the suspension of the quarterly dividend are indicative of a shift in capital allocation strategy. The injection of capital might be aimed at supporting growth initiatives or strengthening the balance sheet. However, the suspension of dividends could be perceived negatively by income-focused investors, as it suggests that the company is prioritizing internal investments over direct shareholder returns.From an economic perspective, the company's ability to raise capital in a potentially tightening monetary environment could signal confidence from investors in the company's strategic direction. The increase in book value per share and the positive trajectory of net income could contribute to a more favorable credit profile, which may lower the cost of capital for future endeavors. 03/11/2024 - 04:07 PM TAMPA, Fla., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HRTG) (""Heritage"" or the ""Company""), a super-regional property and casualty insurance holding company, today reported fourth quarter of 2023 financial results. Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights Fourth quarter net income of $30.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share improved from net income of $12.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an increase in net premiums earned, higher net investment income, and lower net losses incurred.Gross premiums earned of $339.6 million, up 7.0% from $317.3 million in the prior year quarter.Net premiums earned of $177.7 million, up 6.9% from $166.2 million in the prior year quarter.Net loss ratio of 51.0%, an improvement of 11.4 points from 62.4% in the prior year quarter.Net expense ratio of 33.9%, relatively flat from 33.7% in the prior year quarter.Net combined ratio of 84.9%, an improvement of 11.2 points from 96.1% in the prior year quarter.Continued successful exposure management strategy with intentional decline in personal lines policies-in-force of 15.0%, and a decline in personal lines total insured value (""TIV"") of 6.9% as compared to the prior year period.""Our strategic focus on achieving rate adequacy across our portfolio and driving superior underwriting results has been steadfast. Our deliberate efforts over the past two years resulted in a better quality and more diversified book of business, which more effectively manages reinsurance costs and drives lower claims related losses. Our commitment to enhanced and long-term relationships with our reinsurers, who are pivotal to our success, has also been a key aspect of our strategy,"" remarked Ernie Garateix, CEO of Heritage. ""These actions, the subsequent results and our recent capital raise position us well for selective growth going forward. As we look ahead, I am confident in our ability to maintain this momentum across our sixteen-state platform, driven by our solid foundation, strategic clarity, and the dedication of experienced workforce."" Strategic Profitability Initiatives The following provides an update to the Company's strategic initiatives that are expected for Heritage to achieve consistent long-term quarterly earnings and drive shareholder value. The Supplemental Information table included in this earnings release demonstrates progress made since fourth quarter 2022. Generate underwriting profit though rate adequacy and more selective underwriting. Significant rating actions across the book of business have favorably impacted it, resulting in an increase in average premium per policy of 24.2% over the prior year quarter and 4.5% over third quarter 2023.Gross premiums earned increased 7.0% over the prior year quarter, driven by rate actions taken in 2022 and 2023 across the book of business, as well as growth in commercial residential business, which helps drive the higher average premium.Premiums-in-force of $1.4 billion are up 5.6% from the prior year quarter while policy count is down 15.0% due to continued underwriting efforts aimed at rate adequacy, managing the reinsurance cost and improving the quality of the book of business.Continued focus on timely rate actions, tightening underwriting criteria, and expanding restrictions on new business written in over-concentrated markets or products.Allocate capital to products and geographies that maximize long-term returns.Selectively, we increased the commercial residential premium in force by 63.9% year over year, while the TIV only increased by 20.7%, and policies in force saw a modest increase of 3.0%. The commercial residential business, which tends to have a significantly lower attritional loss ratio, generates materially higher premiums. The increase in TIV, spurred by growth of the commercial residential business, is offset by a reduction in personal lines exposure, managing reinsurance costs effectively and contributing to underwriting income and return on equity. Commercial residential business accounts for 18.7% of the in-force premium, compared to 12.0% in the prior year period.As part of our exposure management strategy, reduced policy count for Florida personal lines business by 16.3% as compared to the prior year period. The disciplined underwriting and rating actions have reduced Florida personal lines TIV by 9.4% while reducing premiums in force by only 0.7% and improved the quality of our Florida book of business.This disciplined underwriting approach resulted in a policy count reduction of 14.4% in other states, with a reduction in TIV by 6.3%, resulting in a reduction in premiums in force of only 3.4%.Maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio.Selective diversification of the portfolio by product and state, which can change based on market conditions, serves to reduce performance volatility.No state represents over 26.5% of the Company's TIV.TIV for the top four states declined by 18.4%, while TIV for all other states increased by 88.0%.In-force premium for the four states with the highest TIV decreased by 4.6% while in-force premium for all other states grew by 89.4%.As a result of diversification efforts, personal lines TIV for the five states with the highest TIV decreased by 5.2% from the prior year period and represented 71.6% of all TIV at fourth quarter 2023 compared to 71.9% of all TIV at fourth quarter 2022.Provide coverage suitable to the market and return targets.Offering Excess & Surplus lines (""E&S"") policies in California, Florida, and South Carolina. This product allows greater flexibility in product terms as well as speed to market.Continuing to evaluate other states for E&S and other products.Capital Management On December 14, 2023, the Company completed a primary offering of 3,703,703 shares of its common stock at a public offer price of $6.75 per share. In a concurrent private placement, the Company issued 148,148 shares of its common stock to an investor at the public offering price. Additionally, the Company completed the purchase by one of its independent Directors and the Company's Director and CEO, of 40,871 and 27,247, shares of common stock, respectively, at $7.34, the closing price of common stock on December 14, 2023. Heritage's Board of Directors has decided to continue its suspension of the quarterly dividend to shareholders. The Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend distribution and stock repurchases on a quarterly basis. No shares of common stock were repurchased during the quarter.

Ratios Ceded premium ratio represents ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned. Net loss ratio represents net losses and loss adjustment expenses (""LAE"") as a percentage of net premiums earned. Net expense ratio represents policy acquisition costs (""PAC"") and general and administrative (""G&A"") expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned. Ceding commission income is reported as a reduction of PAC and G&A expenses. Net combined ratio represents the sum of net losses and LAE, PAC and G&A expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned. The net combined ratio is a key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty industry. A net combined ratio under 100% generally reflects profitable underwriting results. Fourth quarter 2023 Results Fourth quarter 2023 net income of $30.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share, an improvement from net income of $12.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. This improvement is attributable to the positive impact of rate actions, underwriting actions, and exposure management taken during 2023 and 2022, which favorably impacted results during 2023. These actions resulted in growth of 6.9% in net premiums earned, an increase of 36.1% in net investment income, and a reduction of 12.6% in net losses and LAE, described below, which was partly offset by elevated policy administration and general and administrative costs from the increase in gross premiums written over the prior year quarter as well as costs associated with a new claims system as described below.Premiums-in-force were $1.4 billion as of fourth quarter 2023, representing a 5.6% increase from fourth quarter 2022 due to continued proactive underwriting and rate actions as well as growth in commercial lines business, despite an intentional reduction of approximately 79,000 personal lines policies.Gross premiums written of $326.7 million were up 1.5% from $322.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting a strategic and substantial organic increase in Florida commercial residential lines business and a higher average premium per policy throughout the book of business from rating actions and use of inflation guard, which ensures appropriate property values, mostly offset by targeted exposure management.Gross premiums earned of $339.6 million, up 7.0% from $317.3 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher gross premiums written over the last twelve months as described above.Net premiums earned of $177.7 million, up 6.9% from $166.2 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher gross premium earned outpacing the increase in ceded premiums for the quarter.Ceded premium ratio of 47.7%, up 0.1 point from 47.6% in the prior year quarter driven by higher catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance costs that were partly offset by growth in gross premiums earned.Net loss ratio decreased to 51.0%, a 11.4 point decline from 62.4% in the same quarter last year reflecting higher net premiums earned and lower net losses and LAE. The improvement in net losses and LAE was largely due to diminished weather and attritional losses. Net weather losses for the current accident quarter were $11.0 million, a decrease from $27.5 million in the previous year's quarter. Catastrophe losses were $3.1 million compared to $15.3 million in the prior year quarter. Other weather losses totaled $7.9 million, a reduction from the prior year's quarter amount of $12.2 million. Additionally, the net loss ratio experienced an impact from net unfavorable loss development of $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from the net unfavorable $2.2 million development in the fourth quarter of 2022.The net expense ratio was 33.9%, a 0.2 point increase from the prior year quarter amount of 33.7%, driven largely by higher general and administrative costs related to software and associated costs with the implementation of a new claims system aimed at driving future efficiencies, which was mostly offset by higher net premiums earned. The Company's implementation of enhanced and updated claims, policy, and billing systems is expected to achieve human capital efficiencies and improve the timeliness and quality of data analytics used to drive underwriting income.Net combined ratio of 84.9% improved 11.2 points from 96.1% in the prior year quarter, driven by a lower net loss ratio and partly offset by a higher net expense ratio as described above.Net investment income, inclusive of realized investment losses and unrealized losses on equity securities, was $5.8 million up $1.0 million from $4.8 million in the prior year quarter reflecting strategic actions to align the investments with the yield curve and take advantage of higher short-term yields, which was partly offset by realized losses mostly related to other investments.The effective tax rate was 6.7% compared to (5.5)% in the prior year quarter. The change in the effective tax rate for each quarter benefited from adjustments to the valuation allowance. Specifically, there was a reduction in the valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset by $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and by $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. These reductions were driven by the impact of favorable Osprey Re results in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, allowing for the recognition of deferred tax assets in each period. The quarterly effective tax rate is subject to change due to the estimates used throughout the year in computing the income tax provision. Furthermore, tax items and estimated amounts are adjusted to reflect actual amounts in the fourth quarter of each year. These adjustments can significantly impact the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter.Supplemental Information: At December 31, Policies in force: 2023 2022 % Change Florida 153,387 182,673 (16.0) % Other States 297,288 347,234 (14.4) % Total 450,675 529,907 (15.0) % Premiums in force: Florida $ 695,010,638 $ 599,596,526 15.9 % Other States 661,392,787 684,469,189 (3.4) % Total $ 1,356,403,425 $ 1,284,065,715 5.6 % Total Insured Value: Florida $ 103,535,162,876 $ 103,752,777,168 (0.2) % Other States 286,860,809,967 306,070,446,229 (6.3) % Total $ 390,395,972,843 $ 409,823,223,397 (4.7) % Book Value Analysis As Of Book Value Per Share December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Numerator: Common stockholders' equity $ 220,280 $ 131,039 $ 343,051 Denominator: Total Shares Outstanding 30,218,938 25,539,433 26,753,511 Book Value Per Common Share $ 7.29 $ 5.13 $ 12.82 Book value per share of $7.29 at December 31, 2023, was up 42.1% from fourth quarter 2022. The increase from the comparable quarter of 2022 is primarily attributable to year-to-date net income as well as a reduction in unrealized losses on the Company's fixed income securities portfolio from the fourth quarter of 2022. The unrealized losses are unrelated to credit risk but due to the rising interest rate environment. The decrease in book value per share from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 is attributable to a 2022 year-to-date net loss, driven primarily by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $90.8 million, net of taxes, made in the second quarter of 2022, and higher weather losses, as well as an increase of $49.0 million of net unrealized losses on the Company's available-for-sale fixed income securities portfolio driven by rising interest rates during 2022.

Future dividends subject to Board discretion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a substantial one-time special cash dividend by ClearOne suggests a significant cash position or a strategic decision to distribute excess capital to shareholders. This can be indicative of a company's strong balance sheet or a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities. For shareholders, this is a direct benefit as it increases their return on investment. However, it might raise questions about the company's future growth plans and whether it could be signaling a lack of viable projects to invest in for further expansion.Investors typically view special dividends positively as they provide immediate liquidity, but they also need to consider the tax implications of such distributions. Moreover, the fact that the dividend exceeds twenty-five percent of the company's stock value is quite unusual and could significantly impact the stock's price, both leading up to and following the ex-dividend date. It's important to monitor how the market reacts to this news, as it will reflect investor sentiment regarding the company's long-term prospects. Market Research Analyst ClearOne's one-time special dividend could be a strategic move to attract new investors and reward current ones, potentially leading to a temporary increase in stock demand. However, such a large dividend payment might also suggest that the company is not finding enough growth opportunities to reinvest its capital, which could be a red flag for future value creation. The market will likely analyze the sustainability of ClearOne's business model and its ability to generate free cash flow in the future.From a market perspective, the announcement could lead to short-term volatility in the stock's price as investors adjust their positions based on the upcoming dividend payout. It is also essential to consider how this move compares with industry peers and whether it might set a precedent for similar companies in the sector. The timing and magnitude of the dividend could influence investor perception of the company's financial health and strategic direction. Economist The distribution of a large one-time dividend can have broader economic implications, especially in the context of the company's industry. It might indicate that the company is in a mature phase, with fewer opportunities for high-return investments, or it could reflect a cyclical peak in earnings. The economic environment, including interest rates and market liquidity, can also affect the decision to issue such a dividend, as alternative uses of capital might be less attractive in a low-interest-rate environment.Another aspect to consider is the economic signal this sends to the market. A significant return of capital to shareholders might suggest confidence in the company's financial stability, but it can also lead to speculation about the company's long-term growth trajectory. Analysts and investors will be keen to understand the underlying reasons for this distribution and its implications for the company's future investment strategy. 03/11/2024 - 04:45 PM SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClearOne (NASDAQ: CLRO) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share of ClearOne common stock, payable on April 10, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 2, 2024. Because the special cash dividend exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the value of the Company’s common stock, in accordance with FINRA UPC (Uniform Practice Code) Rule 11140, a stockholder of the Company that sells shares of the Company’s common stock on or prior to the payment date of April 10, 2024 will not receive the one-time special cash dividend for the Company shares that are sold. “We have decided to share this surplus with our shareholders, who continue to support the Company’s strategy and vision for future growth,” said Derek Graham, Chief Executive Officer of ClearOne. “We believe the company has an achievable plan to return to revenue growth and profitability.” Even though this dividend announcement is a special one-time event, the declaration of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of the ClearOne Board of Directors, which will evaluate the possibility of future dividend distributions from time-to-time based on factors that the Board of Directors deem relevant. However, no additional dividends have been authorized nor are contemplated at this time.

First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund Declares its Quarterly Distribution of $0.315 Per Share,2024-03-11T20:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund (FFA) declares a quarterly distribution of $0.315 per share, payable on March 28, 2024.

The distribution rate based on NAV is 6.44% and based on the closing market price is 6.75%. The Fund's managed distribution policy aims to distribute long-term capital gains more frequently. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly distribution of $0.315 per share by the First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund (FFA) signifies a direct cash flow to shareholders, which is a critical component in assessing the Fund's yield. The distribution rate based on the NAV and closing market price indicates a substantial yield, well above the average money market funds or short-term bonds, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors. However, the sustainability of such a high payout ratio should be scrutinized, especially in relation to the Fund's earnings and paid-out capital gains.Investors should consider the implications of the managed distribution policy, particularly the aspect of distributing long-term capital gains throughout the year. While this could potentially smooth out income streams and provide tax planning advantages, it also raises questions about the impact on the Fund's net asset value over time. If the distributions are not fully covered by income and realized gains, the Fund could be returning capital, which may not be sustainable in the long run. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the Fund's approach to distributing long-term capital gains quarterly rather than annually can have significant implications for shareholders. This distribution strategy might alter the timing of tax liabilities for investors, as capital gains are typically subject to taxes in the year they are received. Shareholders should evaluate their individual tax situations, considering the potential for the managed distribution policy to accelerate tax obligations.Additionally, it is important for shareholders to understand the composition of the distributions they receive. If the distributions include a return of capital, this could reduce an investor's cost basis in the Fund and consequently increase the capital gains tax owed when shares are eventually sold. Shareholders may need to adjust their tax planning strategies accordingly. Market Research Analyst Examining the distribution rate in relation to the Fund's net asset value (NAV) and market price provides insight into the market's perception of the Fund's valuation. A higher distribution rate relative to the market price, as indicated by the 6.75%, suggests that the Fund may be undervalued, or that investors are requiring a higher yield to compensate for perceived risks. This could be due to market volatility, sector-specific risks, or the Fund's own performance history.It is also important to monitor how the market reacts to the distribution announcement. If the Fund's market price adjusts significantly after the ex-dividend date, it may indicate investor sentiment about the sustainability of the distributions or the overall health of the Fund. Long-term trends in the Fund's market price relative to its NAV will be telling of the market's confidence in the Fund's management and strategy. 03/11/2024 - 04:10 PM WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund (the ""Fund"") (NYSE: FFA) has declared the Fund's regularly scheduled quarterly distribution of $0.315 per share. The distribution will be payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 25, 2024. The ex-dividend date is expected to be March 22, 2024. The quarterly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund (FFA): Distribution per share: $0.315 Distribution Rate based on the March 8, 2024 NAV of $19.58: 6.44% Distribution Rate based on the March 8, 2024 closing market price of $18.67: 6.75% The Fund's Board of Trustees has approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the ""Plan"") in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains more frequently than otherwise permitted with respect to its common shares subject to certain conditions. Under the Plan, the Fund intends to pay a quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.315 per share. A portion of this quarterly distribution may include long-term capital gains. This may result in a reduction of the long-term capital gain distribution necessary at year end by distributing long-term capital gains throughout the year. The annual distribution rate is independent of the Fund's performance during any particular period. Accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of any distribution or from the terms of the Plan. This distribution will consist of net investment income earned by the Fund and return of capital and may also consist of net short-term realized capital gains. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of current income and gains and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation.

Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. The Fund may write (sell) covered call options on all or a portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio. The use of options may require the Fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold an equity security that it might otherwise sell. Premiums from writing (selling) call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in the Fund's portfolio can vary widely over time. An adverse event affecting an issuer of equity securities, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value of a particular equity security held by the Fund. Also, the prices of equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the prices of equity securities to which the Fund has exposure. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the equity securities in which the Fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. The Fund may not invest 25% or more of its total assets in securities of issuers in any single industry. If the Fund is focused in an industry, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries of the economy.

Oncology Research Analyst The advancement of CytomX's CX-904, CX-2051 and CX-801 into various phases of clinical trials represents a significant step in oncology therapeutics, particularly in the realm of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The PROBODY platform's ability to conditionally activate biologics may offer a differentiated approach to cancer treatment, potentially improving the therapeutic index by minimizing off-target effects.With CX-904's Phase 1a dose escalation data expected in the second half of 2024, the focus will be on safety, tolerability and preliminary signs of efficacy. Given EGFR's prevalence in various solid tumors, positive results could have substantial implications for the drug's advancement and CytomX's valuation. The collaboration with Amgen underscores the industry's interest in T-cell engagers and could accelerate development and commercialization efforts if outcomes are favorable.CX-2051's targeting of EpCAM, an antigen overexpressed in several epithelial cancers, leverages the ADC mechanism, which has been successful in other oncology therapeutics. The use of a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload could provide potent anti-cancer activity and successful Phase 1 outcomes might pave the way for a new class of EpCAM-targeting drugs.For CX-801, the re-engineered IFNα2b, the focus will be on demonstrating enhanced efficacy with reduced toxicity. If successful, CX-801 could revitalize interest in cytokine therapies in oncology, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by CytomX, including the year-over-year increase in revenue and the reduction in operating expenses, reflect strategic financial management and a focused R&D pipeline. The decrease in operating expenses, primarily driven by workforce reductions and strategic prioritization, indicates a leaner operational model that could benefit the company's long-term financial health.Noteworthy is the $35.0 million upfront payment from Moderna and the milestone payment from Astellas, which contribute to a strong cash position. This, combined with the significant proceeds from the financing transaction with BVF Partners, suggests CytomX has the capital to sustain its clinical programs through key inflection points.Investors might view the reduction in R&D expenses positively, as it suggests a disciplined approach to capital allocation. However, it will be crucial for the company to balance cost control with the need to invest adequately in the development of its clinical candidates to ensure they reach their potential commercialization. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The strategic alliances with industry leaders like Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb and Moderna are indicative of CytomX's collaborative approach to drug development and could provide access to additional resources and expertise. The progression of multiple research programs and the potential for reaching clinical milestones in 2024 suggest a dynamic pipeline with multiple shots on goal, which is a positive sign for future growth.The discontinuation of BMS-986288 by Bristol Myers Squibb, while a setback, is not uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry and highlights the risks inherent in drug development. The focus on other T-cell engagers within the collaboration could mitigate this impact if alternative candidates advance successfully.Given the competitive nature of the oncology market, CytomX's success will depend on the clinical performance of its candidates and their ability to address unmet medical needs. The company's focus on large oncology markets and the pursuit of major unmet needs align with industry trends towards precision medicine and could position CytomX favorably if its candidates prove to be effective and safe. 03/11/2024 - 04:10 PM - CX-904 (EGFRxCD3 T-cell engager) initial Phase 1a dose escalation data in solid tumors anticipated in the 2nd half of 2024 - - CX-2051 (EpCAM ADC) Phase 1 clinical study initiation in solid tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) anticipated in the 1st half of 2024 - - CX-801 (IFNα2b) Phase 1 clinical study initiation in solid tumors including melanoma, renal, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma anticipated in 1st half of 2024 - - Management to hold conference call today at 5 p.m. EDT / 2 p.m. PDT - SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTMX), a leader in the field of conditionally activated, localized biologics, today reported full year 2023 financial results and provided a business update. “2023 was a year of sustained execution across our pipeline, highlighted by the continued progress of CX-904 in Phase 1 dose escalation and the parallel advancement of CX-2051 and CX-801 through successful IND enabling activities towards clinical initiation in the first half of 2024,” said Sean McCarthy, D.Phil., chief executive officer and chairman of CytomX. “We entered 2024 with a robust therapeutic pipeline based upon more than a decade of innovation with the PROBODY® platform. Our lead programs leverage validated oncology targets, potent effector mechanisms and tailored masking approaches. Our strategy is to address large oncology markets and major unmet needs to make a meaningful difference for patients, building on the strong company foundation we have laid with our comprehensive progress to date.” McCarthy added, “Importantly, while advancing key programs throughout 2023, we maintained a consistently strong financial position through disciplined capital allocation and financing that included a strategic equity investment from our largest shareholder, BVF Partners, and ongoing funding from major collaborations.” Fourth Quarter Business Highlights and Recent Developments Pipeline CX-904, PROBODY® T-cell-engager (TCE) targeted to EGFRxCD3 progressing in Phase 1, with dose escalation data anticipated in second half of 2024. CX-904 is a conditionally activated PROBODY T-cell engager designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on cancer cells and the CD3 receptor on T cells within the tumor microenvironment. CX-904 is partnered with Amgen in a global co-development alliance and is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 study in unselected patients with advanced solid tumors that are considered to have EGFR expression. Backfilling of certain dose escalation cohorts has been initiated and dose ranging continues. Initial Phase 1a dose escalation data is anticipated in the second half of 2024. The Phase 1a data is expected to focus primarily on identification of safe and tolerable doses and schedules and will include an evaluation of indicators of clinical activity, including pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) data and assessment of anti-tumor activity.The CX-904 Phase 1a data will inform a potential decision during 2024 to initiate Phase 1b expansion cohorts in specific EGFR positive tumor types. The decision to potentially initiate Phase 1b expansion cohorts will be taken in conjunction with Amgen. CX-2051, an EpCAM-directed PROBODY® antibody drug conjugate advancing to Phase 1 in the 1st half of 2024. EpCAM is a high potential oncology target that is highly expressed across many indications including colorectal, gastric, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. EpCAM has been clinically validated by locally administered, previously approved cancer therapies. However, efforts to generate systemically administered anti-EpCAM therapeutics have, to date, been unsuccessful due to toxicities in certain epithelial tissues, notably in the gastrointestinal tract. As a conditionally activated ADC, CX-2051 is tailored to optimize the therapeutic index for EpCAM-expressing epithelial cancers. The cytotoxic payload utilized in CX-2051 is a derivative of camptothecin, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, a class of drug that has shown potent clinical anti-cancer activity in the ADC context for multiple targets and cancer types. CX-2051 has demonstrated a wide predicted therapeutic index in multiple preclinical models, constituting an opportunity for broad clinical use in large patient populations. In January 2024, CytomX announced that the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for CX-2051 was allowed to proceed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Phase 1 dose escalation of CX-2051 in patients with solid tumors generally known to express EpCAM, including CRC, will be initiated in the first half of 2024. The Phase 1 dose escalation study will follow a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design and is intended to demonstrate initial clinical proof of concept to inform a potential decision to move into dose expansion in 2025. CX-801, a dually-masked PROBODY® interferon-alpha 2b advancing to Phase 1 in the 1st half of 2024. Interferon-alpha 2b is an immunotherapeutic cytokine that has demonstrated clinical activity and gained regulatory approval previously in multiple cancer types, including locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, renal cancer and bladder cancer. IFNα2b provides a potentially superior approach to activating anti-tumor immune responses compared to other cytokines but its clinical benefit has been hindered by severe dose-limiting toxicity. CX-801 is an optimized, dually masked, conditionally activated version of IFNα2b, with an expanded therapeutic index that has the potential to become a cornerstone of combination therapy for a wide range of tumor types. In January 2024, CytomX announced the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for CX-801 was allowed to proceed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).CX-801 is anticipated to initiate Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with solid tumors including melanoma, renal, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the first half of 2024. The Phase 1 dose escalation will utilize a BOIN design to evaluate safety and signs of clinical activity for CX-801 monotherapy and for CX-801 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition. Focus of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) research collaboration evolves to ongoing research programs, including multiple T-cell engagers. The anti-CTLA-4 PROBODY® BMS-986288 will not be further advanced following a recent BMS internal portfolio review. CytomX’s research collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb originated in 2014 and includes multiple PROBODY® therapeutic programs. Following a corporate portfolio prioritization process, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) notified CytomX on March 6th, 2024 that it does not intend to continue the development of BMS-986288 beyond the current Phase 2 study.CytomX’s ongoing research collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb includes multiple preclinical programs, including T-cell engagers. CytomX continues to make progress in R&D partnerships. CytomX has multiple active research and development partnerships and more than 10 ongoing research programs with major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies (Amgen, Astellas, Bristol Myers Squibb, Moderna and Regeneron). Throughout 2023, CytomX made substantial progress across all research partnerships including the commencement of programs under its new alliances with Regeneron and Moderna. CytomX has a consistent track record of forming new strategic research and development alliances and achieving preclinical research and clinical milestones. Partnering is expected to remain an important part of the Company’s strategy. 2024 Priorities and Key Milestones: CX-904 (EGFRxCD3): Continued enrollment into Phase 1a dose escalation with initial data expected in the second half of 2024. These data are expected to inform a potential 2024 decision, to be taken with Amgen, to initiate Phase 1b expansion cohorts in specific EGFR positive tumor types.CX-2051 (EpCAM): Initiation of Phase 1 dose escalation in solid tumors with known EpCAM expression, including locally advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer as a priority indication, is expected in the first half of 2024.CX-801 (IFNα2b): Initiation of Phase 1 dose escalation in solid tumors including melanoma, renal, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is expected in the first half of 2024.Collaborations: Continuation of drug discovery and development activities with Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Astellas, Regeneron, and Moderna with potential pre-clinical and clinical milestones possible in 2024 and beyond. Full Year and Q4 2023 Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $174.5 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $193.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash balance as of December 31, 2023, included cash inflows during 2023 of a $35.0 million upfront payment received in January 2023 as a result of the collaboration with Moderna, a $5.0 million clinical candidate milestone from Astellas in February of 2023 and approximately $30.0 million of proceeds from the financing transaction with BVF Partners L.P. in July of 2023. Total revenue was $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $53.2 million in 2022. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by a higher percentage of completion for research programs in the Bristol Myers Squibb collaboration and the recent collaborations with Regeneron and Moderna. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $26.6 million compared to $20.1 million in the corresponding period in 2022. In 2023, CytomX remained focused on controlling costs and efficiently allocating capital towards its lead pipeline programs. Total operating expense in 2023 was $107.7 million compared to $154.5 million in 2022, a reduction of $46.8 million. The operating expense reduction was driven by the Company’s workforce reduction in 2022, strategic pipeline prioritization, and primarily allocating early phase research efforts towards partnered programs. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $27.2 million compared to $29.6 million in the corresponding period in 2022. Research and development expenses decreased by $34.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, to $77.7 million compared to $111.6 million in 2022. The reduction in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related expenses, as well as winding down of laboratory contract services and clinical study activities related to the CX-2009 and CX-2029 programs, partially offset by an increase in laboratory contract services related to IND-enabling activities for CX-2051 and CX-801 programs. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $19.4 million compared to $19.6 million in the corresponding period in 2022. General and administrative expenses decreased by $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, to $30.0 million, compared to $42.8 million for the corresponding period in 2022. The reduction in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related expenses as a result of the workforce reduction in 2022, reduced external vendor services, and lower occupancy costs as a result of a partial sublease of the Company’s headquarters. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $7.8 million compared to $10.1 million in the corresponding period in 2022.

(CGTX) has announced a public offering of its common stock, with an option for additional shares. The offering is subject to market conditions and may vary in size and terms. Titan Partners Group is the sole book-running manager for the offering. The company is utilizing an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for this purpose. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initiation of an underwritten public offering by Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. is a significant financial event that warrants attention from investors and market analysts. The offering's success will largely depend on market conditions and investor sentiment towards the company's growth prospects and its pipeline of neurodegenerative disorder treatments. The decision to offer a 30-day option for an additional 15% purchase to the underwriter is a common hedging strategy that provides flexibility and potential for additional capital influx, but it also indicates the company's need to secure a safety net in volatile market conditions.The use of a 'shelf' registration statement allows Cognition to offer and sell shares over a prolonged period, up to three years, which can be advantageous in capitalizing on favorable market conditions. However, this also subjects the company to market risks, as fluctuating stock prices can affect the amount of capital raised. Investors should closely monitor the terms of the offering once the prospectus is filed, as it will provide critical details on the pricing and number of shares to be offered, which can impact the company's market capitalization and share dilution. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Cognition's public offering is an important event that could influence its industry position. The neurodegenerative treatment space is highly competitive and research-intensive, requiring substantial investment in clinical trials and R&D. The capital raised through this offering could enable Cognition to advance its product candidates and potentially accelerate the pathway to commercialization. However, the offering's timing and subsequent performance will be critical, as it reflects investor confidence in Cognition's ability to deliver on its promises and compete effectively in the market.Investors will also assess the role of Titan Partners Group as the sole book-running manager, which can be indicative of the offering's structure and the confidence the underwriter has in Cognition's value proposition. The response to the offering could serve as a barometer for the market's perception of Cognition's strategic direction and operational execution. Legal Expert Legally, the public offering by Cognition is conducted under strict regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and protect investors. The effectiveness of the 'shelf' registration statement by the SEC is a crucial step, confirming that the company has met all regulatory requirements to proceed with the offering. Potential investors should be aware that the offering is bound by securities laws and the sale of shares cannot occur in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful without proper registration or exemption. The availability of the prospectus and its supplement will provide legal disclosures and risk factors that are essential for informed investment decisions.The legal stipulations that 'this press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy' underscores the regulatory compliance that companies must adhere to when communicating about public offerings. It is important for stakeholders to understand that the actual sale of securities can only occur through formal channels, as outlined in the prospectus, to avoid legal repercussions. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM PURCHASE, N.

BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND,2024-03-11T20:07:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Benchmark Electronics, Inc. declares a first-quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.165 per share, with payment scheduled for April 12, 2024, benefiting shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024.","BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Benchmark Electronics, Inc. declares a first-quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.165 per share, with payment scheduled for April 12, 2024, benefiting shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Benchmark Electronics, Inc.'s quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and future outlook. Dividends are typically distributed by companies that are in a stable financial position and have a positive earnings outlook, suggesting confidence in their ability to generate cash flow. The declaration of a dividend can also be a signal to the market that the company's management believes the stock is undervalued. Investors often view regular dividends as a steady income stream, which can make the stock more attractive to income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the shares.However, it is crucial to analyze the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio is generally between 30% and 60%. Ratios significantly higher could indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into the business, which may affect long-term growth. Conversely, a very low payout ratio could suggest that the company is reinvesting heavily, which could lead to higher growth in the future but also indicates a smaller immediate return to shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend can have various implications. For instance, it can affect the stock's ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the shares begin to trade without the dividend's value included in the stock price. This often results in a slight drop in the stock price, reflecting the payout. Moreover, the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, becomes a critical factor for comparison against other companies in the industry and broader market indices. A competitive yield can attract a different investor demographic, such as those seeking regular income, which could diversify the shareholder base and potentially reduce stock price volatility.It's also important to consider the context within the broader economic environment. In a rising interest rate environment, for example, high-dividend stocks might compete with safer fixed-income investments like bonds, which could impact the stock's attractiveness. Monitoring sector trends and the performance of peer companies in terms of their dividend policies can offer additional insights into the company's competitive position within the industry. 03/11/2024 - 04:07 PM First quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.165 per share TEMPE, Ariz., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Benchmark Electronics, Inc.

Despite a decrease in cash, the company remains focused on development programs and strategic partnerships. Positive Positive interim data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials of MB-106 presented at ASH Annual Meeting Plans for first-ever registrational CAR-T trial for relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia Potential initiation of Phase 1 multicenter clinical trial for MB-109 in recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas Continued work on in vivo CAR-T technology platform with Mayo Clinic Acceptance of IND for Phase 1 clinical trial of MB-109 by the FDA Publication of proof-of-concept research for in vivo CAR-T technology platform anticipated in 2024 Expected initiation of new investigator-sponsored trials for XSCID patients with MB-117 and MB-217 in 2024 Negative Significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents year-over-year Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $51.6 million for 2023 Reduction in research and development expenses compared to 2022 General and administrative expenses decreased in 2023 Completion of registered direct offering for gross proceeds of $4.4 million in October 2023 Financial Analyst An analysis of Mustang Bio's financial results reveals a significant year-over-year decrease in cash and cash equivalents, from $76.7 million to $7.0 million. This is primarily due to a substantial payment made to terminate existing debt, which could be seen as a strategic move to reduce future interest expenses and improve the company's balance sheet. However, the drastic reduction in liquid assets raises concerns about the company's ability to fund ongoing and future research and development without additional capital infusion. The reduction in research and development expenses, from $62.5 million to $40.5 million, suggests a re-prioritization or scaling back of projects, which may impact the company's growth trajectory and innovation cycle.From an investor's perspective, the net loss decrease from $77.5 million to $51.6 million year-over-year may indicate improved operational efficiency or cost management. However, the current loss rate and cash position could necessitate further financing, which may lead to dilution of existing shareholders' equity. The gain on the sale of property and equipment to uBriGene indicates asset monetization, which may provide short-term liquidity but also signifies a strategic shift that requires careful scrutiny to understand its long-term impact on the company's core capabilities and growth prospects. Medical Research Analyst The announcement of compelling interim data from Mustang's multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-106 is a significant milestone, indicating potential efficacy in treating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) and other hematologic malignancies. The observed deepening and durability of responses, as well as CAR T-cell persistence, are encouraging signs for the therapy's long-term potential. However, the trial is still in early stages and the full impact on Mustang's valuation and market positioning will depend on further data and regulatory milestones, such as the anticipated RMAT designation and the launch of the first registrational CAR-T trial for WM.The development of MB-109, a novel combination therapy for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), represents an innovative approach to a notoriously difficult-to-treat cancer. The use of an oncolytic virus to modify the tumor microenvironment and enhance CAR T-cell therapy's efficacy could be a game-changer if clinical results are positive. However, given the complexity of GBM treatment and the early phase of the trial, the risk associated with this research program is high and its success is far from guaranteed. Biotech Market Analyst Mustang Bio's strategic focus on cell and gene therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers and rare genetic diseases places it within a high-growth sector of the biotech industry. The company's progress in clinical trials and the pursuit of RMAT designation for its CAR-T therapy could potentially expedite the review process and enhance interactions with the FDA, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the biotech sector is highly competitive and Mustang's success will depend on its ability to maintain a robust pipeline and navigate the regulatory landscape effectively.The collaborations with notable institutions such as the Mayo Clinic and the planned publication of proof-of-concept research for its in vivo CAR-T technology platform could further solidify Mustang's position in the field. The company's focus on novel therapies for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) also highlights its commitment to addressing unmet medical needs. Nevertheless, the high cash burn rate and the need for additional funding are critical factors that could affect Mustang's ability to sustain its operations and continue its research programs without interruption. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM WORCESTER, Mass., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mustang Bio, Inc. (“Mustang” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers and rare genetic diseases, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the full-year ended December 31, 2023. ""2023 was an exciting year for Mustang filled with many highlights, including compelling interim data from Mustang’s multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-106 presented at the 2023 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, which builds upon the stellar data presented earlier in the year from the MB-106 Phase 1/2 single institution clinical trial conducted at Fred Hutch. In both the multicenter Phase 1/2 trial and the single institution Phase 1/2 trial, the observed deepening and durability of responses are very gratifying. We believe the CAR T-cell persistence of up to 3 years in the original single institution trial at Fred Hutch and up to 1 year in the current Mustang-sponsored multicenter trial are important potential contributors to the deepening and durability of responses,"" said Manuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang. ""We plan to move ahead with the first ever registrational CAR-T trial focused on relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”), a subtype of indolent lymphoma with no FDA-approved therapy or standard of care in the third-line setting and no FDA-approved CAR-T for any line of therapy. We expect to treat the first patient in the second half of 2024, which could enable topline results in the second half of 2026. In order to facilitate interactions with the FDA throughout this process, we anticipate requesting Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (‘RMAT’) designation for indolent lymphoma – which includes WM – from the FDA in the first half of 2024. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation programs, including early interactions with FDA.” Dr. Litchman continued, “Additionally, we are evaluating the potential to initiate a first-ever Phase 1 multicenter clinical trial at City of Hope (“COH”) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-109, a novel combination of MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR T-cell therapy) and MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus) in adult patients with recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas that express IL13Rα2 on the surface of the tumor cells. The combination leverages MB-108 to reshape the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) and make cold tumors “hot,” which could potentially enhance the clinical effect of MB-101 CAR T-cell therapy. As per a recent publication in Nature Medicine, two patients treated solely with MB-101 who had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T-cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors) achieved complete responses lasting 7.5 and 66+ months, respectively. Also noteworthy is our continued work with the Mayo Clinic to progress our exclusively licensed novel in vivo CAR-T technology platform, for which we anticipate an upcoming publication of proof-of-concept research in a murine tumor model in 2024."" Financial Results: As of December 31, 2023, Mustang’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $7.0 million, compared to $76.7 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $69.7 million year-over-year. In 2023 Mustang made a $30.4 million payment to terminate existing debt. Mustang continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce its cash utilization while focusing on its top priority development programs.Research and development expenses were $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $62.5 million for 2022. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses included in research and development were $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.6 million for 2022.Mustang recorded a gain on the sale of property and equipment of $1.5 million, in connection with the sale of assets to uBriGene.General and administrative expenses were $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $12.2 million for 2022. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses included in general and administrative expenses were $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.7 million for 2022.Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $51.6 million, or $6.00 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $77.5 million, or $10.09 per share, for 2022. 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights: General Corporate: In July 2023, Mustang announced that it amended its previously announced asset purchase agreement with uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences Inc. (“uBriGene”) and closed the transaction. Per the terms of the amended asset purchase agreement, at closing, uBriGene acquired all of Mustang’s assets primarily relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at Mustang’s manufacturing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, for upfront consideration of $6 million in cash. An additional $5 million contingent payment will be payable to Mustang upon (i) Mustang raising $10 million in gross proceeds from equity raises following the closing of the transaction and (ii) completion of the assignment of Mustang’s lease to uBriGene, which remains subject to landlord’s approval, within two years of the closing. Unless and until the lease is transferred to uBriGene, Mustang will retain its facility lease and facility personnel and will continue to occupy the leasehold premises and manufacture there its lead product candidate, MB-106. Clearance for assignment of Mustang’s lease to uBriGene remains under review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), and Mustang and uBriGene are continuing discussions with CFIUS regarding the nature and extent of national security risk posed by the assignment.In October 2023, Mustang completed a registered direct offering priced at-the-market for approximately $4.4 million in gross proceeds. MB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T-cell therapy): Mustang’s lead clinical candidate is MB-106, a CD20-targeted, autologous CAR T-cell therapy to treat a wide range of hematologic malignancies, including WM and follicular lymphoma (“FL”). MB-106 continues to demonstrate a favorable safety and efficacy profile in both the Fred Hutch single institution and Mustang multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trials.In December 2023, Mustang announced initial data from its ongoing multicenter, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of MB-106 CAR T-cell therapy at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Initial data show that all patients responded clinically to treatment with MB-106 (n=9), with a 100% overall response rate for patients with FL and WM. 100% of patients with FL (n=5) had a complete response; 1 very good partial response and 2 partial responses were observed in WM patients (n=3); and the hairy cell leukemia variant (“HCL-v”) patient experienced stable disease, with prolonged, ongoing independence from blood transfusions. Complete responses were observed in patients previously treated with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. MB-106 demonstrated a tolerable safety profile in patients with indolent NHL, with no occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) above grade 1, and no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”) of any grade, despite not using prophylactic tocilizumab or dexamethasone. Outpatient administration was allowed and found to be feasible. MB-106 CAR T-cell expansion and persistence in patients was demonstrated. The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to MB-106 for the treatment of WM, and results from this arm of the multicenter trial are expected to support an accelerated Phase 2 registration strategy for WM, with the first pivotal Phase 2 patient with WM to be treated potentially in 2024.Mazyar Shadman, M.D., M.P.H., Study Chair, Associate Professor and physician at Fred Hutch and University of Washington, also presented data from the ongoing Fred Hutch Phase 1/2 clinical trial specific to two B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohorts, FL and WM. In the FL data cohort (n=20), an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 95% was seen, of which 80% of patients experienced a complete response and 15% had a partial response. The complete response patients include a patient who was previously treated with a CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. Of the six patients who experienced cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”), only one had Grade 2, while the remaining five had Grade 1. Ten patients continue to experience complete response for more than 10 months, four patients have experienced complete response for more than two years (all ongoing), and the first patient enrolled has sustained complete response for more than 3 years. In the WM cohort (n=6), all of whom had received prior Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, two patients experienced complete response, one of whom continues to be in complete response at more than 22 months; 1 patient experienced a very good partial response; and 1 patient experienced a partial response. No patients experienced CRS or ICANS greater than Grade 2. None of the six patients with WM has needed to start new therapy for their disease. MB-109 (IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T-cells + HSV-1 oncolytic virus for recurrent glioblastoma): In October 2023, Mustang announced that the FDA accepted the Company’s IND to initiate a Phase 1 open label, multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-109, a novel combination of MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR T-cell therapy) and MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus), for the treatment of recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytoma. Mustang is evaluating plans to initiate the clinical trial and request orphan drug designation for GBM, subject to resource allocation, in 2024.As previously reported, preclinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting 2022 supported this combination therapy to optimize results to treat recurrent GBM. The combination leverages MB-108 to make cold tumors “hot,” thereby potentially improving the efficacy of MB-101 CAR T-cell therapy.In March 2024, data from the Phase 1 trial evaluating MB-101 IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T-cells in high-grade glioma were published in Nature Medicine. MB-101 was well tolerated and 50% of patients achieved stable disease or better, with two partial responses and two complete responses in high grade glioma patients. The two patients who achieved complete response both had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T-cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors), and their responses lasted 7.5 and 66+ months, respectively. In the cohort with dual intratumoral (ICT)/ intraventricular (ICV) delivery and an optimized manufacturing process there was a ~70% improvement in median overall survival (10.2 months) compared to the expected survival rate of six months in this patient population. In Vivo CAR-T Technology Platform: Mustang continues to collaborate with the Mayo Clinic to progress our exclusively licensed novel in vivo CAR-T technology platform that may be able to transform the administration of CAR-T therapies and has the potential to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy. Mustang anticipates the publication of proof-of-concept research in a murine tumor model in 2024. MB-117 and MB-217 Lentiviral Gene Therapies for X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID): In 2024, the first patients are expected to be treated in both new investigator-sponsored trials for newborns diagnosed with XSCID and for previously transplanted patients with XSCID. These trials with MB-117 and MB-217, respectively, are planned by our partners and will test a modified version of the current lentiviral vector.

Management Commentary“Our 2023 fourth quarter results, including net revenue of $12.5 million, net income of $1.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million, represented a solid finish to a year in which we focused on managing our operations to address the evolution of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 16.4% and 17% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, are in the range of what we can anticipate going forward as we continue to optimize our operations. “Fourth quarter Casino revenue performance reflects a weak October followed by a solid reversal over the balance of the quarter. Importantly, the positive Casino revenue trends experienced exiting 2023 have continued into the early part of this year. Pari-mutuel revenues for the quarter were down 8.4% due primarily to reduced advanced deposit wagering (“ADW”) performance while our full-year pari-mutuel and live racing performance was negatively impacted by the expiration of the cooperative marketing agreement at the end of 2022. Following this change, we have continued to re-evaluate all aspects of our racing operations, and we believe our updated operating strategies will improve the performance of this portion of our business going forward. “Development at Canterbury Commons continues at a rapid pace with significant ongoing activity across our site. Swervo Development Corporation (“Swervo”) has its amphitheater construction in full swing and is on schedule to open in the summer of 2025. Also, our Winner’s Circle development partnership with Greystone continues to bring additional ‘Live, Work, Stay, and Play’ features to Canterbury Commons in the form of a new 10,000 square-foot building now under construction. This project is fully leased, with tenants including a BBQ restaurant, a pizza restaurant and a fitness center. In addition, our barn relocation project is well underway, and we will begin work this summer on a new road that will allow us to unlock approximately 20 acres of land adjacent to the amphitheater for an entertainment district development that would provide further opportunities for Canterbury to create value for its shareholders. “We continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance the return from our operations while simultaneously exploring additional ways to create value for our shareholders including seeking new wagering or gaming entertainment options that we could offer. Recently, alongside the region’s other horse racing operation, we submitted a formal request to the Minnesota Racing Commission to allow us to introduce 500 on-track ADW units that would offer our guests the ability to wager on historical horse racing outcomes similar to what is available in multiple jurisdictions. This effort, along with our continued legislative efforts on sports betting, is a clear indication that we will explore all avenues to bring additional gaming and wagering opportunities to our property to further enhance our business and support the Minnesota horse racing industry. With our solid balance sheet and operational discipline, we believe Canterbury Park remains well-positioned to deliver long-term growth, and we remain committed to building a bright future for our Company.” Canterbury Commons Development UpdateSwervo continues to make progress on the construction of its state-of-the-art amphitheater which is expected to open in 2025. The Company’s barn relocation and redevelopment plan is also underway and should be completed in 2025. Later in 2024, Canterbury expects to begin work on the road adjacent to the amphitheater which will unlock development of 20 acres of land in that portion of the site. Residential and commercial construction updates related to joint ventures include: Phase II of Doran Properties Group’s upscale Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury Park has begun initial occupancy.The Omry at Canterbury, featuring 147 units of senior market rate apartments, is complete and move-ins are underway.Construction has begun on a new 10,000 square-foot commercial building within the Winner's Circle development; the building features three tenants, including a BBQ restaurant, a pizza restaurant and fitness center. The project is expected to open in late 2024. Residential and commercial construction updates related to prior land sales include: Greystone completed the Next Steps Learning Center late in 2023.Pulte Homes of Minnesota continues development on the 45-unit second phase of its row home and townhome residences. Developer and partner selection for the remaining 40 acres of Canterbury Commons, including 20 acres that will become available for development following the completion of a new road the Company will begin building later this year, continues. Additional uses could include office, retail, hotel and restaurants. Summary of 2023 Fourth Quarter Operating ResultsNet revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreased $592,000, or 4.5%, to $12.5 million, compared to $13.1 million for the same period in 2022. Casino revenue declined 3.7%, or $366,000, due to particularly weak trends in October which partially reversed over the balance of the quarter, as well as the impact from increased competition from a nearby tribal casino that reopened its poker room. Pari-mutuel, food and beverage, and other revenue declined 8.4%, 5.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. The decrease in pari-mutuel revenue was driven by continued decreases in revenues related to ADW wagering. Other revenues decreased primarily due to revenues earned during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as part of the cooperative marketing agreement that expired by its terms on December 31, 2022. Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $11.9 million, an increase of $175,000, or 1.5%, compared to operating expenses of $11.8 million for the same period in 2022. Food and beverage cost of goods sold decreased at a rate below the decline in revenues, resulting in increased costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing expenses decreased due to the expiration of the cooperative marketing agreement which resulted in fewer marketing programs in 2023. These decreases were more than offset by higher payroll expense due primarily to increases in annual wage rates, increased depreciation, and increased professional and contracted services due primarily to regulatory fees related to the Company’s racing and Casino operations. The Company recorded income from equity investment of $939,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss from equity investment of $294,000. The income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is related to a gain recognized on insurance proceeds received by Doran Canterbury I related to an outstanding claim while the loss from equity investments in the prior period was primarily related to the Company’s share of depreciation, amortization, and interest expense from the Doran Canterbury joint ventures. The Company recorded interest income, net, of $545,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $256,000, or 88.4%, compared to interest income, net, of $289,000 for the same period in 2022. The continued strength of Canterbury’s balance sheet has driven an increase in interest income through the investment of available cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds as well as from recording additional interest accrued on the TIF receivable and joint venture member loans. The Company recorded income tax expense of $708,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to income tax expense of $288,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company recorded net income of $1.4 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.27, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022, of $1.1 million and $0.22, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $2.1 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 million for the same period in 2022. Summary of 2023 Full-Year Operating ResultsNet revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, decreased $5.4 million, or 8.1%, to $61.4 million, compared to $66.8 million for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year decrease reflects decreases in Casino, pari-mutuel, food and beverage, and other revenues of $438,000, $2.7 million, $398,000, and $1.8 million, respectively. The decrease in Casino revenue is primarily due to a decrease in live race days year-over-year. The full year decreases in pari-mutuel and other revenues were driven primarily by reduced handle on live racing and the expiration of the cooperative marketing agreement at the end of 2022. Food and beverage revenue declined due to the reduced live racing schedule and not hosting Twin Cities Summer Jam in 2023. Operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were $56.4 million, an increase of $483,000, or 0.9%, compared to operating expenses of $55.9 million for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year increase reflects higher payroll expense and professional services expenses in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, which more than offset lower purse and marketing expenses as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in professional service fees was primarily due to $1.2 million in costs related to growth initiatives being pursued as part of our strategic plan focused on growing Casino revenue. The Company recorded a $6.5 million gain on the sale of land for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, related to the sale of 37 acres to Swervo. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of land of $12,000 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022. The Company recorded income from equity investment of $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss from equity investment of $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the loss from equity investment in the prior period were primarily related to the reasons described above in the fourth quarter results. The Company recorded interest income, net, of $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.1 million, or 117.4%, compared to interest income, net, of $910,000 for the same period in 2022. The continued strength of Canterbury’s balance sheet has allowed the Company to drive an increase in interest income primarily due to the reasons described above in the fourth quarter results. The Company also recognized interest related to employee retention credit funds that were received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The Company recorded income tax expense of $4.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to income tax expense of $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The Company recorded net income of $10.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.13, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, of $7.5 million and $1.54, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $16.2 million for the same period in 2022. Additional Financial InformationFurther financial information for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023, is presented in the accompanying tables at the end of this press release. Additional information will be provided in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about March 12, 2024. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our financial statements, we also provide investors with information about our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, and which exclude certain items from net income, a GAAP measure. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest income (net of interest expense), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as excluding stock-based compensation (which includes our 401(k) match expense as this match occurs in Company stock), gain on insurance proceeds relating to equity investments, loss on disposal of assets, gain on sale of land, depreciation and amortization related to equity investments and interest expense related to equity investments. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance. See the table below, which presents reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measure, which is net income. We have presented EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA gives investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it enables investors to understand and assess our core operating results excluding the effect of these items and is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business and provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions.

Season-to-date skier visits decreased 9.7%, but lift revenue increased 2.6%. The Company updated its fiscal year 2024 guidance, expecting net income between $270 million and $325 million. The Board approved an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $2.22 per share. Despite challenging conditions, Resort Reported EBITDA increased by approximately 8% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Positive Net income for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 was $219.3 million, up from $208.7 million in the same period the previous year. Resort Reported EBITDA for Q2 fiscal 2024 was $425.0 million, including $2.1 million of acquisition related expenses, compared to $394.8 million in the prior year. Season-to-date total skier visits decreased by 9.7%, but total lift revenue increased by 2.6% through March 3, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company updated its guidance for fiscal year 2024, expecting net income between $270 million and $325 million and Resort Reported EBITDA between $849 million and $885 million. The Board approved an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $2.22 per share, payable on April 11, 2024. Despite challenging conditions at North American resorts, Resort Reported EBITDA in Q2 increased by approximately 8% compared to the prior year, driven by stable season pass results and improved Resort EBITDA Margin. Negative Season-to-date total skier visits decreased by 9.7%, impacting visitation levels. Retail/rental revenue for North American resort and ski area store locations was down 9.3% compared to the prior year season-to-date period. Dining revenue decreased by 4.4% primarily due to decreased revenue from on-mountain dining venues at Eastern U.S. and Tahoe resorts. Operating expense decreased by 5.8% due to reduced labor hours and disciplined cost management. Lodging segment net revenue decreased by 3.0%, driven by decreased demand and reduced inventory of managed condominium rooms proximate to mountain resorts. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Vail Resorts' net income and Resort Reported EBITDA despite a decrease in skier visits is indicative of the company's strategic resilience. The growth in net income from $208.7 million to $219.3 million and EBITDA from $394.8 million to $425.0 million, suggests effective cost management and a robust season pass program. The stability of pass revenue, which tends to be less variable than single-day lift ticket sales, provides a financial cushion against external challenges such as unfavorable weather conditions.Furthermore, the 8% dividend increase signals confidence in the company's financial health and its commitment to shareholder returns. However, investors should consider the juxtaposition of reduced skier visits with increased lift revenue and ancillary services spending, which could imply a shift towards a more premium market segment or higher spending per visitor. The updated guidance for the fiscal year 2024, projecting net income between $270 million and $325 million, should be analyzed in the context of historical performance and industry benchmarks to assess growth potential and sustainability. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in skier visits by 9.7% juxtaposed with an increase in lift revenue by 2.6% suggests a change in consumer behavior. This may reflect a trend where fewer visitors are spending more, possibly due to the increased uptake of premium services such as ski schools, which saw a 5.5% revenue increase. The decline in retail/rental revenue by 9.3% could be attributed to a shift in consumer spending patterns or the impact of operational changes, such as the exit from certain leased store operations.The strategic focus on season pass sales seems to be paying off, providing revenue stability and potentially attracting a loyal customer base willing to commit upfront. This could be a trend worth monitoring for businesses in the leisure and hospitality sector, as it may indicate the importance of creating loyal customer communities through subscription or pass-based models. Economist The resilience of Vail Resorts' business model amidst unfavorable conditions is a testament to the inelastic nature of demand within certain segments of the tourism and leisure industry. Even with lower snowfall, the company managed to improve its EBITDA margin by 3.3 points, which is a strong indicator of its ability to control costs and optimize operations in response to external pressures. The increase in net income and EBITDA, along with the dividend hike, may have positive implications for the local economy, potentially signaling continued investment in employment and regional development.However, the decrease in visitation raises questions about the broader economic impacts on the industry, particularly for businesses reliant on high visitor volumes. It is essential to monitor whether this is a temporary dip due to specific seasonal factors or part of a longer-term trend that could affect the sector's growth trajectory. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM BROOMFIELD, Colo., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vail Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: MTN) today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ended January 31, 2024 and provided the Company's ski season-to-date metrics through March 3, 2024. Highlights Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. was $219.3 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. of $208.7 million in the same period in the prior year.Resort Reported EBITDA was $425.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which included $2.1 million of acquisition related expenses. In the same period in the prior year, Resort Reported EBITDA was $394.8 million, which included $0.3 million of acquisition and integration related expenses.Season-to-date total skier visits decreased 9.7% and total lift revenue increased 2.6% through March 3, 2024 compared to the fiscal year 2023 season-to-date period through March 5, 2023. Season-to-date ski school revenue was up 5.5% and dining revenue was down 0.5% compared to the prior year season-to-date period. Retail/rental revenue for North American resort and ski area store locations was down 9.3% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.The Company updated its guidance for fiscal year 2024 and is now expecting net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. to be between $270 million and $325 million and Resort Reported EBITDA to be between $849 million and $885 million, which includes an estimated $4 million of acquisition related expenses specific to Crans-Montana.The Company's Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $2.22 per share beginning with the dividend payable on April 11, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024.Commenting on the Company's fiscal 2024 second quarter results, Kirsten Lynch, Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Given the unfavorable conditions across our North American resorts, we are pleased that our results for the quarter demonstrate the resiliency of our strategic business model and our network of resorts and loyal guests. The results for the second quarter were negatively impacted by challenging conditions at all of our North American resorts, with approximately 42% lower snowfall across our western North American resorts through January compared to the same period in the prior year and limited natural snow and variable temperatures at our Eastern U.S. resorts (comprising the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast). ""Despite the impacts of conditions, Resort Reported EBITDA in the second quarter increased approximately 8% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the stability created by our season pass results. Resort EBITDA Margin also improved 3.3 points in the second quarter compared to the prior year driven by disciplined cost management. ""While visitation declined, our ancillary businesses performed well, in particular our ski and ride school, dining and rental businesses experienced strong growth in spending per visit compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the strong execution across our mountain resorts, as well as the impact of the Company's investments in our employees, technology, and on-mountain experience."" Season-to-Date Metrics through March 3, 2024 & Interim Results Commentary The Company reported certain ski season metrics for the comparative periods from the beginning of the ski season through March 3, 2024, and for the prior year period through March 5, 2023. The reported ski season metrics are for the Company's North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas, excluding the results of the Australian ski areas and Andermatt-Sedrun in both periods. The data mentioned in this release is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter end review and adjustments. Season-to-date total skier visits were down 9.7% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.Season-to-date total lift ticket revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period, was up 2.6% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.Season-to-date ski school revenue was up 5.5% and dining revenue was down 0.5% compared to the prior year season-to-date period. Retail/rental revenue for North American resort and ski area store locations was down 9.3% compared to the prior year season-to-date period.Commenting on the season-to-date metrics, Lynch said, ""Across our North American resorts, unfavorable conditions negatively impacted season-to-date visitation, which was below both prior year levels and our expectations based on the number of guests visiting and their frequency. Following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, challenging conditions persisted until early March at Whistler Blackcomb and our Tahoe resorts, and while conditions improved at our Rockies and Eastern resorts, visitation did not improve as quickly as expected. We expect a portion of the lower visitation is related to the challenging conditions in the first half of the season as well as a shift in visitation patterns. Despite the decline in season-to-date visitation relative to the prior year period, we are pleased with lift revenue growth driven by the stability created from the season pass program, the strength in ancillary spending per skier visit across our ski school, dining, and rental businesses, and the improving trends as the season progresses."" Operating Results A more complete discussion of our operating results can be found within the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company's Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, which was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following are segment highlights: Mountain Segment Total lift revenue increased $10.9 million, or 1.8%, compared to the same period in the prior year, to $603.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in North American pass product revenue, which increased 8.3% due to an increase in pass product sales for the 2023/2024 North American ski season compared to the prior year. Pass product revenue, although primarily collected prior to the ski season, is recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations throughout the ski season on a straight-line basis using the skiable days of the season to date period relative to the total estimated skiable days of the season. Challenging conditions during the early portion of the 2023/2024 North American ski season resulted in delayed openings for a number of our resorts and, as a result, we expect to recognize approximately $14 million of pass product revenue during the three months ending April 30, 2024 that would have otherwise been recognized during the three months ended January 31, 2024. Additionally, non-pass product lift revenue decreased 13.1%, driven by a decrease in skier visitation across all regions, which was impacted by limited natural snow and variable temperatures that resulted in delayed openings and reduced terrain offerings as compared to the prior year, and particularly impacted our resorts in the Eastern U.S. and Tahoe, partially offset by an increase in non-pass Effective Ticket Price (""ETP"") of 10.8%.Ski school revenue increased $3.2 million, or 2.6%, primarily driven by increased revenue at our resorts in Colorado and Park City, which benefited from an increase in guest spending per visit.Dining revenue decreased $3.8 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to decreased revenue from on-mountain dining venues at our resorts in the Eastern U.S. and Tahoe, partially offset by an increase in guest spending per visit.Retail/rental revenue decreased $23.8 million, or 14.9%, for which retail sales decreased $15.9 million, or 17.2%, and rental sales decreased $7.9 million, or 11.6%. The decrease in both retail and rental revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in skier visitation, as well as our exit of certain leased store operations which we operated in the prior year and resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $8.4 million.Operating expense decreased $35.6 million, or 5.8%, which was primarily attributable to reduced labor hours at our North American resorts as a result of challenging early season weather conditions including limited natural snow and variable temperatures that resulted in delayed openings and reduced terrain offerings which impacted our ability to operate at full capacity, as compared to the prior year, as well as lower variable expenses associated with decreased revenue, and disciplined cost management.Mountain Reported EBITDA increased $21.5 million, or 5.4%, for the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, which includes $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to $5.7 million in the same period in the prior year.Lodging Segment Lodging segment net revenue (excluding payroll cost reimbursements) for the three months ended January 31, 2024 decreased $2.3 million, or 3.0%, driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from managed condominium rooms of $3.0 million, or 9.7%, as a result of decreased demand, including the impact of decreased skier visitation driven by challenging weather conditions, as well as a reduction in our inventory of available managed condominium rooms proximate to our mountain resorts.Operating expense (excluding reimbursed payroll costs) decreased $11.0 million, or 13.8%, which was primarily attributable to: a reduction in labor hours associated with decreased demand, as well as lower staffing required to support a reduced inventory of managed condominium rooms; a decrease in allocated corporate overhead costs; and the receipt of property tax refunds during the three months ended January 31, 2024.Lodging Reported EBITDA increased $8.8 million, or 216.1%, for the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, which includes $0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to $1.1 million in the same period in the prior year.Resort - Combination of Mountain and Lodging Segments Resort net revenue decreased $16.2 million, or 1.5%, compared to the same period in the prior year, to $1,077.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024.Resort Reported EBITDA was $425.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024, an increase of $30.2 million, or 7.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year, which includes $2.1 million of acquisition related expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $0.3 million of acquisition and integration related expenses in the second quarter of the prior year.Total Performance Total net revenue decreased $23.8 million, or 2.2%, to $1,078.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year.Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. was $219.3 million, or $5.76 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. of $208.7 million, or $5.16 per diluted share, in the second quarter of the prior year. Additionally, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes the after-tax effect of acquisition related expenses of approximately $1.6 million, compared to $0.2 million of acquisition and integration related expenses in the second quarter of the prior year.Return of Capital Commenting on capital allocation, Lynch said, ""Our balance sheet remains strong, including total cash and revolver availability as of January 31, 2024 of approximately $1.4 billion, with $812 million of cash on hand, $409 million of revolver availability under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and $221 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2024, our Net Debt was 2.4 times trailing twelve months Total Reported EBITDA. We remain confident in the strong free cash flow generation and stability of the underlying business model. Given these dynamics, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Vail Resorts' common stock of $2.22 per share, representing an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend. The dividend will be payable on April 11, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and intend to maintain an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. We will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital and remain committed to prioritizing investments in our guest and employee experience, high-return capital projects, strategic acquisition opportunities, and returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program."" Crans-Montana Acquisition As previously announced on November 30, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Crans-Montana Mountain Resort (""Crans-Montana"") in Switzerland, the Company's second ski resort in Europe. Crans-Montana is an iconic ski destination in the heart of the Swiss Alps, with a unique heritage, incredible terrain, passionate team, and a community dedicated to the success of the region. This acquisition aligns to the Company's growth strategy of expanding its resort network in Europe, creating even more value for pass holders and guests around the world. Much like Andermatt-Sedrun, the Company believes Crans-Montana has a unique opportunity for future growth. The transaction is expected to close this spring, subject to certain third-party consents. Capital Investments Regarding calendar year 2024 capital expenditures, Lynch said, ""We remain dedicated to delivering an exceptional guest experience and will continue to prioritize reinvesting in the experience at our resorts, including consistently increasing capacity through lift, terrain, and food and beverage expansion projects, along with investments in technology to further elevate the guest and employee experience at our resorts. As previously announced, we expect our capital plan for calendar year 2024 to be approximately $189 million to $194 million, excluding $13 million of incremental capital investments in premium fleet and fulfillment infrastructure to support the official launch of My Epic Gear for the 2024/2025 winter season at 12 destination and regional resorts across North America, $11 million of growth capital investments at Andermatt-Sedrun and $1 million of reimbursable capital. Including My Epic Gear premium fleet and fulfillment infrastructure capital and one-time investments, our total capital plan for calendar year 2024 is expected to be approximately $214 million to $219 million. This excludes any capital expenditures associated with the Crans-Montana acquisition, which remains subject to closing. ""At Whistler Blackcomb, the Company plans to replace the four-person high speed Jersey Cream lift with a new six-person high speed lift. This lift is expected to provide a meaningful increase to uphill capacity and better distribute guests at a central part of the resort. At Hunter Mountain, subject to approvals, we plan to replace the four-person fixed-grip Broadway lift with a new six-person high speed lift and plan to relocate the existing Broadway lift to replace the two-person fixed-grip E lift, providing a meaningful increase in uphill capacity and improved access to terrain that is key to the progressive learning experience for our guests. At Park City, we are in the planning process to support the approved replacement of the Sunrise lift with a new 10-person gondola in partnership with the Canyons Village Management Association in calendar year 2025, which will provide improved access and enhanced guest experience for existing and future developments within Canyons Village. ""At Park City and Hunter Mountain beyond the planned lift investments we plan to enhance snowmaking systems to improve the experience for key terrain, increase early season terrain consistency, and improve the efficiency through the installation of automated and energy-efficient snowguns. We also plan to further support the Company's Commitment to Zero by investing in waste reduction projects across our resorts to achieve the goal of zero waste to landfill by 2030. At Afton Alps, we plan to install a 10-lane tubing experience and renovate the existing Alpine Building to create a 200 seat restaurant to further enhance the guest experience. At Seven Springs, we plan to add 390 new parking spaces to increase capacity and improve the guest experience. At Perisher, in advance of the 2025 winter season in Australia, we plan to replace the Mt Perisher Double and Triple Chairs with a new six person high speed lift, with capital spending commencing in calendar year 2024 and continuing into calendar year 2025. These projects remain subject to approvals. ""In addition, we are continuing to invest in innovative technology to enhance the guest experience. In the coming year, we are investing in new functionality for the My Epic App, and expanding Mobile Pass and Mobile Lift Tickets to Whistler Blackcomb. Across our resorts, we plan to pilot new technologies at select restaurants to make it both easier and faster for guests to dine at our resorts. In addition, in order to support the launch of My Epic Gear, we plan to invest in logistics and technology infrastructure to help deliver a transformational and elevated gear access experience for our guests. ""The 2023/2024 My Epic Gear pilot at Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, and Keystone is delivering a strong guest experience to pilot participants and valuable learnings for the business launch. My Epic Gear provides its members with the ability to choose the gear they want, for the full season or for the day, from a selection of the most popular and latest ski and snowboard models, and have it delivered to them when and where they want it, including slopeside pick up and drop off every day. In addition to offering the latest skis and snowboards, My Epic Gear will also offer name brand, high-quality ski and snowboard boots with personalized insoles and boot fit scanning technology. The entire My Epic Gear membership, from gear selection to boot fit to personalized recommendations to delivery, will be at the members' fingertips in the new My Epic app. The Company plans to launch My Epic Gear for the 2024/2025 winter season at 12 destination and regional resorts across North America, including kids gear, and will be limiting membership to 60,000 to 80,000 members in the first year launch as the business scales. To support the initial year of this new business, in calendar year 2024 the Company plans to invest $13 million beyond our typical annual capital plan in incremental premium gear fleet and fulfillment infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of this business. We plan to provide additional updates on My Epic Gear and the on-going capital needs of the business after the year one launch. ""At Andermatt-Sedrun, we are pleased to announce plans to invest approximately $11 million in high-impact growth capital projects as part of a multi-year strategic growth investment plan to enhance the guest experience on the mountain, which will be funded by the CHF 110 million capital that was invested as part of the purchase of our majority stake in Andermatt-Sedrun. As part of the calendar year 2024 investments, we are planning to upgrade and replace snowmaking infrastructure at the Sedrun-Milez area on the eastern side of the resort to enhance the guest experience for key beginner and intermediate terrain and significantly improve energy efficiency. In addition, we plan to invest in the on-mountain dining experience with improvements to the Milez and Natschen restaurants. These investments are expected to be completed ahead of the 2024/2025 European ski season and remain subject to regulatory approvals."" Pass Sales Launch Commenting on the launch of season pass sales for the 2024/2025 North American ski season, Lynch said, ""We are pleased to launch pass sales for the 2024/2025 season with a wide range of advance commitment products including our Epic Day Pass, which provides 1 to 7 days of access at our owned and operated resorts, and our unlimited Epic Pass and regional pass products, which can provide unlimited access to 41 resorts every day of the season and access to additional partner resorts, with no reservations required at any resort except Telluride. Subject to close, Vail Resorts plans to include access to Crans-Montana Mountain Resort on select Epic Pass products for the 2024/2025 ski and ride season. Starting in the 2024/2025 North American ski season, when pass holders are skiing or riding with a guest utilizing Buddy Tickets and Ski with a Friend Tickets, they can now skip the ticket line and go directly to the lift. On average, pass prices have increased 8% over the prior season's launch price and continue to represent tremendous value to our guests, further supported by our compelling network of mountain resorts, our strong guest experience created at each mountain resort, and our commitment to continually invest in the guest experience. We greatly appreciate the loyalty of our guests visiting across our entire network of resorts this season, and the continued loyalty of our pass holders that have already committed to next season."" Outlook Commenting on fiscal 2024 guidance, Lynch said, ""Due to the season-to-date underperformance, we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2024. For the remainder of the season, we are expecting improved performance compared to the season-to-date period, including an expected shift in visitation patterns into March and April. This is based on our significant base of pre-committed guests and guest historical behavior patterns, the improvement in conditions across our western North American and Northeast resorts, and our lodging booking trends for the Spring Break period. While we are lowering guidance for the fiscal year, we know that the financial impact of the weather disruptions was greatly mitigated by our advance commitment products, which create stability for our Company, our shareholders, and our communities in exchange for an incredible value to the guest. ""We now expect net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. for fiscal 2024 to be between $270 million and $325 million, and Resort Reported EBITDA for fiscal 2024 to be between $849 million and $885 million. We estimate Resort EBITDA Margin for fiscal 2024 to be approximately 29.6%, using the midpoint of the guidance range. Our guidance includes an estimated $4 million of acquisition related expenses specific to Crans-Montana, but does not include any estimate for the closing costs, operating results or integration expense associated with the Crans-Montana acquisition, which is expected to close this spring. The updated outlook for fiscal 2024 assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and normal weather conditions for the remainder of the 2023/2024 North American and European ski season and for the 2024 Australian ski season. The guidance assumes an exchange rate of $0.74 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada, an exchange rate of $0.65 between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Perisher, Falls Creek and Hotham in Australia, and an exchange rate of $1.13 between the Swiss Franc and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Andermatt-Sedrun in Switzerland."" The following table reflects the forecasted guidance range for the Company's fiscal year ending July 31, 2024, for Total Reported EBITDA (after stock-based compensation expense) and reconciles net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. guidance to such Total Reported EBITDA guidance. Fiscal 2024 Guidance (In thousands) For the Year Ending July 31, 2024 (6) Low End High End Range Range Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. $ 270,000 $ 325,000 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 26,000 18,000 Net income 296,000 343,000 Provision for income taxes (1) 105,000 122,000 Income before income taxes 401,000 465,000 Depreciation and amortization 274,000 266,000 Interest expense, net 164,000 158,000 Other (2) 8,000 — Total Reported EBITDA $ 847,000 $ 889,000 Mountain Reported EBITDA (3) $ 830,000 $ 864,000 Lodging Reported EBITDA (4) 18,000 22,000 Resort Reported EBITDA (5) 849,000 885,000 Real Estate Reported EBITDA (2,000) 4,000 Total Reported EBITDA $ 847,000 $ 889,000 (1) The provision for income taxes may be impacted by excess tax benefits primarily resulting from vesting and exercises of equity awards. Our estimated provision for income taxes does not include the impact, if any, of unknown future exercises of employee equity awards, which could have a material impact given that a significant portion of our awards may be in-the-money depending on the current value of the stock price. (2) Our guidance includes certain forward looking known changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration based solely on the passage of time and resulting impact on present value. Guidance excludes any forward looking change based upon, among other things, financial projections including long-term growth rates for Park City, which such change may be material. Separately, the intercompany loan associated with the Whistler Blackcomb transaction requires foreign currency remeasurement to Canadian dollars, the functional currency of Whistler Blackcomb. Our guidance excludes any forward looking change related to foreign currency gains or losses on the intercompany loans, which such change may be material. Additionally, our guidance excludes the impact of any future sales or disposals of land or other assets, which are contingent upon future approvals or other outcomes. (3) Mountain Reported EBITDA also includes approximately $23 million of stock-based compensation. (4) Lodging Reported EBITDA also includes approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation. (5) The Company provides Reported EBITDA ranges for the Mountain and Lodging segments, as well as for the two combined. The low and high of the expected ranges provided for the Mountain and Lodging segments, while possible, do not sum to the high or low end of the Resort Reported EBITDA range provided because we do not expect or assume that we will hit the low or high end of both ranges. (6) Guidance estimates are predicated on an exchange rate of $0.74 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar, related to the operations of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada; an exchange rate of $0.65 between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar, related to the operations of our Australian ski areas; and an exchange rate of $1.13 between the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar, related to the operations of Andermatt-Sedrun in Switzerland.

Statement Concerning Non-GAAP Financial Measures When reporting financial results, we use the terms Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA, Resort EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Net Real Estate Cash Flow, which are not financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA, Resort EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Net Real Estate Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we report segment Reported EBITDA (i.e. Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate), the measure of segment profit or loss required to be disclosed in accordance with GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. Additionally, with respect to discussion of impacts from currency, the Company calculates the impact by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results, as the Company believes that comparing financial information using comparable foreign exchange rates is a more objective and useful measure of changes in operating performance. Reported EBITDA (and its counterpart for each of our segments) has been presented herein as a measure of the Company's performance. The Company believes that Reported EBITDA is an indicative measurement of the Company's operating performance, and is similar to performance metrics generally used by investors to evaluate other companies in the resort and lodging industries. The Company defines Resort EBITDA Margin as Resort Reported EBITDA divided by Resort net revenue. The Company believes Resort EBITDA Margin is an important measurement of operating performance. The Company believes that Net Debt is an important measurement of liquidity as it is an indicator of the Company's ability to obtain additional capital resources for its future cash needs. Additionally, the Company believes Net Real Estate Cash Flow is important as a cash flow indicator for its Real Estate segment. See the tables provided in this release for reconciliations of our measures of segment profitability and non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Positive Total net sales for Q1 2024 were $127.6 million, a 3.9% decrease from the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations was $2.6 million, with adjusted net loss of $0.2 million. The Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. The company anticipates completing the sale of its fresh cut business in the fiscal second quarter. Calavo Growers targets SG&A savings of $20 million annually. Negative Grown segment net sales decreased by 4.0% to $113.0 million. Net loss increased to $2.6 million from $0.7 million for the same period last year. Adjusted net loss was $0.2 million, compared to adjusted net income of $0.8 million for the prior year quarter. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in total net sales by 3.9% for Calavo Growers, Inc. indicates a challenging quarter, reflecting potential market saturation or increased competition within the avocado and prepared foods industry. The decline in the Grown segment sales by 4.0% and the Prepared segment by 2.9% suggests a need to reassess market strategies and consumer trends. The improved avocado margin per case, despite lower volume, points towards a strategic shift focusing on profitability over volume, which may be a response to market pricing pressures. The anticipation of a successful California avocado season could signal a potential recovery in sales volume and market share. Financial Analyst The net loss widening from $0.7 million to $2.6 million year-over-year signals a concerning trend for investors, particularly as it diverges from the slightly improved Adjusted EBITDA. This discrepancy may result from one-time expenses, such as professional fees for the ongoing investigation, which investors should consider as non-recurring when evaluating the company's core operational performance. The declared quarterly cash dividend, despite the net loss, reflects a commitment to shareholder returns but raises questions about the sustainability of such dividends if profitability does not improve. The expected SG&A savings and reduced depreciation and amortization from the divestiture of the fresh cut business could improve future margins and operational efficiency. Legal Expert The ongoing investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a significant concern, as it could lead to legal repercussions and financial penalties that may impact future financials and investor confidence. The costs associated with this investigation have already contributed to increased SG&A expenses. The full cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) is crucial for mitigating potential damages and restoring trust among stakeholders. Investors should closely monitor the outcomes of this investigation for any material impact on the company's operations and reputation. 03/11/2024 - 04:07 PM SANTA PAULA, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calavo Growers, Inc. (Nasdaq-GS: CVGW), a global avocado industry leader and provider of convenient, ready-to-eat fresh food, today reported its financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2024. First Quarter Financial Overview Introductory Note: In the first quarter of 2024, we concluded that the fresh cut (formerly RFG) business meets the requirements to be classified as held for sale and discontinued operations. As a result, the financial results of that business are reported as discontinued operations in this press release. Prior to the decision to divest our fresh cut business, the Company’s Prepared reporting segment included the fresh cut business unit and our guacamole business. Due to the planned divestiture, the fresh cut business unit is no longer included in our Prepared business segment. Retrospective reclassifications also have been made to prior period financial statements and commentary in this press release to present the fresh cut business unit as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and commentary included in this press release relate to our continuing operations. Total net sales of $127.6 million, a 3.9% decrease from the prior year quarter Grown segment net sales decreased 4.0% to $113.0 millionPrepared segment net sales decreased 2.9% to $14.6 million Gross profit of $12.5 million, compared to $13.1 million for the prior year quarter Grown segment gross profit decreased $1.3 million to $8.1 millionPrepared segment gross profit increased $0.7 million to $4.3 million Net loss from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same period last yearAdjusted net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share for the prior year quarterAdjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million compared to $4.6 million for the same period last year Adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. First Quarter Highlights for Continuing Operations Avocado margin per case improved versus prior year quarter while tomato gross profit declinedPrepared gross profit improved versus prior year quarter primarily due to lower fruit costWe made progress toward completing the sale of the fresh cut business and anticipate closing the transaction within the fiscal second quarter The Company’s investigation into certain matters and potential issues under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is ongoing and the Company continues to cooperate fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of JusticeThe Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on April 29, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 1, 2024 Management Commentary “Our first quarter results were affected by temporary market dynamics within our avocado business, particularly for smaller sized fruit, and we are pleased to report that conditions have improved in February and March,” said Lee Cole, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calavo Growers, Inc. “We expect a solid rebound in earnings in the second quarter and fiscal 2024 owing to improved avocado margins, improved tomato performance and the ramp up of the California avocado season. We expect another successful California avocado season for Calavo in fiscal 2024.” “We continue to anticipate completing the sale of our fresh cut business within the fiscal second quarter. We expect to realize SG&A cost reductions from both the sale of the fresh cut business as well as other cost reductions as we make our corporate structure more efficient. We are targeting SG&A savings of $20 million or more on an annualized basis and already have begun implementing some efficiencies in our corporate structure. We also anticipate a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $10 million on an annualized basis due to the divestiture.” First Quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Review for Continuing Operations Total net sales for the first quarter 2024 continuing operations were $127.6 million, compared to $132.8 million for the first quarter 2023, a decline of 3.9%. Grown segment sales decreased 4.0%, and Prepared segment sales decreased 2.9%. The average selling price of avocados in the Grown segment increased by 20% compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the first quarter was $12.5 million, or 9.8% of net sales, compared to $13.1 million and 9.9%, respectively, for the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter totaled $13.5 million, or 10.6% of net sales, compared to $11.6 million and 8.8% of net sales for the same period last year. The increase versus the prior year primarily was related to $2.4 million of professional fees associated with the ongoing investigation. Absent these costs, our SG&A expenses would have been lower than the prior year quarter. Net loss for the first quarter was $2.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. This compares with a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Adjusted net loss was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million compared to $4.6 million for the same period last year. Balance Sheet and Liquidity The Company ended the quarter with $47.0 million of net debt, which included $45.7 million of borrowings under its credit facility and $6.9 million of other long-term obligations and finance leases, less cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 million. The Company had approximately $33.6 million of available liquidity as of January 31, 2024. Segment PerformanceGrown Grown segment gross profit was $8.1 million, or $1.3 million below the prior year quarter. Avocado gross profit per case was higher than in the year-ago quarter, while volume declined 18% as we prioritized margin over volume in our sourcing and sales decisions. While volume was down, avocado prices were approximately 20% higher than in the prior year quarter. Gross profit in our tomato business was down approximately $1.1 million primarily due to lower volume. Performance in our tomato business has improved in the second quarter, and we expect solid tomato results in fiscal 2024. Foreign exchange gains related to appreciation of the peso were approximately $0.4 million higher than in the year-ago quarter. Prepared (continuing operations)Prepared segment gross profit improved $0.7 million to $4.3 million from the prior year quarter. Gross margin rose to 30% from 24% last year on lower fruit input costs. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes non-GAAP measures EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share, which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.” EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) interest income and expense, (2) income tax (benefit) provision, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA with further adjustments for (1) non-cash net losses (income) recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a primary metric by which management evaluates the operating performance of the business, on which certain operating expenditures and internal budgets are based. Additionally, the Company’s senior management is compensated in part on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA. The adjustments to calculate EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are items recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Calavo Growers, Inc. excluding (1) non-cash net losses recognized from unconsolidated entities, (2) goodwill impairment, (3) write-off of long-lived assets, (4) acquisition-related costs, (5) restructuring-related costs, including certain severance costs, (6) certain litigation and other related costs, and (7) one-time items. Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and the related measure of adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share exclude certain items that are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded. We believe adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations affords investors a different view of the overall financial performance of the Company than adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net income (loss) attributable from continuing operations to Calavo Growers, Inc. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables below. Items are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. None of these metrics are presented as measures of liquidity. The way the Company measures EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in Company agreements.

LifeMD well-positioned for expansion and market disruption in telemedicine. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 60% year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenue to $44.9 million, with a significant 90% increase in Telehealth revenues, is indicative of LifeMD's strong market performance and growing demand for virtual healthcare services. The expansion of the gross margin to a record 88.1% reflects operational efficiency and a favorable revenue mix, which is particularly impressive in the context of the healthcare industry where margins can be pressured by regulatory changes and reimbursement rates.The adjusted EBITDA increase from $1.0 million to $5.5 million year-over-year suggests that the company's profitability is improving and the positive GAAP free cash flow of $3.5 million signals healthy liquidity. However, the GAAP net loss of $4.5 million warrants attention as it highlights ongoing costs that are not included in the adjusted figures. Investors should consider the sustainability of this growth, especially as the company scales up its operations. Market Research Analyst LifeMD's growth in Telehealth and Weight Management subscribers aligns with broader market trends where consumers are increasingly seeking digital health solutions. The company's performance, particularly the 27% year-over-year increase in telehealth subscribers, suggests that it is successfully capitalizing on this trend. LifeMD's strategic positioning as a market disruptor in telemedicine is further supported by the successful launch of its GLP-1 weight management program, which has already exceeded 22,000 subscribers.The raised revenue guidance to at least $200 million for 2024 is a strong indicator of management's confidence in continued growth. However, it is crucial to monitor how the company will manage customer acquisition costs and maintain subscriber growth while ensuring service quality as competition in the telehealth market intensifies. Healthcare Industry Analyst The GLP-1 weight management program's rapid growth to over 22,000 subscribers is noteworthy in the context of the obesity epidemic and the increasing focus on non-surgical weight loss solutions. LifeMD's ability to scale this service in less than nine months demonstrates not only market demand but also operational capabilities. The telehealth platform's licensing and investment agreement with Medifast, which included a $10 million collaboration fee and a $10 million equity investment, also highlights the strategic partnerships that can provide additional capital and validation of LifeMD's business model.Investors should assess the long-term viability of the GLP-1 program's growth trajectory, considering potential market saturation and the regulatory environment surrounding weight management pharmaceuticals. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue increased 60% year-over-year to $44.9 million with Telehealth revenues increasing 90% versus the year-ago period.Adjusted EPS of $0.15 per share compared with $0.02 in the year-ago period.Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 million compared with $1.0 million in the year-ago period.Weight Management subscribers exceeded 22,000 as of year-end 2023, ahead of previous guidance.Telehealth subscribers grew 27% year-over-year to a record 215,000 patients at year-end 2023. Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today NEW YORK, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LifeMD, Inc. (Nasdaq: LFMD), a leading provider of virtual primary care, today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Management Commentary “2023 was a record-setting year for LifeMD, characterized by sharp increases in revenue, telehealth subscribers and profitability. During the year, we launched our GLP-1 weight management program which has rapidly grown to become one of the leading providers of medically supported weight loss management services nationwide. In less than nine months, we scaled this business to over 22,000 subscribers and growing. Year to date in 2024, we continue to see record daily performance in the sale of new weight management subscriptions and at a rate in excess of our previous 2024 guidance. We demonstrated the tremendous value of our proprietary telehealth platform and dedicated 50-state, affiliated medical group through the execution of a substantial platform license and investment agreement with Medifast that provided LifeMD with a $10 million collaboration fee plus a $10 million equity investment,” said Justin Schreiber, Chairman and CEO of LifeMD. “Our RexMD business, once again posted double-digit revenue growth with robust contribution margins that continued to exceed 30%. Looking ahead, we are exceptionally well-positioned to meet or exceed our 2024 financial guidance while continuing to expand our position as a market leading disruptor in telemedicine.” “We exited 2023 with the strongest financial position in our company’s history and are well capitalized to execute upon our aggressive expansion goals. Last year, we produced record cash flow from operations of approximately $9 million compared with negative operating cash flow of almost $23 million in 2022. We achieved this growth in profitability while simultaneously increasing consolidated net revenues by 28% versus the prior year. As a result of the strong performance we’ve seen across our business, led by performance in our growing GLP-1 weight management program, we are raising our 2024 revenue guidance to at least $200 million, up from previous guidance of $195 to $205 million. As this guidance implies, we expect 2024 revenue growth of at least 31% and we re-affirm guidance for adjusted EBITDA growth of 67%,” commented Marc Benathen, Chief Financial Officer of LifeMD.

We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We use certain financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) attributable to common shareholders before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion, financing transaction expense, non-controlling interests, foreign currency translation, inventory valuation, sales return reserves, litigation costs, loss on debt extinguishment, dividends, insurance acceptance and Sarbanes-Oxley readiness, acquisition costs, severance expenses and stock-based compensation expense. We have provided below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss attributable to common shareholders, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EPS is defined as the diluted net loss attributable to LifeMD, Inc common shareholders before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion, financing transaction expense, non-controlling interests, foreign currency translation, inventory valuation, sales return reserves, litigation costs, loss on debt extinguishment, dividends, insurance acceptance and Sarbanes-Oxley readiness, acquisition costs, severance expenses and stock-based compensation expense. We have provided below a reconciliation of adjusted EPS to Diluted loss per share attributable to LifeMD, Inc common shareholders, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We believe the above financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS may vary from that of others in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS should not be considered as an alternative to net loss before taxes, net loss per share, operating loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of performance.

The company aims to be a leader in retinal care with a focus on wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma treatments. Positive milestones include successful financings, key leadership appointments, and progress in clinical trials. Financially, the company has a strong cash position and increasing revenues. However, there are concerns regarding rising research and development expenses, net losses, and non-cash charges. Positive Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. is making significant strides in retinal care with a focus on wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma treatments. The company appointed key strategic and clinical experts, enhancing its position in the field. Successful financings raised over $440 million, supporting the development of AXPAXLI and other clinical programs. Total net revenue increased by 13.4% in 2023, driven by DEXTENZA sales. The company's cash balance of $195.8 million as of December 31, 2023, along with $325 million in gross proceeds from a recent private placement, is expected to support operations into at least 2028. Upcoming milestones include top-line clinical data for AXPAXLI in diabetic retinopathy and PAXTRAVA in glaucoma, expected in Q2 2024. Ocular Therapeutix plans to host an Investor Day in Q2 2024 to outline its updated corporate strategy. Negative Rising research and development expenses, particularly in clinical and regulatory areas, are a concern. Net losses increased significantly, with a net loss of $(80.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization have also increased, impacting the company's financial performance. Financial Analyst The recent financial report from Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. highlights a modest revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, with an increase of 5.0% compared to the same period in 2022. This growth is primarily attributed to sales of DEXTENZA, indicating a positive market reception for the product. However, the company's net loss widened significantly in the fourth quarter, from $(15.5) million in 2022 to $(29.2) million in 2023, which could be concerning to investors. The reported net loss includes non-cash expenses related to derivative liabilities, which are important to consider when evaluating the company's financial health. Ocular's cash position appears strong, with a year-end cash balance of $196 million and an additional $325 million from a recent private placement. This financial backing is expected to support operations into at least 2028, suggesting a solid runway for the company's research and development activities. The company's ability to raise capital through financings is indicative of investor confidence in its pipeline and strategic direction. Medical Research Analyst Ocular Therapeutix's commitment to retinal disease treatments is evident with the initiation of the Phase 3 SOL-1 study for AXPAXLI in wet AMD, a leading cause of blindness among older adults. The strategic focus on this area, coupled with the anticipation of topline clinical data in Q2 2024, suggests significant potential for market expansion and revenue diversification if the trials prove successful. The company's strategic hires, including top experts in the field, demonstrate a strengthened effort to accelerate its clinical programs and potentially enhance its competitive position in the ophthalmology market. The upcoming investor day in Q2 2024 will be crucial for stakeholders to gain insights into the company's updated corporate strategy and long-term vision. This event may serve as a pivotal moment for Ocular, potentially affecting investor sentiment and stock valuation based on the strategic objectives and milestones presented. Market Research Analyst In the context of the ophthalmic pharmaceutical market, Ocular Therapeutix's focus on innovative therapies for eye diseases such as wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy positions the company in a high-growth potential sector. The prevalence of these conditions is increasing with the aging population and effective treatments are in high demand. The company's strategic appointments and clinical trial advancements indicate an aggressive pursuit of market leadership in this niche. However, the competitive landscape is robust, with other biopharmaceutical companies also vying for market share. The success of Ocular's clinical trials and subsequent FDA approvals will be critical to gaining a foothold. Investors will likely monitor the company's research and development efficiency and time-to-market capabilities closely, as these are key factors in the fast-paced pharmaceutical industry. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Leadership Appointments Move Ocular Towards Being a Leader in Retinal Care Screening Underway in AXPAXLI™ Phase 3 SOL-1 Trial for Wet AMD Topline Clinical Data for AXPAXLI in Diabetic Retinopathy and PAXTRAVA™ in Glaucoma Expected in Q2 2024 Cash Expected to Support Operations Into At Least 2028 Based on $196M YE 2023 Cash Balance Plus $325M Gross Proceeds from February 2024 PIPE Planning to Host an Investor Day in Q2 2024 to Outline Updated Corporate Strategy BEDFORD, Mass., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL, “Ocular”, the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to enhancing people’s vision and quality of life through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and other diseases and conditions of the eye, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter 2023 and full year ended December 31, 2023. “I joined Ocular because I see the opportunity to unlock significant value for patients and stockholders through the development of safe, effective and durable treatments for retinal diseases, starting with our lead candidate, AXPAXLI for wet AMD,” said Pravin Dugel, MD, Executive Chairman of Ocular Therapeutix. “Bringing together our dedicated, world-class team of acknowledged strategic and clinical experts has enabled us to position Ocular as a leader in retinal care. Our goal is to bring AXPAXLI to the market as soon as possible. Our strengthened team provides us with an opportunity to enrich and accelerate the AXPAXLI clinical programs.” Dr. Dugel concluded, “I believe the Company has made outstanding progress over the last several months, with the initiation of the Phase 3 SOL-1 study with AXPAXLI in wet AMD and successful financings that raised more than $440 million in gross proceeds from existing and new top tier health care investors. Further, I believe that wet AMD is just the beginning for AXPAXLI. We look forward to providing an update on the Company’s strategy and objectives related to our increased focus on retinal disease during our upcoming Investor Day, planned for the second quarter 2024.” Recent Achievements: Named Pravin Dugel, MD as Executive Chairman and appointed key strategic and clinical experts, including Jeff Heier, MD, as Chief Scientific Officer, Peter Kaiser, MD, as Medical Director, and Sanjay Nayak, MBBS, PhD, as Chief Strategy Officer, to create a world renowned and respected team and move the Company to the forefront of retinal careAnnounced first subjects screened and received their first aflibercept injection in the Phase 3 SOL-1 study with AXPAXLI in wet AMD, being conducted according to a Special Protocol Assessment Agreement with FDACompleted two recent financings raising more than $440 million in total gross proceeds to fund the Phase 3 clinical development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD as well as to fund continued clinical development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy Anticipated Upcoming Milestones: April 5-8, PAXTRAVA™ ASCRS: Topline results from the Phase 2 trial (NCT05335122) in subjects with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT)Q2 2024: Ocular Therapeutix Investor Day (exact date to be announced)Q2 2024: Topline Phase 1 results from the HELIOS trial evaluating AXPAXLI in subjects with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NCT05695417) Fourth Quarter and Year End December 31, 2023 Financial Results Total cash and cash equivalents (Cash) were $195.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company also completed a private placement of common shares in February 2024 that provided gross proceeds of $325.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. Based on current plans and related estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA®, the Company believes that its current cash balance is sufficient to support its planned expenses, obligations and capital expenditure requirements into at least 2028. Total net revenue includes both gross DEXTENZA product revenue, net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which the Company refers to as net product revenue; and collaboration revenue. Total net revenue was $14.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 5.0% increase over total net revenue of $14.1 million in the comparable period in 2022, driven by DEXTENZA sales. Total net revenue for the full year 2023 was $58.4 million versus $51.5 million in 2022, an increase of 13.4%. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $16.2 million versus $13.5 million for the comparable period in 2022, driven primarily by an increase in overall clinical and regulatory expenses associated with product development programs. Overall R&D expenses for the full year increased $7.6 million to $61.1 million from $53.5 million in 2022, reflecting the timing and conduct of our clinical trials. Selling and marketing expenses were $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $10.5 million for the comparable quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting a reduction in personnel costs driven by lower expense for stock-based compensation and other items. Overall, selling and marketing expenses for the full year increased nominally to $40.5 million from $39.9 million in 2022, related to an increase in personnel costs and other costs, offset by lower spend on professional services. General and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $8.3 million in the comparable quarter of 2022, lower primarily due to a reduction of professional-related fees and other expenses. Overall, G&A expenses for the full year increased by $1.7 million to $33.9 million from $32.2 million in 2022, related to an increase of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by lower professional-related fees and other expenses. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(29.2) million, or a loss of $(0.35) per share on both a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $(15.5) million, or net loss of $(0.20) per share on a basic basis and a loss of $(0.24) per share on a diluted basis, for the comparable period in 2022. The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $(6.5) million non-cash expense attributable to changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the Company’s convertible notes and the Barings credit facility versus the net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 that included a $5.2 million non-cash gain attributable to the derivative liability associated with the Company’s convertible notes. Non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization were $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $4.7 million for the comparable quarter in 2022. Overall, the Company reported a net loss of $(80.7) million, or a loss of $(1.01) per share on a basic basis and a loss of $(1.02) on a diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus a net loss of $(71.0) million, or a loss of $(0.92) per share on a basic basis and a loss of $(0.97) on a diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Outstanding shares as of March 6, 2024 were approximately 148.6 million.

(CRBU) reports significant progress in clinical trials, dosing the 30th patient in the CB-010 ANTLER Phase 1 trial and initiating the CB-012 AMpLify Phase 1 trial. The company has $372.4 million in cash and securities to fund operations until Q1 2026. Financially, Caribou saw an increase in licensing revenue but also higher R&D and G&A expenses, resulting in a net loss for Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Positive Significant clinical progress with dosing the 30th patient in the CB-010 ANTLER Phase 1 trial and initiating the CB-012 AMpLify Phase 1 trial. Caribou has $372.4 million in cash and securities to fund operations until Q1 2026. Increase in licensing revenue, primarily due to the termination of the AbbVie Collaboration and License Agreement. Higher R&D and G&A expenses in 2023 compared to 2022, leading to a net loss for Q4 2013 and full year 2013. Negative Net loss reported for Q4 2023 and full year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Increase in R&D and G&A expenses may impact the company's financial performance. Pausing the development of CB-020 may affect the company's pipeline and future potential therapies. Financial Analyst The financial results disclosed by Caribou Biosciences indicate a significant increase in cash reserves from $317.0 million in 2022 to $372.4 million in 2023, bolstered by a successful public offering and a strategic equity investment from Pfizer. This positions the company with a substantial runway, projecting to fund operations into Q1 2026. Such liquidity is crucial for biopharmaceutical companies, which face long development cycles and regulatory hurdles before bringing products to market.Revenue from licensing and collaboration agreements shows a substantial year-over-year increase, primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue from a terminated collaboration with AbbVie. This suggests Caribou's ability to monetize its technological platforms, albeit the sustainability of such revenue streams should be scrutinized, given the one-off nature of the AbbVie revenue recognition.Investors should note the uptick in research and development costs, which reflects ongoing investment in clinical trials. While increased R&D expenses are typical for companies in growth phases, they must be balanced against the progress and potential of the clinical pipeline to assess long-term value creation. Medical Research Analyst Caribou Biosciences' progress with its clinical trials, especially the dosing of the 30th patient in the CB-010 ANTLER Phase 1 trial and the initiation of the CB-012 AMpLify Phase 1 trial, signifies momentum in its pipeline. The Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations granted by the FDA in 2022 for CB-010 underscore its potential to address unmet medical needs.The strategic decision to pause the development of CB-020 and prioritize other assets reflects a focused allocation of resources towards the most promising therapies. The clinical data expected in Q2 2024 for CB-010 will be pivotal in assessing the therapy's efficacy and safety, which could significantly impact the company's valuation and future prospects. Oncology Doctor Caribou's pipeline includes therapies targeting hematologic malignancies, a field where innovation is critically needed. Their allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies, such as CB-010 and CB-011, offer a potential advantage over autologous therapies by being readily available 'off-the-shelf'. This could reduce treatment times and potentially improve access for patients.The FDA's acceptance of a proposed comparator arm for a Phase 3 trial of CB-010 is a positive regulatory milestone. However, the true test will be the comparison of its efficacy and safety profile against standard therapies, which will determine its competitive position in the market. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM -- 30th patient dosed in CB-010 ANTLER Phase 1 trial dose expansion; initial dose expansion data and RP2D to be disclosed in Q2 2024 -- -- 1st patient dosed in CB-012 AMpLify Phase 1 trial for patients with r/r AML -- -- $372.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities expected to fund the current operating plan into Q1 2026 -- BERKELEY, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caribou Biosciences, Inc.

For our second program, CB-011, we continue to enroll patients in the CaMMouflage trial and plan to report initial dose escalation data by year-end 2024. For our third program, CB-012, we are thrilled to have recently dosed the first patient in the AMpLify trial. Our team is focused on clinical execution to inform two clinical datasets this year as part of our mission of bringing transformative therapies to patients with devastating diseases.” Clinical highlightsCB-010, a clinical-stage allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Caribou has dosed the 30th patient in the dose expansion portion of the ongoing ANTLER Phase 1 clinical trial in second-line relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (r/r LBCL) patients. Previously, 16 patients were dosed in the dose escalation portion of ANTLER. The company will continue enrolling additional second-line r/r LBCL patients in ANTLER to collect additional clinical data.In December 2023, Caribou shared regulatory feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following a Type B clinical meeting. The company received the FDA’s input on a Phase 3 randomized pivotal trial for CB-010 in second-line r/r LBCL, stating that Caribou’s proposed comparator arm of platinum-based immunochemotherapy followed by high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is acceptable.As previously reported, CB-010 demonstrated encouraging data from the dose escalation portion of the ANTLER Phase 1 clinical trial in 16 patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). Dose escalation data showed CB-010 has the potential to rival the efficacy and safety profile of approved autologous CAR-T cell therapies.To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-010 is the first anti-CD19 allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy to be evaluated in the second-line LBCL setting, and it was granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations by the FDA for specific indications in 2022. CB-011, a clinical-stage allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy for multiple myeloma Caribou is enrolling patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM) in the dose escalation portion of the ongoing CaMMouflage Phase 1 clinical trial. Patients are currently being enrolled at dose level 3 (450x106 CAR-T cells).Preclinical data for CB-011 were published in Cancer Immunology Research in February 2024. The manuscript is available on Caribou’s website under Scientific Publications. CB-012, a clinical-stage allogeneic anti-CLL-1 CAR-T cell therapy for acute myeloid leukemia The first patient has been dosed in the AMpLify Phase 1 clinical trial, which is evaluating CB-012 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML). Additional site activation is underway.Preclinical data for CB-012 highlighting the investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies will be presented as a poster presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, held April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego. CB-020, a preclinical allogeneic anti-ROR1 CAR-NK cell therapy As part of a regular portfolio prioritization process, Caribou has paused the development of CB-020, a preclinical allogeneic anti-ROR1 CAR-NK cell therapy. Caribou continues to develop its CAR-NK cell therapy platform as these therapies may have potential for the treatment of multiple diseases. 2024 anticipated milestones CB-010: In Q2 2024, Caribou plans to present initial dose expansion data, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and emerging translational data from the ANTLER Phase 1 clinical trial, as well as an updated timeline for the pivotal Phase 3 trial initiation.CB-011: Caribou plans to present initial dose escalation data from the CaMMouflage Phase 1 clinical trial by year-end 2024.CB-012: Caribou plans to provide updates on dose escalation as the AMpLify Phase 1 clinical trial in r/r AML advances. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial resultsCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities: Caribou had $372.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, compared to $317.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The 2023 amount includes the approximately $134.4 million in net proceeds from the Company’s underwritten public offering in July and August 2023 and the $25.0 million equity investment in June 2023 from Pfizer. Caribou expects these cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into Q1 2026. Licensing and collaboration revenue: Revenue from Caribou’s licensing and collaboration agreements was $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $34.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to $3.7 million and $13.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to $24.8 million in revenue recognized under the now-terminated AbbVie Collaboration and License Agreement, including $20.8 million of deferred revenue recognized upon termination of this agreement as previously disclosed, which was the remaining deferred revenue balance from AbbVie’s $30 million upfront payment in February 2021. R&D expenses: Research and development expenses were $31.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $112.1 million for the full year 2023, compared to $25.7 million and $82.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to costs to advance pipeline programs, including the CB-010 ANTLER, CB-011 CaMMouflage, and CB-012 AMpLify Phase 1 clinical trials; personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to headcount increases; and facilities and other allocated expenses. G&A expenses: General and administrative expenses were $9.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $38.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to $8.5 million and $38.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to headcount increases, and other facilities and allocated expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in insurance and other service-related expenses, and patent prosecution and maintenance costs. Net loss: Caribou reported a net loss of $34.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $102.1 million for the full year 2023, compared to $27.0 million and $99.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. About CB-010CB-010 is the lead product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). In the ongoing ANTLER Phase 1 trial, Caribou is enrolling second-line patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) comprised of different subtypes of aggressive r/r B-NHL (DLBCL NOS, PMBCL, HGBL, tFL, and tMZL). CB-010 is an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy engineered using Cas9 CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) genome-editing technology. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-010 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy in the clinic with a PD-1 knockout, a genome-editing strategy designed to improve antitumor activity by limiting premature CAR-T cell exhaustion. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-010 is the first anti-CD19 allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy to be evaluated in the second-line LBCL setting and it has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations by the FDA for specific indications. Additional information on the ANTLER trial (NCT04637763) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. About CB-011CB-011 is a product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM) in the CaMMouflage Phase 1 trial. CB-011 is an allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy engineered using Cas12a chRDNA genome-editing technology. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-011 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy in the clinic that is engineered to improve antitumor activity through an immune cloaking strategy with a B2M knockout and insertion of a B2M–HLA-E fusion protein to blunt immune-mediated rejection. CB-011 has been granted Fast Track and orphan drug designations by the FDA. Additional information on the CaMMouflage trial (NCT05722418) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. About CB-012CB-012 is a product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in the AMpLify Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML). CB-012 is an anti-CLL-1 CAR-T cell therapy engineered with five genome edits, enabled by Caribou’s patented next-generation CRISPR technology platform, which uses Cas12a chRDNA genome editing to significantly improve the specificity of genome edits. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-012 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy with both checkpoint disruption, through a PD-1 knockout, and immune cloaking, through a B2M knockout and B2M–HLA-E fusion protein insertion; both armoring strategies are designed to improve antitumor activity. Caribou has exclusively in-licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in the field of allogeneic CLL-1-targeted cell therapy a panel of fully human scFvs targeting CLL-1, from which the company has selected an appropriate scFv for the generation of the company’s CAR. Additional information on the AMpLify trial (NCT06128044) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. About Caribou’s novel next-generation CRISPR platform CRISPR genome editing uses easily designed, modular biological tools to make DNA changes in living cells. There are two basic components of Class 2 CRISPR systems: the nuclease protein that cuts DNA and the RNA molecule(s) that guide the nuclease to generate a site-specific, double-stranded break, leading to an edit at the targeted genomic site. CRISPR systems are capable of editing unintended genomic sites, known as off-target editing, which may lead to harmful effects on cellular function and phenotype. In response to this challenge, Caribou has developed CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA guides (chRDNAs; pronounced “chardonnays”) that direct substantially more precise genome editing compared to all-RNA guides. Caribou is deploying the power of its Cas12a chRDNA technology to carry out high efficiency multiple edits, including multiplex gene insertions, to develop CRISPR-edited therapies. About Caribou Biosciences, Inc.Caribou Biosciences is a clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for patients with devastating diseases. The company’s genome-editing platform, including its Cas12a chRDNA technology, enables superior precision to develop cell therapies that are armored to potentially improve antitumor activity. Caribou is advancing a pipeline of clinical-stage off-the-shelf cell therapies from its CAR-T platform as readily available treatments for patients with hematologic malignancies.

Cloud revenue saw significant growth, with Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 49% and Cloud Application revenue up 14%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.85, while non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 16% to $1.41. Oracle's total Remaining Performance Obligations reached over $80 billion, setting a new record. Positive Strong Q3 results with total revenue of $13.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year Cloud revenue growth with Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 49% and Cloud Application revenue up 14% GAAP earnings per share at $0.85, non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 16% to $1.41 Total Remaining Performance Obligations exceeded $80 billion, a new all-time record Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in non-GAAP earnings per share by 16% indicates a positive trajectory in Oracle's profitability, which is a critical metric for investors assessing company performance. The 7% year-over-year growth in total revenue suggests a stable expansion, aligning with the broader industry trend of increasing demand for cloud services. However, the 3% decline in cloud license and on-premise license revenues could reflect a shift in consumer preference towards cloud services over traditional software licenses, a trend that financial analysts would monitor for its potential to reshape revenue streams.The remaining performance obligations (RPO) growing by 29% to $80 billion is a significant indicator of future revenue, providing a robust backlog that assures sustained income. The expectation that 43% of this RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next four quarters provides a clear forecast for short-term financial planning. The substantial operating cash flow and free cash flow figures underscore Oracle's liquidity and financial health, which may influence investor confidence and Oracle's ability to invest in strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst The surge in cloud infrastructure (IaaS) revenue by 49% and the overall 25% increase in cloud revenue reflect the high demand for cloud services, positioning Oracle favorably within the competitive cloud market. This growth is particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a global cloud infrastructure market that is becoming increasingly saturated. Oracle's specific mention of the Gen2 AI infrastructure exceeding supply suggests a strong product-market fit and potential for continued market share gains.Oracle's strategic move to transition Cerner customers to its Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure and the upcoming delivery of the Ambulatory Clinic Cloud Application Suite highlight the company's commitment to innovation and expansion within the healthcare sector. The integration of AI-driven systems and voice interfaces could set a new standard for efficiency and accuracy in healthcare technology, potentially opening up new markets and driving customer acquisition. Technology Industry Analyst The emphasis on Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure indicates a strategic focus on artificial intelligence capabilities within their cloud offerings, which is a growing area of interest for many enterprises seeking to leverage AI for competitive advantage. The mention of hypergrowth in the Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure business suggests that Oracle is potentially outpacing competitors in a key market segment, which could have implications for its market position and influence on the technology sector.The introduction of the Clinical Digital Assistant and the Ambulatory Clinic Cloud Application Suite represents a significant advancement in Oracle's healthcare technology offerings. The integration of voice interfaces and automatic updates to Electronic Health Records (EHR) could be a game-changer in terms of efficiency and accuracy in the healthcare industry. These innovations may not only enhance Oracle's reputation as a technology leader but also contribute to long-term revenue growth as healthcare providers seek to modernize their systems. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Q3 GAAP Earnings per Share $0.85, Non-GAAP Earnings per Share up 16% to $1.41Q3 Total Revenue $13.3 billion, up 7% in both USD and constant currencyQ3 Total Remaining Performance Obligations up 29% to $80 billion Q3 Cloud Revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) $5.1 billion, up 25% in USD, up 24% in constant currencyQ3 Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS) Revenue $1.8 billion, up 49% in both USD and constant currency Q3 Cloud Application (SaaS) Revenue $3.3 billion, up 14% in both USD and constant currencyQ3 Fusion Cloud ERP (SaaS) Revenue $0.8 billion, up 18% in both USD and constant currencyQ3 NetSuite Cloud ERP (SaaS) Revenue $0.8 billion, up 21% in USD, up 20% in constant currencyAUSTIN, Texas, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2024 Q3 results.

The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in each of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to stock-based compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related to an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure. * Not meaningful ORACLE CORPORATION Q3 FISCAL 2024 YEAR TO DATE FINANCIAL RESULTS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ($ in millions, except per share data) Nine Months Ended % Increase % Increase (Decrease) February 29, % of February 28, % of (Decrease) in Constant 2024 Revenues 2023 Revenues in US $ Currency (1) REVENUES Cloud services and license support $ 29,149 75 % $ 25,938 72 % 12 % 11 % Cloud license and on-premise license 3,243 8 % 3,627 10 % (11 %) (11 %) Hardware 2,224 6 % 2,424 7 % (8 %) (9 %) Services 4,058 11 % 4,129 11 % (2 %) (2 %) Total revenues 38,674 100 % 36,118 100 % 7 % 6 % OPERATING EXPENSES Cloud services and license support 6,905 18 % 5,606 16 % 23 % 22 % Hardware 649 2 % 780 2 % (17 %) (18 %) Services 3,665 9 % 3,448 10 % 6 % 6 % Sales and marketing 6,161 16 % 6,544 18 % (6 %) (7 %) Research and development 6,689 17 % 6,397 18 % 5 % 4 % General and administrative 1,146 3 % 1,179 3 % (3 %) (4 %) Amortization of intangible assets 2,267 6 % 2,712 7 % (16 %) (16 %) Acquisition related and other 214 0 % 140 0 % 53 % 52 % Restructuring 311 1 % 359 1 % (13 %) (14 %) Total operating expenses 28,007 72 % 27,165 75 % 3 % 3 % OPERATING INCOME 10,667 28 % 8,953 25 % 19 % 17 % Interest expense (2,636) (7 %) (2,550) (7 %) 3 % 3 % Non-operating expenses, net (72) 0 % (386) (2 %) (81 %) (82 %) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 7,959 21 % 6,017 16 % 32 % 29 % Provision for income taxes 636 2 % 833 2 % (24 %) (25 %) NET INCOME $ 7,323 19 % $ 5,184 14 % 41 % 38 % EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic $ 2.67 $ 1.93 Diluted $ 2.60 $ 1.88 WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING: Basic 2,741 2,692 Diluted 2,820 2,757 (1) We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure.

APPENDIX A ORACLE CORPORATIONQ3 FISCAL 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTSEXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects: Stock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.Acquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses may diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur certain of these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.

Positive NGM Bio making progress in patient enrollment for NGM707 Phase 1b trial, showing activity in MSS CRC patients. Encouraging findings in NGM707 Phase 1 Part 1b cohort with an overall response rate of 11% and disease control rate of 43%. NGM Bio initiating a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for NGM120 in hyperemesis gravidarum by the end of 2024. Positive Phase 2b results from ALPINE 4 trial for aldafermin in compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. FDA granted orphan drug designation to aldafermin for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. NGM Bio reported a net loss of $27.7 million for the fourth quarter and $142.4 million for the full year 2023. Related party revenue with Merck was $0.2 million for the quarter and $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Research and development expenses decreased compared to the same periods in 2022. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $144.2 million as of December 31, 2023. NGM Bio entered into a merger agreement with Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. with the Offer expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. reveal a net loss reduction from $162.7 million in 2022 to $142.4 million in 2023, which indicates a potential improvement in the company's cost management and efficiency. The substantial decrease in research and development expenses from $181.1 million to $118.0 million could reflect a strategic allocation of resources towards the most promising trials or a scaling back of less critical projects. However, the significant drop in related party revenue from $55.3 million to $4.4 million, due to the impending end of the collaboration with Merck, raises concerns about the company's future revenue streams and its ability to sustain current levels of R&D without a similar partnership.Moreover, the announced merger with Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. is a critical event that could have various implications. The acquisition price of $1.55 per share will need to be scrutinized against the company's book value, pipeline potential and the premium paid per share to assess the fairness for shareholders. If the merger is completed, the delisting from the Nasdaq could decrease the liquidity and visibility of the company's stock, affecting current investors. However, going private might provide NGM Bio with strategic flexibility to focus on long-term goals without the pressures of quarterly reporting. Medical Research Analyst NGM Biopharmaceuticals' ongoing trials, particularly the combination of NGM707 with pembrolizumab for MSS colorectal cancer, are noteworthy given the typically low response rate of MSS CRC to immuno-checkpoint therapies. The observed partial and complete responses in the Phase 1b trial could signal a significant advancement in treatment options for this patient subset. The industry should closely monitor the mid-2024 update for comprehensive data that could validate these preliminary findings.The potential initiation of a registrational trial using surrogate endpoints for aldafermin in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) also represents a pivotal step. The orphan drug designation by the FDA could expedite the development process and, if successful, aldafermin might address a significant unmet medical need in PSC, a disease with no current FDA-approved treatments. Market Research Analyst NGM Bio's strategic focus on licensing and business development partnerships is a crucial factor for its growth trajectory, especially given the nearing end of its collaboration with Merck. The biotechnology sector often relies on such partnerships for capital infusion and risk-sharing in drug development. The anticipated completion of patient enrollment for NGM707 in 2024 and the initiation of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for NGM120 in hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) by the end of 2024 could serve as potential catalysts for attracting new partnerships or investment.NGM Bio's progress in solid tumor oncology and the rare disease space with aldafermin in PSC could position the company favorably in niche markets with high barriers to entry. The unique positioning, if trials yield positive results, could lead to significant market opportunities and justify the allocation of resources to these programs, as highlighted by the CEO. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM --Enrollment ongoing for patients with microsatellite stability (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) in Phase1/2 trial of NGM707, a dual ILT2/ILT4 antagonist antibody product candidate, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) with expected completion of enrollment in the second quarter of 2024-- --Announced ongoing toxicology activities intended to support initiation of a potential proof-of-concept study of NGM120, a GDF15/GFRAL antagonist, for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) by the end of 2024-- --Ongoing discussions with regulators on the design of a potential registrational trial of aldafermin, an engineered FGF19 analog, for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a rare liver disease, using surrogate endpoints-- --Reported $144.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023-- --On February 26, 2024, announced that it had entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Atlas Neon Parent, Inc., and Atlas Neon Merger Sub, Inc.-- SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGM Bio) (Nasdaq: NGM), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today provided recent business highlights and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “In 2023, we made significant progress in patient enrollment in trials of our solid tumor drug candidates. Most notably, we are encouraged by the signals of activity observed in our NGM707 Phase 1b trial, particularly among MSS CRC patients whose lesions are typically unresponsive to immuno-checkpoint therapies. We also made progress in our discussions with the FDA regarding the design of a potential registrational Phase 2 study of aldafermin in PSC using a primary endpoint composed of surrogate biomarkers of PSC progression and obtained orphan drug designation from the agency for aldafermin for the treatment of PSC,” said David J. Woodhouse, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at NGM Bio. “In 2024, we are focused on completing patient enrollment for NGM707 with a potential interim Phase 1b trial readout in the middle of the year, initiating a potential Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of NGM120 in HG by the end of 2024, and, provided we have the financial resources and agreement on trial design, initiating a registrational Phase 2 trial of aldafermin in PSC patients. Our priority remains to seek licensing and other business development partners across all our wholly-owned product candidates and to allocate our resources to the programs that we believe have the greatest potential both in the near- and long-term.” Key Fourth Quarter and Recent Highlights Solid Tumor Oncology Disclosed in January 2024 encouraging findings in a Phase 1 Part 1b cohort of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial evaluating NGM707 in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including MSS CRC patients. 46 patients were enrolled as of the November 6, 2023 data-cutoff and, of the 37 response-evaluable patients (those completing at least one on-treatment scan), there were four confirmed partial responses across multiple indications, including one pathological complete response, and 12 patients with stable disease (11% overall response rate and 43% disease control rate). The combination of NGM707 and pembrolizumab was generally well-tolerated at all four doses (200, 600, 1200, 1800 mg) of NGM707. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. NGM Bio expects to complete enrollment in the Phase 1 Part 1b cohort in the second quarter of 2024 and anticipates providing an update in mid-2024 on the fully enrolled cohort and subsequent next steps, including, provided sufficient financial resources, the potential for additional cohorts, which NGM Bio expects will include MSS CRC patients.Completed enrollment in the Phase 1 Part 1b cohorts of the Phase 1/1b trials evaluating NGM831, an ILT3 antagonist antibody product candidate, and NGM438, a LAIR1 antagonist antibody product candidate, in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. NGM831 and NGM438, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, have been generally well-tolerated and there have been no dose limiting toxicities noted to date.Initiated an ongoing Phase 1, Part 1c dose finding cohort evaluating the triplet combination of NGM831, NGM438 and pembrolizumab. This cohort is anticipated to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024. Hyperemesis Gravidarum Announced in January 2024 potential development of NGM120 for the treatment of HG. NGM120, a GFRAL antagonist antibody, is designed to block GDF15 signaling, the central cause of HG and, thereby, may potentially have therapeutic benefit for treating pregnant women suffering from HG. HG is a rare, serious condition that affects approximately 100,000 – 150,000 women in the United States each year during pregnancy and is characterized by intractable nausea and vomiting, which then results in dehydration, weight loss and malnutrition. HG has a significant physical and psychosocial impact on patients and leads to overall higher rates of fetal loss, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight and fetal malnutrition. HG is the second leading cause of hospitalization in pregnancy (second to preterm labor) and typically recurs in subsequent pregnancies. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for this condition. Research1 has shown that GDF15 levels increase steadily in early pregnancy and, on average, are higher in women who experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and HG. The research also indicated that women with GDF15 genetic variants associated with lower levels of GDF15 in a non-pregnant state are predisposed to HG.NGM Bio’s goal is to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of NGM120 for the treatment of HG by the end of 2024. NGM Bio is in the process of producing a toxicology package to submit to regulatory authorities in Australia or the United Kingdom that we hope will support initiation of the trial. Aldafermin Presented positive Phase 2b results from the ALPINE 4 trial of aldafermin in compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH at AASLD The Liver Meeting in November 2023.In January 2024, announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug designation to aldafermin, an engineered FGF19 analog, for the treatment of PSC.NGM Bio plans to further develop aldafermin for the treatment of PSC, a rare liver disease that irreparably damages the bile ducts, leading to bile acid dysregulation, which, ultimately, results in serious liver damage. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for PSC. NGM Bio is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the design of a potential registrational trial of aldafermin in PSC, including on the proposed utilization of a primary endpoint composed of surrogate biomarkers with the goal of obtaining accelerated approval from the FDA. NGM Bio plans to continue working towards the goal of initiating a potential registrational trial contingent upon further discussion with the FDA on trial design and obtaining the additional capital necessary to conduct the study. Corporate On February 26, 2024, NGM Bio announced that it had entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Atlas Neon Parent, Inc. (Parent) and Atlas Neon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub). The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the acquisition of NGM Bio by Parent through a cash tender offer (the Offer) by Merger Sub for each issued and outstanding share of NGM Bio’s common stock (other than certain rollover shares) for $1.55 per share (the Offer Price), and (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with and into NGM Bio (the Merger), with NGM Bio surviving the Merger as a privately held company. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Offer Price will be paid subject to any applicable tax withholding and without interest. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on March 8, 2024, Parent commenced the Offer. Additional details can be found in NGM Bio’s recent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).NGM Bio anticipates that the Offer and the Merger contemplated under the Merger Agreement will be consummated in the second quarter of 2024. However, closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that the Offer and the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be completed. If the Merger is effected, NGM Bio’s common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and NGM Bio will be privately held. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results NGM Bio reported a net loss of $27.7 million and $142.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to a net loss of $36.4 million and $162.7 million for the same periods in 2022.Related party revenue from the collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, or Merck, was $0.2 million and $4.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $18.2 million and $55.3 million for the same periods in 2022.

The hybrid in-person and virtual conference is being held March 12-15 in San Diego. “Despite advancements in kidney replacement therapy, mortality rates in children with acute kidney injury (AKI) and multi-organ failure requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) remain at about 50%, and children who survive an AKI episode are at elevated risk of chronic kidney disease. Without doubt, new therapies such as the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) Pediatric (SCD-PED) are needed,” said symposium moderator Stuart Goldstein, MD, FAAP, FNKF, Director of the Center for Acute Care Nephrology and Medical Director of Pheresis Service, Co-Director of the Heart Institute Research Core at Cincinnati Children’s Medical Hospital and Professor at the University of Cincinnati’s Department of Pediatrics. “It’s exciting to have recognized leaders in AKI and nephrology who serve on the SeaStar Medical Scientific Advisory Board participate in this symposium. The discussion will highlight our technology, clinical data and the recent FDA approval of the SCD-PED, the first therapeutic device in our Quelimmune product family,” said Kevin Chung, MD, SeaStar Medical’s Chief Medical Officer.

About Hyperinflammation and the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD)Hyperinflammation is the overproduction or overactivity of inflammatory cells that can lead to damage of vital organs. It occurs when the body overproduces inflammatory effector cells and other molecules that can be toxic, damaging to vital organs and result in multi-organ failure and even death. This is known as the cytokine storm. The SCD is a patented cell-directed extracorporeal device that employs immunomodulating technology to selectively target proinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes during CKRT and reduces the hyperinflammatory milieu including the cytokine storm that causes inflammation, organ failure and possible death in critically ill patients. Unlike pathogen removal and other blood-purification tools, the device is integrated with CKRT hemofiltration systems to selectively target and transition proinflammatory monocytes to a reparative state and promote activated neutrophils to be less inflammatory. The SCD selectively targets the most highly activated proinflammatory neutrophils and monocytes. These cells are then returned back into the body through the blood, and the body is signaled to lower its inflammatory environment and focus on repair. This unique immunomodulation approach may promote long-term organ recovery and eliminate the need for future KRT, including dialysis. About SeaStar MedicalSeaStar Medical is a medical technology company that is redefining how extracorporeal therapies may reduce the consequences of excessive inflammation on vital organs. SeaStar Medical’s novel technologies rely on science and innovation to provide life-saving solutions to critically ill patients. The Company is developing and commercializing cell-directed extracorporeal therapies that target the effector cells that drive systemic inflammation, causing direct tissue damage and secreting a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines that initiate and propagate imbalanced immune responses.

The total AUM breakdown shows growth in all segments, with Equity, Fixed Income, and Alternatives/Multi-Asset Solutions contributing to the increase. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) for AllianceBernstein reflects positive momentum in the company's financial position. A 3% month-over-month growth indicates robust inflows and market performance, which is particularly significant in the context of recent market volatility. Retail channels leading the growth suggest a strong retail investor confidence in AB's offerings. The diversification of AUM across equity (both active and passive), fixed income and alternatives demonstrates a comprehensive investment strategy that appeals to a wide range of investors.From a financial perspective, the uptick in AUM is likely to result in higher management fees, which are a primary revenue source for investment firms. This could potentially translate into improved earnings in future quarters, subject to management's ability to maintain the AUM growth and control costs. Investors should monitor subsequent earnings reports to assess how this AUM growth affects the bottom line. Market Research Analyst The distribution of AUM across different asset classes offers insights into current market trends and investor sentiment. The increase in both active and passive equity strategies suggests a balanced demand for different investment approaches. The growth in fixed income, particularly taxable bonds, may indicate a defensive posture by investors seeking shelter in a low-interest-rate environment or anticipating market corrections. Alternatives and multi-asset solutions gaining traction could be a sign of investors looking for non-correlated returns to diversify risk.Understanding these trends is crucial for competitors and investors alike, as they provide a window into the strategic positioning of investment products. For peers in the industry, AB's successful strategies could serve as a benchmark for product offerings and marketing efforts. Investors might see AB's performance as indicative of the investment firm's ability to navigate the current economic climate effectively. Economist The reported AUM growth aligns with broader economic indicators of market recovery or expansion. Positive net flows across all channels could suggest an overall increase in investor confidence and disposable income, hinting at a healthy economic outlook. However, it is essential to contextualize these figures within the larger economic environment, including inflation rates, interest rate policies and geopolitical concerns which can all influence market dynamics and investor behavior.A detailed analysis of the sources of market appreciation would offer further insights into the sustainability of this growth. For instance, if market appreciation is heavily concentrated in certain sectors or asset classes, it may raise concerns about potential overvaluations or systemic risks. Conversely, broad-based market appreciation would be a more favorable indicator of stable economic growth. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AllianceBernstein L.P.

Outlook for the second quarter includes flat avocado volumes, higher pricing, and a decline in blueberry sales pricing. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in total revenue by 21% to $258.7 million, driven by a 23% rise in average per-unit avocado selling prices, signifies a strong demand for avocados despite flat volume growth. This suggests a favorable market pricing environment for avocados, potentially due to supply constraints or increased consumer demand. The company's ability to maintain volume while increasing prices reflects a robust pricing strategy and brand strength in the market. However, the reliance on pricing rather than volume growth could imply limitations in market expansion or potential supply challenges.The significant improvement in the gross profit percentage, which rose 690 basis points to 11.1% of revenue, indicates effective cost management and margin enhancement strategies. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA from $2.3 million to $19.2 million year-over-year is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates the company's operational efficiency and potential for increased profitability. This could be an attractive point for investors, as it suggests a strong underlying business capable of leveraging market conditions to improve its financial standing. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transition from a net loss of $(8.8) million to a breakeven net income represents a significant turnaround for the company. The adjusted net income of $6.7 million, compared to the previous year's adjusted net loss of $(5.0) million, highlights the effectiveness of the company's strategic initiatives and cost-saving measures. The focus on enhancing profitability is expected to lead to increased free cash flow generation, which is critical for sustaining growth and providing returns to shareholders.It is important to note that while the company's selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 8%, this was offset by a reduction in general corporate expenses and correlated with performance-based incentives, suggesting that the company is investing in its workforce to drive performance. This could indicate a sustainable approach to growth, balancing cost management with investment in human capital. Agricultural Economist The report highlights the impact of regional weather conditions on the supply of blueberries from Peru, which led to a 90% increase in average per-unit sales price despite a 43% decrease in volume sold. This underscores the sensitivity of agricultural commodities to environmental factors and the importance of geographical diversification in farming operations. The company's performance in the Blueberries segment, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $9.2 million to $8.7 million, reflects the ability to capitalize on favorable pricing conditions, but it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of such windfalls in the face of unpredictable weather patterns.Moreover, the company's outlook for avocado pricing to be 10-15% higher than the previous year and the extended Peruvian blueberry season due to harvest timing shifts provide a glimpse into the expected market trends. These insights could be critical for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, as they indicate potential market dynamics and pricing trends for the upcoming quarters. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Company achieves record first quarter results with improved performance across all segmentsOXNARD, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mission Produce, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVO) (“Mission” or the “Company”), a world leader in sourcing, producing, and distributing fresh Hass avocados with additional offerings in mangos and blueberries, today reported its financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2024. Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Financial Overview: Total revenue increased 21% to $258.7 million compared to the same period last year driven primarily by a 23% increase in average per-unit avocado selling prices on flat avocado volumesNet income/(loss) was breakeven, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $(8.8) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, for the same period last yearAdjusted net income of $6.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $(5.0) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, for the same period last yearAdjusted EBITDA of $19.2 million, compared to $2.3 million in the same period last year CEO Message Steve Barnard, CEO of Mission, commented, “We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2024 with the delivery of a first quarter that demonstrated solid execution across all facets of our business. The team’s focus resulted in significantly improved per-unit margins, which translated to nearly 700 basis points of gross margin expansion and resulted in a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA performance year-over-year. Our margin improvement was spurred by strength in avocado margins in our Marketing & Distribution segment, as well as the achievement of record quarterly revenues in our Blueberries segment due to advantageous pricing conditions, which contributed meaningfully to our overall adjusted EBITDA generation. In our International Farming segment, our team has been focused on implementing cost savings measures across our farming and packing operations. We expect to see the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of our fiscal year when we harvest and sell our owned avocado production from Peru. Our improved overall performance is a direct result of the actions we are taking to optimize our business and enhance profitability, and it is expected to result in a meaningful step-up in free cash flow generation in 2024.” Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Review Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $45.2 million or 21% compared to the same period last year driven primarily by higher average per-unit avocado sales prices. Though less significant, we also experienced growth in mango and blueberry revenues resulting from higher average sales prices that were driven by industry supply constraints during the period. Gross profit increased $19.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the same period last year, to $28.7 million and gross profit percentage increased 690 basis points, to 11.1% of revenue. The increases were driven by improved per-unit margins across the Marketing & Distribution and Blueberries segments, the latter of which benefited significantly from higher per-unit sales pricing. Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) for the first quarter increased $1.6 million or 8% compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher employee related costs, including performance-based incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense. These costs were partially offset by a reduction of approximately $1.0 million in general corporate expenses. Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was breakeven, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(8.8) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, for the same period last year. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $(5.0) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $16.9 million as compared to $2.3 million in the prior year period, driven by stronger gross profit performance from the Marketing & Distribution and Blueberries segments. Fiscal First Quarter Business Segment Performance Marketing & Distribution Net sales in the Marketing & Distribution segment increased 24% to $224.6 million for the quarter, due to a 23% increase in average per-unit avocado sales prices; volume was flat year-over-year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $6.4 million to $11.0 million, primarily due to the impact of higher per-unit gross margins. International Farming The vast majority of fruit sales from the International Farming segment are made to the Marketing and Distribution segment, with the remainder of revenue largely derived from services provided to third parties and the Blueberries segment. Affiliated sales are concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian avocado harvest season, which typically runs from April through September of each year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the International Farming segment is generally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the timing of sales. In addition, the Company operates approximately 700 acres of mangos in Peru that are largely in an early stage of production. The timing of the mango harvest is generally concentrated in the fiscal second quarter. However, in the current fiscal year, the harvest has largely concluded in the fiscal first quarter. Total segment sales in the International Farming segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were approximately flat with the prior year period at $5.8 million. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $1.3 million or 72% to $(0.5) million, primarily driven by cost savings measures within the Company’s Peruvian operations. Blueberries Sales in the Blueberries segment have been concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season, which typically runs from July through February. Net sales in the Blueberries segment increased 9% to $32.5 million, primarily due to a 90% increase in average per-unit sales price, substantially offset by a 43% decrease in volume sold, both of which were driven by significant reductions in industry blueberry supply from Peru during the 2023/2024 harvest season resulting from regional weather conditions. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $9.2 million to $8.7 million, primarily due to gross margin improvement driven by elevated sales pricing. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Cash and cash equivalents were $39.9 million as of January 31, 2024, compared to $42.9 million as of October 31, 2023. The Company’s operating cash flows are seasonal in nature and can be temporarily influenced by working capital shifts resulting from varying payment terms to growers in different source regions. In addition, the Company is building its growing crops inventory in its International Farming segment during the first half of the year for ultimate harvest and sale that will occur during the second half of the fiscal year. While these increases in working capital can cause operating cash flows to be unfavorable in individual quarters, it is not indicative of operating cash performance that management expects to realize for the full year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.3 million in the prior year period, driven by improved operating performance partially offset by working capital growth. Within working capital, unfavorable changes in inventory and accounts receivable were partially offset by favorable changes in grower payables. Changes in inventory were driven by higher per-unit cost of Mexican fruit on-hand and higher blueberry growing crop inventory in Peru due to extension of the harvest season compared to prior year. Changes in accounts receivable and grower payables were correlated with the higher avocado pricing/cost factors previously discussed. Capital expenditures were $9.9 million for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, compared to $17.6 million last year. Capital expenditures were balanced across each of the operating segments and were comprised of avocado orchard development and pre-production orchard maintenance and land improvements in Peru and Guatemala, early-stage blueberry plant cultivation and construction costs associated with the UK distribution facility. Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company is providing the following industry outlooks that will drive performance: The industry is expecting avocado volumes to be relatively flat in the fiscal 2024 second quarter versus the prior year period. Industry volumes from Mexico are expected to taper off in the latter part of the quarter as the season nears completion. California harvest volumes should begin to build toward the middle of the quarter, followed by small amounts of Peruvian volume later in the fiscal second quarter. Avocado pricing is expected to be slightly higher on a sequential basis and be approximately 10-15% higher than the $1.30 per pound average experienced in second quarter of fiscal 2023.Harvest timing shifts relative to last year have extended the Company’s Peruvian blueberry season this year. As a result, approximately 20% of the harvest will be sold through in the fiscal second quarter, whereas the season was substantially complete in the prior year period. Sales pricing is expected to decline sequentially in the fiscal second quarter in response to increased industry volume resulting from the expectation for other source regions to begin seasonal harvests on a normal cadence.

The drug is an allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor in Phase 1 clinical development, with promising interim data expected in the second half of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA for TERN-701 marks a significant milestone for Terns Pharmaceuticals in the development of treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This designation is indicative of the therapy's potential to fill an unmet medical need. The implications of ODD are multifaceted, offering not just regulatory support and guidance but also financial incentives such as tax credits and fee waivers which can substantially reduce the cost burden of the drug development process. Furthermore, the seven-year marketing exclusivity post-approval is a critical competitive advantage, potentially increasing the commercial viability of TERN-701 should it reach market approval.From a research perspective, the allosteric mechanism of TERN-701 is noteworthy. Allosteric TKIs target the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in a different manner compared to active-site TKIs, potentially offering improved efficacy and safety profiles. This could signal a shift in the standard of care for CML, pending the outcomes of clinical trials. As such, the industry is closely monitoring the progression of TERN-701 through its clinical phases, with interim data from Phase 1 trials being a key inflection point for the company's valuation and future investment considerations. Financial Analyst Receiving Orphan Drug Designation is a strong positive signal to investors, often leading to an uptick in a company's stock performance due to the perceived reduction of regulatory risk and the financial benefits associated with the designation. For Terns Pharmaceuticals, this could translate into increased investor confidence and liquidity, potentially improving stock valuation in the short term. The long-term financial impact hinges on successful clinical trial outcomes and eventual market approval. However, it is important to note that the biopharmaceutical sector is highly volatile, with significant investment risks, as clinical trial results can be unpredictable and regulatory hurdles can arise.Investors will be particularly attentive to the interim data release from the Phase 1 trial of TERN-701. Positive results could lead to a further increase in stock value, while any setbacks may have a negative impact. It is also crucial to evaluate Terns' overall pipeline diversification and financial health, as reliance on a single investigational drug for future revenue growth can be risky. The ODD could also make Terns a more attractive partner or acquisition target, potentially leading to strategic corporate developments. Oncology Doctor Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow and the development of new treatments is crucial for improving patient outcomes. TERN-701's allosteric inhibition mechanism represents a novel approach in the treatment landscape of CML. Allosteric inhibitors, unlike active-site inhibitors, bind to a site on the enzyme other than the active site, which can result in fewer off-target effects and improved selectivity. This could potentially offer a better safety profile and reduce adverse effects for patients, which is a significant consideration in chronic conditions requiring long-term treatment.As an oncologist, the FDA's recognition of TERN-701 through the Orphan Drug Designation is encouraging as it suggests a recognition of the therapeutic's potential and a commitment to expedite its development. The clinical community will be looking forward to the interim data from the Phase 1 trials to gauge the drug's efficacy and safety. Such data will be crucial for determining the future treatment protocols and the potential impact on patient care in CML. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM FOSTER CITY, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The company plans to use data from this study to support a potential BLA submission for accelerated approval by H2 2025, with initial data expected in Q4 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Larimar Therapeutics' initiation of an open label extension (OLE) study for nomlabofusp is a critical step in the drug development process, particularly for a rare disease like Friedreich’s ataxia (FA). The emphasis on long-term safety and tissue frataxin levels is significant, as it addresses the fundamental deficit in FA patients, who have reduced levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. A comprehensive understanding of the drug's pharmacokinetics and its impact on pharmacodynamic markers, such as lipid profiles and gene expression, is crucial for assessing its efficacy and safety profile over an extended period.From a research perspective, the use of a synthetic control arm is innovative and may offer a more robust comparison for evaluating the drug's effectiveness in the absence of a large patient population, which is often the case with rare diseases. The potential use of frataxin as a novel surrogate endpoint could streamline the regulatory approval process, provided it is validated as a reliable indicator of clinical benefit. The anticipation of initial data in Q4 2024 will be a pivotal moment for stakeholders, as it will offer the first glimpse into the drug's long-term impact and could influence Larimar's stock performance and strategic planning. Biotech Financial Analyst The strategic move by Larimar to target accelerated approval with a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for nomlabofusp in H2 2025 is noteworthy for investors. Accelerated approval pathways can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a drug to market, which is particularly valuable for biotech firms that operate with limited resources and under the pressure of financial sustainability. The successful transition from Phase 2 to the OLE study suggests confidence in nomlabofusp's potential, which could have positive implications for investor sentiment and Larimar's market valuation.Investors should consider the risks associated with the FDA's partial clinical hold and the need for dose escalation data, as regulatory hurdles can impact development timelines and financial forecasts. The focus on a rare disease market, while often less competitive, requires careful consideration of market size and potential return on investment. The stock market reaction to the initial OLE study data release in Q4 2024 will likely hinge on the balance between safety outcomes and efficacy signals demonstrated by nomlabofusp. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of a new treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia, a rare and debilitating disease, extend beyond immediate stock market considerations. The introduction of nomlabofusp could shift the treatment paradigm and potentially reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with managing FA symptoms and complications. The value of such a treatment is amplified in the rare disease space, where patients often have limited options.Should nomlabofusp prove to be safe and effective, it could create a precedent for using surrogate endpoints like tissue frataxin levels in regulatory approvals for other rare diseases. This could have a broader economic impact by encouraging innovation and investment in treatments for rare diseases, which are often overlooked due to perceived lower profitability. However, the pricing strategy for nomlabofusp will be a critical factor in its economic viability and accessibility, given the challenges of balancing drug development costs with the affordability for patients and payers in a rare disease market. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Study will inform on long-term safety profile and tissue frataxin levels OLE initiated with 25 mg daily subcutaneous injections of nomlabofusp Frataxin data and safety data from the OLE study are intended to help support a potential Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submission for accelerated approval targeted for H2 2025Initial data expected in Q4 2024 BALA CYNWYD, Pa., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. (“Larimar”) (Nasdaq: LRMR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for complex rare diseases, today announced dosing of the first patient in an open label extension (OLE) study evaluating 25 mg daily subcutaneous injections of nomlabofusp in participants with Friedreich’s ataxia (FA). Nomlabofusp (CTI-1601) is a novel protein replacement therapy designed to address the root cause of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) by delivering frataxin to mitochondria. “We are pleased to dose the first patient in our OLE study, further advancing the nomlabofusp clinical program and building on the successful completion of our Phase 2 dose escalation study. Importantly, the OLE study will inform on the long-term safety profile and tissue frataxin levels and provide a first look at real-life experience with self-administration by patients or administration by a caregiver. Participants who completed treatment in the recent Phase 2 dose exploration trial, or who previously completed a prior Phase 1 clinical trial of nomlabofusp are potentially eligible to screen for the OLE. Based on our Phase 1 and Phase 2 findings, we expect to continue daily dosing throughout the study,” said Carole Ben-Maimon, MD, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Larimar. “In February we announced that we intend to pursue frataxin as a potential novel surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval. The frataxin data, supportive pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes information and safety data from the OLE study, along with additional nonclinical pharmacology information will be used to help support a potential BLA submission for accelerated approval targeted for the second half of 2025. We look forward to reporting initial data from the OLE study in the fourth quarter of 2024.” Larimar’s Phase 2 OLE study will initially evaluate daily subcutaneous injections of 25 mg of nomlabofusp self-administered or administered by a caregiver. Key study objectives of the OLE study include safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and tissue frataxin levels in peripheral tissues as well as other exploratory pharmacodynamic markers (lipid profiles and gene expression data) following long-term subcutaneous administration of nomlabofusp. Clinical measures collected during the trial will be compared to data from a synthetic control arm derived from participants in the Friedreich’s Ataxia Clinical Outcome Measures Study (FACOMS) database. To escalate the dose in the OLE study, data from the 50 mg cohort of the Phase 2 dose exploration study, as well as available data from the 25 mg dose in the OLE study, will be submitted for FDA review due to the continued partial clinical hold. Initial data from the OLE study is expected in Q4 2024.

Pimavanserin did not show a significant improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint. The safety profile was consistent with previous trials. Positive None. Negative The Phase 3 ADVANCE-2 trial of pimavanserin did not meet its primary endpoint, showing no statistically significant improvement over placebo on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score. Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. does not plan to conduct further clinical trials with pimavanserin following the disappointing results of the ADVANCE-2 trial. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Acadia Pharmaceuticals concerning the Phase 3 ADVANCE-2 trial holds significant weight in the context of drug development for schizophrenia. The trial's inability to meet the primary endpoint—namely, a statistically significant improvement on the NSA-16 total score—suggests that pimavanserin may not be a viable treatment option for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This outcome has implications for Acadia's R&D direction and could lead to a reassessment of their pipeline strategy.From a research perspective, the consistency of pimavanserin's safety profile is a silver lining, as it indicates that the drug is generally well-tolerated. However, the lack of efficacy overshadows this aspect. The placebo effect observed in the ADVANCE-2 trial, being higher than in the previous ADVANCE-1 trial, raises questions about the variability of response in clinical settings, which could be a point of interest for future research in the field.For stakeholders, the decision not to pursue further clinical trials with pimavanserin may affect Acadia's market value and investor confidence. The research community might also experience a setback, as the treatment landscape for schizophrenia, particularly the negative symptoms, remains an area with considerable unmet needs. Financial Analyst Acadia Pharmaceuticals' announcement regarding the Phase 3 ADVANCE-2 trial results is likely to have a tangible impact on the company's financial health. The failure to meet the primary endpoint often translates to a halt in the development process for a drug candidate, which can result in sunk costs and a potential write-down of R&D investments. Furthermore, the market's reaction to such news can be swift, with possible declines in stock price reflecting the diminished prospects of the drug becoming a revenue-generating product.Investors and analysts will closely scrutinize the company's next steps, including how it plans to allocate resources and whether it can pivot to other promising candidates in its pipeline. The financial implications extend beyond immediate stock performance; they could influence future fundraising efforts and partnerships, as well as the strategic direction of the company in the competitive landscape of schizophrenia treatments. Market Research Analyst The broader market for antipsychotic drugs is highly competitive and continuously evolving. Acadia Pharmaceuticals' recent setback with pimavanserin positions the company differently within this market. It is essential to understand that negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and apathy, are notoriously difficult to treat and any successful medication would address a significant gap in the market.Given this context, the trial results may influence not only Acadia's market share but also the investment landscape for similar drugs targeting negative symptoms. Competitors may either be discouraged by these results or see an opportunity to differentiate their products. The impact on Acadia's business strategy could extend to its collaborative dealings, as potential partners may be more cautious in engaging with a company facing a recent high-profile trial failure. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM - Study Did Not Meet Primary Endpoint SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced top-line results from the Phase 3 ADVANCE-2 trial evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Pimavanserin did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the study’s primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score (-11.8 vs. -11.1; p=0.4825; effect size=0.07). The safety and tolerability profile of pimavanserin was consistent with previous clinical trials, showing a low rate of adverse events. “We are disappointed the trial did not meet its primary endpoint given the significant unmet need in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia,” said Steve Davis, Acadia’s Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to analyze these data with our scientific advisors, but we do not intend to conduct any further clinical trials with pimavanserin. We want to thank the patients, their families, and the investigators for their contributions in this important study.” ADVANCE-2 was a 26-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 34 milligram pimavanserin in 454 adult patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia who had achieved control of positive symptoms with their ongoing antipsychotic treatment.​ ADVANCE-2 used the NSA-16 scale, designed to measure change on the wide range of predominant negative symptoms that patients experience, which looks at 16 different items in five subscales and covers symptoms such as blunted affect, poor socialization and lack of motivation.​ The change from baseline observed in the pimavanserin arm of ADVANCE-2 was similar to the change from baseline observed at the 34 milligram dose in ADVANCE-1 (-11.8 vs. -11.6); however, the placebo effect in ADVANCE-2 was higher than the placebo effect observed in ADVANCE-1 (-11.1 vs. -8.5). In ADVANCE-2, pimavanserin was well-tolerated with an adverse event rate of 30.4% compared with 40.3% for the placebo arm.

The company strengthened its cash position with $210 million from private placements, ensuring funding into late 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The initiation of Phase 1b clinical trials and the progression towards registrational studies for ORIC Pharmaceuticals' drug candidates, ORIC-944 and ORIC-114, represent significant milestones in the development of new cancer treatments. The reported data suggesting that these drugs may have 'best-in-class' potential is particularly noteworthy. 'Best-in-class' implies that a drug may outperform existing treatments in terms of efficacy, safety, or a combination of both. The focus on drugs that can penetrate the brain and target specific mutations, such as EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), addresses a critical need for therapies that can manage central nervous system metastases, which are a common and difficult-to-treat aspect of cancer progression.The financial results indicate that ORIC Pharmaceuticals is well-capitalized, with a strengthened cash position from recent financings. The extended cash runway into late 2026 suggests that the company has sufficient funds to continue its research and development activities without the immediate need for additional financing. This financial stability is crucial for investors, as it reduces the risk of dilution in the short to medium term and allows the company to focus on its clinical programs. Financial Analyst The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year indicates an aggressive investment in the development of ORIC's pipeline. This is a common strategy for biotech firms that are in the growth phase, aiming to bring new therapies to market. The increase in G&A expenses, although more modest, is also indicative of an expanding operational scale. The financial health of a biotech company is often gauged by its cash runway and in this case, the reported $351.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments post-financings provides a strong buffer for ORIC's operational plans.For stakeholders, the key takeaway would be the company's ability to fund its operations well into the future, which is often a critical uncertainty in the biotech industry. This financial stability can be an attractive point for potential investors and partners. However, the inherent risks of drug development, especially in the oncology space where the failure rates are high, must be weighed against the potential for high rewards if the drugs prove to be effective and safe in later-stage trials. Market Research Analyst The oncology drug development market is highly competitive, with numerous companies striving to introduce novel therapies. ORIC Pharmaceuticals' emphasis on therapeutic resistance mechanisms positions it within a niche but growing segment of cancer treatment research. The market potential for drugs like ORIC-944 and ORIC-114 is significant, particularly if they achieve 'best-in-class' status upon successful completion of clinical trials. The strategic decision to prioritize these programs indicates a focus on areas with a high unmet medical need, which could lead to expedited regulatory review and potential market exclusivity benefits.Moreover, the initiation of combination studies, such as the one planned for ORIC-944 with AR inhibitors, is aligned with current trends in oncology treatment, where combination therapies are becoming the standard of care to improve outcomes. The positive preclinical data and the planned initiation of dose expansion cohorts further reinforce the company's commitment to advancing its pipeline, which could positively influence market perception and investor confidence. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Presented initial Phase 1b data from three clinical programs that support potential best in class profiles, with ORIC-944 and ORIC-114 prioritized for further advancement towards registrational studies Initiation of combination study of ORIC-944 with AR inhibitor(s) in metastatic prostate cancer expected in first half of 2024 and program update expected in mid-2024 Initiation of multiple dose expansion cohorts for ORIC-114 in patients with mutated NSCLC expected in first half of 2024 and updated Phase 1b data expected in first half of 2025 Strengthened cash position with $210 million from two private placement financings; cash and investments expected to fund operating plan into late 2026 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The project is intended to substantially reduce CO2 emissions from the ethanol production process and provide direct value to the surrounding communities. Both Alto and Vault continue to engage with local stakeholders, landowners, and communities regarding the project. The Pekin campus produces approximately 250 million gallons of specialty alcohols and renewable fuel per year and generates over 600,000 metric tons of CO2 as a by-product of the corn fermentation process. Alto Ingredients intends for the project to enable the Pekin campus to continue to contribute employment and economic opportunities for the local communities while substantially reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. “Partnering with Vault on this CCS project will strengthen our Pekin facilities and enhance shareholder value while employing the latest technologies in the production of clean, low carbon intensity and environmentally friendly bioethanol, consistent with Alto’s ongoing commitment to further lower our carbon impact, protect our environment, and operate in a way that serves both our shareholders and the communities in which we operate,” said Bryon McGregor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alto Ingredients, Inc. “Nearing a key milestone in developing this CCS project, Vault looks forward to working with Alto and continuing to work with communities and landowners in the Pekin area to develop a safe and high-quality project. This project with Alto exemplifies our view that one of the best options for CCS is often a local solution,” said Scott Rennie, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vault 44.01.

(ALTO) reported significant financial improvements in 2023, with a gross profit of $15.7 million, a net loss improvement of $13.6 million, and an Adjusted EBITDA increase of $26.5 million over 2022. The company signed a Letter of Intent for CO2 storage with Vault 44.01, focusing on reducing emissions and enhancing sustainability. Alto's strategic investments and focus on diversification position it for strong performance in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Alto Ingredients, Inc. show a substantial turnaround from the previous year, with a shift from a gross loss to a gross profit and a significant improvement in net loss and Adjusted EBITDA. These metrics are critical indicators of the company's operational efficiency and profitability. The improvement in gross profit by $43.2 million suggests that the company has successfully enhanced its revenue streams or cost structure, or possibly both. Moreover, the $26.5 million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash expenses and one-time items, indicates a healthier operational cash flow.Investors should note the potential for improved crush margins, which refer to the profit margin achieved from converting raw materials into finished products, in this case, ethanol. Positive spreads are indicative of the company's ability to sell its product at a higher price than the cost of raw materials and production, a key driver for profitability in the renewable fuels sector. Alto's focus on diversifying revenue and improving capacity utilization is likely a response to the volatile nature of commodity-based industries and suggests a strategic shift towards more stable and predictable income streams. Environmental Policy Expert Alto Ingredients' commitment to a carbon capture and storage (CCS) program is a significant development, aligning with global trends towards sustainability and reduced carbon emissions. The partnership with Vault 44.01 for CO2 storage reflects a proactive approach to environmental responsibility and may provide Alto with a competitive advantage in an industry increasingly influenced by environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. The close proximity of the geologic reservoir to the company's Pekin campus could result in logistical efficiencies and cost savings.Furthermore, the CCS initiative could open up new revenue streams through government incentives for carbon reduction, such as tax credits under the 45Q program in the United States. This could also lead to long-term energy cost reductions and an improved public image, potentially increasing shareholder value. However, investors should be aware of the risks and uncertainties associated with the implementation of new technologies and the capital investment required for CCS programs. Market Research Analyst The renewable fuel industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and Alto Ingredients' efforts to increase reliability and production run rates in preparation for the summer months demonstrate an understanding of market dynamics. The summer driving season typically sees increased demand for fuel, including ethanol. By optimizing operations ahead of this period, Alto positions itself to take advantage of this cyclical demand.Investors should consider the company's agility and financial prudence, as mentioned by the CEO, which are important traits in adapting to market changes. The ability to pivot and capitalize on profitable opportunities is crucial in the fast-evolving renewable energy sector. The focus on community outreach and financing for the CCS initiative also suggests that Alto is actively managing stakeholder relationships, which can be pivotal in ensuring the smooth implementation of new projects and maintaining a positive corporate reputation. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM - Delivered 2023 Gross Profit of $15.7 Million, Versus Gross Loss of $27.6 Million in 2022 - - Improved 2023 Net Loss by $13.6 Million and Adjusted EBITDA by $26.5 Million over 2022 - - Signed Letter of Intent with Vault 44.01 for CO2 Storage - PEKIN, Ill., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alto Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALTO), a producer and distributor of renewable fuel and essential ingredients and the largest producer of specialty alcohols in the U.S., reported its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, gross loss improved $18.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA improved $19.0 million over the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, gross profit improved $43.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA improved $26.5 million over 2022. “During 2023, our investments to diversify revenue, improve capacity utilization rates, reduce costs and expand operating margins contributed to our financial improvements and positioned Alto for stronger performance in 2024 and beyond,” said Bryon McGregor, President and CEO of Alto Ingredients. “Currently, the overall outlook for 2024 is favorable, which should lead to crush margin improvements over the next few months and produce positive spreads through most of the year. We are conducting ongoing maintenance across our asset portfolio to increase reliability and production run rates that we expect will position Alto well heading into the more robust summer months.” Alto is implementing a carbon capture and storage (CCS) program. In a separate release issued today, Alto announced it signed a letter of intent with Vault 44.01 to partner for safe and permanent CO2 storage deep underground in a secure geologic reservoir located in close proximity to the company's Pekin campus, thereby substantially reducing CO2 emissions from the ethanol production process and providing direct value to the surrounding area. “Additionally, we have prioritized our CCS initiative and are encouraged by recent progress on many aspects, including overall system design, community outreach, financing, EPA application preparation, and vendor negotiations. Further, we are evaluating new options that would enable us to substantially reduce the capital required to pursue CCS, lower our carbon footprint, and reduce our long-term energy costs. Although markets are dynamic, we remain agile and financially prudent and seek to capitalize on the most promising and profitable opportunities. We are enthusiastic about our prospects and confident in our long-term growth strategy,"" concluded McGregor.

Use of Non-GAAP MeasuresManagement believes that certain financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") are useful measures of operations. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as unaudited consolidated net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, asset impairments, loss on extinguishment of debt, unrealized derivative gains (losses), acquisition-related expense and depreciation and amortization expense. A table is provided at the end of this release that provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss). Management provides this non-GAAP measure so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses, which may assist investors in properly assessing the company's performance on a period-over-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of performance under GAAP, or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.

Operating loss increased to $60.4 million compared to $48.1 million in the prior year. Net loss of $65.0 million, including a $43.1 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2.8 million from $3.5 million in the prior year. Financial Analyst The Beachbody Company's recent financial results highlight a significant reduction in total revenue year-over-year, from $692.2 million to $527.1 million, which reflects a 23.9% decrease. This contraction is evident across all revenue streams: digital, nutrition and connected fitness. Despite this, the company has managed to reduce its net loss by 21.4% compared to the previous year, which could be interpreted as a positive sign of cost management and operational efficiency improvements.However, the reported impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, totaling $43.1 million, raises concerns about the company's valuation of its acquisitions and investments. Impairments often indicate that the assets in question are not generating the expected returns, which could impact investor confidence. Additionally, the company's focus on achieving positive free cash flow in the first quarter of 2024 suggests a strategic shift towards liquidity and financial stability, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Beachbody's decline in digital and nutritional subscriptions by 33% and 25% respectively, alongside a 29.4% drop in 'Nutrition and Other' revenue, signals a potential shift in consumer behavior or increased competition in the health and wellness space. The connected fitness sector also experienced a significant decrease in revenue of 49.7%, which could be attributed to market saturation or a lack of differentiation in Beachbody's offerings compared to competitors.It is also worth noting that the company has managed to slightly improve its digital retention rates, which indicates a strong core user base. However, the overall reduction in total streams and connected fitness units delivered points to challenges in user engagement and market penetration. The company's strategy to reshape its nutrition business and aim for more profitable revenue streams will be critical to watch, as it may dictate the company's ability to bounce back and grow in a highly competitive industry. Economist The financial results of The Beachbody Company reflect broader economic trends affecting discretionary spending in the health and wellness sector. The reduction in revenue and subscriptions could be indicative of economic headwinds, such as reduced consumer spending in non-essential categories. The company's efforts to lower its breakeven point by approximately $200 million in fixed costs and capital expenditure savings compared to 2021 are a strategic response to these challenges, aiming to create a leaner operational model that can withstand market fluctuations.The emphasis on fostering more profitable revenue streams and sustainable free cash flows is a prudent approach in the face of economic uncertainty. It suggests that the company is prioritizing financial resilience over aggressive expansion, which may be a defensive but necessary strategy to maintain market position and shareholder value in the current economic climate. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Beachbody Company, Inc.

Non GAAP Information We use Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure, to supplement our results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, amortization of content assets, interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), equity-based compensation, and other items that are not normal, recurring, operating expenses necessary to operate the Company’s business as described in the reconciliation below. We include this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate BODi’s core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because they are non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and equity-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of restructuring costs, interest income and expense). The table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA reconciled to our net loss, the closest GAAP measure, for the periods indicated: Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net loss $ (65,039 ) $ (44,933 ) $ (152,641 ) $ (194,192 ) Adjusted for: Impairment of goodwill 40,000 — 40,000 — Impairment of intangible assets 3,092 18,907 3,092 19,907 Impairment of other investment 4,000 — 4,000 — Loss on partial debt extinguishment (1) — — 3,168 — Depreciation and amortization 8,178 15,990 39,573 74,848 Amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs 57 30 179 492 Amortization of content assets 7,268 5,603 23,755 24,276 Interest expense 2,101 2,194 8,874 3,368 Income tax provision (benefit) (62 ) (1,517 ) 37 (3,053 ) Equity-based compensation 4,739 4,454 23,891 17,620 Employee incentives, expected to be settled in equity (2) — 5,466 (5,466 ) 5,466 Inventory net realizable value adjustment (3) — 1,295 — 24,864 Restructuring and platform consolidation costs (4) (53 ) — 7,169 11,718 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities (1,175 ) (3,626 ) (2,679 ) (8,322 ) Non-operating (5) (309 ) (320 ) (1,649 ) (257 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,797 $ 3,543 $ (8,697 ) $ (23,265 ) 1 Represents the loss related to the $15.0 million partial debt prepayment that the Company made on July 24, 2023. 2 The non-cash charge for employee incentives which were expected to be settled in equity was recorded and included in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reclassified the non-cash charge from employee incentives expected to be settled in equity to equity-based compensation because we settled certain employee incentives with restricted stock unit awards during the period. 3 Represents a non-cash expense to reduce the carrying value of our connected fitness inventory and related future commitments. This adjustment was included during the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, because of its unusual magnitude due to disruptions in the connected fitness market. 4 Includes restructuring expense and personnel costs associated with executing our key growth priorities during the year ended December 31, 2023, and with the consolidation of our digital platforms during the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. The costs primarily relates to termination benefits related to headcount reductions. 5 Primarily includes interest income.

The dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. (FCPT) is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are often a reflection of a company's confidence in its current profitability and future earnings potential. The announced rate of $0.3450 per share, or $1.38 on an annualized basis, provides investors with a tangible return on their investment, which can be particularly attractive in times of market volatility.For investors, the stability of dividend-paying stocks like FCPT can be appealing, especially for those seeking regular income streams. The key factors to consider include the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price and the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. These metrics help evaluate the sustainability of the dividends. A low payout ratio may indicate that the company has room to grow its dividend in the future, while a high payout ratio could suggest that the dividend may not be sustainable in the long term. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a dividend payment can influence investor sentiment and stock valuation. Dividends are often factored into stock pricing models, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), which values a stock based on the present value of its future dividend payments. Consistent dividend payments can signal to the market that the company has a stable and predictable cash flow, which can be a bullish sign for investors.Moreover, the timing of the dividend announcement and its size relative to industry peers can impact the stock's performance. If FCPT's dividend yield is higher than that of its competitors, it could attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the stock. Conversely, if the yield is lower, it might suggest that the company is conservatively managing its cash or investing more heavily in growth opportunities. Real Estate Investment Expert Within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, dividends are a particularly critical component. REITs like FCPT are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can lead to higher yields compared to other sectors. The stability and growth of these dividends are often a proxy for the underlying asset performance and the management's ability to generate consistent rental income and manage operational costs effectively.Analyzing FCPT's dividend in the context of its portfolio composition, occupancy rates, lease durations and tenant credit quality is crucial. These factors can influence the trust's ability to maintain and potentially increase its dividend distributions. Additionally, considering the current interest rate environment and its impact on financing costs for REITs is essential, as higher interest rates can increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce the funds available for dividends. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM MILL VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Four Corners Property Trust, Inc.

(NPWR) reported Q4 and year-end 2023 results, highlighting progress in Project Permian and strategic partnerships. The company signed agreements with Baker Hughes and Lummus Technology, showcasing advancements in technology and manufacturing. Financially, the company ended 2023 with $637 million in cash and short-term investments, with no debt. NET Power aims to continue developing clean energy solutions and achieving key milestones in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Industry Analyst The progression of Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) for Project Permian and the signing of a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) with Baker Hughes are strategic steps for NET Power Inc. in solidifying its position in the energy sector. The FEED phase is crucial for establishing the technical specifications and project costs, which are essential for future investment and project execution decisions. The LNTP indicates a commitment to move forward with the procurement of critical equipment, suggesting confidence in the project's viability and a potential increase in capital expenditure.The strategic supplier agreement with Lummus Technology for recuperative heat exchangers (HXRs) represents an advancement in NET Power's proprietary technology, which aims to deliver near-zero emissions power generation. This agreement could lead to enhanced competitive advantage and open up new revenue streams through equipment licensing, which is a positive indicator for investors looking at the company's potential for innovation-led growth. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, NET Power's cash flow usage in operations and investing activities indicates a burn rate that investors should monitor closely. However, the company's strong cash and short-term investments position, coupled with no debt, provides a robust financial foundation to support its research and development activities. The lack of debt is particularly favorable in an industry where capital-intensive projects are the norm, as it allows for greater flexibility and potentially lower financial risk.The company's stock market performance may be influenced by the anticipated equipment validation campaigns and the completion of the FEED for Project Permian. Investors might see these milestones as indicators of the company's progress towards commercialization and the de-risking of its technology. The successful execution of these milestones could have a positive impact on investor confidence and the company's valuation. Environmental Technology Analyst NET Power's focus on near-zero emissions technology is a response to the global demand for cleaner energy solutions. The company's proprietary technology, which incorporates oxy-fuel combustion and high-efficiency heat exchangers, is designed to capture carbon dioxide emissions efficiently. This technology is not only relevant for the energy industry's transition towards sustainability but also aligns with regulatory trends favoring low-carbon technologies.The collaboration with Baker Hughes and Lummus Technology enhances the credibility of NET Power's offerings and could accelerate the adoption of its technology within the industry. The environmental implications of deploying such technology on a utility scale could be significant, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Progressed Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) for Project Permian, the Company’s first utility-scale project in West Texas; signed Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) with Baker Hughes to release long-lead material for the first utility-scale turboexpander Signed Strategic Supplier Agreement with Lummus Technology to design and supply recuperative heat exchangers (“HXRs”) for NET Power’s near-zero emissions power generation cycle DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NET Power Inc. (NYSE: NPWR) (“NET Power” or the “Company”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year end 2023. Danny Rice, Chief Executive Officer of NET Power, commented, “Our team concluded the fourth quarter of 2023 with steady progress across our three strategic pillars. Development work continues at Project Permian and site preparation at our La Porte facility has ramped up in anticipation of upcoming Baker Hughes equipment validation campaigns scheduled to begin later this year.” Mr. Rice continued, “Our recuperative heat exchanger supply agreement signed with Lummus Technology in the fourth quarter marks a significant step in furthering the development of the NET Power technology and preparing for manufacturing mode. The partnership will enable NET Power plant deployments at manufacturing scale, further solidify our intellectual property moat and create an additional equipment licensing revenue stream. “2023 was a historic year for NET Power, which included completing our business combination with Rice Acquisition Corp. II and becoming a publicly listed company on the NYSE in June. As we look to upcoming 2024 milestones, we plan to commence Baker Hughes equipment validation at La Porte, complete Project Permian FEED and form the project consortium, finalize our strategic partner selection for the Air Separation Unit (ASU) and advance additional NET Power origination projects. “We believe it is of the utmost importance to develop and commercialize a breakthrough technology like NET Power in the public spotlight, and we look forward to continuing the journey towards delivering clean, affordable and reliable energy in the quarters and years to come.” Business Update Baker Hughes Equipment Validation at La Porte Demonstration Facility – The Company continues construction modifications at its La Porte facility ahead of upcoming equipment validation campaigns with Baker Hughes. The process will follow four phases: (i) oxy-fuel burner configuration selection, (ii) single demonstrator combustor can validation, (iii) single utility-scale combustor can validation, and (iv) full demonstrator turboexpander validation. Phase one is set to begin in late 2024 and subsequent phases are expected to continue through 2026. These equipment validation test campaigns at La Porte are intended to de-risk the design of the utility-scale turboexpander which will be deployed to Project Permian and future projects. Project Permian – At NET Power’s first Texas-based project located near Midland-Odessa, FEED is ongoing with licensed EPC partner Zachry Group. FEED is expected to conclude in the second half of 2024 and will form the basis for NET Power’s standardized utility-scale plant design. In December 2023, NET Power signed an LNTP with Baker Hughes to release long-lead material for the turboexpander. Additional orders for long-lead components are expected throughout 2024. NET Power achieved two additional milestones for Project Permian in early 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company initiated engineering work with the Company’s selected ASU provider for Project Permian and executed a site land lease agreement with Occidental Petroleum. These achievements position NET Power to remain on target with the Project Permian development schedule. Financial Updates During the fourth quarter, cash flow used in operations was approximately $3 million and cash flow used in investing activities was approximately $5 million. The Company ended 2023 with approximately $637 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt, as compared to approximately $645 million in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

About Sonendo Sonendo is a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on saving teeth from tooth decay, the most prevalent chronic disease globally. Sonendo develops and manufactures the GentleWave® System, an innovative technology platform designed to treat tooth decay by cleaning and disinfecting the microscopic spaces within teeth without the need to remove tooth structure. The system utilizes a proprietary mechanism of action, which combines procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics, to debride and disinfect deep regions of the complex root canal system in a less invasive procedure that preserves tooth structure. The clinical benefits of the GentleWave System when compared to conventional methods of root canal therapy include improved clinical outcomes, such as superior cleaning that is independent of root canal complexity and tooth anatomy, high and rapid rates of healing and minimal to no post-operative pain. In addition, the GentleWave System can improve the workflow and economics of dental practices. In March 2024, Sonendo divested the TDO® Software segment by selling substantially all the assets and liabilities of TDO Software, Inc.

Increased operating expenses from the acquisition of Spectrum impacted the company's financial performance. Charges for loss on impairment of intangible assets and restructuring costs negatively affected the company's profitability. Adjusted EBITDA decreased significantly compared to the previous year's fourth quarter. Financial Analyst The reported net product sales decline from $49.9 million to $32.5 million in the fourth quarter for Assertio Holdings is a significant indicator of the company's performance, particularly when viewed against the backdrop of the pharmaceutical industry. This decrease is partially attributed to generic competition impacting key products such as Indocin. However, the introduction of Rolvedon, a new product, has partially offset these declines. The company's ability to generate a positive cash flow from operations despite a drop in sales is noteworthy, as it suggests operational efficiency and an effective cost management strategy.Looking ahead, Assertio's guidance for 2024, with net product sales projected between $110 and $125 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $20 to $30 million, indicates a strategic focus on growth and profitability. Investors should consider the company's plans to optimize sales of Rolvedon and manage Indocin's pricing and volume. The gross margin decline from 88% to 70% is considerable and reflects changes in the sales mix and the impact of inventory step-up amortization, which investors should monitor as it affects profitability.Assertio's cash and cash equivalents standing at $73.4 million, alongside a convertible debt of $40 million maturing in September 2027, provides a picture of the company's liquidity and debt position. The operational cash flow of $5.7 million for the quarter and $49.6 million year-to-date, inclusive of acquisition-related costs, is a positive sign of the company's cash-generating ability. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical market is increasingly competitive with the introduction of generics, which can significantly erode the market share and profitability of branded drugs. Assertio's experience with Indocin reflects this trend. However, the company's commercial strategy in response to these challenges, particularly the focus on Rolvedon and the oncology segment, suggests an attempt to diversify its product portfolio and reduce reliance on any single product. The strategic steps taken to reduce operating costs and refine the organization are important for maintaining financial health in a challenging market environment.Assertio's active pursuit of new business development opportunities to expand and diversify its asset base is a proactive approach in the face of generic competition. The success of these initiatives will be crucial for long-term sustainability and growth. Investors should watch for the company's ability to increase customer access and drive new volume growth for Rolvedon, which is positioned to potentially reach sales in excess of $100 million in the coming years. Medical Research Analyst The performance of Rolvedon in the targeted clinic segment and the resolution of channel inventory issues are positive developments from a medical product lifecycle perspective. The ongoing same-day dosing clinical study could provide further differentiation and potentially enhance the drug's marketability. The pharmaceutical industry places significant emphasis on clinical outcomes and product differentiation, which can influence prescribing habits and insurance coverage.Assertio's focus on expanding its customer base in the G-CSF market through its in-person oncology team suggests an emphasis on specialized therapeutic areas where the company can leverage its expertise. The ability to effectively deploy resources in these areas can be critical for the adoption and success of new pharmaceutical products. Investors may benefit from understanding the clinical and market potential of Assertio's products, particularly as the company seeks to navigate the competitive landscape and maximize the economic opportunity of its portfolio. 03/11/2024 - 04:01 PM Fourth Quarter Net Product Sales $32.5 Million, Cash Flow from Operations of $5.7 Million 2024 Full Year Outlook for Net Product Sales of $110 to $125 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $20 to $30 Million LAKE FOREST, Il., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Assertio Holdings, Inc. (“Assertio” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Highlights (unaudited): Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31,(in millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022Net Product Sales (GAAP)$32.5 $49.9 $149.5 $155.1Net (Loss) Income (GAAP)$(57.4) $88.6 $(331.9) $109.6(Loss) Earnings Per Share (GAAP)$(0.61) $1.34 $(4.67) $2.03Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)1$4.5 $33.4 $67.7 $101.6Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP)1$0.11 $0.32 $0.55 $1.19 “Our fourth quarter results include positive indicators for the future, demonstrating the durability of Assertio’s business model. We delivered solid net product sales and positive cash flows from operations as we adapted our business strategy and aligned operating costs to the portfolio of products that will drive our growth and cash flows going forward,” said Heather Mason, interim Chief Executive Officer. “Today we are providing guidance for 2024, targeting net product sales of $110 million to $125 million and adjusted EBITDA2 of $20 million to $30 million. Our focus is growth in Rolvedon and prudent management of Indocin’s pricing and volume to maximize the economic opportunity, which should further grow our cash position.” “Rolvedon continues to perform well in the targeted clinic segment, reflecting sequential quarter-over-quarter demand growth since launch. The channel inventory issues we previously discussed have been resolved, and we are fully committed to maximizing this asset. With our strategy now fully in place, we believe that Rolvedon can grow to sales in excess of $100 million in the coming years through increased customer access and new volume growth. We also continue to advance the same-day dosing clinical study, with an eye toward further differentiation.” “Additionally, we have taken steps to substantially reduce our operating costs to match our product portfolio. We will continue to optimize Assertio’s non-personal promotion strategy while also deploying our excellent in-person oncology team to expand our customer base in the G-CSF market. We also continue to actively pursue new business development opportunities that can further expand and diversify our asset base,” concluded Mason. Fourth quarter results included: Net product sales were $32.5 million, decreased from $49.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The declines in Indocin and Cambia following their respective generic entrants were partially offset by the addition of Rolvedon.Rolvedon net product sales were $11.0 million in the fourth quarter, the first full quarter following the acquisition of Spectrum. During the quarter, the Company successfully addressed high levels of inventory in the channel and implemented an updated commercial strategy expected to drive sales growth throughout 2024 while maintaining pricing discipline.Indocin net product sales in the fourth quarter were $10.8 million, a $23.4 million decrease from the prior year quarter reflecting declining price and volumes due to a generic entrant late in 2023. Gross margin3 in the fourth quarter was 70%, decreased from 88% in the prior year fourth quarter. Inventory step-up amortization contributed nine percentage points of the decrease in margin, with the remaining reduction in margin primarily due to changes in sales mix from the addition of Rolvedon and decrease in higher margin Indocin and Cambia. SG&A expense was $24.0 million, increased from $13.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Results included approximately $9.5 million in higher operating expense due to the acquisition of Spectrum.In response to declining sales and gross profits, the Company refined its organization to further reduce its operating expense profile in the first quarter of 2024. Fourth quarter 2023 included the following other items: A charge of $40.8 million for loss on impairment of intangible assets, primarily driven by a $36.0 million impairment of Indocin intangible asset.A reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration resulted in a benefit of $17.4 million driven by the revaluation of the Indocin contingent liability due to generic competition.A charge of $2.4 million for restructuring costs.Income tax expense of $25.5 million, primarily due to the impact of applying a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 million, decreased from $33.4 million in the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to Indocin generic competition and higher operating expenses from the acquisition of Spectrum. 2024 Full Year Financial Guidance Assertio announced its initial 2024 operating guidance as follows: Net Product Sales (GAAP)$110.0 Million to $125.0 MillionAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)4$20.0 Million to $30.0 Million Balance Sheet and Cash Flow For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $73.4 million.Convertible debt outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2023 was $40.0 million and does not mature until September 2027.Cash generated from operating activities quarter-to-date and year-to-date was $5.7 million and $49.6 million, respectively, inclusive of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Spectrum and supporting Spectrum’s working capital needs.

Assertio does not assume, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company’s financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, the Company has included information about non-GAAP measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share as useful operating metrics. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and the Company’s management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies. This release also includes estimated full-year non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA information, which the Company believes enables investors to better understand the anticipated performance of the business, but should be considered a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. No reconciliation of estimated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to estimated net income is provided in this release because some of the information necessary for estimated net income such as income taxes, fair value change in contingent consideration, and stock-based compensation is not yet ascertainable or accessible and the Company is unable to quantify these amounts that would be required to be included in estimated net income without unreasonable efforts. Specified Items Non-GAAP measures presented within this release exclude specified items. The Company considers specified items to be significant income/expense items not indicative of current operations. Specified items may include adjustments to interest expense and interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, amortization expense, sales reserves adjustments for products the Company is no longer selling, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration or derivative liability, restructuring charges, amortization of fair value inventory step-up as a result of purchase accounting, transaction-related costs, gains or losses from adjustments to long-lived assets and assets not part of current operations, changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and gains or losses resulting from debt refinancing or extinguishment.

(2) The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in the fair value resulting from changes in the underlying inputs being recognized as a benefit or expense in operating expenses until the contingent consideration arrangement is settled. (3) Debt-related expenses consist of an induced conversion expense of approximately $8.8 million and direct transaction costs of approximately $1.1 million incurred as a result of the privately negotiated exchange of $30.0 million principal amount of the Company’s 6.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 in the first quarter of 2023.

(2) The Company uses the if-converted method with respect to its convertible debt to compute GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when the effect is dilutive. Under the if-converted method, the Company assumes the 2027 Convertible Notes, which were entered into on August 22, 2022, were converted at the beginning of each period presented and outstanding. As a result, interest expense, net of tax, and any other income statement impact associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of tax, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation. As a result, interest expense, net of tax, associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes was added back to net loss used in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three months ended December 31, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense, net of tax and the loss from the derivative fair value adjustment, net of tax, associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and potentially dilutive stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP diluted net (loss) income per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.

Oncology Doctor The recent clinical advancements for palazestrant, particularly its efficacy as both a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors ribociclib and palbociclib, mark a significant step in the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer. The drug's ability to target both wild-type and ESR1-mutant breast cancers could potentially fill a gap in current treatment options, which often face challenges such as resistance to existing therapies.From an oncological perspective, the initiation of the OPERA-01 pivotal Phase 3 trial is a critical milestone that signifies the transition from early to late-stage clinical development. The top-line results expected in 2026 will be pivotal in determining the drug's efficacy and safety at a larger scale, which if positive, could lead to a new standard of care for patients with advanced breast cancer. Financial Analyst Olema Pharmaceuticals' financial results reveal a strategic emphasis on research and development, with a notable increase in spending to advance clinical trials for palazestrant. This investment is justified by the potential market opportunity in breast cancer therapies, a field that continues to demand innovation due to the prevalence of the disease and the limitations of current treatments.The company's cash position of $261.8 million as of December 31, 2023, suggests a solid runway to support ongoing clinical trials and the initiation of new studies. However, the reported net loss of $26.8 million for the quarter and $96.7 million for the year, although slightly improved from the previous year, underscores the high costs associated with drug development and the risks involved in the biopharmaceutical industry.The collaboration with Novartis and the successful financing, including a significant private placement and a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, indicate investor confidence and provide financial flexibility. These factors could potentially impact Olema's stock performance and investor sentiment, especially as clinical trial milestones are reached and reported. Market Research Analyst The advancement of palazestrant in clinical trials is not only significant for patient outcomes but also for Olema Pharmaceuticals' position in the competitive landscape of women’s cancer treatments. The company's focus on a targeted therapy approach, as evidenced by the development of a KAT6 inhibitor, suggests a strategic alignment with current industry trends towards personalized medicine.The upcoming presentation of interim Phase 2 clinical results at the ESMO Breast Cancer Annual Congress in 2024 will be a key event for stakeholders, as it will provide valuable insights into the drug's performance and potential market impact. The initiation of a Phase 1b/2 study with an mTOR inhibitor also indicates Olema's commitment to exploring combination therapies, which could enhance the therapeutic efficacy and marketability of palazestrant. 03/11/2024 - 04:03 PM Presented compelling clinical results for palazestrant both as a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib and palbociclib, in Q4 2023 Initiated OPERA-01 pivotal Phase 3 monotherapy trial in Q4 2023; top-line results expected in 202660-patient Phase 2 studies in combination with each of ribociclib and palbociclib are fully enrolled; palazestrant-ribociclib clinical update to be presented at ESMO Breast Cancer Annual Congress 2024, May 15-17, 2024, in BerlinCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $261.8 million as of December 31, 2023 SAN FRANCISCO, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Olema Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Olema”, “Olema Oncology”, Nasdaq: OLMA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted therapies for women’s cancers, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “In 2023 we demonstrated the unique opportunity ahead for palazestrant to make a meaningful impact on improving treatment options for women with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. We believe palazestrant’s activity on both wild-type and ESR1-mutant breast cancer, and its ability to safely combine with ribociclib, result in a highly differentiated profile amongst this emerging new class of estrogen receptor-targeting therapies,” said Sean P. Bohen, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Olema Oncology. “We have recently completed enrollment in our 60-patient Phase 2 study of 120 mg palazestrant in combination with 600 mg ribociclib, and we are looking forward to sharing an update on this study at the 2024 ESMO Breast Cancer Annual Congress. Beyond palazestrant, we recently declared a development candidate for our KAT6 program, OP-3136, and we are advancing towards an IND filing by the end of this year. Our mission at Olema is to improve the lives of women living with cancer and we are very pleased with the progress we are making.” Recent Corporate Highlights Presented interim clinical results of palazestrant in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors ribociclib and palbociclib at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), showing no significant drug-drug interaction, no dose-limiting toxicities and a tolerability profile consistent with the FDA-approved labels of ribociclib or palbociclib plus an endocrine therapy.Presented palazestrant monotherapy Phase 2 clinical results at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023 in Madrid, Spain, as an oral presentation demonstrating compelling activity in both wild-type and ESR1-mutant tumor types.Initiated OPERA-01, our pivotal Phase 3 monotherapy clinical trial in the second- and third-line setting of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including dosing first patients and activating multiple trial sites globally.Nominated OP-3136, an orally bioavailable KAT6 inhibitor, as a development candidate. OP-3136 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity alone and in combination with both palazestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors in preclinical ER+ breast cancer models.Announced the expansion of Olema's clinical collaboration with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novartis), increasing the size of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study testing palazestrant in combination with ribociclib to approximately 60 patients.

Upcoming Milestones Present interim Phase 2 clinical results of palazestrant in combination with ribociclib at ESMO Breast Cancer Annual Congress 2024, May 15-17, 2024, in Berlin, Germany.Initiate Phase 1b/2 clinical study of palazestrant in combination with mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, in Q3 2024.File an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the FDA for OP-3136, a KAT6 inhibitor, in late 2024, and advance clinical development.Prepare for pivotal Phase 3 first-line trial in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, were $261.8 million. Net loss was $26.8 million and $96.7 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $26.2 million and $104.8 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in net loss for the fourth quarter was primarily related to increased spending on clinical operations and development-related activities, including personnel-related expenses, as Olema continues to advance palazestrant into late-stage clinical trials. This increase was offset by decreased spending on general and administrative activities and higher interest income earned from marketable securities. The decrease in net loss for the full year 2023 was primarily due to higher interest income earned from marketable securities. GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses were $25.9 million and $86.1 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $21.6 million and $82.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily a result of increased spending on clinical operations and development-related activities including personnel-related costs as Olema continues to advance palazestrant into late-stage clinical development, which were offset by decreased spending on research-related activities. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $23.0 million and $74.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, excluding $2.9 million and $11.8 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $18.2 million and $69.8 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, excluding $3.4 million and $12.5 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense, respectively. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release can be found at the end of this press release. GAAP G&A expenses were $4.5 million and $18.8 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to $5.6 million and $24.7 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to decreased spending on corporate- and legal-related costs, and personnel-related expenses. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $3.1 million and $13.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, excluding $1.4 million and $5.5 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense respectively. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $4.1 million and $18.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, excluding $1.5 million and $6.4 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense, respectively.

About Palazestrant (OP-1250) Palazestrant (OP-1250) is a novel, orally-available small molecule with dual activity as both a complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (CERAN) and selective ER degrader (SERD). It is currently being investigated in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. In clinical studies, palazestrant completely blocks ER-driven transcriptional activity in both wild-type and mutant forms of metastatic ER+ breast cancer and has demonstrated anti-tumor activity along with attractive pharmacokinetics and exposure, favorable tolerability, CNS penetration, and combinability with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Palazestrant has been granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track designation for the treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer that has progressed following one or more lines of endocrine therapy with at least one line given in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated both as a single agent in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, OPERA-01, and in Phase 2 combination studies with CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and ribociclib) and a PI3Ka inhibitor (alpelisib).

Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Closing of Convertible Notes Offering,2024-03-11T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX) closes $350 million offering of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, with plans to refinance existing debt and fund capped call transactions.

The initial conversion price represents a 25% premium over the closing price of Xerox's common stock on NASDAQ. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An issuance of $350 million in 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by Xerox represents a strategic move to refinance existing debt and potentially reduce future interest expenses. The notes' conversion feature, with an initial conversion rate representing a 25% premium over the current stock price, indicates a bullish stance by the company on its future stock performance. The decision to refinance the 2024 and 2025 Notes could be a response to the current interest rate environment, aiming to lock in lower rates before potential increases. The use of capped call transactions is a sophisticated financial strategy to manage dilution and cash payment obligations upon conversion, which could be seen as a proactive approach to maintain shareholder value.Investors should note the redeemability feature starting in 2027, which provides Xerox with the flexibility to redeem the notes if the stock price appreciates significantly, thus limiting the duration of the debt. The choice of a private placement to qualified institutional buyers suggests confidence in institutional support but also limits liquidity for retail investors. Overall, the transaction reflects a proactive capital management strategy that could lead to a more favorable capital structure, potentially impacting the company's credit ratings and stock performance. Legal Expert The issuance of convertible notes and the related capped call transactions are subject to intricate securities regulations. The private placement under Rule 144A allows Xerox to raise capital from qualified institutional buyers without the extensive disclosures required for public offerings, expediting the process and reducing costs. However, it also means that the securities are restricted and generally cannot be sold to the public without registration or an appropriate exemption. The legal intricacies of such transactions require careful structuring to ensure compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 and to avoid potential legal pitfalls associated with securities offerings.Investors should be aware that the lack of public registration means less public disclosure, which could impact the transparency and perceived risk of the investment. The legal framework surrounding these transactions is designed to protect investors while providing companies with the flexibility to manage their capital needs in a manner that aligns with their strategic objectives. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Xerox's issuance of convertible notes may reflect broader trends in corporate finance, where companies seek to balance equity and debt financing. The semi-annual interest payments are a standard feature, providing regular income to investors, while the conversion option offers potential upside in equity gains. The capped call transactions indicate that Xerox is hedging against excessive dilution, which could reassure investors about the company's commitment to managing its share price impact.The transaction could signal to the market Xerox's confidence in its operational performance and growth prospects. However, the market's reception to this news will depend on the company's current leverage, interest coverage ratios and the perceived risk of the technology sector. The timing of the refinancing may also be influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate forecasts and credit market liquidity, which could affect the company's cost of capital and long-term financial strategy. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (the “Company” or “Xerox”) announced today the closing of its $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). The Company also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of additional notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described below, with any remaining net proceeds of the Notes, together with the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 of the Company, to be used to (i) refinance all of its outstanding 3.800% Senior Notes due 2024 (“2024 Notes”) and a portion of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (“2025 Notes”), (ii) repay, repurchase or redeem a portion of its other outstanding indebtedness, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses, and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Notes and the related guarantees are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears. The Notes are convertible into cash, up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 47.9904 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.84 per share). The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 25% to the $16.67 per share closing price of Xerox’s common stock on NASDAQ on March 6, 2024. The Notes also will be redeemable at the option of the Company on or after September 20, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2030. The Company also entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, which include certain initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions or their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Counterparties”). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions was approximately $28.34 per share, which represents a premium of 70% over the last reported sale price of Xerox’s common stock of $16.67 per share on March 6, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Counterparties. The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the Notes, the related guarantees nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, the Notes, the related guarantees or any other security, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which, or to any persons to whom, such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. In addition, this press release shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the 2024 Notes or the 2025 Notes. Any tender offer will be made solely pursuant to an offer to purchase to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Notes.

Positive iRobot Corp. provides financial expectations for Q1 2024 and reiterates outlook for FY 2024. Q1 2024 revenue expected to be $137-$142 million with net loss per share of ($0.22)-($0.09). FY 2024 revenue projected at $825-$865 million with net loss per share of ($3.13)-($2.70). Anticipated revenue decline in the high teens to low 20s percentage range for the first half of 2024 compared to 2023. Gross margin improvement expected in the second half of the year as the Company ramps its initiatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst The guidance provided by iRobot Corp. indicates a revenue range of $137 - $142 million for the first quarter and $825 - $865 million for the fiscal year 2024. The projected gross margins and operating income (loss) figures are crucial for understanding the company's profitability. A gross margin of 22% to 23% for Q1 and 31% to 33% for the full year, with corresponding non-GAAP adjustments, suggests that iRobot is anticipating moderate profitability, with significant improvements expected in the latter half of the year.Investors should note the substantial non-GAAP adjustments, particularly a ~($54) million adjustment to operating income in Q1 and a ~($17) million adjustment for the fiscal year. This indicates significant non-operating expenses or one-time costs that investors should investigate further, as these adjustments can provide insights into the company's core operating efficiency and potential future profitability. Market Research Analyst The expected decline in revenue in the high teens to low 20s percentage range for the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023, with Q2 anticipated to be weaker, suggests that iRobot is facing challenges in the consumer robotics market. This could be due to a variety of factors such as increased competition, market saturation, or shifts in consumer spending. The mid-single-digit percentage improvement in revenue projected for the second half of the year implies that the company is expecting a recovery or the realization of benefits from its strategic initiatives.Understanding the context of these projections is important for stakeholders. If the anticipated order shift into Q3 is due to new product launches or strategic partnerships, this could be a positive sign for long-term growth. However, if it is due to delayed customer purchases or supply chain issues, it could signal underlying problems that may affect future performance. Economist The financial expectations of iRobot Corp. reflect broader economic conditions. The anticipated gross margin improvement in the second half of the year could be indicative of cost-saving measures, efficiency improvements, or economies of scale as production ramps up. However, the initial revenue decline and operating losses suggest a challenging economic environment, potentially influenced by factors such as consumer confidence, disposable income levels and global economic trends.An economist would also consider the impact of inflation on the company's cost structure and pricing strategy. If iRobot's costs are increasing due to inflation but pricing power is limited due to competitive pressures, this could squeeze margins further. Conversely, if iRobot can pass on costs to consumers without a significant drop in demand, it may indicate strong brand loyalty and product differentiation in the market. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM BEDFORD, Mass., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- iRobot Corp.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Amortization of acquired intangible assets: Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets including completed technology, customer relationships, and reacquired distribution rights acquired in connection with business combinations as well as any non-cash impairment charges associated with intangible assets in connection with our past acquisitions. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Net Merger, Acquisition and Divestiture (Income) Expense: Net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense primarily consists of transaction fees, professional fees, and transition and integration costs directly associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the iRobot-Amazon Merger which was terminated on January 28, 2024. It also includes business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of these transactions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge relating to stock-based awards. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense, and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies. Restructuring and Other: Restructuring charges are related to one-time actions associated with realigning resources, enhancing operational productivity and efficiency, or improving our cost structure in support of our strategy. Such actions are not reflective of ongoing operations and include costs primarily associated with severance costs, certain professional fees, costs associated with consolidation of facilities, warehouses and any other leased properties, and other non-recurring costs directly associated with resource realignments tied to strategic initiatives or changes in business conditions. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP measures when evaluating our recent and prospective business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the action and do not reflect anticipated future operating costs. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. Income tax adjustments: Income tax adjustments include the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate statutory tax rate for each adjustment. We regularly assess the need to record valuation allowances based on non-GAAP profitability and other factors. We also exclude certain tax items, including the impact from stock-based compensation windfalls/shortfalls, that are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. We believe disclosure of the income tax provision before the effect of such tax items is important to permit investors' consistent earnings comparison between periods. iRobot Corporation Supplemental Reconciliation of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 GAAP to Non-GAAP Guidance (unaudited) Q1-24 GAAP Gross Profit $30 - $32 million Stock-based compensation ~$1 million Restructuring and other ~$1 million Total adjustments ~$2 million Non-GAAP Gross Profit $32 - $34 million Q1-24 GAAP Gross Margin 22% - 23% Stock-based compensation ~1% Restructuring and other ~1% Total adjustments ~1% Non-GAAP Gross Margin 23% - 24% Q1-24 GAAP Operating Income $7 - $11 million Amortization of acquired intangible assets ~$0 million Stock-based compensation ~$9 million Net merger, acquisition and divestiture expense (income) ~($74) million Restructuring and other ~$11 million Total adjustments ~($54) million Non-GAAP Operating Loss ($47) - ($43) million Q1-24 GAAP Net Loss Per Diluted Share ($0.22) - ($0.09) Amortization of acquired intangible assets ~$0.01 Stock-based compensation ~$0.33 Net merger, acquisition and divestiture expense (income) ~($2.64) Restructuring and other ~$0.39 Income tax effect ~$0 Total adjustments ~($1.91) Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Diluted Share ($2.13) - ($2.00) Number of shares used in diluted per share calculations* ~28.0 million * Number of shares does not include impact from the at-the-market offering program announced on February 27, 2024 Certain numbers may not total due to rounding iRobot Corporation Supplemental Reconciliation of Fiscal Year 2024 GAAP to Non-GAAP Guidance (unaudited) FY-24 GAAP Gross Profit $258 - $288 million Stock-based compensation ~$4 million Restructuring and other ~$2 million Total adjustments ~$6 million Non-GAAP Gross Profit $264 - $294 million FY-24 GAAP Gross Margin 31% - 33% Stock-based compensation ~1% Restructuring and other ~0% Total adjustments ~1% Non-GAAP Gross Margin 32% - 34% FY-24 GAAP Operating Loss ($41) - ($29) million Amortization of acquired intangible assets ~$1 million Stock-based compensation ~$41 million Net merger, acquisition and divestiture expense (income) ~($74) million Restructuring and other ~$15 million Total adjustments ~($17) million Non-GAAP Operating Loss ($58) - ($46) million FY-24 GAAP Net Loss Per Diluted Share ($3.13) - ($2.70) Amortization of acquired intangible assets ~$0.03 Stock-based compensation ~$1.45 Net merger, acquisition and divestiture expense (income) ~($2.61) Restructuring and other ~$0.53 Income tax effect ~$0 Total adjustments ~($0.60) Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Diluted Share ($3.73) - ($3.30) Number of shares used in diluted per share calculations ~28.3 million View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-provides-first-quarter-2024-financial-expectations-and-reiterates-2024-financial-outlook-302085618.html SOURCE iRobot Corporation What are iRobot Corp.'s revenue expectations for Q1 2024? iRobot Corp. expects revenue for Q1 2024 to be in the range of $137-$142 million.

Upcoming presentation at KeyBanc Capital Markets Life Sciences & MedTech Forum on March 19-20, 2024. Negative 11% decrease in total revenue for full year 2023. Negative free cash flow of $26.6 million for 2023. Operating expenses of $45.9 million in 2023, down from $67.1 million in 2022. Gross profit for 2023 was $10.3 million, compared to $17.5 million in 2022. Decrease in gross profit percentage due to lower revenue and higher overhead costs. Financial Analyst The reported 11% year-over-year decline in total revenue for Alpha Teknova, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's performance, particularly in the context of an industry that relies heavily on continuous investment in research and development to drive growth. The increase in Clinical Solutions customers by 36% is a positive sign, suggesting potential for future revenue streams, yet it's juxtaposed against a 20% drop in Clinical Solutions revenue, indicating a possible issue with customer monetization or market pricing pressures.Moreover, the anticipated revenue guidance for 2024 shows a stabilization effort, with expected revenue slightly below the current year, which could be interpreted as a conservative estimate or a lack of confidence in rapid growth recovery. The free cash outflow projection of less than $18 million, while an improvement over the previous year, still reflects ongoing cash burn, which could affect the company's operational sustainability and investment capacity.Investors should also consider the implications of the stock option repricing approved by the board of directors, which could be seen as a move to incentivize and retain key employees but might also dilute existing shareholders' value. Market Research Analyst The reduction in workforce and other cost-saving measures, estimated to save approximately $8.0 million annually, signal a strategic pivot towards operational efficiency. This could potentially improve the company's competitive positioning in the biotech reagents market, which is characterized by high competition and price sensitivity. However, the cost-cutting measures could also impact the company's innovation capabilities and customer service levels, which are critical in this industry.It's also important to note the impairment charges totaling $4.4 million due to adverse market conditions and lowered financial forecasts. These non-cash charges reflect a reevaluation of the company's assets' worth and could be indicative of broader industry trends, such as decreased valuations for biotech assets or a more challenging funding environment. Legal Expert The stock option repricing indicates a legal strategy to maintain employee motivation and loyalty in a challenging economic environment. However, it is essential to scrutinize the terms and conditions of such repricing, as they can have significant legal implications for both the company and the option holders, particularly regarding securities laws and tax implications.Additionally, the mention of a loss contingency related to non-recurring charges suggests potential legal disputes or settlements that could have an impact on the company's financial health. Stakeholders should be aware of the nature of these contingencies as they could affect future earnings and the company's risk profile. 03/11/2024 - 04:01 PM Full year 2023 total revenue was $36.7 million, down 11% year-over-yearAchieved 36% annual growth in the number of Clinical Solutions customers in 2023Company provides 2024 revenue guidance of $35-38 million HOLLISTER, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Teknova, Inc.

Lab Essentials revenue was $6.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023, down 4% compared to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Clinical Solutions revenue was $0.9 million, up 14% compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Gross profit for the fourth quarter 2023 was $1.3 million, compared to $2.1 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2023 was 17.0%, compared to 26.7% in the fourth quarter 2022. The decrease in gross profit percentage was driven primarily by increased overhead costs (owing to the completion of our new manufacturing facilities), which were partially offset by reduced headcount. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 were $12.2 million, compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Excluding the non-recurring charges of $0.3 million related to a loss contingency and the $2.2 million non-cash tradename impairment charge, both recorded in the fourth quarter 2023, and the non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of $4.2 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2022, operating expenses were down $2.4 million. The decrease was driven primarily by reduced headcount and spending, in particular in professional fees. Net loss for the fourth quarter 2023 was $10.7 million, or negative $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $13.3 million, or negative $0.47 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was negative $5.4 million, compared to negative $8.1 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Free Cash Flow was negative $3.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to negative $12.8 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue was $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023”), an 11% decrease from $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022”). Lab Essentials revenue was $28.8 million in 2023, down 9% compared to $31.8 million in 2022. Clinical Solutions revenue was $6.7 million, down 20% compared to $8.4 million in 2022. Gross profit for 2023 was $10.3 million, compared to $17.5 million in 2022. Gross margin for 2023 was 28.1%, compared to 42.2% in 2022. The decrease in gross profit percentage was driven primarily by the decrease in revenue and associated lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and to a lesser extent by increased overhead costs (owing to the completion of our new manufacturing facilities), which were partially offset by reduced headcount. Operating expenses for 2023 were $45.9 million, compared to $67.1 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily related to a one-time, $16.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, coupled with reduced headcount and spending, in particular in professional fees. Net loss for 2023 was $36.8 million, or negative $1.16 per diluted share, compared to $47.5 million, or negative $1.69 per diluted share, for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was negative $19.2 million, compared to negative $21.9 million for 2022. Free Cash Flow was negative $26.6 million for 2023, compared to negative $55.5 million for 2022. 2024 Outlook Teknova anticipates total revenue of $35 million to $38 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 (“2024”), which assumes roughly 10% growth in Lab Essentials and the remaining revenue from Clinical Solutions. The Company also anticipates free cash outflow of less than $18 million for 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Teknova uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of its business and the effectiveness of its business strategies: (a) Adjusted EBITDA and (b) Free Cash Flow. Teknova defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for interest income (expense), net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items that Teknova does not consider representative of its ongoing operating performance. Teknova defines Free Cash Flow as cash used in operating activities less purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Teknova provides Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow in this press release because Teknova believes that analysts, investors, and other interested parties frequently use these measures to evaluate companies in Teknova’s industry and that such measures facilitate comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Teknova also believes such measures are helpful in highlighting trends in Teknova’s operating results because they exclude items that are not indicative of Teknova’s core operating performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by Teknova may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this release. Forward-Looking Statements Statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Teknova’s anticipated total revenue, including our expectations for 2024 revenue and free cash outflow guidance, expected growth in Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions, ongoing capacity expansion, new research and development products, prospects, including to achieve profitability, strategy of managing operating expenses, and long-term growth strategy. The words, without limitation, “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these or similar identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to uncertainties and factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Teknova’s control and could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the fact that the Company’s fourth quarter and year-end financial closing procedures, annual accounting procedures and adjustments, and annual audit of its financial statements are not yet complete; demand for Teknova’s products (including the potential delay or pausing of customer orders); Teknova’s assessment of fundamental indicators of future demand across its target customer base; Teknova’s ability to expand its production, commercial, and research and development capabilities; Teknova’s cash flows and revenue growth rate; Teknova’s supply chain, sourcing, manufacturing, and warehousing; inventory management; risks related to global economic and marketplace uncertainties, including those related to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; reliance on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of Teknova’s revenue; potential acquisitions and integration of other companies; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of Teknova’s most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in Teknova’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, all of which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

About Rhythm PharmaceuticalsRhythm is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the lives of patients and their families living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. Rhythm’s lead asset, IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide), an MC4R agonist designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing, or patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Both the European Commission (EC) and the UK’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. Additionally, Rhythm is advancing a broad clinical development program for setmelanotide in other rare diseases, as well as investigational MC4R agonists LB54640 and RM-718, and a preclinical suite of small molecules for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism. Rhythm’s headquarters is in Boston, MA. Setmelanotide IndicationIn the United States, setmelanotide is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) or BBS. In the European Union, setmelanotide is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. In Europe, setmelanotide should be prescribed and supervised by a physician with expertise in obesity with underlying genetic etiology. Limitations of UseSetmelanotide is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as setmelanotide would not be expected to be effective: Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency with POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR variants classified as benign or likely benignOther types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, or BBS, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity. ContraindicationPrior serious hypersensitivity to setmelanotide or any of the excipients in IMCIVREE. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi: Generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi have occurred because of its pharmacologic effect. Full body skin examinations prior to initiation and periodically during treatment should be conducted to monitor pre-existing and new pigmentary lesions. Heart rate and blood pressure monitoring: In Europe, heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as part of standard clinical practice at each medical visit (at least every 6 months) for patients treated with setmelanotide. Disturbance in Sexual Arousal: Spontaneous penile erections in males and sexual adverse reactions in females have occurred. Patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours should seek emergency medical attention. Depression and Suicidal Ideation: Depression and suicidal ideation have occurred. Patients should be monitored for new onset or worsening depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Consideration should be given to discontinuing setmelanotide if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors, or clinically significant or persistent depression symptoms occur. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. If suspected, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue setmelanotide. Pediatric Population: The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated. In Europe, the prescribing physician should monitor growth (height and weight) using age- and sex-appropriate growth curves. Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in Neonates and Low Birth Weight Infants: Setmelanotide is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) included skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, depression, and spontaneous penile erection.

Cash flows from operating activities improved by $142 million year over year. Annual revenues from customers spending $100,000 or more grew by 29% year over year. Positive Annual revenues grew by 19% year over year to $652.5 million in fiscal 2024. GAAP operating loss improved to $270.0 million, or 41% of revenues, compared to $407.8 million in fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP operating loss was $58.1 million, or 9% of revenues, an improvement from $207.3 million in fiscal 2023. Cash flows from operating activities were negative $17.9 million in fiscal 2024, an improvement compared to negative $160.1 million in fiscal 2023. Asana expects revenues of $168.0 million to $169.0 million for Q1 of fiscal 2025, with year over year growth of 10% to 11%. Negative Negative free cash flow of $30.4 million in fiscal 2024, compared to negative $159.6 million in fiscal 2023. GAAP net loss of $257.0 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $407.8 million in fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.20 in fiscal 2024, compared to $1.04 in fiscal 2023. Financial Analyst The reported improvement in cash flows from operating activities and revenue growth, particularly from high-value customers, indicates a strengthening business model for Asana. The significant reduction in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating losses suggests that the company is moving towards operational efficiency. A key metric to consider is the dollar-based net retention rate, which remains over 100% for all customers and even higher for core and high-spending customers. This reflects strong customer satisfaction and potential for upselling.However, despite revenue growth, the company still operates at a loss, which is a concern for long-term sustainability. The forward-looking statements project continued losses, albeit at a lower margin, which could indicate a strategic focus on growth over immediate profitability. Investors should monitor the company's ability to control costs while expanding its customer base and increasing its revenue per customer. Market Research Analyst Asana's growth in the work management platform sector is noteworthy, particularly in the context of the ongoing digital transformation in workplaces. The increase in the number of customers, especially those spending $100,000 or more, suggests that Asana is successfully penetrating the upper segment of the market. The expansion into new markets, such as the opening of the Warsaw office, could provide additional growth opportunities in the EMEA region.Furthermore, the company's investment in AI and the Asana Work Graph positions it well within the competitive landscape, as businesses seek more intelligent and integrated solutions for collaboration. The focus on innovation, as evidenced by the Work Innovation Summit and research from The Work Innovation Lab, reinforces Asana’s commitment to addressing the evolving needs of the modern workplace. Technology Industry Analyst Asana's strategic emphasis on AI integration into its work management solutions is a critical move, given the increasing demand for AI-driven productivity tools. The platform's ability to provide relevant and reliable context for organizational effectiveness could be a significant differentiator in the market. Moreover, the company's research on the state of collaboration technology indicates a proactive approach to understanding and shaping the future of work.It is important to note that Asana’s financial performance must be evaluated in the context of its technology investments and market expansion strategies. While current losses reflect heavy investment in growth, the potential returns could materialize as the adoption of AI and collaborative technologies continues to accelerate across industries. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM $142 million improvement in cash flows from operating activities year over year Annual revenues from customers spending $100,000 or more grew 29% year over year SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Asana, Inc.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may materially differ. Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section below for information on the factors that could cause Asana’s actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements.

A live webcast and replay will be available on the Asana Investor Relations webpage at: https://investors.asana.com. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our ability to execute on our current strategies, our technology and brand position, Asana’s outlook for the fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2024 and the full fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, Asana’s outlook for free cash flow for calendar year 2024, expected benefits of our offerings, Asana’s market position, and potential market opportunities. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Asana’s future financial or operating performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and in some cases can be identified by terms such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “potential,” “may,” “will,” “goal,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including factors beyond Asana’s control, that may cause Asana’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to: Asana’s ability to achieve future growth and sustain its growth rate, Asana’s ability to attract and retain customers and increase sales to its customers, Asana’s ability to develop and release new products and services and to scale its platform, including the successful integration of artificial intelligence, Asana’s ability to increase adoption of its platform through Asana’s self-service model, Asana’s ability to maintain and grow its relationships with strategic partners, the highly competitive and rapidly evolving market in which Asana participates, Asana’s international expansion strategies, broader macroeconomic conditions and the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are included in Asana’s filings with the SEC, including Asana’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2023 and subsequent filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that Asana believes to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, Asana assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Asana’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Asana utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in understanding and evaluating its core operating performance. In this release, Asana’s non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating loss, operating margin, net loss, net loss per share, and free cash flow are not presented in accordance with GAAP and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP presentations of results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of Asana’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which can be found in the accompanying financial statements included with this press release. Asana is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about its financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of Asana’s past performance and future prospects, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations against other companies in Asana’s industry, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by Asana’s management for financial and operational decision-making. Asana believes excluding the following items from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors and others in assessing Asana’s operating performance due to the following factors: Share-based compensation expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of Asana’s core business and to facilitate comparison of its results to those of peer companies. Employer payroll tax associated with RSUs. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on Asana’s stock price and other factors that are beyond its control and that do not correlate to the operation of the business. Non-cash and non-recurring expenses. Non-cash expenses include charges for impairment of long-lived assets. Non-recurring expenses include costs related to restructuring. Asana believes the exclusion of certain non-cash and non-recurring items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of its operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to GAAP financial measures, including that the non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in Asana’s business and an important part of its compensation strategy. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures outlined above, Asana also uses the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, which is defined as net cash from operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs, plus non-recurring expenditures such as capital expenditures from the purchases of property and equipment associated with the build-out of Asana’s corporate headquarters and costs related to restructuring. Asana believes free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures and operational expenses, for investment in its business and to make acquisitions. Asana believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures Asana’s ability to generate or use cash. There are a number of limitations related to the use of free cash flow as compared to net cash from operating activities, including that free cash flow includes capital expenditures, the benefits of which are realized in periods subsequent to those when expenditures are made. Definitions of Business Metrics Customers spending $5,000 or more on an annualized basis, or Core customers We define customers spending $5,000 or more, which we also refer to as Core customers, as those organizations on a paid subscription plan that had $5,000 or more in annualized GAAP revenues in a given quarter, inclusive of discounts. Customers spending $100,000 or more on an annualized basis We define customers spending $100,000 or more as those organizations on a paid subscription plan that had $100,000 or more in annualized GAAP revenues in a given quarter, inclusive of discounts. Dollar-based net retention rate Asana’s reported dollar-based net retention rate equals the simple arithmetic average of its quarterly dollar-based net retention rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent fiscal quarter. Asana calculates its dollar-based net retention rate by comparing its revenues from the same set of customers in a given quarter, relative to the comparable prior-year period. To calculate Asana’s dollar-based net retention rate for a given quarter, Asana starts with the revenues in that quarter from customers that generated revenues in the same quarter of the prior year. Asana then divides that amount by the revenues attributable to that same group of customers in the prior-year quarter. Current period revenues include any upsells and are net of contraction or attrition over the trailing 12 months, but exclude revenues from new customers in the current period. Asana expects its dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the expected growth of its revenue base, the level of penetration within its customer base, and its ability to retain its customers. About Asana Asana empowers organizations to work smarter. Asana has over 150,000 customers and millions of users in 200+ countries and territories.

Announces Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. (EPRT) has announced a public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock with an option for an additional 1,200,000 shares. The Company will enter into forward sale agreements with underwriters and expects to settle within 12 months. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and potential future investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Essential Properties Realty Trust's decision to initiate an underwritten public offering of 8 million shares on a forward basis is a strategic move to raise capital without an immediate dilution of share value. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as joint book-running managers signals confidence in the offering's success. Forward sale agreements provide a hedge against market fluctuations, allowing the company to potentially lock in a sale price for the shares, mitigating the risk of future stock price volatility.The option granted to underwriters to purchase an additional 1.2 million shares indicates a potential for over-allotment, which could lead to additional capital if the offering is well-received. Investors should note that while the company will not receive immediate proceeds from the initial sale of shares by the forward purchasers, the eventual settlement of these agreements within the next 12 months could inject significant capital into the company, earmarked for general corporate purposes and future investments.It is critical to monitor the company's use of the net proceeds from the settlement of the forward sale agreements. The allocation of funds towards the company's operating partnership in exchange for OP Units suggests a reinvestment strategy aimed at fostering growth and expansion. The impact on the stock price will depend on investor perception of the company's growth prospects and the effectiveness of its capital allocation strategy. Market Research Analyst The public offering by Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. appears to be a calculated effort to capitalize on current market conditions. The structure of the forward sale agreements allows the company to defer equity dilution while potentially securing capital for future use. This move could be indicative of the company's confidence in its long-term strategy and its ability to deploy capital effectively towards accretive investments.For market observers, the key factors to watch include the response of the market to the offering, the final terms of the forward sale agreements and the subsequent investment plans outlined by the company. Success in these areas could position Essential Properties Realty Trust favorably among competitors, particularly if the proceeds are used to secure high-quality assets or to improve the company's balance sheet.The real estate investment trust (REIT) sector is sensitive to interest rate changes and the timing of this offering may reflect an attempt to preempt any adverse market conditions stemming from rate hikes. The company's strategic use of forward sale agreements could serve as a benchmark for other REITs considering similar capital raising efforts. Legal Expert The offering is conducted under the company's effective shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows for timely capital raising under federal securities laws. The preliminary prospectus supplement, alongside the prospectus, will provide investors with necessary legal disclosures, including risks associated with the forward sale agreements and the potential impact of the underwriters' over-allotment option.Investors and stakeholders should review these legal documents carefully to understand the terms of the offering and the obligations of both the company and the forward purchasers. The forward sale agreements' structure must comply with securities regulations and the conditions under which the forward purchasers or their affiliates may not be required to borrow and sell shares are particularly noteworthy.It is also essential to ensure that the offering adheres to the regulations of each state or jurisdiction involved, as the press release clearly states that the securities will not be sold where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. 03/11/2024 - 04:02 PM PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: EPRT; the “Company”) announced today that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock on a forward basis in connection with the forward sale agreements described below. BofA Securities, Wells Fargo Securities, Truist Securities and Mizuho are acting as the joint book-running managers for the offering. In connection with the offering, the Company expects to enter into forward sale agreements with BofA Securities, Wells Fargo Securities, Truist Securities and Mizuho (or affiliates thereof) (the “forward purchasers”), with respect to 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The underwriters have been granted a 30-day option, exercisable in whole or in part from time to time, to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. If the option to purchase additional shares of the Company’s common stock is exercised, the Company expects to enter into one or more additional forward sale agreements with the forward purchasers in respect of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that are subject to exercise of the option to purchase additional shares. In connection with the forward sale agreements and any additional forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers (or their affiliates) are expected to borrow from third parties and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (or an aggregate of 9,200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full). However, a forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is not required to borrow and sell such shares if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is unable to borrow such shares, or if borrowing costs exceed a specified threshold or if certain specified conditions have not been satisfied. If a forward purchaser (or its affiliate) does not deliver and sell all of the shares of the Company’s common stock to be sold by it to the underwriters, the Company will issue and sell to the underwriters a number of shares of its common stock equal to the number of shares that such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) did not deliver and sell, and the number of shares underlying the relevant forward sale agreement or such additional forward sale agreement will be decreased by the number of shares that the Company issues and sells. Pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreements and any additional forward sale agreements, and subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, the Company intends to issue and sell, upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements and any additional forward sale agreements, an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock (or an aggregate of up to 9,200,000 shares of common stock if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) to the forward purchasers. The Company expects to physically settle the forward sale agreements and any additional forward sale agreements within approximately 12 months from the date of the prospectus supplement relating to the offering. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchasers (or affiliates thereof). The Company intends to contribute any net proceeds from the settlement of the forward sale agreements to the Company’s operating partnership in exchange for OP Units, and the operating partnership intends to use such net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential future investments. All of the shares of common stock will be offered pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). A preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC. When available, a copy of the preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from BofA Securities, Inc., NC1-022-02-25, 201 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28255-0001, Attn: Prospectus Department, Email: dg.prospectus_requests@bofa.com; Wells Fargo Securities, 90 South 7th Street, 5th Floor, Minneapolis, MN 55402, at 800-645-3751 (option #5) or email a request to WFScustomerservice@wellsfargo.com; Truist Securities, Inc. 3333 Peachtree Road NE, 9th Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30326, Attn: Equity Capital Markets or by email at TruistSecurities.prospectus@Truist.com, or Mizuho Securities USA LLC, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10020, Attn: Equity Capital Markets, telephone: 1-212-205-7600 or by emailing US-ECM@mizuhogroup.com, or by visiting the EDGAR database on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov.

(""LDI"" or ""Company"") (NYSE: LDI), the Official Naming Rights partner of the home of the Miami Marlins and the Official Mortgage Provider of the team, has announced the return of its “Runs Scored” program with the Miami Marlins Foundation. For the fourth consecutive year, the organizations are pledging $50 to Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade for every Marlins run scored at loanDepot park. Runs Scored supports the Marlins Nike Jr. RBI little league program, an invitational sports-based youth program designed to promote interest in baseball, softball, academic achievement, and social responsibility in underserved areas of South Florida. “It’s both an honor and a joy to contribute to the strength of the communities where Team loanDepot lives and works,” said loanDepot Chief Administrative Officer TJ Freeborn. “As we enter our fourth season of partnership with the Marlins, we're excited to continue collaborating with the Foundation to create even more opportunities for kids in South Florida. loanDepot park holds a special place in our hearts as our home away from home, and the Boys & Girls Clubs provide a similar sanctuary for kids in the community, which makes Runs Scored all the more special to us.” Funds donated through Runs Scored support the maintenance and growth of teams at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade's Northwest Club in Liberty City. In its inaugural season, the program allowed for the creation of two baseball and softball teams for 30 kids, which has expanded to 40 kids heading into the 2024 spring season. “The game of baseball extends far beyond the field – it provides an incredible way for kids to learn valuable skills around leadership and teamwork that can support their lifelong success,” said Marlins Chief Commercial Officer David Oxfeld. “Despite the pure, timeless nature of the sport, it’s not easily accessible to many kids in underserved areas of the city, and as we work to change this, we’re so grateful to have a partner in loanDepot who shares our passion for the community – and supporting the next generation of Marlins. Come March 28, our fans will have another reason to make some noise in loanDepot park as every Marlin who crosses the plate will rack up more big wins for Boys & Girls Clubs.” loanDepot’s commitment to the South Florida community extends beyond Runs Scored, as the Company also presents the Marlins Salute and Serve Days, which honors active and retired military personnel, veterans, fire rescue personnel, members of the police department and health care professionals by offering complimentary tickets to select Marlins’ home games throughout the season.

The Company aims to develop a customized system for subcutaneous administration in ambulatory infusion centers and hospitals. CEO Linda Tharby expresses excitement for expanding into new therapeutic settings. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The collaboration between KORU Medical Systems and a global pharmaceutical manufacturer to conduct a feasibility study on the Freedom Infusion System represents a strategic move to expand the application of this medical device into new therapeutic areas. The fact that the device is being considered for a rare disease therapy underscores the potential for targeted treatments in niche markets. Moreover, the mention of the system's use in ambulatory infusion centers (AIC) and ambulatory infusion suites (AIS) in the U.S., as well as hospitals in the EU, signals a diversification of the delivery settings for such therapies.From a research perspective, the feasibility study is a critical step in validating the device's effectiveness and safety for a new indication. If successful, the subsequent FDA submission could enhance the device's marketability and therapeutic reach. The adaptation of the Freedom Infusion System for subcutaneous administration of a large volume therapy also aligns with current trends in patient-centric care, potentially improving the quality of life for patients by offering more convenient treatment options outside of traditional hospital settings. Market Research Analyst The announcement by KORU Medical Systems may have a positive influence on its market position and investor sentiment. Entering the rare disease market with a specialized delivery system could open up new revenue streams for the company. Rare diseases, by definition, affect a smaller segment of the population, but the treatments often command higher prices due to the lack of alternatives and the specialized nature of the drugs. This could translate into a high-margin business for KORU Medical if the feasibility study and subsequent FDA clearance are successful.Furthermore, the expansion into AICs and AISs could be seen as an opportunity to capitalize on the growing trend of outpatient care. As healthcare systems worldwide are moving towards cost-effective and patient-friendly treatment options, KORU Medical's move could position it favorably within this evolving landscape. The market will be watching closely for the results of the feasibility study and the FDA submission timeline, as these milestones could significantly impact the company's stock performance and competitive edge. Financial Analyst The financial implications of KORU Medical's announcement are multifaceted. Initially, the costs associated with conducting the feasibility study and developing a customized Freedom System for the rare disease therapy could weigh on the company's short-term financials. However, the long-term prospects of entering a new market with a patented delivery system could be lucrative. It is important to monitor how the company manages its R&D expenses and whether it can secure additional funding or partnerships to mitigate financial risks.The potential FDA clearance within the next 12 months is a key milestone for investors to track. Regulatory approval would not only validate the company's technology but also potentially accelerate its time to market. Given the high stakes of regulatory outcomes, investors should consider the inherent risks and the company's track record in navigating the FDA approval process. The market's response to these developments will be contingent on the perceived probability of success and the expected impact on KORU Medical's revenue growth and profitability. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM MAHWAH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KORU Medical Systems, Inc.

(VRTS) reported preliminary assets under management of $176.1 billion as of February 29, 2024, showing growth from the previous month. The company also serviced $2.6 billion of other fee-earning assets. The assets were distributed across various product types and asset classes, with notable increases in Equity and Institutional Accounts. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported preliminary assets under management (AUM) by Virtus Investment Partners show a month-over-month increase from $171.1 billion to $176.1 billion. This uptick indicates a positive inflow or performance, or a combination of both, which can be an indicator of the company's operational success and could potentially influence investor sentiment. The growth in AUM is a critical metric as it directly correlates to the management fees the company can earn, which are a significant source of revenue for asset managers.Analyzing the distribution of AUM across product types and asset classes, there is a noticeable increase in equity assets, which could suggest a favorable market environment or successful stock selection strategies. The slight decrease in fixed income assets might reflect changes in interest rates or investor preference shifts. The rise in multi-asset and slight decline in alternatives require context; multi-asset growth could signify a demand for diversified risk management solutions, while the dip in alternatives might raise questions about investor appetite for these types of investments. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the dynamics observed in Virtus Investment Partners' AUM composition can provide insights into broader market trends. The increase in open-end funds and retail separate accounts suggests a growing retail investor base or increased retail investor activity. This could reflect broader economic confidence or a shift in consumer investment behavior.Moreover, the increase in institutional accounts AUM is noteworthy as it may indicate institutional trust in Virtus's management capabilities and could signal a competitive edge in attracting institutional capital. It's important to monitor these trends alongside industry benchmarks to evaluate Virtus's performance relative to its peers. Economist The data presented can be indicative of underlying economic trends. For instance, the increase in equity AUM could be reflective of a bullish stock market or investor optimism about economic growth. Conversely, the stable-to-slightly-decreasing fixed income AUM might suggest concerns about interest rate hikes or a search for higher yields in a low-interest environment.The role of multi-asset strategies is becoming increasingly important as investors seek to navigate complex economic conditions. The growth in this area could be a response to increased market volatility or uncertainty, prompting investors to seek out more diversified investment strategies. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

Market Research Analyst A critical analysis of Juniper Networks' positioning in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure reveals strategic implications for the company and its stakeholders. The consistent recognition as a leader indicates a robust product portfolio and a strong market presence. This accolade could potentially influence customer trust and purchasing decisions, which in turn may affect the company's market share and competitive standing.Furthermore, the mention of Juniper's revenue growth, particularly in the AI-Native enterprise solutions sector, is indicative of the company's successful execution of its business strategy. The significant outperformance of market growth rates, as well as the reported customer base expansion across various industry verticals, suggests a solidifying foothold within the industry. These factors are likely to be of interest to investors as they reflect both the company's current financial health and its potential for future growth. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Juniper Networks' announcement of record revenue results for 2023 and its status as the fastest-growing vendor on a full calendar year basis from 2022 to 2023 are key highlights. The nearly 70% year-over-year revenue growth in wired and wireless access products attached to the Mist cloud is a testament to the company's scalability and innovation.Investors should note that sustained revenue growth, particularly in a contracting industry, as reported for Q4, represents a competitive advantage and may lead to upward revisions in future earnings projections. This performance is also likely to influence the company's stock market valuation positively, reflecting investor confidence in Juniper's strategic direction and execution capabilities.

The ability to reduce manual tasks and proactively address networking issues is a significant value proposition that resonates with the current industry trend towards automation and intelligent systems.The integration of indoor location services, which provide additional value-added features, further differentiates Juniper's offerings from competitors.

As Gartner explains, “Magic Quadrants offer visual snapshots, in-depth analyses and actionable advice that provide insight into a market’s direction, maturity and participants. Assessing the market and its technology and service providers is a business-critical task. Vendor differentiation based on variations in operations, customer satisfaction, level of complexity and strategy can make comparisons of vendor offerings challenging. In addition, the market’s overall direction is often evolving. Gartner’s Magic Quadrants solve these problems by offering snapshots of markets and their participants, and help you map vendor strengths and cautions against your current and future needs.” “We believe this latest recognition as a Leader by Gartner reinforces the value our products deliver for our customers,” said Sudheer Matta, Group Vice President, Products for the AI-Native Enterprise, Juniper Networks. “By delivering full-stack automation, insight and self-driving actions, Mist AI continues to stand out from the rest of the industry for fast deployments, the fewest tickets and quickest problem resolution.

The increase was driven by positive markets and net inflows, offset by client redemptions.","Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces Month-End Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton) reported a rise in assets under management (AUM) to $1.62 trillion in February 2024 from $1.60 trillion in January 2024. The increase was driven by positive markets and net inflows, offset by client redemptions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) by Franklin Templeton indicates a positive trend for the company and its investors. A rise from $1.60 trillion to $1.62 trillion, although modest, suggests a healthy inflow of investments and a favorable market condition. In particular, the $5.5 billion in the retirement channel demonstrates robust growth in a segment that is typically considered stable and long-term. However, the $2.0 billion redemption in fixed income by an institutional client could signal concerns about interest rate risk or a shift in investment strategy. This redemption slightly dampens the overall positive AUM growth narrative.From an investment perspective, the distribution of AUM across various asset classes provides insights into the company's diversification. The equity class showing an increase from $550.9 billion to $572.8 billion reflects investor confidence and potentially bullish market conditions. The fixed income slight decrease might be attributed to market volatility or shifts in investor preference towards higher-risk, higher-reward asset classes. The stability in the alternative investments at around $256 billion could be indicative of investors seeking non-correlated assets as a hedge against market volatility.For stakeholders, the short-term benefits include the assurance of growth and potential for increased returns. In the long term, consistent AUM growth could lead to enhanced company performance and stability. However, attention must be paid to the fixed income outflows as they could be symptomatic of underlying market shifts that may require strategic adjustments. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the AUM distribution further, the growth in multi-asset from $160.6 billion to $162.5 billion and the stability of alternative assets suggest a trend towards diversified investment strategies. This diversification can be a defensive maneuver in times of market uncertainty, allowing Franklin Templeton to mitigate risks and capitalize on different market conditions. The cash management segment's decrease from $68.1 billion to $66.3 billion could reflect a strategic deployment of cash into higher-yielding assets, given the current interest rate environment or investor preference for liquidity.In evaluating the industry norms, Franklin Templeton's AUM growth aligns with the broader industry trend where asset managers are benefiting from market rallies and increased investor participation. However, the fixed income outflows may contrast with industry trends if other firms are not experiencing similar redemptions. This could warrant a closer examination of the company's fixed income strategies and performance relative to peers.For investors and market observers, the AUM composition and growth trajectory provide valuable indicators of the company's strategic positioning and risk management capabilities. It is essential to monitor these trends for indications of the company's adaptability to changing market conditions and the potential impact on future performance. Economist The reported AUM figures by Franklin Templeton can also be viewed through an economic lens. The increase in equity AUM may reflect broader economic optimism or a shift in investor sentiment towards seeking capital appreciation in a potentially low-interest-rate environment. This can indicate an economic cycle phase where investors are more willing to take risks. Conversely, the fixed income outflows could suggest concerns about inflation or impending interest rate changes, which typically affect bond prices inversely.It is also worth noting that the AUM figures serve as a barometer for economic health, as asset management firms like Franklin Templeton are often considered indicators of investor confidence and market liquidity. The AUM growth could suggest that the economic environment is conducive to investment, with potential implications for consumer spending, corporate earnings and stock market performance.Overall, the AUM growth is a positive economic indicator but must be balanced against macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and global economic trends that could influence future asset valuations and investor behavior. 03/11/2024 - 04:02 PM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton) (NYSE: BEN) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $1.62 trillion at February 29, 2024, compared to $1.60 trillion at January 31, 2024.

The company aims for net revenue growth of 6% – 12% and AEBITDA growth of 5% – 16% in 2024. Positive Net revenue for Q4 increased 13.9% YoY to $90.4 million. Net loss for Q4 was $9.3 million compared to $7.3 million in the prior year. Constant currency AEBITDA for Q4 increased 89.1% to $24.4 million.

The company had a cash balance of $62.0 million and no borrowings on its $45 million Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023. Ranpak forecasts net revenue growth of 6% – 12% and AEBITDA growth of 5% – 16% in 2024. The company aims to focus on profitability, cash generation, and deleveraging in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net revenue for Ranpak Holdings Corp, particularly the 13.9% year-over-year growth and 10.3% on a constant currency basis, suggests a robust performance in their operational activities. This growth is indicative of a positive market response to their product offerings and may be a result of increased demand for environmentally sustainable packaging solutions, a trend that has been gaining momentum. The financial health of a company can often be gauged by its revenue growth, which in this case, is a strong signal to investors and stakeholders about Ranpak's market position.However, the reported net loss widening from $7.3 million to $9.3 million year over year raises concerns. It is vital to analyze the underlying factors contributing to this loss, such as increased operating expenses, investment in growth, or one-time charges. Stakeholders should consider whether this loss is a temporary setback or indicative of more profound challenges within the company's business model or market conditions.Furthermore, the reduction in net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA from 4.6x is a positive step towards financial stability, suggesting that the company is making progress in managing its debt levels. This is a critical metric for assessing a company's ability to meet its long-term financial obligations. Market Research Analyst Ranpak's strategic focus on e-Commerce and industrial supply chains is particularly relevant given the ongoing growth in online shopping and the need for sustainable packaging solutions. The reported uptick in e-Commerce activity during the holiday season in North America, coupled with improved operating conditions in Europe, aligns with broader market trends and reflects the company's ability to capitalize on these opportunities.The volume increases in product categories such as cushioning and void-fill are consistent with the rise in shipping and packaging demands associated with e-Commerce growth. The company's positioning as a provider of environmentally sustainable solutions is likely to resonate with consumers and businesses increasingly focused on sustainability, which could provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.The emphasis on Automation revenue growth and the establishment of Ranpak as a top-tier end-of-line automation player suggests a strategic pivot towards leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and scalability. This move could potentially open new revenue streams and improve profit margins, provided the execution aligns with market needs and customer adoption rates. Environmental Sustainability Analyst Ranpak's commitment to environmentally sustainable packaging solutions is a significant aspect of its business model that aligns with global sustainability trends. The increase in placement of packaging systems indicates market acceptance of sustainable practices and can be seen as a response to consumer and regulatory pressures for greener packaging options. This strategic positioning not only caters to a growing niche market but also addresses broader environmental concerns, potentially enhancing the company's brand reputation and customer loyalty.Investments in digital and physical infrastructure aimed at supporting sustainable solutions could yield long-term benefits as global markets increasingly prioritize environmental impact in their purchasing decisions. Ranpak's focus on sustainability is not only ethically commendable but also strategically sound, potentially leading to a more resilient and future-proof business model. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Packaging System placement up 1.5% year over year to approximately 141,200 machines at December 31, 2023 Net revenue for the fourth quarter increased 13.9% year over year to $90.4 million and increased 10.3% year over year on a constant currency basis to $93.9 million Net loss for the fourth quarter of $9.3 million compared to net loss of $7.3 million for the prior year period. Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”) for the fourth quarter of $24.4 million up 89.1%, or $11.5 million, year over year CONCORD TOWNSHIP, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ranpak Holdings Corp (NYSE: PACK) (“Ranpak” or “the Company”), a leading provider of environmentally sustainable, systems-based, product protection solutions for e-Commerce and industrial supply chains, today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Omar Asali, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as Ranpak finished the year on a positive note and built on the volume improvement momentum which began in the third quarter of 2023. Net revenue for the quarter increased 10.3% year over year on a constant currency basis to $93.9 million, driven by growth in both North America and Europe/APAC. We saw continued general improvement in the operating environment in Europe in the quarter and a more pronounced e-Commerce holiday season uptick in North America. Volumes overall increased 10% compared to the prior year and finished positive for the year after a slower start. In addition to our improved top-line performance, we experienced our most profitable quarter of the year as better volumes and more favorable input costs drove an Adjusted EBITDA increase of 89.1% to $24.4 million on a constant currency basis. Overall, we continued to claw back our targeted gross margin throughout the year and are encouraged by the volume improvement we began to see in the second half of the year. The fourth quarter shows the power of the model when a sufficient amount of volumes are flowing through the complex and we are committed to building on our finish to the year to have a much improved 2024.” “We have been working towards bringing our key initiatives to drive top-line growth to fruition and made solid progress executing in this area. Strategic account activity in PPS in North America will begin to be felt in the second quarter and we believe Automation revenue growth will step up this year driven by inroads we have made in the industry by building our reputation as a top-tier end of line Automation player. We made substantial investments in our digital and physical infrastructure as well as our product portfolio over the past couple of years, and believe 2024 is the first year where we are able to focus on volumes, profitability, and deleveraging rather than additional investment. We finished 2023 at 4.6x net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis which is a full turn below our recent peak in Q2, and are committed to moving further down the path towards less than 3.0x leverage.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Packaging systems placement increased 1.5% year over year, to approximately 141,200 machines as of December 31, 2023 Net revenue increased 13.9% and increased 10.3% adjusting for constant currency Net loss of $9.3 million compared to net loss of $7.3 million Constant currency AEBITDA1 of $24.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 is up 89.1% Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million compared to net revenue of $79.4 million in 2022, an increase of $11.0 million or 13.9%. Net revenue was positively impacted by increases in cushioning, void-fill, wrapping, and other revenue. Revenue from our cushioning and void-fill product categories continued to improve quarter over quarter on a consolidated basis driven by increased utilization of packaging systems by end users, driven by the holiday season and improved operating environment. Cushioning increased $2.8 million, or 8.5%, to $35.9 million from $33.1 million; void-fill increased $5.2 million, or 15.7%, to $38.4 million from $33.2 million; wrapping increased $0.5 million, or 5.2%, to $10.2 million from $9.7 million; and other sales increased $2.5 million, or 73.5%, to $5.9 million from $3.4 million, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Other net revenue includes automated box sizing equipment and non-paper revenue from packaging systems installed in the field, such as systems accessories. ___________________ 1 Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Data” in this press release for an explanation and related reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures and further discussion related to certain other non-GAAP metrics included in this press release. The increase in net revenue is quantified by an increase in the volume of our paper consumable products of approximately 10.4% and a 2.2% increase in sales of automated box sizing equipment, partially offset by a 2.1% decrease in the price or mix of our paper consumable products. Constant currency net revenue was $93.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an $8.8 million, or 10.3%, increase from constant currency net revenue of $85.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net revenue in North America for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $39.1 million compared to $36.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase of $3.0 million, or 8.3%, was attributable to increases in cushioning sales of $0.3 million, void-fill sales of $1.7 million, and other sales of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in wrapping sales of $0.4 million. Net revenue in Europe/Asia for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $51.3 million compared to $43.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase of $8.0 million, or 18.5%, was driven by increases in cushioning sales of $2.5 million, void-fill sales of $3.5 million, wrapping sales of $0.9 million, and other sales of $1.1 million, as well as favorable currency exchange rates of the Euro to the U.S. dollar. Constant currency net revenue in Europe/Asia was $54.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a $5.8 million, or 11.8%, increase from constant currency net revenue of $49.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Highlights Net revenue increased 3.0% and increased 1.4% adjusting for constant currency Net loss of $27.1 million compared to net loss of $41.4 million Constant currency AEBITDA of $76.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 is up 14.5% Balance Sheet and Liquidity Ranpak completed the fourth quarter of 2023 with a strong liquidity position, including a cash balance of $62.0 million and no borrowings on its $45 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in June 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $250.0 million of USD-denominated term loans and €134.0 million of euro-denominated term loans outstanding under its First Lien Term Loan facilities, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA net leverage ratio of 4.6x based on results on a constant currency basis through the fourth quarter of 2023. The First Lien Term Loan facilities mature in June 2026. The following table presents Ranpak’s installed base of protective packaging systems by product line as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change % Change PPS Systems (in thousands) Cushioning machines 34.8 35.3 (0.5 ) (1.4 ) Void-Fill machines 83.7 81.6 2.1 2.6 Wrapping machines 22.7 22.2 0.5 2.3 Total 141.2 139.1 2.1 1.5 Outlook for 2024 On a constant currency basis, we are forecasting net revenue growth in the area of 6% – 12% and AEBITDA growth of 5% – 16%, which results in a range of $370 – $390 million in constant currency net revenue and $80 – $89 million for AEBITDA on a constant currency basis. Our outlook reflects our expectation of a continuing but somewhat uneven return to a more normal operating environment as e-Commerce buying patterns normalize and strategic account activity ramps up, while industrial activity remains slower. Our expected growth in Adjusted EBITDA reflects expected strong top-line growth and a steady margin profile that is consistent with the second half of 2023. Our focus for 2024 is to grow volumes in PPS, scale Automation, and focus on profitability and cash generation to de-lever. We made tremendous investments in facilities, technology, products, and people over the past few years. We have now transitioned to a new phase in Ranpak focused on achieving strong returns on these investments.

We have included EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our primary business operations. However, EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; constant currency AEBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA do not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; constant currency AEBITDA does not take into account any restructuring and integration costs; constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA are presented on a constant currency basis and give effect to the impact of currency fluctuations; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA — EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: benefit from (provision for) income taxes; interest expense; and depreciation and amortization. Constant currency EBITDA — Constant currency EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we present on a constant currency basis and we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: benefit from (provision for) income taxes; interest expense; and depreciation and amortization. Constant currency AEBITDA — Constant currency AEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we present on a constant currency basis and calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: benefit from (provision for) income taxes; interest expense; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items; as further adjusted to reflect the performance of the business on a constant currency basis. We present constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA on a constant currency basis because it allows a better insight into the performance of our businesses that operate in currencies other than our reporting currency. Before consolidation, our Europe/Asia financial data is derived in Euros. To calculate the adjustment that we apply to present constant currency EBITDA and constant currency AEBITDA on a constant currency basis, we multiply this Euro-derived data by 1.15 to reflect an exchange rate of 1 Euro to 1.15 U.S. dollars (“USD”), which we believe is a reasonable exchange rate to use to give a stable depiction of the business without currency fluctuations between periods, to calculate Europe/Asia data in constant currency USD. We believe that using an exchange rate of 1.15 is reasonable because it approximates the average exchange rate of the Euro to USD over the past five years. In addition, we include certain other unaudited, non-GAAP constant currency data for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. This data is based on our historical financial statements, adjusted (where applicable) to reflect a constant currency presentation between periods for the convenience of readers. We reconcile this data to our GAAP data for the same period for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. This press release also includes forecasts for certain non-GAAP metrics. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forecast of net revenue on a constant currency basis for 2023 to a forecast of net revenue on a GAAP basis without unreasonable effort primarily because we are unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the associated currency impact. In addition, a reconciliation of our forecast for constant currency AEBITDA for 2023 to GAAP net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because we are unable to forecast with reasonable certainty several of the items necessary to calculate such comparable GAAP measure, including asset impairments, integration related expenses, reorganizations and discontinued operations related expenses, legal settlement costs, constant currency adjustments, as well as other unusual or non-recurring gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe the inherent uncertainties in reconciling such non-GAAP measures for projected periods to the most comparable GAAP measures would make the forecasted comparable GAAP measures difficult to predict with reasonable certainty or reliability.

Bowman is focused on optimizing resource utilization and integrating acquired organizations into a common culture. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Bowman Consulting Group Ltd. indicates a robust growth trajectory with a 30% year-over-year increase in net service billing and a 31% compound annual growth rate since 2020. This growth is significant as it surpasses the organic growth rates typically seen in the engineering and infrastructure services industry. Investors may view the company's ability to consistently increase revenue as a positive indicator of operational efficiency and market penetration.Moreover, the company's strategy of expanding through acquisitions, as evidenced by the 11 acquisitions contributing to $60 million in annualized net service billing, suggests an aggressive approach to scaling operations. This could potentially enhance the company's competitive edge by broadening its service offerings and geographic reach. However, investors should be cautious of the integration risks associated with mergers and acquisitions, including cultural assimilation and potential disruptions in operations. Market Research Analyst Bowman's focus on becoming one of the top 50 domestic engineering firms reflects its ambition in a fragmented market. The introduction of adjacent service offerings and leading-edge geospatial solutions could cater to the evolving needs of clients and may increase the firm's market share. The healthy pipeline of opportunities and the leverage of significant public funding for infrastructure projects suggest a favorable demand environment for Bowman's services.However, it's important to consider the cyclical nature of the infrastructure sector and the impact of economic cycles on project funding and execution. The company's optimism should be weighed against potential macroeconomic risks that could affect public and private spending on infrastructure. Economist The significant public funding available for infrastructure projects mentioned by Bowman's CEO underscores the current government focus on improving national infrastructure. This can be a key driver for the engineering and infrastructure services sector, potentially leading to increased demand for companies like Bowman. The firm's strategic positioning to capitalize on this trend through acquisitions and service diversification could yield positive returns in an environment where infrastructure spending is prioritized.However, the reliance on public funding introduces a degree of uncertainty tied to political and budgetary constraints. Shifts in policy or economic downturns could alter the landscape significantly. Therefore, the company's future performance may be influenced by factors beyond its control, which stakeholders should monitor closely. 03/11/2024 - 04:05 PM RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bowman Consulting Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: BWMN) (“Bowman” or the “Company”), a national engineering and infrastructure services firm supporting owners and developers of the built environment, today released financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “This past year we surpassed $300 million in net service billing representing nearly 30% year-over-year growth and approximately 31% compound annual growth since 2020, the year before our May 2021 initial public offering,” said Gary Bowman, Chairman and CEO of Bowman. “We remain focused on becoming one of the 50 largest domestic engineering firms and are continually working to optimize the utilization of our resources as we advance toward this goal. Our pipeline of opportunities, including both new and existing customer assignments and prospective acquisitions, is healthy, and the significant public funding available for infrastructure projects provides a positive outlook for the future.” “During 2023 we completed 11 acquisitions representing approximately $60 million in annualized net service billing,” continued Bowman. “We added new customers and grew our relationships with existing customers while expanding our geographic footprint and increasing our ability to gain both market-share and wallet-share through the introduction of adjacent service offerings and leading-edge geospatial solutions. We remain committed to our fully integrated operating model as we continue to weave together a diverse mix of acquired organizations into one common culture. We are confident about our long-term prospects and believe our approach to growth will continue to deliver shareholder value.” Financial highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022: Gross contract revenue of $93.0 million, compared to $75.6 million, a 23% increase Year-over-year organic gross contract revenue growth1 of 6% Net service billing2 of $80.5 million, compared to $66.2 million, a 22% increase Year-over-year organic net service billing growth of 4% Net loss of $7.7 million, compared to net income of $0.5 million Adjusted EBITDA2 of $11.2 million, compared to $9.4 million, a 19% increase Adjusted EBITDA margin, net 2 of 14.0% compared to 14.2%, a 20 bps decrease Gross backlog2 of $306 million, compared to $243 million, a 26% increase Financial highlights for fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022: Gross contract revenue of $346.3 million, compared to $261.7 million, a 32% increase Year-over-year organic gross contract revenue growth1 of 21% Net service billing2 of $304.0 million, compared to $235.2 million, a 29% increase Year-over-year organic net service billing growth of 18% Net loss of $6.6 million, compared to a net income of $5.0 million Adjusted EBITDA2 of $47.0 million, compared to $34.0 million, a 38% increase Adjusted EBITDA margin, net 2 of 15.5% compared to 14.5%, a 100 bps increase Impact of IRC Section 174 Research & Development Tax Expense Deductibility The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) drastically altered IRC Section 174 and the treatment of Research and Experimental (“R&E”) expenditures for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Prior to this alteration, under IRC Sec. 174 businesses were permitted to deduct the full amount of R&E expenditures as an expense in the taxable year in which they were incurred. As amended, IRC Sec. 174 eliminated the ability for U.S. businesses to deduct their R&E expenditures as an expense, instead requiring businesses to capitalize these expenses and amortize them over a period of five years resulting in acceleration of tax remittance. The Company maintains an uncertain tax position (“UTP”) with respect to its position that its R&E expenses are not subject to the altered IRC Sec. 174 treatment based on specific facts and circumstances. The Company’s tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and full-year 2023 include a $4.6 million accrual relating to the UTP and the Company is carrying approximately $38 million of associated deferred tax assets. On January 31, 2024, the US House of Representatives passed HR 7024, the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024, on a bi-partisan basis, which, among other things, restores U.S. taxpayers’ ability to deduct currently, and retroactively, domestic R&E costs paid or incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2026. If HR 7024 is adopted by the U.S. Senate and the President, the Company would reverse its UTP related liability, tax expense and deferred tax assets. Activity Under Stock Repurchase Program: In November 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (""2022 Stock Repurchase Program"") to repurchase up to $10.0 million of the Company’s common stock. As previously disclosed, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 the Company repurchased a total of 28,704 shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.94. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program expired on November 10, 2023. On November 17, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $10.0 million repurchase program (""2023 Stock Repurchase Program""). As of March 11, 2024, the Company has $10.0 million remaining under the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program. Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share: In connection with the release of financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company introduced the new non-GAAP financial metric of adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”). To calculate Adjusted EPS, the Company adds back non-reoccurring expenses specific to acquisitions, non-cash stock compensation expense associated with pre-IPO grants, and other expenses not in the ordinary course of business. With respect to the elimination of any non-cash stock compensation expense, the Company computes an adjusted tax expense or benefit which accounts for the elimination of any periodic windfall or shortfall tax effects resulting from the difference between grant date fair value and vest date value. With respect to all other eliminations, the Company applies its average marginal statutory tax rate, currently 25.6%, to derive the tax adjustment associated with the elimination of these expenses. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS, both basic and diluted, is included with this press release for reference. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022: Basic Adjusted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.44 Diluted Adjusted EPS was $0.31 compared to $0.41 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022: Basic Adjusted EPS was $1.12 compared to $1.46 Diluted Adjusted EPS was $1.03 compared to $1.36 Updating FY 2024 Guidance The Company is adjusting its full year 2024 outlook for net service billing2 to be in the range of $363 to $378 million and Adjusted EBITDA2 in the range of $59 to $65 million. The current outlook for 2024 is based on completed acquisitions as of the date of this release and does not include contributions from any future acquisitions. Management discusses the Company’s acquisition pipeline and its prospective impact during regularly scheduled earnings calls. “Our 2024 forecast assumes uneven growth in net service billing from first to third quarter with an accommodation for a modest seasonal impact during the fourth quarter,” said Bruce Labovitz, Chief Financial Officer at Bowman. “Generally speaking, we have found that it can take acquisitions a couple of months to return to normal net service billing levels due to the unusual demands of immediate post-closing integration. We reiterate that when acquisitions are added to guidance, we include a pro-rated amount of announced annualized net service billing run rate that is based on the timing of closing and anticipated integration related revenue disruptions.” Q4 2023 Earnings Webcast Bowman will host an earnings webcast to discuss the results of the quarter as follows: Date: March 12, 2024 Time: 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time Hosts: Gary Bowman, Chairman and CEO and Bruce Labovitz, Chief Financial Officer Where: http://investors.bowman.com 1 Includes reclassification of 2022 Q4 acquisitions as organic revenue. 2 Non-GAAP financial metrics the Company believes offer valuable perspective on results of operations.

The company specializes in military and industrial power supplies/transformers.,"Espey Increases and Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend of $0.175 Per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. (ESP) announces a 16% increase in quarterly dividend to $0.175 per share. The company specializes in military and industrial power supplies/transformers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. regarding the increase in its quarterly dividend by 16% is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and management's confidence in its cash flow stability. Dividends are typically distributed from earnings and the ability to increase them suggests that Espey has a robust profit margin and a solid balance sheet. Investors often view such increases as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable impact on the company's stock price due to perceived shareholder value enhancement.However, it is crucial to consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. If the ratio is too high, it might indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough in its growth, which could be a concern for future earnings potential. Conversely, a moderate increase aligned with earnings growth can be seen as sustainable. Stakeholders should analyze this dividend increase in the context of Espey's earnings reports and future earnings guidance to assess the long-term sustainability of this policy. Market Research Analyst Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp.'s decision to increase its dividend is also reflective of its competitive positioning within the specialized military and industrial power supplies/transformers sector. A dividend increase can be a strategic move to attract income-focused investors, particularly in an industry that may have a limited number of players due to the specialized nature of its products. The increase could signify that Espey is outperforming its peers or at least maintaining a competitive edge.Moreover, the company's specific focus on military and industrial applications may provide a certain level of resilience against economic downturns, as these sectors often have long-term contracts and stable demand. This aspect could contribute to investors' confidence in the company's ability to maintain and grow its dividends in the future. Market participants should consider industry trends, such as defense spending budgets and industrial production indices, to contextualize Espey's performance relative to the broader market. 03/11/2024 - 02:00 PM SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp.

The SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve demonstrated lower rates of paravalvular leak, improved gradients, and larger effective orifice areas compared to previous versions. The data were published in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions, highlighting significant advancements in TAVR technology. Positive None. Negative None. Cardiologist From a clinical perspective, the Edwards SAPIEN valve platform's latest study showcases a significant advancement in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis—a condition characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve opening. The findings indicating lower rates of paravalvular leak (PVL) and improved hemodynamic performance with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve are noteworthy. PVL is a common complication post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which can lead to heart failure and increased mortality. Therefore, any reduction in PVL rates can have a substantial impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, the larger effective orifice areas and lower echo-derived gradients signify improved blood flow and less strain on the heart, which could potentially translate into better long-term cardiac function and patient quality of life. Medical Device Analyst From an industry standpoint, the results presented by Edwards Lifesciences have significant implications for the medical device market. The TAVR sector is highly competitive and innovations that offer superior clinical outcomes can lead to increased market share and revenue growth for the company. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve's enhanced features could set a new benchmark for TAVR devices, potentially influencing purchasing decisions of healthcare providers and the recommendations of cardiologists. The real-world data, demonstrating comparable outcomes across different valve sizes, also reinforces the versatility and reliability of the Edwards SAPIEN TAVR platform. This can be a strong selling point, as it may reduce the need for hospitals to stock multiple TAVR systems, thereby streamlining inventory management and potentially reducing costs. Healthcare Economist Examining the economic implications, the advancements in TAVR technology could lead to a shift in the treatment paradigm for aortic stenosis, with potential cost savings for healthcare systems. Improved patient outcomes, such as reduced rates of PVL and the need for fewer reinterventions, can decrease the overall cost burden of managing complications and long-term care. Furthermore, the longer-lasting valve performance suggested by these studies could reduce the frequency of valve replacements over a patient's lifetime, leading to a decrease in repeat procedures and associated healthcare expenses. However, it is essential to balance these potential savings against the upfront costs of the new technology and to consider the impact on insurance reimbursement policies and healthcare providers' budgets. 03/11/2024 - 02:00 PM WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW) announced today at Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) 2024 the compelling results from two large, real-world studies based on TVT Registry data that demonstrated continued excellent outcomes for patients treated with the Edwards SAPIEN valve platform. A study of Edwards’ latest TAVR technology, the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve, found lower rates of paravalvular leak (PVL) at 30 days, lower echo-derived gradients and larger effective orifice areas across all valve sizes when compared to the SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra valves. These data were presented yesterday during a podium presentation and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Cardiovascular Interventions. In a second study presented during the late-breaking clinical trials session, small Edwards SAPIEN TAVR valves demonstrated equally excellent outcomes at 3 years as compared to larger SAPIEN TAVR valve sizes. “These real-world data further add to the robust body of evidence on the performance of Edwards SAPIEN TAVR and highlight the meaningful advancements of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve, which provides patients with severe aortic stenosis the leading option for true lifetime management of their heart valve disease,” said Larry Wood, Edwards’ corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart. Real-World Results of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA Valve In a study of real-world evidence of patients from the TVT Registry, researchers compared the outcomes of more than 10,000 patients across more than 800 sites in the United States treated with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve to those receiving SAPIEN 3 Ultra and SAPIEN 3 valves using procedural and hemodynamic data and clinical outcomes for propensity-matched cohorts. The study found that all Edwards TAVR platforms demonstrated excellent PVL results. Notably, there was a statistically significant reduction in PVL for the 29 mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve as compared to the 29 mm SAPIEN 3, with 88.3% of patients exhibiting no PVL and only 10.7% of patients exhibiting mild PVL. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve was also associated with significantly lower echocardiography-derived mean gradients and larger effective orifice areas across all four valve sizes with low rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, all stroke, life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications, and permanent pacemaker implantation in-hospital or at 30 days. Late-Breaking Clinical Results Comparing Small Edwards TAVR Valves to Larger Valves An analysis of 8,100 propensity matched patients across more than 800 sites in the United States found that patients treated with a 20mm Edwards SAPIEN valve demonstrated excellent all-cause mortality and stroke outcomes at 3-years, equivalent to those receiving 23, 26 and 29mm SAPIEN valve sizes. Among mortality indicators, researchers concluded that while PVL and new permanent pacemaker implantation were both associated with increased mortality, the relationship between post-procedural echo-derived mean gradients and clinical outcomes is nonlinear and more complex. “This examination of these real-world data gives us important insights into the actual performance of small Edwards valves and reaffirms the excellent outcomes for patients receiving SAPIEN TAVR, regardless of valve size,” said Amr Abbas, MD, Professor of Medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Director of Structural Heart at Corewell Health East, William Beaumont University Hospital and principal investigator in the small SAPIEN valve study.

New state-of-the-art facility in Phoenix highlights commitment to quality and excellence. Proprietary technologies and components set new standards in vehicle performance and design. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The launch of Upfit UTV Inc.'s high-performance luxury utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) represents a strategic move to capture the growing market of off-road enthusiasts and luxury consumers. The UTV market has been expanding, with a noticeable shift towards vehicles that offer both performance and comfort. By focusing on a niche segment that desires customization and luxury, Upfit UTV Inc. is positioning itself to cater to a premium customer base willing to pay a higher price for differentiated products.With the backing of Fox Factory Holding Corp., a company known for its performance shocks and suspension products, Upfit UTV Inc. is leveraging its parent company's reputation and expertise. This synergy could provide a competitive advantage in terms of quality and performance, which are critical factors in the luxury UTV segment. Moreover, the commitment to a 30-day upfit turnaround and the support of a nationwide service network suggest a focus on customer experience, which is paramount in the luxury market.However, the long-term success of this venture will likely hinge on the sustained demand for luxury UTVs and the company's ability to maintain its promised quality and performance standards. Additionally, the manufacturing and operational costs associated with producing luxury, high-performance vehicles could impact profit margins. It will be important to monitor customer reception and sales following the launch to gauge the effectiveness of the company's market entry strategy. Financial Analyst The introduction of Upfit UTV Inc.'s luxury UTVs could potentially have a positive impact on Fox Factory Holding Corp.'s revenue streams, diversifying its product portfolio and possibly increasing its market share in the UTV segment. The emphasis on proprietary products and patented technologies, such as clean airdrop and Live Valve® shock tuning upgrades, indicates an attempt to create a unique selling proposition that could justify premium pricing and drive higher margins.Investors should pay close attention to the initial sales figures and market penetration post-launch, as these will be key indicators of the product's acceptance and its contribution to the company's financial health. The state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Phoenix also signifies a significant capital investment, which will likely be reflected in the company's capital expenditures. The return on this investment will be critical to assess in the subsequent financial quarters.It is also worth noting that the UTV market is subject to economic cycles and luxury items typically face greater volatility during economic downturns. Therefore, while the launch may be promising, it is essential to consider the broader economic context and consumer spending patterns when evaluating the potential impact on Fox Factory Holding Corp.'s stock performance. Automotive Industry Analyst The UTV industry is witnessing a trend where consumers are increasingly seeking vehicles that offer not just utility but also an enhanced driving experience with luxury features. Upfit UTV Inc.'s focus on high-performance luxury UTVs aligns with this trend and the introduction of features like frameless doors and magnetic clutch duct for Can-Am Maverick X3 could set new industry standards. Such innovations may raise consumer expectations and push competitors to elevate their offerings, potentially leading to a shift in market dynamics.Moreover, the emphasis on real-world testing and technology differentiation indicates a commitment to reliability and performance, which are crucial in the off-road vehicle space. The ability to offer customized, turn-key solutions also taps into the consumer desire for personalization, which could foster brand loyalty and repeat business. However, the challenge will be to balance the costs of customization with operational efficiency to maintain profitability.The impact of these vehicles on the UTV market will depend on how well Upfit UTV Inc. can communicate the value of its unique features to its target audience and how these features compare to existing offerings. It will also be important to monitor how competitors respond to these market changes and whether they introduce similar features to meet evolving consumer demands. 03/11/2024 - 12:30 PM Upfitting High-Performance Luxury UTVsPHOENIX, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Upfit UTV Inc., a subsidiary of Fox Factory Holding Corp.

(NYSE: AGR) announces the construction of Osagrove Flats, a 153 MW wind farm in La Salle County, Illinois. The project, the company's fifth wind farm in the state, aims to accelerate the clean energy transition, bringing jobs and investment to the local community. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The announcement of Avangrid's new wind farm, Osagrove Flats, marks a significant addition to the renewable energy landscape in Illinois. With a capacity of 153 MW, this project contributes to the growing trend of utility-scale renewable energy projects that are reshaping energy production in the United States. From an energy market perspective, the integration of such a substantial amount of wind energy is likely to influence local energy prices, potentially lowering them due to the increased supply of low marginal cost electricity.Furthermore, the production of over 550,000 MWh annually can be contextualized by considering that the average U.S. household consumes about 10,649 kWh per year. This output could therefore power roughly 51,600 average American homes, underscoring the project's substantial impact on meeting energy needs sustainably. Investors in the energy sector may view this development favorably, as it aligns with global trends towards decarbonization and could enhance Avangrid's reputation as a leader in renewable energy. Financial Analyst Avangrid's expansion into Illinois with the construction of Osagrove Flats represents a strategic investment that could have positive long-term financial implications for the company. The project aligns with investor interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria, which is increasingly important for attracting investment. As renewable energy assets like wind farms often benefit from government incentives and long-term power purchase agreements, they can provide stable and predictable revenue streams.However, the capital expenditure required to build the wind farm must be scrutinized alongside potential returns. The financial health of Avangrid, including its ability to fund the project without over-leveraging, will be an important consideration for stakeholders. The impact on Avangrid's balance sheet and future earnings reports will be closely monitored by investors seeking to understand the project's return on investment and its contribution to the company's overall financial performance. Environmental Policy Expert The construction of Osagrove Flats by Avangrid is emblematic of the broader policy-driven shift towards renewable energy sources in the U.S. It reflects the alignment with state and federal policies that incentivize clean energy production. This project contributes to Illinois' Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) goals, which mandate a certain percentage of energy from renewable sources and can potentially influence other states' energy policies by serving as a model for successful renewable energy integration.On a broader scale, the wind farm's development is consistent with international climate targets, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement. It demonstrates how private sector investments can support public policy objectives in reducing carbon emissions. The environmental benefits, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the conservation of natural resources, are likely to resonate with stakeholders who prioritize sustainability in their investment decisions. 03/11/2024 - 02:31 PM The 153 Megawatt (MW) wind farm, Osagrove Flats, will be built in La Salle County and demonstrates company’s continued investment in Illinois PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avangrid, Inc. (NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and member of the Iberdrola Group, today announced the construction of what will be the company’s fifth wind farm in Illinois. Osagrove Flats, located in La Salle County, will include 34 wind turbines with a total capacity of 153 MW. “Avangrid has a long track record of successfully partnering with Illinois communities to build and operate wind farms, helping accelerate a clean energy transition in the state and across the country,” said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. “We are excited to build on our more than 15-year history in Illinois with Osagrove Flats, which will bring jobs and additional investment to the local community.” The wind farm will produce more than 550,000 MWh of energy in a year, which is the same amount of power used by about 50,000 U.S. homes. Construction at Osagrove Flats is expected to create about 300 jobs. Long-term operations and maintenance will also support several permanent jobs on site. The wind farm is estimated to contribute more than $40 million in property taxes over the life of the project, which directly supports public services like education and fire protection. Avangrid has also worked closely with the surrounding community, providing direct financial support in some cases. For example, the company donated $15,000 to the Village of Dana, located near the project, which it used to maintain ambulance service in the community and renovate the town hall. ""We have developed a tremendous relationship with Avangrid over the past several years and we are thrilled to see the Osagrove Flats wind farm coming to life,"" said Joe Centeno, president of the Village of Dana. ""They have demonstrated time and again that they care about this community, and I look forward to seeing the lasting benefits this project will bring to our village, school district, and township."" Osagrove Flats is located near four other Avangrid wind farms operating in Illinois, including Streator Cayuga Ridge South, Midland, Otter Creek, and Providence Heights. When construction is complete, it will bring Avangrid’s total installed renewable energy capacity in Illinois to nearly 800 MW.

(HMLA) partners with Renovi Recovery SRL to develop a medical tourism resort in the Dominican Republic. Renovi! aims to capture a segment of the growing medical tourism market by offering a unique outpatient rehabilitation experience at an upscale beachfront resort. Positive None. Negative None. 03/11/2024 - 03:02 PM Pittsburgh, PA, March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Himalaya Technologies, Inc. (OTC: HMLA) is pleased to announce it has partnered with Renovi Recovery SRL (“Renovi!”), a real estate development Company based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (“DR”), to finance the development of a medical tourism resort in the #1 tourist destination in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic. Additionally, the Company has appointed Renovi!’s CEO, David Burns, Ph.D., to its Advisory Board to guide its entry into this multi-billion dollar market, assist on mergers and acquisitions including a potential combination of Renovi! with Himalaya, and provide management consulting. Medical Tourism Market and Renovi! Overview Market Research Future® estimates the medical tourism market at over USD $23.0 billion in 2023, growing to USD $121.8 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 21%+. The availability of the newest medical technologies and the cheaper cost of treatment in emerging nations are key market drivers enhancing market growth. Renovi! is positioned to capture a key segment of this market by targeting U.S. patients aged 50 and older who suffer from chronic illness and have an urgent need for medical rehabilitation and recovery. Like other outpatient rehabilitation options, Renovi! provides physical therapy, behavior and lifestyle change, nutrition and weight loss, therapy and non-pharma multi-mode pain management. The problem with traditional outpatient rehabilitation is that patients live at home during treatment, often in the same unhealthy living conditions that contributed to illness in the first place - poor diet, lack of exercise, insomnia, noise, stress, loneliness, pollution, etc. These unhealthy living conditions reduce treatment effectiveness and interfere with recovery. Renovi! reinvents traditional outpatient rehabilitation by offering patients a “recovery vacation” at an upscale, beachfront medical resort with healthy diet, exercise, community and exceptional medical care. This holistic approach accelerates recovery, improves quality of life and reduces the likelihood of recurrence. Renovi! differentiates itself from competitors by combining outpatient rehabilitation with healthy living in an upscale, beachfront medical resort . And, due to low labor costs in the DR, patients save 40% on outpatient rehabilitation costs compared to the U.S. The Dominican Republic is uniquely positioned as a medical tourism destination because of its low costs, proximity to the U.S., a well-established tourism infrastructure, and tax incentives for tourism investments. The target market consists of 70MM+ U.S. consumers who suffer from chronic illness including heart attack, stroke, diabetes, cancer and chronic pain, as well as consumers who are at risk of chronic illness. These consumers urgently need recovery and prevention, and, for many, recovery and healthy living are quite literally a matter of life and death. Renovi!’s facility will comprise 210,000 square feet of construction including a 180-room medical resort, a 10,000 square foot clinic, restaurant, pool, gym, salon, spa, chapel, social area and pharmacy located on 15 acres of beachfront property. The company estimates construction costs of USD $30 million and a total project cost of USD $54 million, of which a substantial portion will be repaid by construction loans and upscale condominium presales. Real estate investors will make their units available for rent on an extended-stay basis through the company’s in-house reservation and property management service. Sources of revenue will include condominium sales, medical rehabilitation services, rental and all-inclusive fees, maintenance fees and incidental revenues from added-value services such as the spa, salon, pharmacy, and tours and excursions. Marketing and sales efforts will support condominium sales, recruit referral and alliance partners, and sell patients suffering from chronic illness on the benefits of a beachfront-resort “recovery vacation”. The company is in the process of acquiring land under an exclusive purchase option from a private owner to be followed by funding of its master plan, permits, design, and infrastructure launch. The Company has formed a SPV in the U.S. to facilitate financing and has a stated goal of selling the resort in the future to pave the way for additional similar projects. Further information on Renovi!’s plan is available at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRMC_ap5o69jd7FAIqIP5OwsFg8a4XLz/view?usp=sharing New Advisory Board Member – David Burns, Ph.D. As part of its move into the medical tourism market, Himalaya has appointed Renovi!’s Founder and CEO, David Burns, Ph.D., to its Advisory Board to spearhead growth of the initial project and potential additional similar resorts in the Caribbean, Latin America, and/or other countries. Dr. Burns brings 25+ years’ experience in senior leadership roles in consulting, B2B software, real estate, international logistics, and supply chain management. As co-founder of three B2B software startups, Dr. Burns brings a track record of success managing and launching world-class products and accelerating revenue growth. In his latest B2B software venture, he and his colleagues grew the Company from $0 to $50 million in annual revenue. Dr. Burns played a key product management and business development role in achieving this goal, with responsibility for products serving 20,000 customers in 20 countries and generating 40% of the Company’s revenue. He completed his B.S. in Mathematics and Economics and earned his Ph.D. in Applied Statistics at the University of Maryland College Park. Dr. Burns resides in New York and in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and his Linked Profile is available @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-burns-b777371/. Management Commentary Said David Burns, Ph.D., Renovi! CEO: “I am passionate about health and wellness and particularly excited to meet the need of patients suffering from chronic illness to recover faster and enhance their quality of life. The importance of exceptional medical care in treating these patients is obvious. However, what’s equally important and often overlooked is the need for a comprehensive, healthy living ecosystem, including healthy diet, exercise and community. Renovi! offers a unique solution to this important need. I am thrilled to work with Himalaya on this project and look forward to telling Renovi!’s story in detail to the investment community.” Said Vik Grover, CEO: “Medical tourism is a vast and rapidly growing market, with secular growth driven by the potential for significant savings on healthcare costs coupled and the expected doubling of the world’s population over the age of 60 during the next decade. We love Dr. Burns’ vision for this medical resort in the top destination of the Caribbean and will work with him and his team to identify institutional funding for the project, a process which commenced two weeks ago. Meanwhile, we will explore using HMLA as a go public vehicle and offering our EVEREST crypto token to finance Renovi! as it moves towards breaking ground this summer.” About Himalaya Technologies, Inc.: Himalaya Technologies, Inc.

Specificity aims to aggressively take to market its industry disrupting tech stack of tools that solve three of the industry's largest challenges representing billions of dollars in wasted ad spend annually. These challenges are widely understood by industry leaders and until now, have been unsuccessfully addressed.This strategic partnership also aims to accelerate the development and deployment of Specificity's groundbreaking AI-driven audience identification solution that will drive even greater efficiency for marketers seeking to maximize the ROI of their ad campaigns.""The entire industry knows that bot traffic, mechanical MAIDs and inaccurate audience data has plagued ad serving platforms for years and the iOS update 14.5 further exasperated an already wasteful approach"", Jason Wood, CEO of Specificity said, ""And now facing the cessation of enhanced CPC and the start of cookie deprecation from Google, we don't have the need to educate marketers and brand managers on the issue because they see it every day and we all know it's only going to get worse. Add to that the fact that we all face a new challenge, the move to a 1st party data world.""Specificity's solution utilizes the only accessible 1st party data graph in existence. Other 1st party data graphs are owned by Big Tech and they either monetize on the waste or sell the data in a very cost prohibitive ""cost per lead"" model.Wood went on to say, ""In a world where 1st party data is crucial, sharing the data with our clients allows their teams to pull smarter levers and drive far better insights and quite frankly, the difference between us and others in this space is that we see those insights as work product owned by the client paying to create them with us and not a mechanism for monetization with competing brands."" AI algorithms have yet to infuse this complexity of data understanding in the audience ID arena and doing so will give Specificity and its clients a huge competitive advantage.Wood commented on the significance of the seed round, stating, ""We wanted to ensure that our technology stack was market-ready before initiating this fundraising round. Now, with proof of concept and successful deployment, we are excited to embark on this next phase of growth.

Bit Brother Limited Plans to Appeal Delisting Determination by Nasdaq Hearing Panel,2024-03-11T18:02:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Bit Brother Limited (BETS) announces its intention to appeal the delisting decision by Nasdaq, citing support from shareholders and emphasizing the negative impact on shareholder interests due to the bullish cryptocurrency market. Shareholders express concerns over the suspension of trading and sharp stock price decline.","Bit Brother Limited Plans to Appeal Delisting Determination by Nasdaq Hearing Panel Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bit Brother Limited (BETS) announces its intention to appeal the delisting decision by Nasdaq, citing support from shareholders and emphasizing the negative impact on shareholder interests due to the bullish cryptocurrency market. Shareholders express concerns over the suspension of trading and sharp stock price decline. Positive None. Negative Delisting decision by Nasdaq impacting shareholder interests Suspension of trading leading to stock price decline Financial Analyst The decision by Nasdaq to delist Bit Brother Limited represents a significant event with potential repercussions for the company's capital structure and investor relations. Delisting typically leads to reduced liquidity and investor base, as many institutional investors are precluded from holding shares of companies not listed on a major exchange. Moreover, the delisting process often results in a decline in share price due to a negative perception and the subsequent decrease in demand. The company's intention to appeal is a critical step that could mitigate these effects if successful.However, the timing of the delisting amidst a bullish cryptocurrency market can exacerbate the impact on shareholders. Given the company's focus on digital currency operations, the current market trend could have provided a favorable environment for growth and potentially enhanced shareholder value. The delisting could therefore be seen as curtailing the potential gains during this period.Furthermore, the suspension of trading on Nasdaq and the inability for shareholders to trade on OTC markets may have precipitated a sharp decline in the stock price, leading to significant losses for shareholders. The appeal process, while offering a glimmer of hope, also introduces uncertainty. Investors will likely monitor the situation closely, as the outcome of the appeal will have important implications for the company's future trading venues and stock performance. Legal Expert The appeal against Nasdaq's delisting decision is a legal procedure that requires careful navigation of regulatory frameworks and the presentation of a compelling case that the company meets the exchange's listing requirements. The grounds for delisting can range from non-compliance with financial reporting, governance standards, to minimum share price thresholds. The company's argument that its financing activities have not harmed shareholder interests must be substantiated with evidence that it meets all of Nasdaq's quantitative and qualitative listing standards.It is important to note that the appeal process can be protracted and there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome. During this time, the company must maintain transparent communication with its shareholders and the market. Should the appeal fail, Bit Brother Limited may face further challenges in accessing capital and maintaining shareholder confidence.Additionally, the company's call for shareholder support and opinions could be indicative of a strategy to demonstrate to Nasdaq the level of shareholder backing as part of their appeal. This could be a double-edged sword, as mobilizing shareholder sentiment may strengthen the company's case but also raise expectations and pressure for a successful appeal. Market Research Analyst The cryptocurrency market's current bullish trend represents a macroeconomic factor that can influence a company's performance, especially for firms like Bit Brother Limited that are directly involved in digital currency operations. The positive market sentiment can drive increased activity and investment in related companies, which can lead to higher revenues and profitability. However, the delisting from Nasdaq places the company at a disadvantage by potentially limiting exposure to a broader investor base and restricting the ability to capitalize on the favorable market conditions.Investor anticipation of growth in the cryptocurrency sector suggests that there may be underlying confidence in the company's core business model and future prospects. However, this must be weighed against the tangible implications of the delisting, which can affect the company's stock visibility and credibility. The delisting could also impact the company's strategic partnerships, as other firms may be cautious in associating with a company that does not meet the listing requirements of a major stock exchange.The appeal process represents a critical juncture for Bit Brother Limited. The outcome will likely influence investor perception and could either restore confidence or further erode shareholder trust, depending on the decision rendered by Nasdaq's Hearing Panel. 03/11/2024 - 02:02 PM CHANGSHA, China, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Brother Limited (""Bit Brother, "" ""We"" or the ""Company"") (OTC Pink: BETSF), today announced its intention to appeal the recent delisting decision issued by the Hearing Panel of Nasdaq Stock Market (""Nasdaq""). We have recently received correspondence from shareholders across the globe who indicted that that they believe BETSF's recent financing activities have not harmed their interests. And it is with their support that we will be submitting our appeal. As the cryptocurrency market experiences a bullish trend, BETSF remains focused on our digital currency operations, and shareholders are eagerly anticipating the company's growth in this thriving market. It is precisely during this opportune moment in the cryptocurrency market that Nasdaq's decision to delist BETSF should be considered as detrimental to shareholder interests. The timing of this Panel's decision is particularly unfortunate as shareholders expect significant returns from the company's operations in the cryptocurrency sector. We were told on the social media platform that since the trading of our Class A ordinary shares was suspended on Nasdaq since March 7 many of our shareholders were unable to trade on OTC. They told us they could only sell shares and suffered a huge loss when the stock price fell sharply. We intend to submit our appeal to Nasdaq no later than March 20, 2024. During this process, we sincerely invite all shareholders who share our concerns to stand with us，shareholders please email us with your valuable opinion at IR@bitbrother.com.

SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intel (Nasdaq: INTC): This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240311946286/en/Developed by Intel Granulate and contributed to the open source community, Continuous Profiler combines multiple profilers into one view as a flame graph. This unified view offers developers, performance engineers and DevOps a continuous and autonomous way to identify runtime inefficiencies. (Credit: Intel Corporation) What’s New: Intel today announced the release of Continuous Profiler to open source – serving as an example of the company’s open ecosystem approach to catalyze innovation and boost productivity for developers. The optimization agent is actively used by companies including ironSource, ShareChat and Snap Inc. to identify production bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Developed by Intel® Granulate™ and contributed to the open source community, Continuous Profiler is a solution that combines multiple profilers into one view as a flame graph. This unified view offers developers, performance engineers and DevOps a continuous and autonomous way to identify runtime inefficiencies. “Continuous Profiler has been at the heart of what we’ve been doing at Intel Granulate. By helping developers identify bottlenecks in the code, businesses can optimize their applications more easily and effectively.” –Asaf Ezra, general manager of Intel Granulate Why It Matters: Determining why central processing units (CPUs) are busy is a routine task for performance analysis in any testing and production environment. Continuous Profiler delivers a flame graph of the hottest code paths. “This visualized view makes it immediately obvious where CPU is consumed so you can find cost savings, eliminate bottlenecks, improve throughput, and reduce latency and performance regressions,” said Brendan Gregg, Intel Fellow. “In today's complex environment, however, flame graphs can unearth so many performance wins that it becomes laborious to apply them all. Intel Granulate automates this task, allowing companies to realize these performance wins now and in the future as Intel develops more optimizations.” How It Works: The evolution of gProfiler, Continuous Profiler combines multiple sampling profilers to produce a unified visualization of what a CPU is spending time on. Easy-to-navigate flame graphs pinpoint performance regressions, such as garbage collection, deadlocks and others to help smooth deployments. Among its unique features, Continuous Profiler allows DevOps to filter services based on container name, hostname or Kubernetes deployment object by simply selecting the resolution level within the platform. These native Kubernetes filters profile down from the deployment to pod level without having to deploy a profiler for each object. This allows teams to investigate the behavior of different deployments, pods, nodes and hosts across different regions and code. The profiler is compatible with Intel Granulate’s continuous optimization services and can be deployed cluster-wide within minutes, supporting a range of programming languages without requiring code changes. Continuous Profiler is SOC2-certified and held to Intel's high security standards, ensuring reliability and trust in its deployment. What’s Next: With a simple user interface (UI) and seamless integration, Continuous Profiler will add modifications to meet unique developer needs, uncover bottlenecks on the runtime level and boost application performance for improved user experiences. Together with open source contributors and the broader ecosystem, Intel will further refine the tool and help developers make applications faster, stronger and more cost-efficient.
