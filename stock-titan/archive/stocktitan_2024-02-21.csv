This follows the success of their first product, FAZE POP, which became the top-selling new energy drink in 7-Elevens nationwide in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of FAZE UP by FaZe Holdings, Inc. and GHOST represents a strategic move to capitalize on the growing energy drink market, which is expected to reach USD 86.01 billion by 2026 according to a report by Fortune Business Insights. The prior success of FAZE POP, which became the leading new energy drink at 7-Eleven, underscores the efficacy of leveraging popular culture and nostalgia in product marketing. The choice of a nostalgic citrus soda flavor may tap into the millennial demographic's preferences, potentially driving sales and increasing market share.Furthermore, the exclusive partnership with 7-Eleven for the launch can be seen as a targeted distribution strategy that could ensure high visibility and accessibility for consumers. The collaboration with a well-known gaming organization like FaZe Clan also aligns with the trend of lifestyle branding in the sports nutrition and energy drink industry, which could foster brand loyalty and create a unique product identity that resonates with the target audience. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the success of FAZE POP and the subsequent launch of FAZE UP may have positive implications for FaZe Holdings' stock performance (NASDAQ:FAZE). The company's ability to innovate and capture market trends can be a strong indicator for investors assessing growth potential. The energy drink sector's high margins and the partnership with a retailer like 7-Eleven could contribute to an improved bottom line.Investors will likely monitor the sales data post-launch to gauge the product's impact on the company's revenue. It is also important to consider the marketing and promotional costs associated with the launch, as these could affect the short-term profitability but may be justified if they lead to long-term brand establishment and customer acquisition. Consumer Behavior Analyst Analyzing consumer behavior, the appeal to nostalgia with FAZE UP is a noteworthy strategy. Nostalgia marketing has been shown to evoke emotional connections and can be particularly effective in a crowded market. By combining the nostalgic element with the modern energy drink trend, FaZe Holdings and GHOST are likely aiming to differentiate their product and create a strong emotional appeal.Additionally, the involvement in gaming culture through the association with FaZe Clan could influence consumer preferences, especially among younger demographics who are avid gamers and have a higher consumption rate of energy drinks. The effectiveness of these strategies will be reflected in the consumer adoption rate and brand engagement on social media platforms, which are key indicators of market reception. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM NEW FLAVOR FOLLOWS SUCCESSFUL FIRST PRODUCT LAUNCH OF ""FAZE POPTM"" - THE NO. 1 SELLING NEW ENERGY DRINK IN 7-ELEVENS NATIONWIDE IN 2023LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Today, FaZe Holdings, Inc.

Higher revenues, metallurgical recoveries, and concentrate grades were achieved. The CEO and President express optimism for future progress and revenue diversification. Positive None. Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Luca Mining Corp. (""Luca"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: LUCA) (OTCQX: LUCMF) (Frankfurt: Z68) is pleased to provide an update on the optimization program at its wholly-owned Campo Morado polymetallic mine in Guererro, Mexico. Significantly improved overall performance in Q4 2023 compared to previous quarters, yielding increased revenues.Plant performance exceeded expectations with operational consistency.Higher metallurgical recoveries and concentrate grades. Of note, copper in the bulk concentrate increased from less than 48% recovery to over 70% recovery.Mike Struthers, CEO, commented, ""The results we're achieving at Campo Morado are better than expectations, and it's extremely encouraging to see we can consistently maintain this performance week after week. The new regime of blending ore types from the mine is proving very successful by providing consistent feed to the plant and we expect this to continue to trend upwards during the year."" Ramon Perez, President, commented, ""The dedication and hard work of our team and our consultants Ausenco over the past four months are yielding tangible results. While we acknowledge this achievement, we remain committed to further enhancing the mine's performance and diversifying our revenue streams, particularly through a clean copper-lead separation. We anticipate sharing further positive updates on the progress of both Campo Morado and the Tahuehueto mine with the market in the very near future."" SummaryThe optimization program, known as the Campo Morado Improvement Project (""CMIP""), was formulated in Q4 2023 with the aim of significantly improving operational performance with a comprehensive strategy between the mine and mill. Key features of the program include effective mine-to-mill planning, new procedures for ore blending, increased metallurgical test work, optimized grinding and reagent dosing for improved recoveries, and phased equipment upgrades for mine and mill. The results to date have been excellent, and include higher metallurgical recoveries and concentrate grades, especially for copper in the bulk concentrate, which are reflected in increased revenues. Plant performance in Q4 2023 met or exceeded expectations, particularly in the bulk circuit where copper recovery increased from less than 48% to over 70%. Most notably, the operation increased copper recovery dramatically, by over 20%, whilst improving concentrate grades to over 14%. Additional equipment was added to the mine to improve operational consistency, and in the plant a number of initiatives were completed, including adjusted reagent dosing schemes, and upgraded process control instrumentation. Currently the operation produces a zinc concentrate, and a mixed (bulk) copper-lead concentrate. Metallurgical test work at the ALS laboratories in Canada continues, with the goal to achieve a clean copper-lead separation, thereby producing three saleable concentrates (zinc, copper, lead) resulting in much improved revenues. Mike Struthers, commented, ""The progressive investments in plant improvements will continue over the coming months. This is an exciting year for the operations and the Company.""

(NYSE/TSX: SII) (“Sprott” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management commentary ""In 2023, Sprott's Assets Under Management (""AUM"") increased by $5.3 billion (23%) to $28.7 billion driven largely by strong uranium prices and inflows to our exchange listed products. Much of this growth came late in the fourth quarter and is already positively contributing to our 2024 performance,"" said Whitney George, Chief Executive Officer of Sprott. ""The success of our uranium strategies has been a bright spot for Sprott clients and shareholders as they have grown to account for approximately 28% of our total AUM. During the year, we also expanded our critical materials product offerings with the launch of seven new ETFs in this rapidly growing category. Precious metals markets were relatively quiet in 2023, though gold still gained 13% on the year, despite high real interest rates.” ""Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders in 2024. We have a strong pipeline of new products and a growing reputation as a trusted partner in our areas of specialization. We are welcoming many new clients who have just started to explore opportunities in critical materials and are now joining the loyal clients invested in our precious metals products. Finally, we have a focused team of employee shareholders who are eager to demonstrate the potential of our highly-scalable asset management platform,"" added Mr. George. Key AUM highlights1 AUM was $28.7 billion as at December 31, 2023, up $3.3 billion (13%) from September 30, 2023 and up $5.3 billion (23%) from December 31, 2022. On a three and twelve months ended basis, we benefited from strong uranium prices, as well as inflows across the majority of our exchange listed products. We also benefited from capital raises in our private strategies funds. Key revenue highlights Management fees were $34.5 million in the quarter, up $6.1 million (21%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $132.3 million on a full-year basis, up $16.9 million (15%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Carried interest and performance fees were $0.5 million in the quarter, down $0.7 million (59%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $0.9 million on a full-year basis, down $2.4 million (73%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Net fees were $31.5 million in the quarter, up $4.9 million (18%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $120.7 million on a full-year basis, up $13.7 million (13%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Our revenue performance was due to higher average AUM across most of our exchange listed products and higher average AUM in our private strategies funds as a result of two new fund launches. On a full-year basis, these increases were partially offset by lower average AUM in our managed equities segment and lower carried interest crystallization in our private strategies segment.Commission revenues were $1.3 million in the quarter, down $3.7 million (74%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $8.3 million on a full-year basis, down $22.4 million (73%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Net commissions were $0.7 million in the quarter, down $2.1 million (75%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $4.6 million on a full-year basis, down $11.6 million (71%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Lower commissions were due to lower ATM activity in our physical uranium trust on a full-year basis and the sale of our former Canadian broker-dealer in the second quarter.Finance income was $1.2 million in the quarter, down $0.2 million (16%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $4.9 million on a full-year basis, down $0.1 million (3%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. Our results were primarily driven by lower income generation in co-investment positions we hold in LPs managed in our private strategies segment. Key expense highlights Net compensation expense was $14.8 million in the quarter, up $2.3 million (18%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $60.4 million on a full-year basis, up $4.1 million (7%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the quarter and on a full-year basis was primarily due to new hires and increased AIP accruals on higher net fee generation.SG&A was $4.2 million in the quarter, up $0.1 million (3%) from the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $17.5 million on a full-year basis, up $1.5 million (9%) from the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the quarter and on a full-year basis was due to higher marketing and technology costs. Earnings summary Net income was $9.7 million ($0.38 per share) in the quarter, up 32% from $7.3 million ($0.29 per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. On a full-year basis, net income was $41.8 million ($1.66 per share), up 137% from $17.6 million ($0.70 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income in the quarter benefited from higher average AUM across most of our exchange listed products and private strategies. On a full-year basis we benefited from higher average AUM as noted previously, but also from the second quarter realization of an unrecorded contingent asset relating to a prior period acquisition.Adjusted base EBITDA was $18.8 million ($0.75 per share) in the quarter, up 4% from $18.1 million ($0.72 per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. On a full-year basis, adjusted base EBITDA was $71.9 million ($2.85 per share), up 1% from $71 million ($2.83 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increased management fees generated from higher average AUM on a full-year basis were largely offset by lower commission income due to the sale of our former Canadian broker-dealer during the second quarter of the year. Subsequent events On February 20, 2024, the Sprott Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share.Subsequent to year-end, we continue to benefit from our late 2023 asset growth as well as ongoing strength in uranium prices. As at February 16, 2024, AUM was $29.2 billion, up 2% from $28.7 billion at December 31, 2023. 1 See “non-IFRS financial measures” section in this press release and schedule 2 and 3 of ""Supplemental financial information"" Supplemental financial information Please refer to the December 31, 2023 annual financial statements of the Company and the related management discussion and analysis filed earlier this morning for further details into the Company's financial position as at December 31, 2023 and the Company's financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(“Sprott” or the “Company”) (NYSE/TSX: SII) is pleased to also announce today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) has approved the Company’s notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (""NCIB""). Pursuant to the terms of the NCIB, Sprott may purchase its own common shares for cancellation through the facilities of the TSX, alternative Canadian trading systems and/or the New York Stock Exchange, in each case in accordance with the applicable requirements, and as otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws. The maximum number of common shares which may be purchased by Sprott during the NCIB will not exceed 646,576 common shares being approximately 2.5% of 25,863,041 (representing the number of issued and outstanding common shares as of February 19, 2024). The average daily trading volume (the “ADTV”) of the common shares on the TSX for the six-month period ended January 31, 2024 was 28,455. Under the rules of the TSX, Sprott is entitled to repurchase during the same trading day on the TSX up to 25% of the ADTV of the common shares, being 7,113 common shares, except where such purchases are made in accordance with the ""block purchase"" exemption under applicable TSX policy. Sprott will effect purchases at varying times commencing on March 4, 2024 and ending on March 3, 2025. In addition to providing shareholders liquidity, Sprott believes that the common shares have been trading in a price range which does not adequately reflect the value of such shares in relation to Sprott’s business and its future prospects. Under its current NCIB that commenced on March 3, 2023 and will terminate on March 2, 2024, Sprott previously sought and received approval from the TSX to repurchase up to 648,908 common shares. Pursuant to its current NCIB, Sprott has purchased an aggregate of 122,953 common shares through the facilities of the TSX and the NYSE. 18,915 common shares were purchased on the TSX at a weighted-average price of C$45.54 per common share for total cash consideration of CAD$861,389.10, and 104,038 common shares were purchased on the NYSE at a weighted-average price of US$32.63 per common share for total cash consideration of US$3,394,759.94. Sprott did not repurchase the maximum allowance under the current NCIB due to a combination of factors. Non-IFRS Financial Measures This press release includes financial terms (including AUM, net commissions, net fees, expenses, adjusted base EBITDA, operating margins and net compensation) that the Company utilizes to assess the financial performance of its business that are not measures recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). These non-IFRS measures should not be considered alternatives to performance measures determined in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Our key performance indicators and non-IFRS and other financial measures are discussed below. For quantitative reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS financial measures please see schedule 2 and schedule 3 of the ""Supplemental financial information"" section of this press release. Net fees Management fees, net of trailer, sub-advisor, fund expenses and direct payouts, and carried interest and performance fees, net of carried interest and performance fee payouts (internal and external), are key revenue indicators as they represent the net revenue contribution after directly associated costs that we generate from our AUM. Net commissions Commissions, net of commission expenses (internal and external), arise primarily from purchases and sales of uranium in our exchange listed products segment and transaction-based service offerings by our broker dealers. Net compensation Net compensation excludes commission expenses paid to employees, other direct payouts to employees, carried interest and performance fee payouts to employees, which are all presented net of their related revenues in the MD&A, and severance, new hire accruals and other which are non-recurring. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted base EBITDA and operating margins EBITDA in its most basic form is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA (or adjustments thereto) is a measure commonly used in the investment industry by management, investors and investment analysts in understanding and comparing results by factoring out the impact of different financing methods, capital structures, amortization techniques and income tax rates between companies in the same industry. While other companies, investors or investment analysts may not utilize the same method of calculating EBITDA (or adjustments thereto), the Company believes its adjusted base EBITDA metric, in particular, results in a better comparison of the Company's underlying operations against its peers and a better indicator of recurring results from operations as compared to other non-IFRS financial measures. Operating margins are a key indicator of a company’s profitability on a per dollar of revenue basis, and as such, is commonly used in the financial services sector by analysts, investors and management.

The collaboration aims to address weed resistance challenges in agriculture by designing a novel Mode-of-Action herbicide targeting the APTH1 protein. Positive None. Negative None. Agricultural Biotechnology Expert The strategic partnership between AgPlenus and Bayer AG is poised to address a critical need in the agricultural sector - the development of a novel, sustainable herbicide. This collaboration is significant, as it combines AgPlenus's AI-driven computational modeling with Bayer's R&D and commercial prowess. The focus on a new Mode-of-Action (MoA) is particularly relevant given the increasing instances of weed resistance, which poses a threat to food security and the efficacy of current regenerative agricultural practices.From a biotechnological perspective, targeting the APTH1 protein presents a fresh avenue for herbicide development. The AI-driven approach can potentially streamline the molecule optimization process, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional chemical synthesis. This could lead to a more diverse portfolio of crop protection agents, mitigating the risk of resistance build-up. Moreover, the introduction of a new MoA could revolutionize the herbicide market, currently valued at $42.81 billion, by offering an alternative to farmers grappling with resistant weed species. Financial Analyst The financial arrangement of this collaboration is noteworthy, with AgPlenus set to receive an upfront payment, research funding, milestone payments and royalties on future sales. This deal structure suggests a significant commitment from Bayer and potential long-term revenue for AgPlenus. The exclusive licensing agreement indicates Bayer's confidence in the commercial viability of the products developed from this partnership.For investors, the focus should be on the projected timelines for development, regulatory approvals and market entry, as these factors will influence the financial returns. The potential impact on Bayer's stock could be positive, given the company's expansion of its sustainable crop protection portfolio, which aligns with growing market demand for environmentally friendly farming solutions. However, the actual financial impact will largely depend on the successful development and market adoption of the new herbicide. Sustainability Analyst This collaboration has significant implications for sustainable agriculture. Introducing a new MoA herbicide aligns with societal expectations towards environmentally conscious farming practices. The use of AI to design and optimize herbicides promises not only efficiency but also the potential reduction of environmental impact by minimizing the use of chemicals and focusing on target-specific action.The success of this initiative could set a precedent for the industry, encouraging other companies to invest in AI and computational modeling for sustainable product development. It also reinforces the notion that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand, with the promise of new solutions that are both effective and have less ecological footprint. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM The collaboration will tap into the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to design and optimize crop protection chemistry, developing a novel sustainable Mode-of-Action (MoA) broad-spectrum herbicide for farmers REHOVOT, Israel, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AgPlenus Ltd., a global leader in designing and developing novel sustainable crop protection products and a subsidiary of Evogene Ltd. (Nasdaq: EVGN), (TASE: EVGN), announced today the signing of a licensing & collaboration agreement with Bayer AG, a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and agriculture.

The company forecasts consolidated earnings of $2.12 per average diluted share for 2024, with a focus on consistent growth and long-term shareholder value. Negative Net income decreased primarily due to milder weather, higher expenses, and lower revenues in 2023 compared to 2022. Other operations reported increased losses in 2023 due to higher interest expenses. - Financial Analyst The reported earnings of OGE Energy Corp. reflect a notable decrease from $3.32 to $2.07 per diluted share year-over-year. This decline is primarily attributed to the absence of income from natural gas midstream operations after the company's strategic exit from that segment. The sale of Energy Transfer units in the previous year was a significant contributor to earnings and its one-time nature should be accounted for when analyzing the company's ongoing performance.Furthermore, the reported decrease in net income for OG&E is due to a combination of milder weather, higher depreciation and increased operation and maintenance expenses. These factors are crucial as they suggest a rise in costs that could affect future profitability if not managed effectively. The guidance for 2024, with a midpoint of $2.12 per diluted share, suggests stability in the company's outlook, but it's imperative to monitor whether the cost management strategies and capital investment recovery will offset the rising expenses.For investors and stakeholders, the consistency in dividend payments, with the latest declaration, indicates a commitment to shareholder returns. However, the growth rate target of five to seven percent for consolidated earnings per share should be examined against the backdrop of the company's operational challenges and strategic investments in infrastructure. Energy Sector Analyst OGE Energy Corp.'s focus on leveraging low customer rates and investing in infrastructure projects is a strategic move within the energy sector. By targeting the economic vitality of Oklahoma and Arkansas, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on regional growth. The emphasis on strong load growth is particularly significant, as it indicates the company's anticipation of increased demand for electricity. This could potentially lead to higher revenue streams and enhanced stability in their financial performance.However, the energy sector is highly sensitive to external factors such as weather conditions, regulatory changes and market dynamics. The reported milder weather impacting OG&E's earnings is a testament to this volatility. As OGE Energy continues to divest from natural gas midstream operations and focuses on its regulated electric utility, the company's risk profile may change, potentially affecting its stock valuation and investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst The reported earnings and financial guidance of OGE Energy Corp. provide insight into the company's market positioning and potential for growth. The company's target for a consistent growth rate in earnings per share is an important metric for investors, as it suggests a strategic vision for steady expansion. This is further supported by the company's investment in lower-risk infrastructure projects, which may enhance long-term shareholder value.It is critical to assess the company's performance within the broader context of the utility market, where competition and regulatory frameworks play significant roles. The ability of OGE Energy to maintain low customer rates while investing in infrastructure could be a key differentiator in a competitive landscape. The projected earnings growth, coupled with a commitment to dividends, may make the company attractive to investors seeking stability in a traditionally conservative sector. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE: OGE), the parent company of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (""OG&E""), today reported earnings of $2.07 per diluted share in 2023, compared to $3.32 per diluted share in 2022. Earnings for 2022 included net income of $1.16 per diluted share from natural gas midstream operations, which OGE Energy fully exited in 2022 through the sale of all Energy Transfer units. Beginning in 2023, OGE Energy no longer has a Natural Gas Midstream Operations reporting segment. OG&E, a regulated electric company, contributed earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2023, compared to earnings of $2.19 per diluted share in 2022.Other operations, which includes the holding company, contributed a loss of $0.05 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.03 per diluted share in 2022.""In 2023, our team delivered outstanding results as we provided safe and reliable electricity to our customers,"" said Sean Trauschke, Chairman, President and CEO of OGE Energy Corp. ""The fundamentals of our business are strong and our sustainable business model to leverage our low rates and excellent service drives economic growth in Oklahoma and western Arkansas which contributes to a bright future for our company, consistent long-term growth for our shareholders, and ever more reliable service for our customers."" Discussion of 2023 ResultsOG&E contributed net income of $426.4 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in 2023 compared to $439.5 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, in 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to milder weather in 2023, higher depreciation and interest expense on a growing asset base, and increased operation and maintenance expense. These items were partially offset by higher operating revenues driven by the recovery of capital investments, strong load growth and higher net other income. Other Operations resulted in a loss of $9.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2023 compared to a loss of $5.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2022. The increase in net loss was primarily due to higher interest expense related to increased short-term debt and partially offset by a higher income tax benefit. OGE Energy's net income was $416.8 million or $2.07 per diluted share in 2023, compared to earnings of $665.7 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, in 2022. Earnings for 2022 included net income of $1.16 per diluted share from natural gas midstream operations, which OGE Energy fully exited in 2022 through the sale of all Energy Transfer units. Fourth Quarter ResultsFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, OGE Energy reported net income of $48.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared with net income of $50.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in same period of 2022. OG&E reported net income of $48.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared with net income of $46.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the same period of 2022. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating revenues driven by the recovery of capital investments and lower other operation and maintenance expense partially offset by higher interest expense and higher depreciation expense on a growing asset base. Other operations reported a loss of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to net income of $0.1 million in the same period 2022. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to higher interest expense related to increased short-term debt partially offset by a higher income tax benefit related to the former natural gas midstream operations recorded in 2023. 2024 Outlook and Consolidated Earnings per Share Growth RateThe midpoint of OGE Energy's consolidated earnings guidance for 2024 is $2.12 per average diluted share, within a range of $2.06 to $ 2.18 per average diluted share. The Company forecasts earnings for OG&E, the electric company, of $2.22 per average diluted share and earnings for the holding company of a loss of $0.10 per average diluted share. The guidance assumes, among other things, approximately 201.5 million average diluted shares outstanding and normal weather for the remainder of the year. OG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings due to weather on a year over year basis. OGE Energy is focused on creating long‐term shareholder value by targeting the consistent growth of consolidated earnings per share of five to seven percent, supported by strong load growth enabled by low customer rates and a strategy of investing in lower risk infrastructure projects that improve the economic vitality of the communities it serves in Oklahoma and Arkansas.

Financial Analyst Garmin Ltd.'s financial performance for the fiscal year 2023 indicates a robust economic position with record consolidated revenue and significant growth in key segments. The 8% year-over-year increase in revenue, alongside an expanded gross margin and a 27% increase in operating income for Q4, reflect strong operational efficiency and product demand. The company's ability to maintain a gross margin of 57.5% despite a slight decrease from the previous year demonstrates effective cost management and pricing power. The substantial growth in the Auto OEM segment by 54% in Q4, driven by increased domain controller shipments, is particularly noteworthy. This segment's expansion into domain controllers, including a multi-year contract set to commence in 2027, signals Garmin's strategic diversification and potential for future revenue streams.Garmin's announcement of a dividend increase and a new share repurchase program is a positive signal to shareholders, indicating confidence in the company's financial health and a commitment to returning value. The share repurchase program, authorized through December 26, 2026, highlights the company's strong cash position and management's proactive approach to capital allocation. Investors should note Garmin's forward-looking guidance, projecting a 10% revenue increase for 2024, as it suggests continued growth momentum. However, the anticipated decrease in pro forma EPS to $5.40, compared to $5.59 in 2023, may warrant attention for its implications on profitability and earnings quality. Market Research Analyst Garmin's performance in the fitness and outdoor segments, with respective revenue increases of 22% and 8% in Q4, underscores the company's strong positioning in the wearable and adventure watch markets. The recognition of Garmin's Venu 3 at the Consumer Electronics Show with three CES Innovation Awards, including Best of Innovation, is indicative of the company's technological leadership and brand strength in the consumer electronics space. The successful launch of new products, such as the Descent G1 Solar-Ocean Edition made from recycled ocean-bound plastics, showcases Garmin's commitment to innovation and sustainability, which may enhance brand loyalty and attract environmentally conscious consumers.Garmin's dominance in the aviation segment, despite a 4% revenue decrease in Q4, is maintained by its selection for advanced air mobility applications, such as Eve Air Mobility's electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. This demonstrates Garmin's strategic partnerships and technological adaptability in a rapidly evolving industry. The marine segment's growth, fueled by the acquisition of JL Audio and new product launches like the ECHOMAP Ultra 2 series, positions Garmin favorably in the boating and angling markets. These developments across different segments suggest a diversified product portfolio that can mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and consumer trends. Legal Expert The financial disclosures and forward-looking statements provided by Garmin must be scrutinized within the framework of regulatory compliance, particularly with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company's adherence to non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma EPS and free cash flow, requires transparent reconciliation to GAAP metrics to ensure investor clarity. Garmin's share repurchase program, governed by Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18, must be executed with due diligence to prevent market manipulation and maintain shareholder trust.

We are entering 2024 with strong momentum from our robust product lineup and have many product launches planned during the year. I am very proud of what we accomplished in 2023 and look forward to all that 2024 will bring."" - Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer of Garmin Ltd. Fitness: Revenue from the fitness segment increased 22% in the fourth quarter with growth across all categories led by strong demand for wearables. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 22%, respectively, resulting in $93 million of operating income. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, our Venu 3 was recognized with three CES Innovation Awards, including the prestigious Best of Innovation honor for outstanding design and engineering. Outdoor: Revenue from the outdoor segment increased 8% in the fourth quarter with growth across multiple categories led by adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 34%, respectively, resulting in $164 million of operating income. During the quarter, we expanded our lineup of dive offerings with the introduction of the Descent G1 Solar – Ocean Edition, our first-ever product made with recycled ocean-bound plastics. We also launched the new Descent Mk3 watch-style dive computer and the Descent T2 transceiver with enhanced SubWave TM sonar technology. This enhanced underwater technology features diver-to-diver messaging and tank pressure monitoring. Also during the quarter, we launched the eTrex® Solar, our first handheld GPS with solar charging capability allowing for infinite battery life for outdoor adventurers. Aviation: Revenue from the aviation segment decreased 4% in the fourth quarter as growth in OEM categories was more than offset by decreases in aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins were 75% and 26%, respectively, resulting in $57 million of operating income. During the quarter, our G3000 integrated flight deck was selected by Embraer backed Eve Air Mobility for its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. The G3000's lightweight, high-resolution displays and intuitive touchscreen interface are ideally suited for both legacy aircraft and emerging advanced air mobility applications. Marine: Revenue from the marine segment increased 14% in the fourth quarter due to contributions from the acquisition of JL Audio. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 16%, respectively, resulting in $37 million of operating income. During the quarter, we launched the ECHOMAP TM Ultra 2 chartplotter series designed with premium sonar, mapping and wireless networking capabilities for inland and nearshore anglers. We also launched the GSD 28 sonar module with RapidReturn technology that offers six times faster updates than its predecessor. Auto OEM: Revenue from the auto OEM segment increased 54% during the fourth quarter primarily due to increased shipments of domain controllers. Gross margin was 21%, and the operating loss narrowed to $10 million. Domain controller deliveries to the BMW Group continued to ramp up across multiple models and regions. During the quarter, we were awarded a multi-year contract with a premium automaker to supply domain controllers on a global basis starting in 2027, which is projected to be the single largest award in the history of our Auto OEM business. In addition, at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we revealed our updated Unified Cabin and announced our motorcycle infotainment solution was selected by Yamaha Motors for select motorcycles and smart scooters. Additional Financial Information: Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $524 million, a 10% increase over the prior year. Research and development increased 10% primarily due to engineering personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% driven primarily by personnel related expenses and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of JL Audio. Advertising expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher cooperative advertising. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported a $159 million income tax benefit. Excluding $181 million of income tax benefit due to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets, and $12 million of income tax benefit due to auto OEM manufacturing tax incentives in Poland, our pro forma effective tax rate(1) in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 9.0% compared to 8.9% in the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated operating cash flow of $466 million and free cash flow(1) of $417 million. We paid a quarterly dividend of approximately $140 million and repurchased approximately $19 million of the Company's shares within the quarter, completing the share repurchase program authorized through December 29, 2023. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion.

These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies. Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the Company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the Company, as described in more detail by category below. The tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Pro forma effective tax rate The Company's income tax expense is periodically impacted by discrete tax items that are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. Therefore, management believes disclosure of the effective tax rate and income tax provision before the effect of certain discrete tax items are important measures to permit investors' consistent comparison between periods.

(2) In third quarter 2023, the Company recognized $2.3 million of tax expense due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets associated with the change in corporate income tax rate for the state of Kansas. (3) Certain Switzerland deferred tax assets related to the enactment of Switzerland Federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform were revalued in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, resulting in income tax benefit of $181.4 million and income tax expense of $7.2 million, respectively. (4) In fourth quarter 2023, the Company recognized $12.1 million of income tax benefit due to auto OEM manufacturing tax incentives in Poland. Pro forma net income (earnings) per share Management believes that net income (earnings) per share before the impact of foreign currency gains or losses and certain discrete income tax items, as discussed above, is an important measure in order to permit a consistent comparison of the Company's performance between periods.

However, there is minimal cash impact from such foreign currency gains and losses. (2) The tax effect of foreign currency gains and losses was calculated using the pro forma effective tax rate of 9.0% and 8.5% for the 13-weeks and fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, respectively, and the pro forma effective tax rate of 8.9% and 7.9% for the 14-weeks and fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. (3) The 2023 and 2022 discrete tax items are discussed in the pro forma effective tax rate section above. Free cash flow Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations that is available for investing and defines it as operating cash flows less capital expenditures for property and equipment. Management believes that excluding purchases of property and equipment provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's operations and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company's results between periods. This metric may also be useful to investors but should not be considered in isolation as it is not a measure of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The most comparable GAAP measure is net cash provided by operating activities.

The estimated impact of foreign currency gains and losses cannot be reasonably estimated on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the related tax effects of such gains and losses. The impact on diluted net income per share of foreign currency gains and losses, net of tax effects, was $0.13 per share for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2023. At this time, management is unable to determine whether or not significant discrete tax items will occur in fiscal 2024 or anticipate the impact of any other events that may be considered in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures.

Hughes' expertise in SATCOM for government, defense, and enterprise sectors ensures cutting-edge technology for customers. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Expert The contract awarded to Hughes Network Systems by SES Space & Defense signifies a strategic enhancement in satellite communications (SATCOM) capabilities, particularly for defense applications. The introduction of a software-defined, multi-orbit, auto-PACE solution enables seamless integration of different satellite constellations, enhancing the resilience and flexibility of broadband connectivity. This is crucial for defense operations where reliable communication is vital, regardless of location or mobility. The utilization of both Ku- and Ka-band frequencies across GEO, MEO and LEO satellites ensures optimal frequency band usage, which is critical for overcoming limitations due to spectrum availability or atmospheric conditions.The deployment of Hughes' automated Network Management System (NMS) and Enterprise Management and Control (EM&C) capabilities, coupled with the Smart Network Edge software, represents a significant advancement in network management and control. This allows for more efficient allocation of resources, better network performance and reduced operational costs. The integration of next-generation, software-defined HM100 and HM400 satellite modems will provide enhanced GEO and MEO connectivity, which is expected to deliver improved data throughput and lower latency for end-users. Defense Technology Analyst The Defense Experimentation Using Commercial Space Internet (DEUCSI) program, in collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), emphasizes the U.S. military's increasing reliance on commercial SATCOM solutions for defense operations. The Hughes auto-PACE solution is particularly noteworthy for its potential to provide Comms on the Pause (COTP) and Comms on the Move (COTM) capabilities. These are essential for modern military operations that require constant and reliable communication channels, even in the most challenging environments. The ability to maintain connectivity while on the move or in a static position without manual intervention for network adjustments is a game-changer for battlefield communications.Moreover, the integration of LEO solutions by SES Space & Defense into the Hughes offering is indicative of the growing trend towards the use of LEO constellations for defense communications. LEO satellites, due to their proximity to Earth, can offer lower latency and potentially higher data rates, which are critical for applications requiring real-time communication and data transfer. This multi-orbit approach aligns with the Department of Defense's strategic objectives to leverage commercial technologies to maintain technological superiority and enhance the resilience of its communication networks. Market Analyst The announcement of this contract could have a positive impact on EchoStar's financial performance, as it represents an expansion of Hughes' footprint in the government and defense sectors. The defense sector's demand for advanced SATCOM solutions is growing, driven by the need for robust and secure communication systems. Hughes' long-standing experience and innovation in satellite communications position it well to capture a significant share of this market.The contract may also have broader implications for the satellite communications industry, signaling a shift towards more integrated and flexible network solutions. As government and defense entities increasingly look to commercial providers for next-generation capabilities, companies like Hughes that can offer comprehensive, multi-orbit solutions are likely to benefit. This could lead to increased competition and innovation within the sector, ultimately benefiting end-users with more advanced and reliable communication services. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM The Hughes solutions will support both ground- and air-based proof of concept testing.

Prepares to Launch Crucial Genetic Predisposition Study in Preparation to Investigate the Potential of TVGN 489 to Address Critical Unmet Need for Long COVID Treatment Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags covid-19 Rhea-AI Summary Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. announces the development of TVGN 489, a CTL therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2, for high-risk COVID-19 patients. The company plans to conduct further studies on Long Covid treatment and assess the relationship between Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) and Long Covid development. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The development of TVGN 489, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) therapy by Tevogen Bio, marks a significant advancement in the treatment of COVID-19, particularly for high-risk patients. The therapy's ability to target multiple protein segments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome could potentially provide a more comprehensive immune response than treatments focusing on a single viral protein. This broad-spectrum approach is noteworthy given the virus's capacity to mutate, as it may maintain efficacy against emerging variants.The proof of concept clinical trial's results suggesting a favorable tolerance profile is promising. However, it is crucial to scrutinize the trial's scale, the diversity of the patient population and the parameters used to measure 'tolerance.' The long-term effectiveness and potential side effects will be key factors in evaluating the therapy's viability. Moreover, the planned studies to explore the treatment's efficacy for Long COVID symptoms are of particular interest, as this represents an unmet medical need with a growing patient population.Understanding the correlation between HLA types and Long COVID could lead to personalized medicine approaches, improving treatment efficacy. However, the financial and time investments required for such personalized therapies could be substantial, posing challenges for scalability and accessibility. Investors should monitor the progress of these trials closely, as positive outcomes could lead to significant market opportunities for Tevogen Bio. Immunologist The exploration of Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) types in the context of Long COVID is a sophisticated and potentially groundbreaking aspect of Tevogen's research. HLAs play a crucial role in the immune system's ability to present viral antigens to T cells and individual variations in HLA can significantly influence susceptibility and immune response to infections.The endeavor to match CTL products with the most common HLA types associated with Long COVID, should a correlation be established, reflects a precision medicine strategy that could enhance treatment effectiveness. This approach could revolutionize the way Long COVID is treated, but the complexity of HLA interactions and the necessity for individualized therapies present both scientific and logistical challenges. The impact on the broader healthcare system, in terms of required diagnostics and the cost of personalized treatments, should be considered by stakeholders. Healthcare Industry Analyst Tevogen's focus on Long COVID treatment trials is strategically aligned with an emerging healthcare market. As Long COVID continues to affect a significant portion of the population, the demand for effective treatments is likely to increase. The company's proactive research into HLA types and their association with Long COVID could position it as a leader in this niche market.However, the market potential for TVGN 489 will depend on several factors, including the prevalence of Long COVID, the competitive landscape and the ability of healthcare systems to adopt new therapies. It is important for investors to consider the regulatory pathway and market adoption rate when evaluating the potential financial impact of Tevogen's CTL therapy. A successful treatment for Long COVID could open up new revenue streams for the company, but the timeline for clinical trials and FDA approval processes must be factored into any financial forecasts. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM WARREN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. ('Tevogen Bio') (Nasdaq: TVGN) Tevogen’s ExacTcell platform was developed to harness the killing ability of naturally occurring cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), against viral and malignant targets. TVGN 489, a CTL therapy produced by the ExactTcell platform, contains CTLs recognizing multiple protein targets across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. These cells were well tolerated in a completed proof of concept clinical trial in high-risk patients with acute COVID-19, with later stage studies planned in this area. Tevogen plans to assess whether TVGN 489 cells can rapidly eliminate symptoms of Long Covid. To facilitate the development of a Long Covid treatment trial, Tevogen will launch a preliminary study in Q1 2024 to assess whether the development of Long COVID is associated with a key component of an individual’s immune system known as Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). TVGN 489 CTLs work in conjunction with HLA molecules to recognize and destroy viral targets. HLA types vary from person to person and are known to influence degrees of risk in other infectious settings. Specific HLA types may be associated with more or less protection against a particular infection. Prior to launching the Long COVID clinical trial, Tevogen seeks to address whether Long COVID occurs more commonly with certain HLA types and less commonly with others, or whether Long COVID occurs randomly in the population regardless of HLA. This effort will help Tevogen generate CTL products recognizing the HLA types that are most commonly associated with Long Covid, if a relationship between Long Covid and HLA type is identified, with the goal of allowing a Long COVID treatment trial to be designed and completed expeditiously. “We have spent significant resources and time identifying TVGN 489’s targets from across the entire COVID genome. These have remained remarkably durable over the last 4 and a half years. I am highly optimistic that TVGN 489 will offer a meaningful solution for both acute and Long COVID patients,” said Neal Flomenberg, MD, Tevogen’s Chief Scientific Officer. “Generating this information will provide important insights into the immunologic factors that contribute to Long COVID development and will greatly facilitate the treatment trial we expect to follow,” added Shannon Rudolph, Clinical Scientist at Tevogen About Tevogen Bio Tevogen Bio is a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy company harnessing one of nature’s most powerful immunological weapons, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to develop off-the-shelf, genetically unmodified precision T cell therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancers, and neurological disorders, aiming to address the significant unmet needs of large patient populations. Tevogen leadership believes that sustainability and commercial success in the current era of healthcare rely on ensuring patient accessibility through advanced science and innovative business models. Tevogen has reported positive safety data from its proof-of-concept clinical trial, and its key intellectual property assets are wholly owned by the company, not subject to any third-party licensing agreements. These assets include granted patents and pending patents, two of which are related to artificial intelligence.

The company reported a 1.8% YoY revenue growth for the full year, with a notable 4.9% YoY growth in Excluding License and Support (Ex-L&S) revenue. Operating profit margin for the full year stood at 3.8%, while the non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.0%. Total Contract Value (TCV) witnessed a significant increase, with a 27% YoY growth for the full year. Unisys provided full-year 2024 guidance of (1.5)% to 1.5% YoY constant currency revenue growth and 5.5% to 7.5% non-GAAP operating profit margin. Negative The company experienced a decline of 2.1% in constant currency for 4Q revenue. Unisys reported a net loss attributable to the corporation, including a non-cash pension settlement loss of $167.2 million. Revenue for the License and Support (L&S) segment declined by 15.2% YoY. The gross profit margin for Ex-L&S revenue was 16.5%, indicating a decrease of 11.8% YoY. Financial Analyst The reported financial results showing full-year revenue growth of 1.8% YoY and the significant improvement in operating cash flow from $12.7 million to $74.2 million indicate a robust operational performance. The growth in Ex-L&S revenue by 4.9% YoY, both as reported and in constant currency, suggests a healthy expansion in the company's core services, excluding the more volatile license and support segment. The 27% YoY increase in Ex-L&S Total Contract Value (TCV) for the full year and particularly the 137% YoY in the fourth quarter, highlights strong demand for the company's offerings and a solid foundation for future revenue streams.However, the decline in License and Support (L&S) revenue by 15.2% YoY raises concerns about this segment's sustainability and the need for strategic adjustments. Additionally, the non-GAAP operating profit margin of 7.0% compared to last year's 8.0% may reflect margin pressures despite top-line growth. The guidance for the full-year 2024 indicates a cautious outlook with potential for both contraction and modest growth in constant currency revenue, suggesting that management is accounting for market uncertainties and currency volatility. Market Research Analyst The company's performance in the Digital Workplace Solutions (DWS) and Cloud, Applications & Infrastructure Solutions (CA&I) segments shows resilience, with DWS experiencing an 8.9% YoY revenue increase. This reflects the ongoing demand for digital transformation and remote work solutions. The gross profit margin improvement in these segments is indicative of operational efficiency gains or a shift towards higher-margin services.The Enterprise Computing Solutions (ECS) segment, however, faced a 10.0% YoY revenue decline, which could be attributed to a shift in customer preferences or a competitive landscape that impacts the company's traditional offerings. It is essential to monitor how the company adapts its strategy in this segment to mitigate the decline.Moreover, the pension de-risking strategy and the transfer of pension liabilities to a third-party insurer could be seen as a move to streamline the company's financials and reduce long-term liabilities, potentially making the company more attractive to investors. Economist From an economic perspective, the company's financials reflect the broader trends of currency impacts on multinational corporations. The emphasis on constant currency figures in their reporting underscores the challenges of foreign exchange volatility. The improved free cash flow performance is a positive sign of liquidity and operational efficiency, which is crucial for sustaining investments and weathering economic downturns.The company's pension management strategy, including the purchase of annuity contracts, is a proactive measure to address long-term pension liabilities, which can be a significant concern for investors, especially in a time where pension obligations are under scrutiny due to changing demographics and market conditions. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Company Exceeds 2023 Upwardly Revised Revenue and Profitability Guidance, Delivers Strong Growth in Contract Signings in 4Q Full-year revenue growth of 1.8% year over year (YoY), or 1.6% in constant currency(1); Excluding License and Support (Ex-L&S)(15) revenue growth of 4.9% YoY both as reported and in constant currency4Q revenue up 0.1% YoY, a decline of 2.1% in constant currency; 4Q Ex-L&S revenue growth of 6.8% YoY, or 4.3% in constant currencyFull-year operating profit margin of 3.8%; non-GAAP operating profit(8) margin of 7.0%Full-year operating cash flow of $74.2 million compared to $12.7 million for 2022, and free cash flow(11) of ($4.5) million compared to ($73.2) million for 2022Ex-L&S Total Contract Value (TCV)(4) increased 27% YoY for the full-year and 137% YoY in the fourth quarter, including New Business(6) TCV growth of 18% YoY for the full-year and 84% YoY in the fourth quarterCompany issues full-year 2024 guidance of (1.5)% to 1.5% YoY constant currency revenue growth and 5.5% to 7.5% non-GAAP operating profit marginConstant currency revenue guidance implies (1.0)% to 2.0% revenue growth as reported, based on recent exchange rates, and assumes Ex-L&S full-year revenue growth of 1.5% to 5.0% and License and Support (L&S)(14) revenue of approximately $375 millionBLUE BELL, Pa., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Unisys (NYSE: UIS) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.

DWS gross profit margin was 15.3%, an increase of 20 bps YoY. The increase in revenue and gross profit margin was primarily driven by New Business with existing clients. CA&I revenue increased 0.1% YoY, a 0.5% decline in constant currency. CA&I gross profit margin was 16.3%, a decrease of 270 bps YoY, as the prior year quarter gross profit included a benefit from the sale of surplus IP addresses. Full-year CA&I gross profit was 15.4%, up 630 bps, as the result of delivery improvements. ECS revenue declined in the fourth quarter 10.0% YoY, or a 12.2% decline in constant currency. ECS gross profit margin was 67.4%, a decrease of 590 bps YoY. The decrease in revenue and gross profit margin was primarily driven by the timing of software license renewals, as expected. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow (In millions) 4Q23 4Q22 FY23 FY22 Cash and cash equivalents $387.7 $391.8 Cash provided by operations $23.0 $34.9 $74.2 $12.7 Free cash flow $4.0 $13.8 ($4.5) ($73.2) Pre-pension free cash flow $10.7 $23.6 $43.5 ($29.5) Adjusted free cash flow(13) $30.9 $39.3 $120.5 $27.0 Full-year 2023 free cash flow improved by $68.7 million YoY due to improvements in working capital. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were $387.7 million. The company continued its pension de-risking strategy during 2023 with the purchase of two annuity contracts relating to its U.S. pension plans. The aggregate purchase price for the two transactions was approximately $516 million, which was funded by plan assets and resulted in a similarly sized reduction in plan liabilities. These actions resulted in non-cash pension settlement losses of $348.2 million. Other Key Performance Metrics YoY Change QoQ Change* 4Q23 Pipeline(3) Total company (1) % (20) % Ex-L&S pipeline (1) % (20) % TCV Total company 50 % 331 % Ex-L&S TCV 137 % 339 % FY23 TCV Total company 3 % Ex-L&S TCV 27 % * QoQ - quarter over quarter Sequential pipeline decline was due to elevated client signings during the fourth quarter while YoY decline was the result of renewal timing, partially offset by growth in New Business pipeline. In the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023, TCV growth was driven by strong growth in New Business TCV. Backlog was $3.01 billion for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $2.92 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $2.38 billion in the third quarter of 2023. The sequential and YoY increase was primarily driven by timing of Ex-L&S contract renewals and strong New Business signings during the fourth quarter. 2024 Financial Guidance The company has issued full-year 2024 revenue growth and profitability guidance: Guidance Revenue growth in constant currency (1.5)% to 1.5% Non-GAAP operating profit margin 5.5% to 7.5% Constant currency revenue guidance implies (1.0)% to 2.0% revenue growth as reported, based on recent exchanges rates, and assumes Ex-L&S full-year revenue growth of 1.5% to 5.0% and L&S revenue of approximately $375 million.

(1) Constant currency – A significant amount of the company's revenue is derived from international operations. As a result, the company's revenue has been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. The company refers to revenue growth rates in constant currency or on a constant currency basis so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to facilitate comparisons of the company's business performance from one period to another. Constant currency is calculated by retranslating current and prior-period revenue at a consistent exchange rate rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. (2) Backlog – Represents future revenue associated with contracted work which has not yet been delivered or performed. Although the company believes this revenue will be recognized, it may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty. (3) Pipeline – Represents qualified prospective sale opportunities for which bids have been submitted or vetted prospective sales opportunities which are being actively pursued. There is no assurance that pipeline will translate into recorded revenue. (4) Total Contract Value (TCV) – Represents the estimated revenue related to contracts signed in the period without regard for cancellation terms. New Business TCV represents TCV attributable to expansion and new scope for existing clients and new logo contracts. (5) Book-to-bill – Represents total contract value booked divided by revenue in a given period. (6) New Business – Represents expansion and new scope for existing clients and new logo contracts. (7) Next-Gen Solutions – Includes our Modern Workplace solutions within DWS, Digital Platforms and Applications (DP&A) solutions within CA&I, Specialized Services and Next-Gen Compute (SS&C) solutions within ECS, as well as Micro-Market solutions. The company uses estimated Next-Gen Solutions metrics to provide insight into the company's progress in shifting the revenue mix towards solutions that are generally higher-growth and higher-margin. (8) Non-GAAP operating profit – This measure excludes pretax postretirement expense and pretax charges in connection with certain legal matters related to professional services and legal fees, including legal defense costs, associated with certain legal proceedings, and cost-reduction activities and other expenses. (9) EBITDA & adjusted EBITDA – Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is calculated by starting with net income (loss) attributable to Unisys Corporation common shareholders and adding or subtracting the following items: net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense (net of interest income), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes postretirement expense; certain legal matters related to professional services and legal fees, including legal defense costs, associated with certain legal proceedings; environmental matters related to previously disposed businesses; cost-reduction activities and other expenses, non-cash share-based expense, and other (income) expense adjustments. (10) Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share – These measures excluded postretirement expense and charges in connection with certain legal matters related to professional services and legal fees, including legal defense costs, associated with certain legal proceedings; environmental matters related to previously disposed businesses; and cost-reduction activities and other expenses. The tax amounts related to these items for the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share include the current and deferred tax expense and benefits recognized under GAAP for these items. (11) Free cash flow – Represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. (12) Pre-pension free cash flow – Represents free cash flow before postretirement contributions. (13) Adjusted free cash flow – Represents free cash flow less cash used for postretirement funding; certain legal matters related to professional services and legal fees, including legal defense costs, associated with certain legal proceedings; environmental matters related to previously disposed businesses; and cost-reduction activities and other payments. (14) License and Support (L&S) – Represents software license and related support revenue within the company's ECS segment. (15) Excluding License and Support (Ex-L&S) – These measures exclude revenue, gross profit and gross profit margin in connection with software license and support revenue within the company's ECS segment. The company provides these measures to allow investors to isolate the impact of software license renewals, which tend to be significant and impactful based on timing, and related support services in order to evaluate the company's business outside of these areas. Forward-Looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Unisys cautions readers that the assumptions forming the basis for forward-looking statements include many factors that are beyond Unisys' ability to control or estimate precisely, such as estimates of future market conditions, the behavior of other market participants and that TCV is based, in part, on the assumption that each of those contracts will continue for their full contracted term. Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""estimates,"" ""expects,"" ""projects,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""should"" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements and such forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as of this date concerning future developments and their potential effect upon Unisys. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with management's expectations, assumptions and beliefs or that the effect of future developments on Unisys will be those anticipated by management. Forward-looking statements in this release and the accompanying presentation include, but are not limited to, any projections or expectations of revenue growth, margin expansion, achievement of operational efficiencies and savings, future growth of our Next-Gen solutions, TCV and New Business TCV, backlog, pipeline, book-to-bill, full-year 2024 revenue growth and profitability guidance, including constant currency revenue, Ex-L&S revenue growth, L&S revenue, non-GAAP operating profit margin and the assumptions and other expectations made in connection with our full-year 2024 financial guidance, our pension liability and statements regarding future economic conditions or performance. Additional information and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Unisys' expectations are contained in Unisys' filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Unisys' Annual Reports on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, recent Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other SEC filings, which are available at the SEC's web site, http://www.sec.gov. Information included in this release is representative as of the date of this release only and while Unisys periodically reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting Unisys' results of operations and financial condition in connection with its preparation of management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contained in its Quarterly and Annual Reports filed with the SEC, Unisys does not, by including this statement, assume any obligation to review or revise any particular forward-looking statement referenced herein in light of future events. Non-GAAP Information This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items such as postretirement expense; certain legal and other matters related to professional services and legal fees, including legal defense costs, associated with certain legal proceedings; environmental matters related to previously disposed businesses; and cost-reduction activities and other expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations, as they may be unusual or non-recurring. The inclusion of such items in financial measures can make the company's profitability and liquidity results difficult to compare to prior periods or anticipated future periods and can distort the visibility of trends associated with the company's ongoing performance. Management also believes that non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information about the company's financial performance and liquidity, as well as greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are often provided and utilized by the company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results and to isolate in some instances the impact of software license renewals, which tend to be lumpy, and related support services in order to evaluate the company's business outside of these areas. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the company's GAAP results for the applicable period. These measures should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found below except for financial guidance and other forward-looking information since such a reconciliation is not practicable without unreasonable efforts as the company is unable to reasonably forecast certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation.

Main Street Announces Second Quarter 2024 Regular Monthly Dividends and Supplemental Dividend Payable in March 2024,2024-02-21T12:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) announces regular monthly dividends of $0.24 per share for April, May, and June 2024, along with a supplemental dividend of $0.30 per share payable in March 2024. These dividends mark a 6.7% increase from the previous year and reflect Main Street's consistent dividend growth since its IPO in 2007.","Main Street Announces Second Quarter 2024 Regular Monthly Dividends and Supplemental Dividend Payable in March 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) announces regular monthly dividends of $0.24 per share for April, May, and June 2024, along with a supplemental dividend of $0.30 per share payable in March 2024. These dividends mark a 6.7% increase from the previous year and reflect Main Street's consistent dividend growth since its IPO in 2007. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of regular monthly dividends and a supplemental dividend by Main Street Capital Corporation signifies a robust dividend policy that is likely to attract income-focused investors. The consistency and increase in dividend payouts compared to the previous year suggest a stable and potentially growing income stream. This could be indicative of Main Street's operational success and financial health, as dividends are often paid from earnings. Additionally, the company's history of never reducing its dividend since its IPO may provide a sense of reliability and could be a positive signal for market sentiment towards Main Street's stock.The announced dividend yield of 9.1% based on the current share price is substantial and it exceeds the average dividend yield of the broader market. This high yield could be a double-edged sword, as it may either indicate a strong dividend policy or a potential red flag for over-distribution relative to earnings. Investors would benefit from examining Main Street's payout ratio and comparing it with industry standards to assess sustainability.Furthermore, the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) allows for compounding returns for investors who choose to reinvest their dividends, potentially enhancing the long-term value of their investment. The direct stock purchase plan (DSPP) also provides an accessible way for new investors to acquire shares, potentially increasing the investor base and liquidity of Main Street's stock. Tax Expert The final determination of the tax attributes for the dividends is an important consideration for investors, as it affects the after-tax income they receive. The expectation that the dividends for 2024 will include a combination of ordinary taxable income, qualified dividends, capital gains and potentially a return of capital, suggests a complex tax structure. Qualified dividends and capital gains may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, which could be advantageous for shareholders. However, a return of capital reduces the cost basis of the investment and is not taxed until the stock is sold. Shareholders should consult with a tax professional to understand the implications of these dividends on their personal tax situation. Market Research Analyst The declaration of a supplemental dividend, in addition to regular monthly dividends, could be interpreted as a positive market indicator, as it may reflect Main Street's confidence in its financial surplus and commitment to shareholder returns. However, it is also crucial to analyze the source of funding for these dividends. If the supplemental dividend is being paid out of Main Street's undistributed taxable income, it suggests that the company has generated sufficient earnings to cover its dividend payments without eroding its capital base. Market participants should look for trends in Main Street's earnings, payout ratios and retained earnings over time to evaluate the long-term sustainability of such dividend payments. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Regular Monthly Dividends of $0.24 per Share for each of April, May and June 2024 Supplemental Dividend of $0.30 per Share Payable in March 2024 HOUSTON, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Main Street Capital Corporation (NYSE: MAIN) (""Main Street"") is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors declared regular monthly cash dividends of $0.24 per share for each of April, May and June 2024. These monthly dividends, which will be payable pursuant to the table below, total $0.72 per share for the second quarter of 2024 and are consistent with the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2024 and represent a 6.7% increase from the regular monthly dividends paid in the second quarter of 2023. Since its October 2007 initial public offering, Main Street has periodically increased the amount of its regular monthly dividends paid per share and has never reduced its regular monthly dividend amount per share. Summary of Second Quarter 2024 Regular Monthly Dividends Declared Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payment Date Amount Per Share 2/20/2024 4/5/2024 4/8/2024 4/15/2024 $0.24 2/20/2024 5/7/2024 5/8/2024 5/15/2024 $0.24 2/20/2024 6/7/2024 6/7/2024 6/14/2024 $0.24 Total for Second Quarter 2024: $0.72 In addition to the regular monthly dividends for the second quarter of 2024, the Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.30 per share payable in March 2024. This supplemental cash dividend, which will be payable as set forth in the table below, will be paid out of Main Street's undistributed taxable income (taxable income in excess of dividends paid) as of December 31, 2023. Supplemental Cash Dividend Payable in March 2024 Declared Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payment Date Amount Per Share 2/20/2024 3/19/2024 3/20/2024 3/27/2024 $0.30 Including all dividends declared to date, including the second quarter 2024 regular monthly dividends and the March 2024 supplemental dividend, Main Street will have paid $40.555 per share in cumulative cash dividends since its October 2007 initial public offering at $15.00 per share. Including the second quarter 2024 regular monthly dividends and the March 2024 supplemental dividend, these most recent dividend declarations represent total dividends to Main Street shareholders of $1.02 per share, representing an annualized current yield of 9.1% based on the closing price of $44.88 per share on February 20, 2024. The final determination of the tax attributes for dividends each year are made after the close of the tax year. The final tax attributes for 2024 dividends are currently expected to include a combination of ordinary taxable income and qualified dividends and may include capital gains and return of capital. Main Street maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the ""Plan""). The dividend reinvestment feature of the Plan (the ""DRIP"") provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of Main Street's registered stockholders who hold their shares with Main Street's transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or certain brokerage firms that have elected to participate in the DRIP. Under the DRIP, if Main Street declares a dividend, registered stockholders who have not ""opted out"" of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of Main Street common stock. The direct stock purchase feature of the Plan (the ""DSPP"") provides investors with a convenient and economical method to purchase shares of Main Street common stock.

Financially, they saw revenue growth, increased EBITDA, and a conservative balance sheet. The company announced a cash distribution and provided full-year 2024 guidance. Positive Record Q4 2023 production of 24,332 Boe/d surpassing guidance. 21.2% revenue increase in Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA rose by 23.7% in Q4 2023. 98 active rigs drilling on Kimbell's acreage. Conservative balance sheet with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x. Q4 2023 cash distribution of $0.43 per common unit. Full-year 2024 guidance with estimated daily production at 24,000 Boe/d. Increased borrowing base to $550 million on secured credit facility. Chairman highlighted organic growth and future acquisition plans. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kimbell Royalty Partners of surpassing their Q4 2023 production guidance and achieving a 3.4% organic growth between Q3 and Q4 2023 signifies a robust operational performance. The increase in production volume is a critical metric that can lead to greater revenue generation and improved profitability, assuming stable or favorable oil prices. This growth trajectory, coupled with their conservative debt ratio (Net Debt to EBITDA of 1.0x), suggests a disciplined approach to financial management. Investors often scrutinize this ratio as it indicates the company's ability to manage its debt and finance its operations effectively. The increased borrowing base to $550 million enhances liquidity, enabling the company to pursue further growth opportunities or manage existing obligations.The cash distribution of $0.43 per common unit, which translates to an 11.2% annualized yield based on the recent closing price, is an attractive return for investors, particularly considering the tax-advantaged nature of these distributions. However, the payout ratio of 75% of cash available for distribution might raise questions about the sustainability of such high yields in the long-term, especially in a volatile commodity market. The remaining 25% allocated for debt repayment is a prudent move, reinforcing the company's commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. Market Research Analyst Kimbell's market share of active rigs, at 16.3%, is a significant indicator of its competitive position within the U.S. land rig count. This level of activity suggests that Kimbell is aggressively capitalizing on its acreage, which can lead to increased reserves and production over time. The company's superior five-year annual average PDP (Proved Developed Producing) decline rate of 14% is noteworthy as it is lower than the industry average, which typically ranges between 20-40%. A lower decline rate implies that the wells have a slower production drop-off, increasing the wells' value and potentially leading to a more stable revenue stream.From a strategic standpoint, Kimbell's focus on the Permian Basin, a region known for its prolific oil and gas reserves, is a positive sign for future growth prospects. The Permian Basin is a key area for oil and gas investment and Kimbell's significant presence there could position it well to benefit from economies of scale and operational synergies. The company's intention to continue consolidating in the fragmented oil and natural gas royalty sector indicates an aggressive growth strategy that could create shareholder value if executed effectively. Energy Sector Analyst Kimbell's operational momentum, with its rig count remaining near record highs, is an indication of its strategic commitment to growth through increased drilling activities. The mention of high-interest wells coming online in the Permian and Haynesville suggests a focus on high-return projects. The energy sector is particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and Kimbell's ability to maintain a low PDP decline rate and a conservative balance sheet positions it well to navigate the cyclical nature of the industry.The company's role as a consolidator within the U.S. oil and natural gas royalty sector is particularly interesting. The sector's estimated size of over $700 billion underscores the vast potential for consolidation. Kimbell's growth since its IPO and its significant acquisition activities in 2023 demonstrate an aggressive expansion strategy, which could result in increased market power and economies of scale. However, such growth strategies also carry risks, such as integration challenges and exposure to commodity price fluctuations, which must be managed carefully to maintain profitability and shareholder value. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Record Q4 23 Run-Rate Daily Production of 24,332 Boe/d (6:1) Exceeds High End of Guidance; Represents Organic Growth of 3.4% Between Q3 2023 and Q4 2023 Activity on Acreage Remains Robust with 98 Active Rigs Drilling Representing 16%1 Market Share of U.S. Land Rig Count Superior Five-Year Annual Average PDP Decline Rate of 14% Requires Only an Estimated 5.8 Net Wells Annually to Maintain Flat Production Compared to 8.4 Net Line-of-Site Wells Increase in Borrowing Base on Secured Revolving Credit Facility to $550 Million; Conservative Balance Sheet with Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of 1.0x Announces Q4 2023 Cash Distribution of $0.43 per Common Unit FORT WORTH, Texas, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP (NYSE: KRP) (""Kimbell"" or the ""Company""), a leading owner of oil and natural gas mineral and royalty interests in over 129,000 gross wells across 28 states, today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended and year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Record Q4 2024 run-rate daily production of 24,332 barrels of oil equivalent (""Boe"") per day (6:1)Record Q4 2023 oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $83.9 million, an increase of 21.2% from Q3 2023Q4 2023 net income of approximately $17.8 million and net income attributable to common units of approximately $9.8 million, as compared to $18.5 million and $13.6 million, respectively, from Q3 2023Record Q4 2023 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $69.0 million, an increase of 23.7% from Q3 2023As of December 31, 2023, Kimbell's major properties2 had 8.38 net drilled but uncompleted wells (""DUCs"") and net permitted locations on its acreage (4.55 net DUCs and 3.83 net permitted locations) compared to an estimated 5.8 net wells needed to maintain flat productionAs of December 31, 2023, Kimbell had 98 rigs actively drilling on its acreage, down 1 rig from Q3 2023 and representing 16.3% market share of all rigs drilling in the continental United States as of such timeOn December 8, 2023, the borrowing base and aggregate commitments on Kimbell's secured revolving credit facility were increased from $400 million to $550 million in connection with its Fall redeterminationAnnounced a Q4 2023 cash distribution of $0.43 per common unit, reflecting a payout ratio of 75% of cash available for distribution; implies a 11.2% annualized yield based on the February 20, 2024 closing price of $15.38 per common unit; Kimbell intends to utilize the remaining 25% of its cash available for distribution to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under Kimbell's revolving credit facilityInitiated full year 2024 guidance with estimated daily production at its mid-point projected at 24,000 Boe/d for the year____________________________ 1 Based on Kimbell rig count of 98 and Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count of 602 as of December 31, 2023. 2 These figures pertain only to Kimbell's major properties and do not include possible additional DUCs and permits from Kimbell's minor properties, which generally have a net revenue interest of 0.1% or below and are time consuming to quantify but, in the estimation of Kimbell's management, could add an additional 15% to Kimbell's net inventory. Robert Ravnaas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kimbell Royalty GP, LLC, Kimbell's general partner (the ""General Partner""), commented, ""2023 was another record year for Kimbell. We completed our largest acquisition to date during 2023, which was not only immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per common unit, but also bolstered the Permian as the leading basin for the Company in terms of production, active rig count, DUCs, permits and undrilled inventory. Furthermore, the borrowing base and elected commitments on the Company's revolving credit facility increased to $550 million, further enhancing our liquidity and conservative capital structure. Finally, the Company paid out $1.73 per common unit in tax-advantaged quarterly distributions during 2023 and paid down approximately $49.9 million on its credit facility by allocating 25% of cash available for distribution for debt-paydown. ""Q4 2023 reflected significant organic growth relative to Q3 2023 due to a number of high interest wells coming online in the Permian and Haynesville. We expect to continue this operational momentum as we progress through 2024 given that our rig count remains near record highs with 98 rigs actively drilling in the U.S. ""Reflecting on our growth since our IPO, we have now grown production from 3,116 Boe/d to 24,332 Boe/d, an increase of 681%. As evidenced by our significant acquisition activity in 2023, we expect to continue our role as a major consolidator in the highly fragmented U.S. oil and natural gas royalty sector, which we estimate to be over $700 billion in size. And, as I have stated in the past, there are only a handful of public entities in the U.S. and Canada that have the financial resources, infrastructure, network and technical expertise to complete large-scale, multi-basin acquisitions. We believe that we are still in the early stages of this consolidation and will actively seek out targets that fit within our acquisition profile. We are very excited about the opportunities to expand in the future and deliver unitholder value for years to come."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Distribution and Debt Repayment Today, the Board of Directors of the General Partner (the ""Board of Directors"") approved a cash distribution payment to common unitholders of 75% of cash available for distribution for the fourth quarter of 2023, or $0.43 per common unit. The distribution will be payable on March 20, 2024 to common unitholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2024. Kimbell plans to utilize the remaining 25% of cash available for distribution for the fourth quarter of 2023 to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its secured revolving credit facility. Since May 2020 (excluding the expected upcoming pay-down from the remaining 25% of Q4 2023 projected cash available for distribution), Kimbell has paid down approximately $136.0 million of outstanding borrowings under its secured revolving credit facility by allocating a portion of its cash available for distribution for debt pay-down. Kimbell expects that approximately 93% of its fourth quarter 2023 distribution should not constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but instead are estimated to constitute non-taxable reductions to the basis of each distribution recipient's ownership interest in Kimbell common units. The reduced tax basis will increase unitholders' capital gain (or decrease unitholders' capital loss) when unitholders sell their common units. The Form 8937 containing additional information may be found at www.kimbellrp.com under ""Investor Relations"" section of the site. Kimbell currently believes that the portion that constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be considered qualified dividends, subject to holding period and certain other conditions, which are subject to a tax rate of 0%, 15% or 20% depending on the income level and tax filing status of a unitholder for 2024. Kimbell believes these estimates are reasonable based on currently available information, but they are subject to change. Financial Highlights Kimbell's fourth quarter 2023 average realized price per Bbl of oil was $77.69, per Mcf of natural gas was $2.27, per Bbl of NGLs was $21.71 and per Boe combined was $36.04. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company's total revenues were $99.2 million, net income was approximately $17.8 million and net income attributable to common units was approximately $9.8 million, or $0.14 per common unit. There was a non-cash ceiling test impairment expense of $18.2 million recorded during the quarter, primarily related to the decline in commodity prices. Total fourth quarter 2023 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $69.0 million (consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measures at the end of this news release). In the fourth quarter of 2023, G&A expense was $9.1 million, $5.8 million of which was Cash G&A expense, or $2.59 per BOE (Cash G&A and Cash G&A per Boe are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see definition under Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the Supplemental Schedules included in this news release). Excluding the impact of approximately $0.8 million in integration related expenses associated with the Q3 2023 acquired production, Cash G&A per Boe was $2.25. Unit-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2023, which is a non-cash G&A expense, was $3.3 million or $1.49 per Boe. On December 8, 2023, the borrowing base and aggregate commitments under Kimbell's secured revolving credit facility were increased from $400 million to $550 million in connection with its Fall redetermination. As of December 31, 2023, Kimbell had approximately $294.2 million in debt outstanding under its secured revolving credit facility, had net debt to fourth quarter 2023 trailing twelve month consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.0x and was in compliance with all financial covenants under its secured revolving credit facility. Kimbell had approximately $255.8 million in undrawn capacity under its secured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, Kimbell had outstanding 73,851,458 common units and 20,847,295 Class B units. As of February 21, 2024, Kimbell had outstanding 74,938,960 common units and 20,847,295 Class B units. Production Fourth quarter 2023 average daily production was 25,235 Boe per day (6:1), which consisted of 903 Boe per day related to prior period production recognized in Q4 2023, and 24,332 Boe per day of run-rate production. The 24,332 Boe per day of run-rate production was composed of approximately 50% from natural gas (6:1) and approximately 50% from liquids (33% from oil and 17% from NGLs). The prior period production recognized in Q4 2023 was attributable to past production that came into pay status during the fourth quarter of 2023. Operational Update As of December 31, 2023, Kimbell's major properties had 807 gross (4.55 net) DUCs and 727 gross (3.83 net) permitted locations on its acreage. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, Kimbell had 98 rigs actively drilling on its acreage, which represents an approximate 16.3% market share of all land rigs drilling in the continental United States as of such time.

Reserves Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared an estimate of Kimbell's proved reserves as of December 31, 2023. Average prices of $78.22 per barrel of oil and $2.64 per MMBtu of natural gas were used in accordance with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). Realized prices with applicable differentials were $76.84 per barrel of oil, $2.11 per Mcf of natural gas and $23.78 per barrel of NGLs. Proved developed reserves at year-end 2023 increased by approximately 41% year-over-year to over 65 MMBoe, reflecting the acquisitions Kimbell made during the year along with continued development by the operators of Kimbell's acreage.

These locations only include Kimbell's major properties and do not include Kimbell's minor properties, which generally have less than a 0.1% net revenue interest and are time consuming to quantify, but in the estimation of Kimbell's management could add up to an additional 15% to Kimbell's net inventory in the aggregate. Including both the estimated major and minor upside locations, the Company believes it has a total of 93.05 net locations, or approximately 16 years of drilling inventory based on 5.8 net wells per year needed to maintain flat production. Approximately 75% of the total estimated undrilled net inventory is located in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Haynesville, which have some of the best economic returns and lowest break-even costs in the U.S. In addition, Kimbell's superior five-year average PDP decline rate of only 14% requires only an estimated 5.8 net wells each year to keep production flat.

Kimbell believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate Kimbell's operating performance and compare the results of Kimbell's operations period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate cash flow available to pay distributions to Kimbell's unitholders. Kimbell defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), net of depreciation and depletion expense, interest expense, income taxes, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, non-cash unit based compensation, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, cash distribution from affiliate, equity income (loss) in affiliate, gains and losses on sales of assets and operational impacts of variable interest entities, which include general and administrative expense and interest income. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined by GAAP. Kimbell excludes the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within Kimbell's industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Kimbell's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Kimbell expects that cash available for distribution for each quarter will generally equal its Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations, tax obligations, and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the Board of Directors may determine is appropriate. Kimbell believes Cash G&A and Cash G&A per Boe are useful metrics because they isolate cash costs within overall G&A expense and measure cash costs relative to overall production, which is a widely utilized metric to evaluate operational performance within the energy sector. Cash G&A is defined as general and administrative expenses less unit-based compensation expense. Cash G&A per Boe is defined as Cash G&A divided by total production for a period. Cash G&A should not be considered an alternative to G&A expense presented in accordance with GAAP. Kimbell's computations of Cash G&A and Cash G&A per Boe may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Olezarsen received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for FCS. Ionis provided full year 2024 financial guidance, showing revenue growth and decreased operating loss. The Company's revenue doubled in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, driven by pipeline success. Ionis' operating expenses increased due to investments in bringing new medicines to patients. Cash and short-term investments reached $2.3 billion, enabling continued growth and value creation. WAINUA was approved in the U.S., with a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca and a successful launch for ATTRv-PN. Ionis' 2024 financial guidance includes revenue exceeding $575 million and an operating loss of less than $475 million. The Company plans to deploy capital towards growth opportunities, expanding its pipeline, and advancing technology. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ionis Pharmaceuticals' financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 demonstrate a significant improvement in revenue, with a more than doubling in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year and a 34% increase for the full year. This growth is primarily attributed to the successful progression of their pipeline and technology platform. While operating expenses have increased, likely reflecting strategic investments in their product candidates, the overall operating loss has decreased from the previous year, indicating better financial management and potential cost efficiencies.Furthermore, the cash and short-term investments reported at $2.3 billion provide the company with a robust financial position to support ongoing and future product launches. The revenue composition, with substantial contributions from commercial and R&D activities, suggests a diversified revenue stream, which could be seen as a positive indicator for financial stability and resilience against market fluctuations. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation for olezarsen for familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and the positive Phase 3 data for olezarsen and donidalorsen for hereditary angioedema (HAE) are critical milestones. These developments not only expedite the regulatory process but also enhance the potential for a faster market introduction, which can be a substantial competitive advantage, especially in markets where there are unmet medical needs.The orphan drug designations for both olezarsen and donidalorsen by the FDA and EMA respectively, provide market exclusivity benefits and certain cost reductions, which can significantly impact Ionis' market positioning and profitability for these drugs. Furthermore, the approval and launch of WAINUA for hereditary ATTR polyneuropathy in the U.S., with anticipated approvals in the EU and Canada, could lead to an expanded market presence and increased revenue streams from new geographies. Market Research Analyst Ionis' strategic licensing agreements, such as with AstraZeneca and Otsuka, indicate an effective leveraging of their pipeline to generate upfront and milestone payments, which contribute to the revenue growth. The $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca for the FDA approval of WAINUA for ATTRv-PN in the U.S. and the licensing payment for ION826 showcase the potential financial benefits of such strategic collaborations.Additionally, the sustained global market leadership of SPINRAZA for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, with sales of $1.7 billion in 2023, reflects the company's strong commercial capabilities and the importance of having a flagship product that can provide consistent revenue over time. This level of sales performance also suggests a well-established market presence and effective demand generation for SPINRAZA. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM WAINUA™ approved with launch underway; on track for EU and Canada approval decisions this year Positive Phase 3 olezarsen and donidalorsen data, preparing regulatory submissions for FCS and HAE, respectively Olezarsen granted Breakthough Therapy designation by the FDA for FCS Ionis provides full year 2024 financial guidance CARLSBAD, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Revenue Ionis' revenue was comprised of the following: Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revenue: (amounts in millions) Commercial revenue: SPINRAZA royalties $62 $67 $240 $242 Other commercial revenue: TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA revenue, net 9 7 35 30 Licensing and royalty revenue 8 6 34 31 Total commercial revenue 79 80 309 303 Research and development revenue: Amortization from upfront payments 76 15 125 69 Milestone payments 11 14 101 74 License fees 92 - 117 37 Other services - 22 10 27 Collaborative agreement revenue 179 51 353 207 WAINUA joint development revenue 67 21 126 77 Total research and development revenue 246 72 479 284 Total revenue $325 $152 $788 $587 Commercial revenues in 2023 were comparable to 2022. Commercial revenue for 2023 included $240 million from SPINRAZA royalties, which was comparable to 2022. Ionis' commercial revenue in 2023 also included royalties from QALSODY U.S. product sales. R&D revenue significantly increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to continued success with Ionis' pipeline and technology. As a result, Ionis earned significant partner payments, including $50 million from AstraZeneca for the FDA approval of WAINUA for ATTRv-PN in the U.S., $36 million from AstraZeneca for licensing ION826 and payments from Ionis' new collaborations with Otsuka, Roche and Novartis. Operating Expenses Ionis' operating expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to certain one-time costs, including a non-cash charge associated with a lease exit and the license fee Ionis paid to Vect-Horus. As Ionis advanced its robust pipeline, study costs increased compared to the same periods in 2022 as many of the Company's Phase 3 studies are either fully enrolled or approaching full enrollment, resulting in higher R&D expenses year over year. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $80 million upfront payment Ionis paid to Metagenomi in 2022. Ionis' SG&A expenses increased year over year primarily due to launch preparation activities for WAINUA, olezarsen and donidalorsen. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2023, Ionis' cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $2.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 primarily due to the $500 million Ionis received from Royalty Pharma in January 2023 and significant partner payments throughout 2023. Ionis' working capital also increased over the same period primarily due to the Company's higher cash and short-term investments balance. In 2023, the Company recorded a long-term liability for future royalties due to Royalty Pharma. In June 2023, Ionis issued $575 million of senior convertible notes due in June 2028 with an interest rate of 1.75%. The Company used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase $504 million of its 0.125% convertible notes. 2024 Financial Guidance The Company's 2024 guidance reflects its plan to deploy its capital resources toward growth opportunities, including continued investments in its near-term commercial opportunities, expanding its wholly owned pipeline and advancing its technology platform. Additionally, the Company expects to continue earning substantial revenue from its commercial portfolio and partnered programs.

(REGN) receives FDA Priority Review for linvoseltamab to treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The BLA is supported by Phase 1/2 trial data, with a target action date of August 22, 2024. Linvoseltamab aims to activate T cells for cancer-cell killing in MM patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's acceptance of the BLA for linvoseltamab under Priority Review signifies a significant step for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in bringing a novel therapeutic option to patients with R/R multiple myeloma. This condition, being the second most prevalent blood cancer, represents a substantial patient population with a high unmet medical need, particularly after the failure of three prior lines of therapy. The bispecific antibody mechanism of linvoseltamab, aimed at connecting MM cells with T cells for enhanced immune response, is a cutting-edge approach in oncology therapeutics.Given the incurable nature of MM and the inevitability of disease progression, the development of linvoseltamab could potentially extend remission periods or improve quality of life, which would be a noteworthy advancement in treatment. The ongoing Phase 3 confirmatory trial, alongside additional planned studies, indicates a robust clinical development strategy, potentially expanding the drug's indications and bolstering its therapeutic value. The implications for Regeneron's pipeline and market positioning are considerable, particularly if linvoseltamab demonstrates a favorable safety and efficacy profile upon regulatory review. Oncology Doctor Multiple myeloma is a complex disease that often requires multiple lines of therapy due to its refractory and relapsing nature. Linvoseltamab's mode of action, engaging both the B-cell maturation antigen and T cells, represents an innovative approach that could potentially offer a more targeted and effective treatment for patients who have exhausted other options. The clinical outcomes of the LINKER-MM1 trial will be critical in determining the real-world efficacy of linvoseltamab.From a medical perspective, the potential approval of linvoseltamab introduces an alternative for R/R MM patients, which could translate into prolonged survival rates and improved patient outcomes. The bispecific antibody's ability to directly engage the immune system to combat MM cells is a promising strategy that aligns with the trend towards personalized and precision medicine in oncology. Financial Analyst The market's response to the FDA's Priority Review for linvoseltamab will likely be positive, considering the high demand for new treatments in the R/R MM space. The August 22, 2024 target action date provides a clear timeline for potential market entry, which is crucial for investor expectations. The acceptance of the Marketing Authorization Application by the European Medicines Agency further reinforces the global commercial potential of linvoseltamab.Regeneron's strategic move to invest in a broad clinical development program for linvoseltamab, including trials for earlier lines of therapy, suggests confidence in its efficacy and safety profile. This could result in a strong competitive edge and diversification of revenue streams for Regeneron, especially if linvoseltamab is approved. Investors will be closely monitoring the Phase 3 trial results for indications of the drug's market viability and long-term financial impact on the company. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for linvoseltamab to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) that has progressed after at least three prior therapies. The target action date for the FDA decision is August 22, 2024. Linvoseltamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing. The BLA is supported by data from a Phase 1/2 pivotal trial (LINKER-MM1) investigating linvoseltamab in R/R MM, which were last shared in December 2023. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for linvoseltamab in the same indication. As the second most common blood cancer, it’s estimated 35,000 people will be diagnosed with MM in the U.S. every year. MM is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (MM cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. MM is not curable despite treatment advances. While current treatments are able to slow the progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression and require additional therapies. The linvoseltamab clinical development program includes a Phase 3 confirmatory trial in patients with R/R MM (LINKER-MM3) that is currently enrolling. Additional trials in earlier lines of therapy and stages of disease are planned or underway, including a Phase 1/2 trial in the first-line setting, a Phase 2 trial in high-risk smoldering MM and a Phase 2 trial in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. A Phase 1 trial of linvoseltamab in combination with a Regeneron CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in MM is also planned. For more information, visit the Regeneron clinical trials website, or contact via clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643. Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the Phase 1/2 TrialThe ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion LINKER-MM1 trial is investigating linvoseltamab in 282 enrolled patients with R/R MM. Eligibility in the Phase 2 portion required patients to have received at least three prior lines of therapy or have triple-class refractory MM. Linvoseltamab was administered with an initial step-up dosing regimen followed by the full dose. Additionally, in the Phase 2 portion, a response-adapted regimen enabled patients treated with linvoseltamab 200 mg who achieved a very good partial response or a complete response to shift from every two-week to every four-week dosing after a minimum of 24 weeks of therapy. The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across nine dose levels of linvoseltamab exploring different administration regimens. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary endpoint of objective response rate. Key secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression free survival, rate of minimal residual disease negative status and overall survival.

The common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on February 23, 2024, under the existing symbol 'BPTH'. The split aims to reduce outstanding shares from 12,352,664 to approximately 617,833 shares.","Bio-Path Holdings Announces 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPTH) announces a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-20 effective on February 22, 2024. The common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on February 23, 2024, under the existing symbol 'BPTH'. The split aims to reduce outstanding shares from 12,352,664 to approximately 617,833 shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is often used by companies to boost the share price and maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements. In the case of Bio-Path Holdings, the 1-for-20 reverse stock split will significantly reduce the number of shares outstanding, from approximately 12.35 million to around 617,833. This action can have both positive and negative implications for the company and its shareholders.On the positive side, a higher share price may attract institutional investors who avoid stocks under a certain threshold. It could also deter short selling, which is more prevalent in lower-priced stocks. However, on the downside, existing shareholders may interpret a reverse split as a sign that the company is in distress, particularly if the move is primarily to satisfy exchange listing requirements. Moreover, while the par value remains unchanged, the market's perception of the stock's value could be affected.For the stock market, the immediate impact will likely be a recalibration of the share price on the effective date. In the longer term, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's operational performance and the market's reception of its product pipeline, particularly its DNAbilize® antisense RNAi nanoparticle technology and clinical trials progress. Biotechnology Market Analyst The biotech sector is highly sensitive to news related to clinical trials and regulatory milestones. Bio-Path Holdings' announcement of a reverse stock split coincides with updates on its clinical trials for cancer drug candidates. The company's proprietary DNAbilize® platform is noteworthy because it represents a novel approach in the crowded field of RNAi therapeutics, which could potentially offer a competitive edge.However, the success of biotech firms like Bio-Path is highly dependent on their ability to bring drug candidates through the clinical trial process and ultimately receive FDA approval. The enrollment and dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial for Liposomal Bcl-2 and the upcoming IND application for Liposomal STAT3 are critical milestones. These developments could significantly influence the company's valuation and investor sentiment.It is important to note that while the reverse stock split does not directly affect the company's technology or clinical progress, it could be a strategic move to align the company's stock profile with its scientific advancements. If Bio-Path's drug candidates show promising results, the reduced share count post-split could amplify the positive impact on the stock price. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the reverse stock split does not alter the rights or preferences of the common stock, which is an important consideration for shareholders. The company has ensured compliance with securities laws by adjusting all outstanding securities, including stock options and warrants, as required by the terms of those securities.Additionally, the provision of whole shares in lieu of fractional shares to stockholders who would otherwise hold a fraction post-split is a common practice to avoid the complexities and costs associated with fractional share trading. This is a standard procedure in reverse splits and is generally viewed as a shareholder-friendly approach.It's also significant that the company's transfer agent will maintain the book-entry records for the common stock, simplifying the process for registered stockholders. However, it's crucial for shareholders to understand the implications of such corporate actions and to consult with their financial advisors or legal counsel, especially when it comes to adjustments in their investment portfolios. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Shares of Common Stock Will Begin Trading on a Split-Adjusted Basis on February 23, 2024HOUSTON, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPTH) (the “Company”), a biotechnology company leveraging its proprietary DNAbilize® antisense RNAi nanoparticle technology to develop a portfolio of targeted nucleic acid cancer drugs, announced that it intends to effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of 1-for-20. The reverse stock split will be effective as of 5:30 p.m., Eastern Time on February 22, 2024, and the Company’s common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the commencement of trading on February 23, 2024 under the Company’s existing symbol “BPTH.” The Company’s common stock has been assigned a new CUSIP number of 09057N409. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every 20 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the effective date will be automatically combined into one share of common stock. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. If as a result of the reverse stock split, a stockholder of record would otherwise hold a fractional share, the stockholder will receive one whole share in lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share. The reverse stock split will not change the par value of the common stock or modify the rights or preferences of the common stock. The Company anticipates that the reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding from 12,352,664 shares to approximately 617,833 shares. All outstanding securities entitling their holders to purchase shares of common stock or acquire shares of common stock of the Company, including stock options and warrants, will be adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split, as required by the terms of those securities. The Company’s transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, LLC will continue to maintain the book-entry records for the Company’s common stock. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Company’s common stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to such broker’s particular processes and procedures; if you hold your shares with such a broker, bank trust or other nominee and if you have questions in this regard, you are encouraged to contact your nominee.

Despite challenging market conditions, Caesarstone remains focused on strategic investments to reignite growth and enhance shareholder value. Positive Positive financial results for the full year with revenue of $565.2 million and cash flow from operations of $66.5 million. Initiation of significant restructuring actions in 2023 to drive long-term growth and profitability. Expected cost savings of approximately $20.0 million in 2024 and $30.0 million thereafter compared to 2023. Focus on strategic investments in brand, sales, marketing, R&D, and product expansion to drive profitable growth. Negative Decline in fourth quarter revenue to $128.5 million compared to $159.4 million in the prior year. Lower gross margin in the fourth quarter due to lower revenues, unfavorable product mix, and higher production costs. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of $33.2 million compared to $75.2 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA decrease in the fourth quarter to $1.4 million from $5.7 million in the prior year. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter increased to $1.47 from $2.15 in the prior year. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Caesarstone Ltd. indicate a significant year-over-year decline in revenue and gross margin, with full year revenue dropping from $690.8 million to $565.2 million and gross margin decreasing from 23.6% to 16.3%. This contraction is a critical indicator of the company's performance and the challenging economic conditions it faces. The drop in gross margin, particularly, can be attributed to the lower fixed cost absorption due to reduced capacity utilization and an unfavorable product mix, which is a concern as it suggests a decrease in operational efficiency and potential market competitiveness issues.Furthermore, the restructuring actions and facility closures, while aimed at cost savings, have resulted in substantial non-cash impairment charges totaling $47.9 million for the year. However, the expected future annual savings of $20.0 million in 2024 and $30.0 million thereafter are significant. These figures imply that the company anticipates a material impact on profitability and cash flow, which could be a positive sign for long-term investors if these savings are realized and effectively contribute to a leaner, more efficient operation.It is also noteworthy that despite the net losses, the company managed to end 2023 with a solid net cash position of $83.5 million, an improvement from $28.2 million in the previous year. This suggests prudent cash management and could provide a buffer against ongoing macro-economic challenges. Market Research Analyst The external factors impacting Caesarstone's performance, such as macro-economic headwinds and competitive pressures, particularly in the renovation and remodeling channels, are important to consider when evaluating the company's future prospects. The decline in volumes suggests that demand for Caesarstone's products is sensitive to economic cycles, which could mean future revenue growth is contingent on broader economic recovery, especially in the construction and home improvement sectors.Additionally, the Australian market presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Caesarstone. The ban on engineered stone containing crystalline silica, which includes Caesarstone's quartz-based products, could disrupt sales. However, the company's proactive steps to supply alternative materials could mitigate the impact and maintain its market position. This responsiveness to regulatory changes is crucial for sustaining operations in affected markets. Legal Expert The regulatory developments in Australia, with the impending ban on certain engineered stone products, represent a significant legal and operational challenge for Caesarstone. The transition to alternative materials must be managed effectively to comply with new regulations while minimizing disruption to the business. The company's ability to navigate these legal complexities will be critical in maintaining its market share in the region.Moreover, the financial implications of the ban, such as potential inventory write-offs or the costs associated with the development and marketing of new products, must be closely monitored. The legal landscape in Australia serves as a reminder of the importance of regulatory compliance and adaptability in the engineered surfaces industry. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM - Fourth Quarter Revenue of $128.5 Million and Full Year Revenue of $565.2 Million - - Full Year Cash Flow from Operations of $66.5 Million - - Initiated Restructuring Actions During 2023 to Reignite Long-term Growth and Profitability - - Expects to Realize Restructuring-Related Cost Savings of Approximately $20.0 Million in Full Year 2024 and $30.0 Million Thereafter Compared to Full Year 2023 - MP MENASHE, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Caesarstone Ltd. (NASDAQ: CSTE), a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality engineered surfaces, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Yos Shiran, Caesarstone’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “In 2023, we implemented a new strategic plan and initiated significant restructuring actions which allowed us to achieve our primary financial objective for 2023, to generate positive cash flow from operations and end the year with a solid net cash position. We achieved that despite challenging macro-economic, regional geo-political and regulatory dynamics in key markets. We continue to position Caesarstone’s production footprint advantageously around the world and our teams have executed well to generate meaningful cost savings from our global restructuring actions. We are investing a portion of those savings into our brand, improving sales and marketing and R&D activities, as well as expanding our premium porcelain products to reignite profitable growth across our business to drive value to our customers and shareholders.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $128.5 million, compared to $159.4 million in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue was down 19.6% year-over-year mainly due to lower volumes. Volumes were primarily impacted by global economic headwinds, particularly in renovation and remodeling channels, across the Company’s main regions resulting in lower demand accompanied by greater competitive pressures. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 18.1% compared to 19.4% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was 18.9% compared to 19.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross margin resulted from lower revenues, unfavorable product mix, and higher production costs due to lower fixed cost absorption mainly related to lower capacity utilization. The reduction in gross margin was partially offset by the benefits of our improved production footprint. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $56.5 million, or 43.9% of revenue, compared to $106.1 million, or 66.6% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The lower percentage is primarily attributable to lower restructuring and impairment expenses. During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a $27.7 million non-cash pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses related to Richmond Hill facility closure. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingencies and restructuring and impairment expenses, operating expenses were 24.3% of revenue, compared to 22.2% in the prior year quarter with the higher percentage mainly reflecting lower revenues. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $33.2 million compared to operating loss of $75.2 million in the prior year quarter. The difference mainly reflects lower restructuring and impairment expenses partially offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation, legal settlements and loss contingencies, restructuring and impairment expenses and for other non-recurring items, was $1.4 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the operating loss and lower gross margin. Finance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $3.7 million compared to expenses of $0.4 million in the prior year quarter. The difference primarily reflects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Net loss attributable to controlling interest for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $50.5 million compared to net loss of $74.0 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $1.47 compared to net loss per share of $2.15 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net loss per share for the fourth quarter was $0.28 on 34.5 million shares, compared to adjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.02 in the prior year quarter on a similar share count. Full Year 2023 Results Revenue in the full year 2023 was $565.2 million compared to $690.8 million in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, 2023 revenue was lower by 17.0% year-over-year, primarily attributable to lower volume. Gross margin in 2023 was 16.3% compared to 23.6% in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin in 2023 was 17.0%, compared to 23.8% in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower revenues and increased manufacturing unit costs due to lower fixed cost absorption mainly related to lower capacity utilization. This was partially offset by the benefits of an improved production footprint. Operating expenses in 2023 were $180.0 million compared to $221.9 million in the prior year. During 2023, the Company recorded a $47.9 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge related to the Sdot Yam and Richmond Hill manufacturing facility closures. Excluding legal settlements, loss contingencies, impairment and restructuring charges, adjusted operating expenses were 24.2% of revenue, compared to 21.7% in the prior year. Operating loss in 2023 was $88.0 million compared to operating loss of $58.7 million in the prior year. The year-over-year difference mainly reflects lower gross margins partially offset by lower restructuring and impairment expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash impairment charges, expenses for share-based compensation, legal settlements and loss contingencies, restructuring and impairment expenses and for other non-recurring items, was a loss of $9.4 million in 2023, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $51.9 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the lower gross margin and operating loss. Finance income in 2023 was $1.1 million compared to finance expense of $3.1 million in the prior year. The difference was primarily a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Net loss attributable to controlling interest in 2023 was $107.7 million compared to net loss of $57.1 million in the prior year. Net loss per share for 2023 was $3.13 compared to diluted net loss per share of $1.66 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted net loss per share for 2023 was $1.34 on 34.6 million shares compared to adjusted diluted net income per share of $0.31 in the prior year on a similar share count. Balance Sheet & Liquidity During the fourth quarter, the Company generated positive cash flow from operations of $13.2 million mainly driven by inventory reductions, compared to operating cash flow of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s balance sheet included cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $91.1 million and total debt to financial institutions of $7.6 million. The Company’s net cash position as of December 31, 2023, was $83.5 million compared to $28.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Restructuring and Cost Optimization Update During 2023, the Company initiated several actions under its strategic restructuring plan across the Company’s operations. These included the closure of its manufacturing facility in Sdot-Yam, Israel in mid-2023, the closure of its Richmond Hill manufacturing facility in January 2024, and a reduction in related workforce. These actions were undertaken to better align the Company’s organizational structure, streamline global production and drive additional cost efficiencies through an optimized manufacturing footprint. In connection with the facility closures, the Company incurred restructuring expenses and a one-time non-cash impairment charge totaling $27.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $47.9 million for the full year 2023, including a non-cash write-down of the long term non-cancellable lease agreement related to the Sdot-Yam property. Cash costs related to the facility closures were $1.4 million for the full year 2023. The Company estimates remaining cash costs associated with closing the facilities during 2024, will be in the range of $3.0 million to $5.0 million. The facility closures are intended to help improve the Company’s profitability and expected to collectively contribute savings of approximately $20.0 million in 2024 and $30.0 million thereafter compared to full year 2023, by optimizing the Company’s manufacturing footprint, with the potential for additional cash savings as subleases are executed on the non-cancellable long-term facility lease agreement. Following these restructuring actions, the Company continues to maintain its high level of service to customers through its remaining capacity and its third-party strategic manufacturing partners. Australia Market Update On December 13, 2023, Australian federal, state and territory governments announced a joint decision to ban the use, supply and manufacture of engineered stone slabs containing crystalline silica (including our quartz-based products) in Australia. Subject to the formal adoption of the legislation and regulations, the ban will go into effect on July 1, 2024 in most Australian states and territories. Following the decision and although there are still uncertainties as it relates to the transition period, the Company is taking the necessary steps to ensure supply of alternative materials to its Australian customers in line with its high standards in the first half of 2024 to maintain its leading position. Outlook “As we enter 2024, we believe our business is seeing signs of stabilization. The U.S. macro environment appears more encouraging with potential Fed rate cuts on the horizon to catalyze construction activity. In Australia, we are determined to maintain our leading position as we introduce our high-quality alternative products in the first half of 2024. Based on these factors, we expect first quarter revenues to trend in line with the fourth quarter and improve sequentially in accordance with our historic seasonal cadence. While macro uncertainties and the competitive landscape persist, our strategic restructuring actions initiated over the past year have put us on more solid footing with leaner operations to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024. We also expect to produce another full year of positive operating cash flow. We believe that we are poised to take hold of the promising opportunities that lie ahead,” concluded Nahum Trost, Caesarstone’s Chief Financial Officer.

Based on an analysis of all the reviews left on Tripadvisor for beaches globally over one year, the award reveals the highest-rated beaches by real people who recently visited. From rave reviews of breathtaking views to unrivaled cleanliness to watersport-friendly seas, award-winners provided the best overall experiences during this time period, and can be seen in full at tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches. ""It's hard for me to play it cool when it comes to beaches, where my all-time-favorite memories have been made. And I'm not alone: last year, Tripadvisor got millions of reviews for beaches—it's clear that our community absolutely loves them. But as our Travelers' Choice lists reveal, there's no one-size-fits-all 'beach day': Our top 25 winners alone encompass 18 countries across five continents. The top three beaches are all in Europe, ousting the perennially popular Caribbean from those spots—a sign that some travelers are eager to swap typical resort vacations for the coastlines of Portugal, Italy, and beyond."" – Sarah Firshein, Head of Editorial at Tripadvisor. Though winners span from Sydney to Seychelles to Hawaii, No. 1 in the World for 2024 is Praia da Falésia in Portugal. Set in the heart of the Algarve, the tiny fishing town of Olhos de Agua surrounds a sandy cove lapped by the Atlantic Ocean. This gorgeous stretch of white sand and colored cliffs is up from No. 6 in 2023. Top 10 Beaches in the World for 2024 Praia da Falésia – Olhos de Agua, PortugalGood for: scenic walks, sunbathingBest time to visit: Spring is a great time to visit for more affordable prices and fewer crowds.Spiaggia dei Conigli – Lampedusa, ItalyGood for: sea turtle sightings, scuba divingBest time to visit: The spring generally has the lowest hotel prices.

Plus, beat the summer crowds.Ka'anapali Beach – Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S.Good for: wildlife sightings, water sportsBest time to visit: It's never a bad time to visit Maui.

But for those who want to warm up with the masses from winter back home, January is another great time.Eagle Beach – Palm-Eagle Beach, ArubaGood for: sunbathing, jet skiingBest time to visit: With its location south of hurricane zones, there is never a bad time to visit Aruba, but going in the winter is especially sweet. While there is a slightly rainy season from October to January, the showers are usually short.Siesta Beach – Siesta Key, Florida, U.S.Good for: sunbathing, familiesBest time to visit: Fall is a great time to visit Siesta Key to snag lower hotel prices and enjoy post-summer sunshine.Varadero Beach – Varadero, CubaGood for: couples, walkingBest time to visit: U.S. citizens still need to stay up-to-date on travel policies and jump through a few hoops to visit Cuba, but hotel prices are generally the lowest in the spring.In the U.S., winners span eight different states this year, from the northern coasts of Maine to the Pacific shores of Oregon, signifying that people all over the country have access to great beaches within driving distance. However, Hawaii and Florida unsurprisingly shine with the most award-winning beaches – and Hawaii leads with 10 winners, including the coveted No. 1 spot. Ka'anapali Beach on the island of Maui has achieved the best in the U.S. title for the second year in a row. Nearing 10,000 reviews, Ka'anapali also ranks No. 4 in the world.

(ADI) reported revenue of over $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, with strong cash flow and returns to shareholders. Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic about future growth opportunities in the Intelligent Edge era. Positive Revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating cash flow reached $4.6 billion, with free cash flow at $3.2 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis. Over $600 million returned to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in the first quarter. Quarterly dividend increased by 7%, marking twenty consecutive years of growth. Appointed Richard C. Puccio as EVP and Chief Financial Officer. CEO Vincent Roche expressed confidence in the company's ability to drive shareholder value in the long term. Despite macroeconomic challenges, ADI's revenue and profitability exceeded expectations. The company expects a more favorable business environment in the second half of the year. ADI is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities with its investments in product development and customer engagement. Adjusted results show a decline in gross margin, operating income, and diluted earnings per share compared to the previous year. Cash generation and return figures for the trailing twelve months demonstrate solid financial performance. Outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue forecast of $2.10 billion, with expected operating and adjusted margins. Negative Decline in revenue, gross margin, operating income, and diluted earnings per share compared to the previous year. Negative operating margin and adjusted operating margin trends. Reduction in dividend paid and stock repurchases compared to the previous year. Actual results for the second quarter may differ from forecasts due to various factors. Financial Analyst The reported revenue and profitability figures from Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) indicate a significant year-over-year decline in revenue, gross margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. This contraction is reflective of the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted the semiconductor industry at large. The decrease in gross margin percentage and operating margin suggests increased costs or pricing pressures, which could be due to a variety of factors including but not limited to rising material costs, changes in product mix, or competitive dynamics.ADI's ability to generate operating cash flow and maintain a robust free cash flow is a positive indicator of its operational efficiency. The company's commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, even amidst a downturn, demonstrates confidence in its financial health and long-term strategy. However, the outlook for the second quarter indicates a further decrease in revenue and margins, which may raise concerns among investors regarding the near-term growth prospects and profitability of the company.It is important to note that the semiconductor industry is cyclical and ADI's anticipation of customer inventory rationalization subsiding could lead to improved performance in subsequent quarters. ADI's investments in product development and its strategic positioning for the 'Intelligent Edge' era may pay dividends in the long run, but investors should closely monitor the company's ability to navigate the current economic headwinds and execute on its growth initiatives. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is currently facing a period of adjustment after the surge in demand during the pandemic. ADI's reported decline is indicative of broader market trends, where companies are grappling with inventory adjustments and softer demand. ADI's focus on the Intelligent Edge—a sector encompassing advanced technologies at the periphery of networks, such as IoT devices and smart infrastructure—is strategically significant given the expected long-term growth in these areas.ADI's emphasis on a 'customer first' approach and agile hybrid manufacturing model may provide it with a competitive edge as the market stabilizes. The replenished die banks and short lead times mentioned by the CEO could allow ADI to respond quickly to market demand as it rebounds. However, the forecasted decrease in revenue and margins for the next quarter suggests that the market has not fully recovered and ADI, like its peers, may continue to face headwinds in the short term.Investors should consider the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for ADI to benefit from long-term secular trends, such as the growth in 5G, autonomous vehicles and AI, which are expected to drive demand for semiconductors in the future. Economist The semiconductor industry serves as a bellwether for the broader technology sector and, by extension, the global economy. ADI's financial results, characterized by a notable drop in key performance metrics, mirror the economic challenges that have been prevalent, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. The decrease in gross margin and operating margin percentages is particularly telling, as it reflects not only revenue decline but also potential increases in input costs or shifts in sales mix toward lower-margin products.ADI's projection that customer inventory rationalization will subside in the upcoming quarter could be interpreted as a sign that the industry is moving past the peak of a corrective phase, which typically follows periods of overexpansion. However, the cautious outlook for the next quarter, with lower expected revenue and margins, signals that the economic uncertainty is far from over.Investors should consider the long-term economic trends affecting the semiconductor industry, including global demand for electronics, the pace of technological innovation and international trade dynamics. ADI's results and outlook may suggest a period of consolidation within the industry, with potential implications for global economic growth and technology sector performance. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Revenue of more than $2.5 billion with continued growth in Automotive Operating cash flow of $4.6 billion and free cash flow of $3.2 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis Returned over $600 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in the first quarter Raised quarterly dividend by 7%, marking the twentieth consecutive year of increase Appointed Richard C. Puccio as EVP and Chief Financial Officer WILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Analog Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today announced financial results for its 14-week fiscal first quarter 2024, which ended February 3, 2024. “ADI delivered first quarter revenue and profitability above the midpoint of our outlook, despite the continued difficult macroeconomic environment,” said Vincent Roche, CEO and Chair. “Consistent with our prior view, we expect customer inventory rationalization to largely subside in our second quarter, and thus enter the second half in a more favorable business backdrop. Importantly, we are well positioned to capitalize on the inevitable upswing given our replenished die banks, short lead times, and agile hybrid manufacturing model.” Roche continued, “Over the past several years, we have invested at record levels in product development, customer engagement, and manufacturing activities, positioning us exceptionally well to pursue the rich opportunities of the Intelligent Edge era. The growing criticality of our technology to our customers’ success, and our ‘customer first’ approach to innovation, gives me unwavering confidence in our ability to drive shareholder value for many years to come.” Performance for the 14 Week First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Results Summary(1) (in millions, except per-share amounts and percentages) Three Months Ended Feb. 3, 2024 Jan. 28, 2023 Change Revenue $ 2,513 $ 3,250 (23 )% Gross margin $ 1,474 $ 2,124 (31 )% Gross margin percentage 58.7 % 65.4 % (670 bps) Operating income $ 586 $ 1,131 (48 )% Operating margin 23.3 % 34.8 % (1,150 bps) Diluted earnings per share $ 0.93 $ 1.88 (51 )% Adjusted Results(2) Adjusted gross margin $ 1,734 $ 2,392 (28 )% Adjusted gross margin percentage 69.0 % 73.6 % (460 bps) Adjusted operating income $ 1,054 $ 1,659 (36 )% Adjusted operating margin 42.0 % 51.1 % (910 bps) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.73 $ 2.75 (37 )% Three Months Ended Trailing Twelve Months Cash Generation Feb. 3, 2024 Feb. 3, 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,139 $ 4,550 % of revenue 45 % 39 % Capital expenditures $ (223 ) $ (1,308 ) Free cash flow(2) $ 916 $ 3,242 % of revenue 36 % 28 % Three Months Ended Trailing Twelve Months Cash Return Feb. 3, 2024 Feb. 3, 2024 Dividend paid $ (426 ) $ (1,720 ) Stock repurchases (180 ) (2,490 ) Total cash returned $ (606 ) $ (4,209 ) (1) The sum and/or computation of the individual amounts may not equal the total due to rounding.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this release. Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure, is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.

Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, special charges, net3, and tax related items4, which are described further below. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net. Free cash flow revenue percentage represents free cash flow divided by revenue. 1Acquisition Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to debt, inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include fair value adjustments associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance. 2Acquisition Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Maxim acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance. 3Special Charges, net: Expenses, net, incurred as part of the integration of Maxim, in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, other accelerated stock-based compensation expense and other cost reduction efforts or reorganizational initiatives. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. 4Tax Related Items: Income tax effect of the non-GAAP items discussed above and certain other income tax benefits associated with prior periods. We excluded the income tax effect of these tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.

Assured Guaranty provides credit enhancement products to various markets and is involved in asset management through Sound Point Capital Management, LP. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Assured Guaranty Ltd.'s dividend increase is a positive signal to shareholders, reflecting the company's financial health and confidence in its ability to generate consistent cash flow. An 11% increase in the dividend payout is significant, surpassing the average annual dividend growth rate for the S&P 500, which has historically ranged between 5-6%. This move could potentially attract income-focused investors and bolster the stock's attractiveness.Assured Guaranty's consistent dividend raises since 2012 demonstrate a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This consistency can also be indicative of a stable earnings outlook, which is a critical factor for long-term investment considerations. However, investors should also evaluate the payout ratio to ensure that the dividends are sustainable and not at the expense of the company's growth opportunities or financial stability. Market Research Analyst In the broader context of the credit enhancement and asset management industry, Assured Guaranty's dividend increase may be a strategic move to maintain a competitive edge. The company operates in a niche market, providing credit enhancement products to public finance and infrastructure sectors, which can be sensitive to economic cycles and interest rate changes. Therefore, the company's ability to raise dividends could signal underlying strength in these markets.It's also worth noting the company's involvement through its ownership interest in Sound Point Capital Management, LP, which suggests a diversified revenue stream that could support dividend payments. Potential investors and current shareholders might view this diversification as a buffer against sector-specific risks, thereby potentially reducing the stock's overall risk profile. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Company Has Raised Dividends Every Year Since 2012 HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Assured Guaranty Ltd.

Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Technology Analyst The partnership between Amwell and Amplar Health represents a strategic move in the healthcare sector, focusing on the integration of digital care technology in chronic disease prevention. The utilization of Amwell's Automated Care platform by Amplar Health signifies a shift towards proactive healthcare management, leveraging patient-generated health data to anticipate and prevent health issues before they escalate.From a business perspective, this collaboration could potentially lead to increased market penetration for Amwell in the Australian healthcare market, which is currently dominated by Medibank. By becoming a reseller of Amwell's technology, Amplar Health could influence the digital health landscape in Australia, fostering a more preventative approach to healthcare. For investors, the key metrics to watch would be the adoption rates of these programs and their impact on reducing the incidence of chronic diseases, which could translate into cost savings and improved patient outcomes. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Amwell and Amplar Health is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for digital health solutions. The integration of Amwell's technology into Amplar Health's services aligns with the broader trend of digital transformation in healthcare. The focus on chronic disease prevention is particularly relevant given the high prevalence and economic burden of chronic conditions in Australia.For stakeholders, the potential benefits include increased access to healthcare services, improved health outcomes and cost savings from averted medical treatments. However, the success of this initiative will largely depend on user engagement and the effectiveness of the digital programs in achieving tangible health improvements. The high patient satisfaction rates reported for SilverCloud in the UK and Ireland suggest a promising outlook for its implementation in Australia. Financial Analyst The announcement of Amwell's partnership with Amplar Health could have significant financial implications for both entities. For Amwell, expanding into the Australian market with Medibank's customer base could result in a considerable increase in revenue streams, assuming successful program adoption and scalability. The deal not only opens up a new market but also establishes Amwell as a key player in international digital healthcare provision.Investors should consider the potential for long-term growth and the scalability of Amwell's technology platforms. The financial performance of this partnership will depend on the cost-efficiency of the digital programs and the ability to show reduced healthcare costs due to the prevention of chronic diseases. If successful, this could set a precedent for similar partnerships and expansions into other markets, thereby diversifying Amwell's income sources and reducing dependency on existing markets. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Amplar Health to leverage Amwell’s digital care technology for chronic disease prevention programsBoston & Melbourne, Australia, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amwell® (NYSE: AMWL), a leader in hybrid care enablement, announced today that it has partnered with Amplar Health to expand access to hybrid and digital care programs across Australia. Amplar Health partnered with Amwell to support delivery of its prevention programs to reach more Australians at risk of chronic disease. The Amwell Automated Care platform will provide Amplar Health customers with access to a digital companion that can guide them through the next steps on their care journeys, whether automated or escalated to a health coach or care team member. This hybrid approach will ensure Australians have the tools to set personal health goals and make sustainable lifestyle changes that can contribute to healthier outcomes. “Healthcare has traditionally been reactive, focused on treating patients who are sick or advanced in their illnesses. We have seen significant adoption of Amwell’s automated and digital care technologies by healthcare organizations in the U.S. and U.K. that are determined to flip that paradigm on its head by using patient-generated health data to become more proactive in caring for members and patients,” said Murray Brozinsky, Amwell chief strategy officer. “Amplar Health’s hybrid approach and commitment to prevention and keeping people healthy showcases its innovation and leadership, making it a beacon for others to follow. We’re extremely honored to partner with Amplar Health and help enable this first-of-its-kind preventative health program to nurture a healthier Australia.” Amplar Health is part of the Medibank group, Australia’s largest private health insurance provider, with more than four million customers. Medibank customers will be the first to benefit from the Amplar Health and Amwell partnership, gaining access to a lifestyle management program that will launch soon. After a health check by an Amplar Health registered nurse, eligible customers will receive a referral to the automated preventative care program, which will promote wellness and aim to prevent chronic diseases. Amplar Health will also be an Australian reseller of Amwell Automated Care and the SilverCloud® by Amwell® platforms and embed the technology in its prevention programs and services. The delivery of digital mental health programs through SilverCloud has been well-received globally. The technology has a 93 percent patient satisfaction rate among the nearly 700,000 people who have used the technology in the United Kingdom through the NHS. In addition, SilverCloud has a 94 percent patient satisfaction rate among the more than 12,000 people in Ireland who have used the program for mental health care and support. “Many chronic conditions share common risk factors that are largely preventable or treatable; for example, tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diets and high blood pressure. Preventing or modifying these risk factors can reduce the risk of developing a chronic condition and result in large population and individual health gains by reducing illness and rates of death,” said Robert Read, group lead, Amplar Health. “Through our partnership with Amwell, we’re providing innovative resources and support that can help improve health literacy and facilitate better health outcomes for Australians. By embracing this technology, we can provide prevention programs at scale to our communities, supporting the broader healthcare system.” About Amplar Health At Amplar we are driven by our vision to deliver the best health and wellbeing for Australia. We are focussed on how we can make the health system experience better for people in Australia - giving them greater access, choice and control over their healthcare. With more than 30 years’ experience in healthcare delivery we are a trusted health service provider run by experienced clinicians who make healthcare more personal by co-creating health services with government, businesses and not-for-profits. Amplar Health is a business of Medibank Health Solutions Pty Ltd and part of the Medibank Group. We are committed to reforming healthcare delivery in response to the needs of Australians and to helping ensure the sustainability of the Australian healthcare system. About Amwell Amwell is a leading hybrid care, delivery enablement platform in the United States and globally, connecting and enabling providers, payers, patients, and innovators to deliver greater access to more affordable, higher quality care.

(“10 Barrel Brewing Co.” or “10 Barrel”), a trailblazer in the craft brewing industry, and Widmer Brothers Brewing (“Widmer Brothers”), the original Portland craft brewer, both subsidiaries of Tilray Brands, Inc. (“Tilray”) (NASDAQ: TLRY and TSX: TLRY), are pleased to announce a multi-year, exclusive partnership with the Portland Timbers (“Timbers”). Widmer Brothers and 10 Barrel will become the official craft beer partners of the Timbers. At the same time, Pub Beer has been named as the official Patio Beer, unveiling the “Pub Beer Patio,” a new general admission section, and the first standing-room only section in the stadium. The partnership includes the unveiling of the ‘World’s Smallest Dive Bar’ complete with the fixings that make for a bar a true dive — a dart board, pool cues, and of course, Pub Beer neon lights to lead the way to the taps. “We are thrilled to bring in 10 Barrel as an official sponsor and extend our longstanding relationship with Widmer. Adding the Pub Beer Patio to our list of fan experience options gives us the chance to offer fans a totally unique and one of a kind matchday perspective,” said CEO Heather Davis. “A top priority of ours with the creation of this space is to make it lively and accessible to all fans, and our partners 10 Barrel and Widmer have been instrumental in the execution.” “Being half a mile from the Timbers stadium, 10 Barrel’s Portland Pub has long been a pre- and post-game mainstay for fans,” said Brian Hughes, Marketing Director, 10 Barrel. “It’s been amazing to formalize this partnership and work with the Timbers staff to bring our ideas to life in an amazing venue.” In addition to the tiny dive bar on the Pub Beer patio, the stadium will host a 10 Barrel Airstream-based pub serving up a selection of their ready-to-drink cocktails. With a 700-person capacity, the field-level Pub Beer patio will be open to general admission tickets. “Widmer and the Timbers have had one of the longest running partnerships in the MLS and we couldn’t be happier to continue that relationship for the ’24 season – giving fans the opportunity to get our flagship Hefe on tap throughout the stadium,” said Brady Whalen, senior marketing director, Widmer Brothers. 10 Barrel and Widmer Brothers, leaders in the PNW craft scene and part of the larger Tilray craft beer family will also have more unique activations to come throughout the season with events happening at 10 Barrel’s Portland Pub. On game days, these include beer specials, post-game rooftop parties, and special discounts for Timbers fans.

The company deployed electric hydraulic fracturing fleets and repurchased shares. However, the fourth quarter saw a revenue decrease to $348 million, a net loss of $17 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $64 million. Despite challenges, ProPetro remains optimistic about future growth and value creation. Positive Revenue for full year 2023 was $1.6 billion, up 27% from 2022.

Challenges in the fourth quarter included a revenue decrease to $348 million and a net loss of $17 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $64 million. Guidance for 2024 includes reduced capital expenditures and anticipated fleet utilization. ProPetro remains positive about future growth and value creation. Conference call scheduled for February 21, 2024, to discuss financial results. Negative Revenue decreased in the fourth quarter to $348 million. Net loss of $17 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $64 million in the fourth quarter. Challenges faced in the fourth quarter due to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion. Net loss included $8 million of true-up depreciation related to equipment. Substantial reduction in capital expenditures for 2024 compared to 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of ProPetro Holding Corp. for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023 indicate a noteworthy year-over-year revenue increase of 27%, with net income escalating from $2 million in 2022 to $86 million in 2023. This substantial growth in profitability, especially in a volatile energy sector, suggests a robust operational performance and strategic capital allocation. The repurchase and retirement of 5.8 million shares, about 5% of outstanding common stock, reflect a shareholder-friendly capital return policy, potentially signaling management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value and future prospects.However, the fourth quarter results show a contraction with a net loss of $17 million, contrasting with the previous quarter's net income of $35 million. This decline, attributed to reduced hydraulic fracturing utilization due to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion, raises concerns about the company's short-term revenue volatility and the potential impact of external factors on its operational efficiency. This is further compounded by the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from $108 million in the previous quarter to $64 million in Q4. Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage these cyclical challenges while maintaining profitability. Energy Sector Analyst The deployment of two FORCESM electric hydraulic fracturing fleets, with two more expected in the first half of 2024 and the emphasis on Tier IV DGB Dual-fuel fleets, is a strategic move aligning with industry trends towards more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient technologies. Electric fleets in hydraulic fracturing are increasingly preferred due to their lower emissions and potential to reduce operational costs. ProPetro's transition to such technologies could enhance its competitive position in the Permian Basin, which is a key oil-producing region.The acquisition of Par Five Energy Services LLC, aimed at expanding cementing services in the Delaware Basin, demonstrates ProPetro's growth strategy through accretive acquisitions. This could diversify the company's service offerings and strengthen its market presence. Investors should consider the effectiveness of such strategic moves in generating long-term value, especially in the context of the company's capital expenditure reduction plans and the anticipated decrease in capital intensity. Market Research Analyst The forward-looking statements by ProPetro's CEO suggest confidence in the company's positioning and its ability to capitalize on value-creating opportunities in the future. The projected reduction in capital expenditures for 2024, along with the anticipated deployment of additional electric fleets, indicates a strategic shift towards capital-light assets and operational optimization. This aligns with the broader industry's focus on cost management and operational efficiency.However, the bifurcation in the service sector, as mentioned by the CEO, where demand for top-tier service providers remains strong, could imply a challenging environment for smaller or less differentiated firms. ProPetro’s emphasis on quality service and a young, next-generation equipment offering, particularly in a concentrated market like the Permian Basin, could provide a buffer against market inconsistencies. Stakeholders should weigh these strategic elements against broader market trends, including oil price fluctuations and regulatory changes impacting the energy sector. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ProPetro Holding Corp. (""ProPetro"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: PUMP) today announced financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Full Year 2023 Results and Highlights Revenue was $1.6 billion, a 27% increase over 2022. Net income increased significantly to $86 million as compared to $2 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $404 million, a 28% increase over 2022. Repurchased and retired 5.8 million shares representing approximately 5.0% of our outstanding common stock since plan inception in May 2023. Deployed two FORCESM electric hydraulic fracturing fleets operating under contract and expect two additional FORCESM fleets to be deployed in the first half of 2024. The FORCESM electric fleet deployments along with our Tier IV DGB Dual-fuel fleets will represent approximately 65% of our hydraulic fracturing capacity. Published our first ProPetro ProEnergy ProPeople Sustainability Report in October. Realized continued benefits from our optimization program which supported lower capital expenditures and our capital returns program in 2023 and is expected to support further reduced capital expenditures in 2024. Completed another accretive acquisition to expand our cementing services into the Delaware Basin. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results and Highlights Revenue was $348 million compared to $424 million for the prior quarter. Net loss of $17 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $35 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $64 million compared to $108 million in the prior quarter. Effective utilization was 12.9 fleets compared to 15.5 fleets for the prior quarter. Completed the acquisition of Par Five Energy Services LLC (""Par Five""), a Permian Basin-focused provider of cementing services in the Delaware Basin. Repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares. Deployed our second FORCESM electric hydraulic fracturing fleet under contract. (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is described and reconciled to net income (loss) in the table under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Sam Sledge, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""The fourth quarter proved to be more challenging than we had originally anticipated, largely due to additional deferred activity late in the quarter. However, despite the white space, which we attribute primarily to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion, we were able to continue to execute on our strategy through the acquisition of Par Five, the deployment of an additional FORCESM electric fleet under contract, and continued capital returns through our share repurchase program. Thanks to the hard work of our team throughout 2023, we improved profitability, executed a disciplined approach to asset deployment, successfully pursued accretive growth, and employed a sustainable capital allocation plan. We have transformed ProPetro into a leading dual-fuel and electric frac provider with a complement of premium completion services, primarily offered in the Permian Basin. We have advanced our strategy to industrialize our business, and are confident that ProPetro is well-positioned to continue to execute on value-creating opportunities in 2024 and beyond.” David Schorlemer, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “2023 was a remarkable year of progress for the Company. As we have previously noted, over the last two years, we invested over $1 billion to bring state-of-the-art technologies and completion services to ProPetro. These investments in dual-fuel conversions, electric frac technology, and the tremendous progress in our optimization program will lead to a sizeable decrease in capital spending and an improved operating expense profile going forward. We made these investments while repurchasing almost 6 million shares and protecting our liquidity and solid balance sheet. Our strategic execution coupled with the financial and operational discipline at ProPetro is working to create meaningful value for our customers and shareholders."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Summary Revenue was $348 million, compared to $424 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to our decreased hydraulic fracturing utilization caused by higher than expected seasonality, holiday, and customer budget exhaustion impacts. Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization of approximately $62 million, decreased to $261 million from $292 million during the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expense of $28 million decreased from $29 million in the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expense excluding non-recurring and non-cash stock-based compensation of $4 million and other non-recurring expenses of $2 million was $22 million, or 6% of revenue, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net loss totaled $17 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $35 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes $8 million of true-up depreciation related to changing the useful lives of certain equipment. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $64 million from $108 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to our decreased hydraulic fracturing utilization caused by higher than expected seasonality, holiday, and customer budget exhaustion impacts. Moreover, we elected to keep all fleets staffed despite the decreased utilization, in our anticipation of our customers resuming operations in early January 2024. Liquidity and Capital Spending As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33 million and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility were $45 million. Total liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 was $134 million, which included cash and cash equivalents and $101 million of available borrowing capacity under our ABL Credit Facility. Capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 were $39 million, the majority of which related to maintenance expenditures and support equipment for our FORCESM electric frac fleet offering. Net cash used in investing activities as shown on the statement of cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $71 million. Share Repurchases The Company repurchased and retired 5.8 million shares during 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased and retired 1.6 million shares. Subsequent to year-end through February 16, 2024, the Company repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares, bringing the total repurchases to 6.6 million shares, representing approximately 6% of our outstanding common stock since plan inception in May 2023. Guidance and Recent Results ProPetro’s outlook for full year 2024 incurred capital expenditures is expected to be between $200 million and $250 million, a reduction compared to $310 million in 2023. The significant year-over-year reduction is a testament to ProPetro’s strategy of employing capital light assets, such as the FORCESM electric frac fleet, and optimizing our operational and maintenance performance to reduce the capital intensity in our business. Additionally, based on its current outlook for the first quarter of 2024, ProPetro anticipates frac fleet utilization of 14 to 15 fleets. Outlook Mr. Sledge, added, “As we proceed in 2024, we expect the service sector to remain bifurcated and that demand for top tier service providers like ProPetro will remain strong throughout the year. We have already seen our activity recover from the impacts we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, we are on track to deploy our third and fourth FORCESM electric frac fleets in the first half of 2024. We believe electric equipment will play a significant role in ProPetro's future and are pleased to see strong demand for our FORCESM electric frac fleets and the commercial architecture under which they will be deployed."" Mr. Sledge concluded, ""To reiterate, despite the recent market slowdown, demand for our next generation offerings has not waned. Our strategy is designed to generate durable returns in the current low-to-no-growth market environment and through the cycle. As our dedicated blue-chip customers seek reliable completion services at competitive costs, ProPetro is uniquely positioned to provide quality service, a young, next generation equipment offering and operational density in the Permian. This differentiation continues to insulate ProPetro from some of the market inconsistency seen in other basins and in the spot market. As we continue to optimize our operations and industrialize our business, modernize our fleet, and seek opportunistic transactions in line with our commitment to disciplined capital deployment, we are confident in ProPetro’s ability to generate meaningful shareholder returns for years to come.” Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call at 8:00 AM Central Time on February 21, 2024, to discuss financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2023.

The year ended December 31, 2022 reflects amounts as reported. In 2022, we wrote off the remaining book value of prematurely failed and disposed of power ends to loss on disposal of assets. To conform to prior year presentation, we have presented these write-off amounts within loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2023. The amounts included in loss on disposal of assets in connection with premature failure of power ends during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $38.7 million and $35.9 million, respectively. (2) Represents lease costs related to operating leases on our FORCESM electric-powered hydraulic fracturing fleets. This cost is recorded within cost of services in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We did not have these leases in 2022. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We define EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense and (iii) income tax expense (benefit). We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus (i) loss (gain) on disposal of assets, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) other expense (income), (iv) other general and administrative expense (net) and (v) other unusual or nonrecurring expenses (income) such as impairment charges, retention bonuses, severance, costs related to asset acquisitions, insurance recoveries, one-time professional fees and legal settlements. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, and net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Eton Pharmaceuticals Awarded U.S. Patent for Proprietary Hydrocortisone Oral Liquid Formulation,2024-02-21T11:50:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Eton Pharmaceuticals secures US patent for ET-400 product candidate's formulation, expected to boost market exclusivity until 2043.","Eton Pharmaceuticals Awarded U.S. Patent for Proprietary Hydrocortisone Oral Liquid Formulation Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Eton Pharmaceuticals secures US patent for ET-400 product candidate's formulation, expected to boost market exclusivity until 2043. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Patent Expert The granting of a U.S. patent to Eton Pharmaceuticals for its ET-400 product candidate represents a significant milestone in the company's efforts to secure its intellectual property rights. This patent protection effectively creates a legal barrier to entry for potential competitors, effectively granting Eton a monopoly on the commercialization of this specific oral liquid hydrocortisone formulation until 2043. The inclusion of this patent in the FDA's Orange Book upon approval is crucial, as it solidifies the company's market exclusivity and can be a deterrent against generic competition.From a business perspective, this patent grant can lead to increased investor confidence in the company's pipeline and future revenue potential. The extended protection timeline gives Eton ample opportunity to recoup research and development costs and maximize profits before facing generic competition. However, while patents are a strong form of protection, they also come with the responsibility to defend against infringement, which can lead to costly legal battles. Financial Analyst The announcement of a new patent grant for Eton Pharmaceuticals is likely to have a positive impact on the company's financial outlook. Patents in the pharmaceutical industry are critical in determining a company's valuation due to their direct link to potential future earnings. This patent grant may lead to upward revisions in revenue forecasts and could be a catalyst for stock price appreciation as investors price in the longer-term revenue stream afforded by the protection.However, investors should also consider the stage of the product in the development pipeline. The ET-400 still requires FDA approval and the patent's value is contingent upon successful commercialization. Potential regulatory hurdles and market acceptance are factors that could affect the projected financial benefits of the patent. Additionally, the company's broader patent portfolio and strategy should be assessed to gauge its overall competitive moat. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market for rare disease treatments is essential when evaluating the impact of Eton Pharmaceuticals' newly granted patent. Rare diseases, by definition, affect a small segment of the population, which often leads to a high unmet medical need and the potential for significant pricing power. The exclusivity granted by the patent for ET-400 can enable Eton to set prices that reflect the innovation and value the treatment provides without immediate price erosion from generics.It is important to analyze the size of the target market for ET-400 and the competitive landscape. If the market is underserved or if current treatments are inadequate, Eton's product could capture a significant market share. However, if there are already established treatments with similar efficacy, the company may face challenges in market penetration. Additionally, payor willingness to reimburse for the treatment will be a critical factor in its commercial success. 02/21/2024 - 06:50 AM DEER PARK, Ill., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals (“Eton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has granted the Company’s U.S. Patent Application No. 18/113,458, which covers the Company’s ET-400 product candidate’s proprietary formulation of oral liquid hydrocortisone.

Osisko Development Provides Update on Upcoming Year-End  2023 Results,2024-02-21T12:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Osisko Development Corp. announces a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $80-120 million for its Trixie gold test mine. Despite this charge, management believes in the exploration potential of the property.","Osisko Development Provides Update on Upcoming Year-End 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Osisko Development Corp. announces a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $80-120 million for its Trixie gold test mine. Despite this charge, management believes in the exploration potential of the property. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of a non-cash impairment charge by Osisko Development Corp. is a significant financial event that investors must carefully consider. The estimated impairment charge of $80 to $120 million represents a substantial adjustment to the company's asset valuation. While this does not affect cash flows directly, it does indicate a reduction in the value of the Trixie mine assets on the balance sheet. Impairments can signal to investors that previous asset valuations may have been overly optimistic or that the underlying resource's market conditions have changed unfavorably.Investors should note that such impairments can affect a company's equity value and potentially its borrowing capacity. However, the management's confidence in the exploration prospects suggests that they expect future positive developments. The forthcoming mineral resource estimate will be critical in providing further context to the impairment and should be watched closely by stakeholders for indications of the mine's economic viability. Mining Industry Analyst The impairment charge concerning Osisko Development's Trixie mine is rooted in the complex factors that govern mineral asset valuation in the mining industry. The reference to assumptions about future exploration and capital expenditures, potential mining and processing methods and gold grades highlights the technical and economic challenges inherent in resource extraction. For industry observers, the impairment is a reminder of the risks associated with mining projects, particularly in the exploration phase where capital constraints can limit the realization of a project's full potential.It is also important to differentiate between the Trixie mine and the wider Tintic Project. The impairment does not reflect on the latter's copper porphyry targets, which could represent a different avenue for resource growth. The delineation of these projects within the company's portfolio underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the company's assets and their individual contributions to the overall asset base. Market Research Analyst Osisko Development's impairment news is a reflection of broader market dynamics and investor sentiment towards the mining sector. The timing of the impairment, alongside the planned release of a new mineral resource estimate, suggests a strategic approach to managing market expectations. The impairment, while a negative adjustment, could be perceived by the market as a proactive measure to align the company's asset book value with market realities, potentially mitigating the impact on the stock price when the news is fully digested.The company's emphasis on the 'highly prospective nature' of its exploration package is aimed at reassuring investors about its long-term growth prospects. The market's response to the new mineral resource estimate will be telling, as it will either validate or challenge the company's optimistic exploration outlook. Stakeholders will need to balance the immediate implications of the impairment with the potential for future discoveries and resource expansions that could enhance the company's value proposition. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM MONTREAL, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Osisko Development Corp. (NYSE: ODV, TSXV: ODV) (""Osisko Development"" or the ""Company"") announces that it has undertaken a review of the carrying value of its assets in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (the ""Impairment Analysis"") as at December 31, 2023, as part of its fourth quarter and year-end 2023 financial results preparation. As a result of the preliminary review, which is ongoing and has not been finalized, the Company believes that a non-cash impairment exists to the carrying value of its 100%-owned Trixie gold test mine (""Trixie""), located within the Company's wider Tintic Project in central Utah, U.S.A. Based on the information currently available, the preliminary Impairment Analysis suggests that a non-cash impairment charge totaling approximately between $80 and $120 million (unaudited) will be recorded against the net carrying value of Trixie. The impairment charge is primarily a result of, among other things, assumptions related to required future exploration and capital expenditures, potential mining and processing methods, and average processed gold grades related to the gold targets only. For greater clarity, the Impairment Analysis relates only to Trixie, and is unrelated to the wider Tintic Project property or the ongoing copper porphyry target drilling. Despite the expected non-cash impairment charge, management continues to believe in the highly prospective nature of the exploration package, which remains significantly underexplored in areas with known historical mining due to capital allocation constraints of its balance sheet resources. The asset impairment charge will be a non-cash item and, for the avoidance of doubt, will have no impact on Company cash flows. The Impairment Analysis will be finalized and recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company anticipates releasing a new mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for the Trixie deposit in March 2024, and its fourth quarter and year-end 2023 operating and financial results at the end of March 2024. ABOUT OSISKO DEVELOPMENT CORP. Osisko Development Corp. is a premier North American gold development company focused on high-quality past-producing properties located in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company's objective is to become an intermediate gold producer by advancing its 100%-owned Cariboo Gold Project, located in central B.C., Canada, the Tintic Project in the historic East Tintic mining district in Utah, U.S.A., and the San Antonio Gold Project in Sonora, Mexico. In addition to considerable brownfield exploration potential of these properties, that benefit from significant historical mining data, existing infrastructure and access to skilled labour, the Company's project pipeline is complemented by other prospective exploration properties. The Company's strategy is to develop attractive, long-life, socially and environmentally sustainable mining assets, while minimizing exposure to development risk and growing mineral resources.

The sale price represents a premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price. The decision to divest aligns with Piedmont's commitment to maintaining a prudent balance sheet and minimizing shareholder dilution. The company remains focused on its joint venture with Sayona Quebec and the ramp-up of North American Lithium. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the sale of Piedmont Lithium's stake in Sayona Mining represents a strategic liquidity event, potentially strengthening Piedmont's balance sheet. The transaction's timing, at a premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price, suggests a favorable deal for Piedmont, highlighting effective asset management. The proceeds of approximately US$39.4 million could provide Piedmont with additional capital to invest in core projects or reduce debt, enhancing financial flexibility. This move may be seen positively by investors as it indicates a focus on core business activities and financial prudence.Moreover, the divestiture does not affect Piedmont's joint venture or offtake position with Sayona Quebec, preserving strategic interests that are critical to the company's long-term value proposition. This suggests that while Piedmont is liquidating its direct investment in Sayona, it remains committed to its partnership and the supply chain for electric vehicle lithium resources. Stakeholders should monitor how the proceeds are allocated to gauge the impact on the company's future growth trajectory and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) market is rapidly expanding and lithium is a key component in the production of EV batteries. Piedmont Lithium's divestment from Sayona, while retaining its joint venture interest, indicates a strategic maneuver to optimize its involvement in the lithium supply chain. By focusing on their joint venture, Piedmont ensures continued access to lithium resources necessary for the burgeoning U.S. EV market, which is strategically important given the federal push for clean energy and EV adoption.It's essential to evaluate the market implications of this sale within the context of the global lithium market. The demand for lithium is expected to grow significantly and companies like Piedmont that secure supply chain positions are well-placed to benefit. Investors should consider the potential for increased competition and price volatility in the lithium market, which could affect Piedmont's future profitability and market position. Economist The sale of shares by Piedmont Lithium in Sayona Mining can be viewed through the lens of macroeconomic conditions. In an environment where interest rates are rising and there is a potential for economic tightening, companies may seek to bolster their liquidity to weather any financial uncertainties. This sale could be a preemptive move to ensure that Piedmont has the resources to sustain operations and invest in strategic areas without the need for external financing, which may become costlier in a higher interest rate environment.Piedmont's strategy to maintain a prudent balance sheet while minimizing shareholder dilution is reflective of a broader economic trend where companies are prioritizing financial stability over aggressive expansion. The decision to divest at a premium also indicates confidence in the company's valuation and timing, which may have broader implications for the lithium sector's economic outlook and investor sentiment. 02/21/2024 - 06:50 AM BELMONT, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Piedmont Lithium (“Piedmont” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: PLL; ASX: PLL), a leading global supplier of lithium resources critical to the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain, today announced the sale of the shares it held in Sayona Mining (“Sayona”) (ASX: SYA). The Company has agreed to sell 1,152.2 million shares of Sayona for A$0.052 Australian Dollars (“A$”) per share through a secondary block sale via Canaccord Genuity. The sale price represents a premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price and will result in gross proceeds of approximately A$59.9 million, or US$39.4 million for Piedmont. Following the transaction and some smaller recent public market share sales, Piedmont will no longer hold any shares of Sayona. The sale of these shares has no impact on Piedmont’s joint venture or offtake position with Sayona Quebec. The decision to divest the Sayona shares aligns with Piedmont's commitment to maintaining a prudent balance sheet while simultaneously minimizing dilution of Piedmont’s shareholders. This action, in addition to the cost-saving initiatives outlined in Piedmont’s recent corporate update, strategically positions Piedmont for the long term. “This transaction underscores our commitment to delivering long-term value for Piedmont shareholders,"" said Keith Phillips, President and CEO of Piedmont Lithium. “We acquired our initial Sayona shares as part of our strategic investment in the Sayona Quebec joint venture and will recognize a meaningful gain on the investment. We remain fully committed to our joint venture with Sayona, with a particular focus on the ongoing ramp up of North American Lithium, the largest lithium operation in North America. Our 25% joint venture interest and associated offtake agreement are core assets of Piedmont, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners at Sayona to supply IRA-qualified lithium resources critical to the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain.” About Piedmont Lithium Piedmont Lithium Inc. (Nasdaq: PLL; ASX: PLL) is developing a world-class, multi-asset, integrated lithium business focused on enabling the transition to a net zero world and the creation of a clean energy economy in North America.

(GLBE) reports strong financial performance with record GMV, revenue growth, and Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 and FY 2023. Despite market uncertainties, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth. Positive Record GMV of $1,189 million in Q4 2023, a 42% YoY increase Revenue of $185.4 million in Q4 2023, a 33% YoY increase Adjusted EBITDA of $35.2 million in Q4 2023, a 62% YoY increase GMV for FY 2023 at $3,557 million, a 45% YoY increase Revenue for FY 2023 at $569.9 million, a 39% YoY increase Adjusted EBITDA for FY 2023 at $92.7 million, a 90% YoY increase Strategic partnerships and new client acquisitions driving growth Q1 2024 and FY 2024 outlook showing continued growth trajectory Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Global-e Online Ltd. highlights substantial year-over-year growth in key financial metrics such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The 45% increase in GMV and the 39% growth in revenue indicate a robust expansion in the company's core business operations. Moreover, the significant 90% growth in Adjusted EBITDA suggests improved operational efficiency and profitability. However, the reported net loss for the full year raises questions about the company's cost structure and investment activities. Despite these losses, the optimistic outlook for 2024, with projected increases in GMV and revenue, reflects confidence in the company's strategic direction and market positioning.From a financial analysis perspective, the improved Non-GAAP gross margin, which expanded by 190 basis points for the full year, is indicative of better cost management and pricing strategies. Investors should consider the implications of these financial results on the company's valuation, liquidity position and future capital allocation. The strong customer retention and net dollar retention rates, alongside the expansion of partnerships and client base, are positive indicators of the company's competitive advantage and market share growth potential. Market Research Analyst The e-commerce sector is experiencing a shift towards cross-border transactions and Global-e's performance reflects this trend. The company's strategic partnership with Shopify and the successful integration of their systems demonstrate the importance of technological innovation and platform compatibility in the e-commerce space. The adoption of Open-AI's ChatGPT technology for customer service automation is a forward-thinking move that could set a precedent for customer experience management in the industry.Global-e's expansion in diverse geographic locations and the addition of prominent brands to their platform underscore the company's strategic focus on diversification and scalability. The outlook for 2024, with GMV expected to continue its upward trajectory, suggests that the company is capitalizing on the growing demand for cross-border e-commerce solutions. Stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to maintain high growth rates in a competitive environment and assess the sustainability of these trends in the long term. Economist The financial results from Global-e Online Ltd. must be contextualized within the broader macroeconomic environment, which has been characterized by volatility and consumer sentiment fluctuations in 2023. Despite these challenges, the company's performance indicates resilience and an ability to capitalize on the growing e-commerce sector. The macroeconomic uncertainties mentioned by the CEO for 2024, including potential consumer spending shifts and currency fluctuations, could impact cross-border transactions and, consequently, Global-e's operations.It is essential to consider how changes in international trade policies, taxation and global economic conditions could influence Global-e's business model. The company's strategic investments and the use of advanced technologies may provide a buffer against macroeconomic headwinds. However, investors should remain cognizant of the potential impact of global economic trends on the company's future performance and the e-commerce industry as a whole. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM PETAH-TIKVA, Israel, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global-e Online Ltd.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics” for additional information regarding this metric. 2 Non-GAAP Gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics” for additional information regarding this metric. 3 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information regarding this metric, including the reconciliations to Operating Profit (Loss), its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Operating Profit (Loss), its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this GAAP financial measure are not within the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation expenses. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable impact on the Company’s future financial results. Conference Call Information Global-e will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, February 21, 2024.The call will be available, live, to interested parties by dialing: United States/Canada Toll Free: 1-877-704-4453International Toll: 1-201-389-0920 A live webcast will also be available in the Investor Relations section of Global-E’s website at: https://investors.global-e.com/news-events/events-presentations Approximately two hours after completion of the live call, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site and will remain available for approximately 30 calendar days. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics To supplement Global-e’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, Global-e considers certain financial measures and key performance metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP including: Non-GAAP gross profit, which Global-e defines as gross profit adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles. Non-GAAP gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenuesAdjusted EBITDA, which Global-e defines as operating profit (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization, commercial agreements amortization, amortization of acquired intangibles, merger related contingent consideration and acquisition related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate directly to the performance of the underlying business. Global-e uses the Non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of Global-e’s overall assessment of its performance, including the preparation of Global-e’s annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of Global-e’s business strategies, and to communicate with Global-e’s board of directors concerning its financial performance. The Non-GAAP measures are used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Global-e’s definition of Non-GAAP measures may differ from the definition used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these metrics or similar metrics. Furthermore, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, Non -GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Global-e also uses Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) as a key operating metric. Gross Merchandise Value or GMV is defined as the combined amount we collect from the shopper and the merchant for all components of a given transaction, including products, duties and taxes and shipping. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation tables provided below. The accompanying reconciliation tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The partnership between Plug Power Inc. and a major U.S. automobile manufacturer signifies a notable shift in the automotive industry's approach to sustainability. The integration of hydrogen fuel cells for material handling operations is a strategic move that could set a precedent for future energy solutions within the sector. Hydrogen fuel cells offer a cleaner alternative to traditional battery solutions, with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly.From an energy sector perspective, this deal could accelerate the adoption of hydrogen technology, potentially increasing demand for green hydrogen production. The installation of on-site hydrogen infrastructure, including storage tanks and dispensers, is a substantial investment in the hydrogen economy. It not only supports the immediate needs of the facility but also lays the groundwork for broader hydrogen applications in the future.For stakeholders, the short-term implications involve capital expenditure for the installation and potential disruptions during the transition phase. However, the long-term benefits include lower operational costs due to increased efficiency and reduced carbon footprint, aligning with global sustainability goals. This move could also lead to increased investor confidence in Plug Power as a key player in green energy solutions, potentially impacting the company's stock valuation positively. Automotive Industry Analyst The implementation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in one of the largest automotive manufacturing facilities in the U.S. is a significant development for the automotive sector. It underscores the industry's commitment to adopting sustainable and efficient technologies. The transition to fuel cells for material handling equipment such as forklifts and tuggers is expected to enhance operational efficiency by reducing the downtime associated with battery charging and swaps.Moreover, the automotive industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and this initiative by a major manufacturer could encourage others to follow suit, potentially leading to a wider industry transformation. The focus on electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries at the facility aligns with the broader industry trend of electrification and the use of green hydrogen further solidifies the environmental commitment.For investors, this development could signal a competitive edge for the involved automobile manufacturer, as it demonstrates forward-thinking and adaptability to emerging energy solutions. This could translate into improved market perception and potentially bolster the manufacturer's stock performance in the long run, as consumers and regulators alike increasingly favor environmentally responsible companies. Environmental Sustainability Expert The environmental implications of transitioning to a hydrogen-powered material handling fleet are profound. Hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor as a byproduct, making them an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels and even traditional lithium-ion batteries, which carry concerns regarding mining impact and end-of-life disposal.However, it is essential to consider the source of the hydrogen. If produced using renewable energy sources, the environmental benefits are maximized, contributing to the reduction of the overall carbon footprint of the automotive industry. This initiative can also serve as a catalyst for other sectors to explore hydrogen as a viable alternative to reduce emissions.The long-term environmental benefits could be substantial, potentially influencing regulatory policies and consumer preferences. Companies that proactively invest in sustainable operations may find themselves better positioned to comply with future regulations and attract environmentally conscious consumers, which could have a positive impact on their market share and profitability. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM One of the largest automotive manufacturing facilities in the U.S., spanning over 6 square miles, to run on Plug hydrogen and fuel cell solutionsLATHAM, N.Y., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc.

Papa as New President and CEO Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags management acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Emergent BioSolutions Inc. appoints Joseph C. Papa as president and CEO to focus on public health protection, growth, and debt reduction. The company highlights key achievements in 2023, including product launches, FDA approvals, and financial improvements. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The appointment of Joseph C. Papa as president and CEO of Emergent BioSolutions Inc. is a significant corporate development, likely to influence the company's strategic direction. Papa's background suggests a focus on operational efficiency and growth, which are critical as the company aims to enhance its financial position and reduce debt. His previous experience in driving growth for pharmaceutical companies could bode well for Emergent's future, especially given the company's recent contract wins and product launches.From a financial perspective, the shift in leadership could be a catalyst for stock performance, as investors often react to changes in top management with optimism, especially when the incoming leader has a strong industry reputation. The implementation of organizational changes and resource deployment that led to substantial savings, along with the divestiture of the Travel Health business, are indicative of a proactive approach to improving the balance sheet, which is a positive signal for shareholders and potential investors. Healthcare Policy Expert Emergent BioSolutions' focus on public health preparedness and response is increasingly relevant given global health crises such as the opioid epidemic and infectious disease outbreaks. The company's products, including NARCAN® Nasal Spray and various vaccines, play a critical role in addressing these issues. The contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense for BioThrax® and RSDL®, along with FDA approvals and BARDA contracts, underscore the company's integral role in national defense and public health.For stakeholders, this translates into a potential increase in long-term value due to the steady demand for such products backed by government contracts. This is a double-edged sword, however, as reliance on government contracts can lead to volatility in revenues if policy priorities shift. Nevertheless, the current landscape suggests a sustained investment in biodefense and public health, which could benefit Emergent in the foreseeable future. Financial Analyst The financial milestones achieved by Emergent in 2023, including significant cost savings and a strategic divestiture, are indicative of a strong financial acumen within the company's leadership. The amended and extended maturity of the secured credit facility provides the company with more breathing room to manage its debt obligations, which is crucial for maintaining investor confidence.Moreover, the financial impact of new contracts and FDA approvals is likely to be substantial. Contracts worth hundreds of millions signal not only immediate revenue but also enhance the credibility and stability of Emergent's business model. Investors should note these developments as they may influence both the short-term liquidity and long-term solvency of the company. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Papa will lead Emergent into a new era of focusing on protecting public health, returning to growth and paying down the company’s debt GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emergent BioSolutions Inc.

Ero Copper Announces 2023 Production Results and Provides 2024 Guidance,2024-02-21T12:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Ero Copper Corp. announces 2023 production results, 2024 guidance, and three-year production outlook, highlighting record gold production and successful initiatives. The company expects significant growth in copper and gold production, with detailed cost and capital expenditure guidance.","Ero Copper Announces 2023 Production Results and Provides 2024 Guidance Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ero Copper Corp. announces 2023 production results, 2024 guidance, and three-year production outlook, highlighting record gold production and successful initiatives. The company expects significant growth in copper and gold production, with detailed cost and capital expenditure guidance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Ero Copper Corp's announcement detailing its production results and forward-looking guidance presents several key points for market analysis. The record gold production and the achievement of the Caraíba mill expansion design capacity are significant developments. While the company did exceed its gold production guidance, it slightly missed the copper production target due to unforeseen downtime. This discrepancy in performance could influence investor perceptions, particularly as it relates to operational efficiency and the company's ability to meet its production targets.Looking ahead, the guidance for 2024 and the three-year outlook suggest a substantial increase in copper production, which could have a positive impact on revenue and profitability, assuming copper prices remain favorable. The decrease in capital expenditures for 2024 could potentially improve free cash flow, which is often a key metric for investors. However, the projection of lower mined and processed copper grades at the Caraíba Operations, which could be offset by higher throughput volumes, introduces an element of risk that should be monitored closely.The updated C1 cash cost projections and the changes in cost calculation methodology could affect the company's cost structure and margin profile. The strength of the Brazilian Real and the assumption of 100% export of copper concentrate could have both positive and negative implications on the cost guidance and realized prices, depending on currency and commodity market fluctuations. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Ero Copper Corp's recent production results and future guidance are multifaceted. The record gold production is likely to have a positive impact on the company's earnings, especially given the high average processed gold grades reported. This could lead to an improved earnings outlook for the company, which may be reflected in stock price movements in the near term.On the other hand, the slight miss in copper production targets suggests potential challenges in operational consistency. This could be a point of concern for investors, as it raises questions about the company's ability to execute on its growth strategy and meet future production estimates. The transition from construction to commissioning at the Tucumã Project is another critical juncture that will require close scrutiny, as it will significantly influence the company's copper production profile and financials in the medium term.Furthermore, the updated cost guidance, particularly the C1 cash costs and AISC, are essential for evaluating the company's cost efficiency and competitive position in the industry. Investors will need to assess whether the projected cost efficiencies and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations align with industry norms and will support the company's profitability targets. Mining Sector Analyst The technical aspects of Ero Copper Corp's announcement, such as the completion of the NX 60 initiative and the Caraíba mill expansion, are noteworthy from a sector perspective. Achieving design capacity at the Caraíba mill is a critical milestone that can enhance the company's long-term ore processing capabilities. The integration of the expansion circuit, despite causing unplanned downtime, is a strategic investment that could lead to increased operational efficiency and throughput in the future.The anticipation of the Tucumã Project commencing production in the second half of the year is a strategic move that aligns with the company's organic growth strategy. The projected doubling of copper production by 2025, as the Tucumã Mine reaches full production, is a bold forecast that, if realized, could significantly alter the company's market position within the mining sector.It is also important to consider the implications of the updated copper C1 cash cost calculation methodology and the expected decrease in mined and processed gold grades at the Xavantina Operations. These factors could influence the company's operational cost base and its ability to maintain profitability in a fluctuating commodity price environment. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise noted) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ero Copper Corp. (TSX: ERO, NYSE: ERO) (""Ero"" or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its 2023 production results, 2024 guidance and three-year production outlook. HIGHLIGHTS Record Gold Production Driven by Successful Completion of the NX 60 Initiative The Xavantina Operations produced 59,222 ounces of gold in 2023, exceeding the increased guidance range of 55,000 to 59,000 ounces, issued on November 2, 2023, and the original 2023 guidance range of 50,000 to 53,000 ouncesAverage processed gold grades of 15.13 grams per tonne (""gpt"") represented a 98.8% increase in gold grades as compared to 2022 Caraíba Mill Expansion Design Capacity Reached by Year-End The Caraíba Operations produced 43,857 tonnes of copper in concentrate for the full year, slightly below guidance of 44,000 to 47,000 tonnesAlthough the Caraíba mill expansion design capacity was achieved by year-end, throughput volumes and copper production for the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by approximately one week of additional unplanned downtime related to the integration of the expansion circuit 2024 Guidance Consolidated copper production is expected to be 59,000 to 72,000 tonnes in concentrate at C1 cash costs between $1.50 to $1.75 per pound of copper producedThe Xavantina Operations are expected to produce 55,000 to 60,000 ounces of gold at average C1 cash costs between $550 to $650 per ounce of gold produced and all-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") between $1,050 and $1,150 per ounce of gold producedTotal capital expenditures are expected to decrease year-on-year to a range of $299 to $349 million in 2024, primarily due to the completion of the Tucumã Project, which remains on track to commence production during the second half of the year. As a result, capital spend is expected to be weighted towards the first half of 2024 Three-Year Production Outlook Consolidated copper production is projected to more than double to 95,000 to 105,000 tonnes in 2025, as the Tucumã Mine is expected to achieve its first full year of productionFollowing the successful completion of the NX 60 initiative in 2023, the Xavantina Operations are expected to sustain annual gold production levels of 55,000 to 60,000 ounces through 2026 Commenting on the production results and 2024 guidance, David Strang, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our 2023 production performance reflects the strong execution of our organic growth strategy, highlighted by the successful completion of the NX 60 initiative, which resulted in a 39% year-on-year increase in gold production. Although the completion of the mill expansion project at our Caraíba Operations necessitated additional plant downtime, culminating in full-year copper production that slightly missed our expectations, this milestone is pivotal for supporting higher sustained ore production volumes from the Pilar Mine over the long term. “We have carried this strategic momentum into 2024 as we transition from construction to commissioning at the Tucumã Project, where we anticipate initial copper concentrate production in the second half of this year. With consolidated copper production on track to increase at least 35% this year and more than double in 2025, we are actively advancing our longer-term growth initiatives. These include construction of the new external shaft at the Caraíba Operations, continued nickel exploration throughout the Curaçá Valley, and preparing for the first phase of work at the Furnas Project. ""I am proud of the progress our team has made in executing major growth initiatives announced just over two years ago. We are committed to building upon this track record as we position Ero to deliver peer-leading growth in the years ahead."" FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 PRODUCTION RESULTS Caraíba Operations Throughput volumes increased 12.8% year-on-year to over 3.2 million tonnes, despite lower-than-expected processed tonnage in Q4 2023 due to mill downtime related to the integration of the expansion circuitProcessed copper grades and metallurgical recoveries were in-line with expectations, averaging 1.49% and 91.4%, respectively, for the year Xavantina Operations Processed gold grades increased 98.8% to average 15.13 gpt for the year, more than offsetting lower year-on-year mill throughput volumes 2023 Guidance Q4 2023 Full Year 2023 Original UpdatedCaraíba Operations Tonnes Processed 812,202 3,231,667 3,300,000 —Grade (% Cu) 1.59 1.49 1.50 —Recovery Rate (%) 91.0 91.4 91.5 —Cu Production (tonnes) 11,760 43,857 44,000 - 47,000 44,000 - 47,000 Xavantina Operations Tonnes Processed 34,416 136,002 175,000 —Grade (gpt Au) 17.18 15.13 10.00 —Recovery Rate (%) 88.7 89.5 92.0 —Au Production (oz) 16,867 59,222 50,000 - 53,000 55,000 - 59,000 2024 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE AND THREE-YEAR PRODUCTION OUTLOOK The Company's 2024 production guidance and three-year production outlook reflect the ongoing execution of its organic growth strategy, including the successful completion of the Xavantina Operations' NX 60 initiative as well as the anticipated completion of the Tucumã Project, which remains on track to commence production in the second half of this year. As a result, the Company expects to deliver sustained annual gold production of 55,000 to 60,000 ounces through 2026 and more than double copper production to 95,000 to 105,000 tonnes in concentrate in 2025. At the Caraíba Operations, copper production is projected to range from 42,000 to 47,000 tonnes through 2026, with higher mill throughput volumes expected to offset lower forecast mined and processed copper grades. Following the anticipated completion of the Pilar Mine's new external shaft in late 2026, the Company expects mined and processed copper grades to increase as mining from the high-grade Deepening Extension Zone ramps up. Copper production from the Tucumã Operations is expected to increase from 17,000 to 25,000 tonnes in the second half of 2024 to 53,000 to 58,000 tonnes in 2025, when the mine achieves its first full year of production. The Tucumã mill is expected to sustain nameplate throughput levels of approximately 4.0 million tonnes per annum beginning in 2025 with strong mined and processed copper grades projected through 2026. At the Xavantina Operations, higher mill throughput levels are expected to offset lower mined and processed gold grades over the next three years. In 2024, gold production is expected to be slightly weighted towards the first half of the year due to higher anticipated gold grades compared to the second half of the year. 2024 2025 2026Copper (tonnes) Caraíba Operations 42,000 - 47,000 42,000 - 47,000 42,000 - 47,000Tucumã Operations 17,000 - 25,000 53,000 - 58,000 48,000 - 53,000Total Copper 59,000 - 72,000 95,000 - 105,000 90,000 - 100,000 Gold (ounces) Xavantina Operations 55,000 - 60,000 55,000 - 60,000 55,000 - 60,000 Note: Guidance is based on estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, mineral reserve estimates, grade and continuity of interpreted geological formations and metallurgical recovery performance.

This range incorporates several key updates relative to previous 2024 C1 cash cost projections: The foreign exchange rate has been adjusted from 5.30 to 5.00 Brazilian Real (BRL) per U.S. Dollar (USD), reflecting the BRL's continued strengthGuidance includes higher concentrate treatment and refining charges based on Q4 2023 levels, which have shown a favorable downward trend year-to-dateConsumable cost assumptions have been refreshed higher to align with consumable pricing observed in Q4 2023The Company has assumed the Caraíba Operations will export 100% of its copper concentrate in 2024, up from the 50% previously assumed Furthermore, in light of changes to the Caraíba Operations' copper concentrate sales channels, the Company has updated its copper C1 cash cost calculation methodology1. This change will be offset by an equal increase in reported realized copper prices. At the Xavantina Operations, the C1 cash cost guidance range of $550 to $650 per ounce of gold produced reflects improved fixed cost efficiencies driven by higher expected gold production, partially offsetting the impact of planned decreases to mined and processed gold grades. The AISC guidance range for 2024 is $1,050 to $1,150 per ounce of gold produced. 2024 cost guidance assumes a foreign exchange rate of 5.00 USD:BRL, a gold price of $1,900 per ounce, and a silver price of $23.00 per ounce. Copper C1 Cash Cost ($/lb) Caraíba Operations $1.80 - $2.00Tucumã Operations $0.90 - $1.10Consolidated Copper Operations $1.50 - $1.75 Gold C1 Cash Cost ($/oz) $550 - $650Gold All-In Sustaining Cost ($/oz) $1,050 - $1,150 Note: C1 Cash Costs and AISC are non-IFRS measures. Please see the Notes section of this press release for additional information. 1. For further details, please refer to the definition of ""C1 Cash Cost of Copper Produced (per lb)"" the Notes section below. 2024 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE GUIDANCE 2024 capital expenditures are expected to decrease to a range of $299 to $349 million due to the anticipated completion of the Tucumã Project, which is on track to commence production in the second half of the year. As a result, capital spend is expected to be weighted towards the first half of 2024. The table below includes an estimated $30 to $40 million of consolidated exploration expenditures. This estimate includes approximately $20 million designated for drilling activities at the Caraíba Operations, including expenditures related to the Curaçá Valley nickel exploration program. Additionally, the Company has budgeted approximately $6 million for the first phase of work at the Furnas Project. The 2024 capital expenditure guidance assumes an exchange rate of 5.10 USD:BRL for the Tucumã Project based on designated foreign exchange hedges with a weighted average ceiling and floor of 5.10 and 5.23 USD:BRL, respectively. All other capital expenditures assume an exchange rate of 5.00 USD:BRL. Figures presented below are in USD millions.

These performance measures have no standardized meaning prescribed within generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS and, therefore, amounts presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies. These non-IFRS measures are intended to provide supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. C1 Cash Cost of Copper Produced (per lb) C1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb) is a non-IFRS performance measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate the operating performance of its copper mining segment and is calculated as C1 cash costs divided by total pounds of copper produced during the period. C1 cash costs comprise the total cost of production, including expenses related to transportation, and treatment and refining charges. These costs are net of by-product credits, incentive payments and certain tax credits associated with sales invoiced to the Company's Brazilian customers. Effective Q4 2023, the Company is including freight parity charged by its customers as part of treatment, refining and other costs within the calculation of C1 cash costs. This charge was previously presented as a reduction in realized copper price. While the C1 cash cost of copper produced per pound is widely reported in the mining industry as a performance benchmark, it does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed as a supplement to IFRS measures. C1 Cash Cost of Gold produced (per ounce) and AISC of Gold produced (per ounce) C1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce) is a non-IFRS performance measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate the operating performance of its gold mining segment and is calculated as C1 cash costs divided by total ounces of gold produced during the period. C1 cash cost includes total cost of production, net of by-product credits and incentive payments. C1 cash cost of gold produced per ounce is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in supplemental to IFRS measures. AISC of gold produced (per ounce) is an extension of C1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce) discussed above and is also a key performance measure used by management to evaluate operating performance of its gold mining segment. AISC of gold produced (per ounce) is calculated as AISC divided by total ounces of gold produced during the period. AISC includes C1 cash costs, site general and administrative costs, accretion of mine closure and rehabilitation provision, sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining leases, and royalties and production taxes. AISC of gold produced (per ounce) is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in supplement to IFRS measures.

CAUTIONARY NOTES REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES In accordance with applicable Canadian securities regulatory requirements, all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates of the Company disclosed or incorporated by reference in this press release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and are classified in accordance with CIM Standards. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) generally applicable to U.S. companies. For example, the terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve”, “probable mineral reserve”, “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information contained in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies reporting pursuant to SEC disclosure requirements. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Pursuant to the CIM Standards, mineral resources have a higher degree of uncertainty than mineral reserves as to their existence as well as their economic and legal feasibility. Inferred mineral resources, when compared with measured or indicated mineral resources, have the least certainty as to their existence, and it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured mineral resource as a result of continued exploration. Pursuant to NI 43-101, inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of any economic analysis. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral resource exists, will ever be converted into a mineral reserve, or is or will ever be economically or legally mineable or recovered.

World Health Organization's Global Strategy aims to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030, recognizing the potential of at-home testing to prevent cases caused by HPV infections. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of the at-home self-collection HPV test by BD and Camtech Health represents a significant advancement in public health, specifically in the area of cervical cancer prevention. By circumventing traditional barriers to screening such as time constraints, privacy concerns and fear, this initiative could potentially increase screening rates and early detection of high-risk HPV strains. From a medical research perspective, the data provided by increased screening can enhance our understanding of HPV prevalence and genotype distribution, thereby informing future public health strategies and interventions.Moreover, the ability to identify specific high-risk genotypes, such as HPV52 and HPV33/58, which are more prevalent in Singapore, is crucial. The BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay's capability to test for these genotypes individually rather than in pooled results could lead to more accurate risk assessment and personalized follow-up care. This precision in testing aligns with the global shift towards personalized medicine and could result in more effective resource allocation and treatment strategies. Health Economist From an economic standpoint, the launch of the at-home HPV self-collection program could be a cost-effective solution to the public health challenge of cervical cancer screening. By reducing the need for in-person clinic visits, the program may lower healthcare system costs associated with clinician time, clinic space and associated overheads. Additionally, early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can significantly reduce the financial burden of advanced cervical cancer treatment on both the healthcare system and patients.However, the cost of the self-collection kits and the subsequent analysis must be evaluated against the potential savings. If the kits are priced accessibly and covered by health insurance, the program could be widely adopted, leading to substantial long-term savings. The economic benefits also extend to the workforce, as women can undergo screening without needing to take time off work, thus maintaining productivity. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership between BD and Camtech Health taps into a growing market for at-home health testing, which has seen increased demand due to the convenience and privacy it offers. This program's success could set a precedent for similar at-home diagnostic tests, potentially expanding the market for both companies involved. For investors, the partnership's impact on BD's market share and revenue growth in the diagnostics segment is worth monitoring, especially considering the global push for cervical cancer elimination by the WHO.As the program is the first of its kind in Singapore, its reception and adoption rates will provide valuable insights into consumer behavior regarding at-home health testing in Asia. Should the program prove successful, it may lead to increased investor confidence in BD's innovation capabilities and strategic partnerships, potentially influencing the company's stock performance positively. 02/21/2024 - 06:45 AM First-Ever Program in the Country to Offer At-Home Self-Collection of Samples for HPV Testing SINGAPORE, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today announced a strategic partnership with Camtech Health, a digital health company focused on at-home health testing, to advance cervical cancer screening by offering the first-ever option for women in Singapore to self-collect a sample in the privacy of their own home. The program combines the Camtech Health HPV (human papillomavirus) test for self-collection with the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay, which is a clinically validated test that can simultaneously detect 14 high-risk HPV strains (or ""genotypes""). The program objective is to improve the rate of cervical cancer screening in Singapore, where less than half of eligible women are currently being tested. ""For women in Singapore, lack of time, embarrassment, fear and inconvenience are among the key barriers to screeningi, and before now, Singapore only offered HPV testing via hospital or clinic settings with a speculum examination and a clinician collection,"" stated Dr. Jeff Andrews, vice president of Global Medical Affairs at BD. ""Cervical cancer is preventable, precancer is curable, and programs like this help to support the national goal of cervical cancer elimination. Not only does self-collection afford women greater access to HPV testing by enabling them to collect a sample in privacy at a time and place of their choosing, but they can also feel confident that the reliability of self-collected samples is comparable to those collected by a clinicianii."" In late 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer, recognizing the potential to virtually eliminate cervical cancer as a public health threat, recognizing the potential to eliminate cervical cancer in our lifetimeiii. The strategy established clear targets to achieve by 2030 for HPV vaccination coverage (>90%), screening coverage (>70%) and access to treatment (>90%). At-home collection can help address the urgent public health challenge of reaching women who do not attend routine cervical cancer screening. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, with an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020.ivAlmost all cervical cancer cases (more than 95%) are caused by a persistent HPV infection, an extremely common virus transmitted through sexual contact.iIn Singapore, cervical cancer ranks as the 10th most frequent cancer among women and the 4th most frequent cancer among women between 30 and 39 years of age.vCervical cancer screening among all women in Singapore aged 25 – 74 decreased by 17% between 2007 and 2019; from 58% to 48%.viAmong those aged 25-29, the decline has been more precipitous—from nearly 50% in 2007 to only 21% in 2019.v""Making at-home self-collection available is the first step to empowering health and well-being, but making the test easy to use is just as important,"" said Kuok Meng-Han, Chairman of Camtech Health. ""The Camtech Health HPV test with the Camtech Health app is completed in simple steps and then sent via postage-paid packaging provided in the kit. The sample is analyzed using the BD Onclarity™ HPV assay, and the BD Viper™ LT fully automated integrated molecular testing system, and physician-reviewed results are provided on the app with a virtual consultation to discuss any abnormalities."" HPVs are a large group of related viruses. Each virus in the group is given a number, which is called an HPV genotypevii (or ""type""). BD Onclarity™ is the only FDA-approved assay that tests for an extended set of HPV types individually, and particularly for HPV52 and HPV33/58, three HPV types that pose a high-risk for causing cervical cancer in Singapore. Most clinically validated tests report multiple HPV types in a single pooled result, which can mask the true risk of developing cervical cancer. Being able to identify the high-risk genotypes that are prevalent in cervical cancers in the country is critical to the detection and prevention of cervical cancer. ""Providing women the ability to self-collect in the convenience of their own home is critical to improving their access to cervical cancer screening, and empowering women to take charge of their own health, especially among underserved communities in Singapore who might be deterred from seeking healthcare,"" said Dr. Ida Ismail-Pratt, Advisor of the Alliance for Active Action against HPV (A4HPV), a youth-led non-profit committed to increasing awareness about HPV and its related cancers, by working on effective strategies for equitable and affordable cervical cancer screening access across the Commonwealth. ""With less than 50% of women in Singapore regularly screening for cervical cancer, it is heartening that this self-collection option is finally available in Singapore for the first time. We hope that this additional option will help Singapore to reach the WHO's cervical cancer screening goal of 70% by 2030, and truly leaving no one behind.'' Combining HPV self-collection with an assay that individually identified more kinds of HPV allows clinicians to focus on those women at highest risk while not overtreating those at very low risk by allowing risk stratification directly on the screening sampleVI. The BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay received the industry's first CE Mark for HPV screening from at-home self-collected vaginal samples. Camtech Health is a digital health company that is focused on empowering people across Singapore and Southeast Asia to take control of their health and well-being and lead healthier and fuller lives. Camtech does this by integrating multiple disciplines to deliver a seamless sample-to-insight testing experience using home self-collection test kits – all in the convenience and comfort of their own home.

Rush has executed the Fifth Amendment to the Brewer Option Agreement with the Brewer Gold Receiver (""Receiver""), which eliminates any option payments during exploration and until closing a potential purchase. Highlights:No option payments for remainder of Option Period (through December 31, 2030)Purchase price formula streamlined to be 60% of government past costs through 2024 plus pro-rated annual government costs from 2025 until closing, should Rush exercise its optionFinancial assurance at closing can be satisfied through one of five non-cash methodsCarolina Rush President and CEO Layton Croft commented: ""We extend our sincere appreciation to the Receiver, South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for their steadfast support of Carolina Rush. Their continued endorsement reaffirms their belief in our capacity to explore the Brewer Gold-Copper Project responsibly and successfully. With the amended Option Agreement providing almost 7 years without option payment requirements, we can deploy maximum available capital into the ground for ongoing exploration."" Court-appointed Receiver Kelly Lowry stated: ""It is my responsibility to oversee the Brewer property, including Carolina Rush's operations, and to coordinate with SC DHEC and EPA, the two regulatory agencies currently responsible for remediation of the site. Recognizing that successful and responsible minerals exploration demands ample time, Rush's diligence, excellent work and professionalism to date justifies the amendment of the Option Agreement. The adjustment defers previously stipulated annual option payments, originally slated to commence in 2025, to the closing of Brewer's sale, contingent on Rush's decision to exercise its option. We all share a common goal of success at Brewer, provided that Rush maintains its current performance standards in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and agreements.""The Brewer site covers 397 hectares (981 acres) of private land located 115 kilometers (72 miles) southeast of Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. The property enjoys easy access, streamlined permitting, excellent infrastructure, and a robust regional mining supplier and labor pool. Brewer is located 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) from the producing, open pit and underground Haile Gold Mine. Haile provides a positive example of South Carolina's pro-mining commitment, especially to the revitalization of historic mines into modern, environmentally responsible operations. Acquisition of Brewer comes without any underlying royalties and with all existing infrastructure, facilities and equipment from previous mining operations. This includes high voltage power lines connected to a nearby transformer sub-station, extensive graded roads, site-wide water distribution infrastructure and treatment systems, an abundant industrial water supply for potential future mining operations, dozens of groundwater monitoring wells, heavy machinery and vehicles, equipped office and maintenance facilities, and more than 283 hectares (700 acres) of quality timber reserves. Brewer Option AgreementIf Rush exercises its option to purchase Brewer, the price will be determined by two components: 1) 60% of past costs incurred by SC DHEC and EPA at Brewer between 2005-2024; and 2) the pro-rated sum of deferred annual payments incurred by the Company from 2025 through 2030. Also, if Rush exercises its option to purchase Brewer, it will be required to post financial assurance at closing, which, according to EPA guidelines, can be satisfied through one of the following: Trust Funds; Letters of Credit; Surety Bonds; Insurance Policies; Corporate Financial Tests; or Corporate Guarantees (https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/financial-assurance-superfund-settlements-and-orders). The amended Brewer Option Agreement also stipulates that Rush will abandon all exploration boreholes in accordance with SC DHEC regulations. To date the Company has capped but not yet abandoned 19 holes, in order to be able to conduct downhole geophysical surveys and/or extend holes later in the program. The Option Agreement requires Rush to deposit US$150,000 in a Receiver-controlled escrow account within 120 days of the Fifth Amendment's effective date (February 20, 2024). The Company will report to the Receiver and SC DHEC on a quarterly basis the updated status of borehole abandonment, after which the funds in escrow will be adjusted accordingly. For more details about the Brewer Option Agreement and the history of Brewer, see https://thecarolinarush.com/brewer-gold-copper-project/. History of BrewerGold was first discovered at Brewer in the 1820s, as part of North America's first gold rush. About 200,000 ounces of gold has been produced at Brewer historically. From 1987-1995, Brewer produced 178,000 ounces of oxide gold from two open pits that extended to 50-metre depths. Operated by the U.K.-owned Brewer Gold Company (""BGC""), more than 12 million tons of ore and waste rock were mined from two open pits. After ceasing mining operations, BGC's reclamation efforts from 1995-1999, guided by SC DHEC, fell short of achieving a fully reclaimed site. BGC abandoned the site in 1999, leaving SC DHEC and the EPA to manage the site, finalize reclamation, and treat acid-mine drainage until today.In 2005, the Brewer site was designated a US EPA Superfund site as per the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensations and Liability Act (""CERCLA"") due to water quality threats. BGC's abandonment of the property left SC DHEC and EPA with no options for addressing water quality threats from the site other than using the CERCLA response actions funded by EPA and SC DHEC. Both entities retained access to the property for purposes of constructing, operating, and maintaining the wastewater treatment plant and otherwise carrying out the CERCLA remedy. With the interim wastewater treatment addressing potential environmental risks, in 2019, SC DHEC, through a South Carolina court, appointed the Brewer Gold Receiver (a legal construct similar to a trustee) to facilitate the leasing, sale or other use or disposition of the abandoned property, including potential renewal of mineral exploration and mining development. In January 2020, Carolina Rush (then known as Pancontinental Resources) emerged as the chosen entity, through a competitive process, to explore and purchase the former Brewer Gold Mine Property (see Company news releases dated January 15, 2020, March 2, 2020, April 22, 2020, March 23, 2022, and July 12, 2022).

The company announced plans to acquire Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC and highlighted the success of Glo Fiber in driving revenue and EBITDA growth. Despite positive results, there are challenges such as declining Tower segment revenue and the need for additional growth capital. Positive Significant growth in Glo Fiber data customers, passings, and revenue. Consolidated revenue grew by 7.5% to $287.4 million in 2023. Consolidated net income was $8.0 million in 2023 compared to a net loss of $8.4 million in 2022. Acquisition agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests in Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA grew by 19.3% to $90.6 million in 2023. Broadband Total Broadband Data Revenue Generating Units grew by 13.0% in 2023. Broadband revenue grew by $20.2 million to $269.3 million in 2023. Tower segment revenue decreased by 1.5% to $18.6 million in 2023. Capital expenditures increased to $256.6 million in 2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $139.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Total indebtedness was $300 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative Tower segment revenue decreased by 1.5% in 2023. Tower Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 2.8% in 2023. RLEC & Other revenue decreased by 6.7% in 2023. Tower operating income remained flat in 2023. Tower revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was consistent with revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022. Financial Analyst The reported growth in Shenandoah Telecommunications Company's (Shentel) Glo Fiber data customers and passings indicates a robust expansion strategy that has translated into significant revenue growth. A 71.7% increase in data customers and a 58.6% increase in passings are considerable achievements that suggest effective market penetration and operational efficiency. The reported 91.9% revenue growth for Glo Fiber is particularly impressive, outpacing the consolidated revenue growth of 7.5%. This disparity suggests that while Glo Fiber is a strong growth driver, other segments may be experiencing slower growth or facing challenges.The turnaround from a net loss in 2022 to a net income in 2023 is a positive signal for investors, reflecting improved operational performance and possibly the benefits of strategic initiatives such as network rationalization and cost management. The 19.3% growth in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is another highlight, as it is a key indicator of the company's operational profitability and ability to generate cash flow. The forward-looking statement regarding the potential to double Glo Fiber data customer penetration over the next five years is ambitious and, if realized, could significantly enhance shareholder value.However, the Capital Expenditures (CapEx) increase of $66.9 million, driven by expansion, raises questions about the long-term sustainability of such growth rates and the impact on free cash flow. Investors should consider the balance between growth investments and the generation of positive cash flow, as well as the implications of the planned acquisition of Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC for $385 million. Market Research Analyst Shentel's strategic decision to focus on the expansion of its Glo Fiber Markets is indicative of the broader industry trend towards fiber-optic technology to meet growing consumer demand for higher-speed internet services. The reported penetration rates of 17.8% for Glo Fiber Markets and 50.8% for Cable Markets highlight the significant growth potential for Glo Fiber, given the lower current penetration compared to the more mature Cable Markets.The company's ability to increase Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU) by 4.0% in Glo Fiber Markets is noteworthy as it suggests pricing power and value perception among consumers. The churn rate of 1.0% is also a critical metric, indicating strong customer retention amidst the expansion. The reported growth in Commercial Fiber revenue, despite the loss of T-Mobile backhaul circuits, shows resilience in the company's commercial offerings.On the downside, the decline in Rural Local Exchange Carrier (RLEC) & Other revenue and the decrease in video subscribers in Cable Markets reflect broader industry challenges, such as the decline in traditional DSL subscribers and the trend of cord-cutting. These trends could have long-term implications for revenue diversification and stability. Legal Expert Shentel's definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC and the plans to potentially sell some or all of its tower portfolio as part of its capital-raising strategy are significant strategic moves that require careful legal consideration. Regulatory approval will be a key factor for the acquisition and the outcome will have material implications for the company's operational scope and financial position.The acquisition's consideration mix of cash and common stock illustrates a balanced approach to financing, which could mitigate the impact on the company's leverage. However, the increase in total indebtedness to $300 million as of the end of 2023 poses potential concerns regarding the company's debt capacity and financial flexibility post-acquisition.Additionally, the completed sale of 2.5 GHz spectrum indicates proactive portfolio management and the associated cash inflow could have contributed to the company's liquidity position. Legal and regulatory expertise will continue to be pivotal in navigating these strategic initiatives while ensuring compliance and minimizing risk. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM EDINBURG, Va., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (“Shentel”) (Nasdaq: SHEN) announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial and operating results. 2023 Highlights Glo Fiber data customers grew 71.7% year-over-year to approximately 42,000.Glo Fiber passings grew by approximately 86,400, or 58.6%, to approximately 234,000.Glo Fiber revenue grew 91.9% to $35.1 million.Consolidated revenue grew 7.5% to $287.4 million.Consolidated net income in 2023 was $8.0 million, compared with consolidated net loss of $8.4 million in 2022.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA1 grew 19.3% to $90.6 million in 2023, compared with $76.0 million in 2022.Announced in October 2023 agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests in Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC. “Glo Fiber continues to be the major catalyst for our strong growth and is now our largest line of business in terms of passings.

French. “We believe we have the potential to more than double our Glo Fiber data customer penetration rate over the next five years, creating an excellent opportunity to continue to drive strong consolidated CAGR results.” Shentel’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call will be webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, February 21, 2024.

Full Year 2023 Results Broadband Total Broadband Data Revenue Generating Units (“RGUs”) grew 17,459, or 13.0%, in 2023 to 151,389. Glo Fiber Markets Data RGUs grew 17,424, or 71.7%, year-over-year to 41,710, driven by network expansion of 86,393 passings and churn of 1.0%. Cable Markets Data RGUs grew 35 to 109,679. Penetration for Glo Fiber Markets and Cable Markets were 17.8% and 50.8%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Broadband revenue grew $20.2 million, or 8.1%, to $269.3 million. Residential & SMB revenue in Glo Fiber Markets increased approximately $16.8 million, or 91.9%, during 2023, primarily driven by 71.7% year-over-year growth in data RGUs and a 4.0% increase in data Average Revenue per Unit (“ARPU”). Residential & SMB revenue in Cable Markets, excluding discontinued Beam operations, increased approximately $2.5 million, or 1.4%, during 2023, primarily driven by 1.8% year-over-year growth in data ARPU. Commercial Fiber revenue increased approximately $3.3 million, or 8.5%, during 2023, primarily driven by $3.0 million in T-Mobile non-recurring early termination fees and $0.3 million in recurring revenue driven by year-over-year growth in connections. T-Mobile disconnected 338 backhaul circuits during 2023 as part of their previously announced rationalization of the former Sprint network. The Company expects approximately $1 million of additional annual revenue churn as part of the network rationalization. Rural Local Exchange Carrier (“RLEC”) & Other revenue decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 6.7%, compared with 2022, primarily driven by a decline in residential DSL subscribers. Broadband operating expenses decreased approximately $0.2 million, or 0.1%, to $228.1 million in 2023, compared with 2022. The primarily drivers were lower impairment charges and depreciation charges resulting from the discontinuation of Beam fixed wireless in 2022 as well as lower payroll costs due to higher capitalized labor. These lower expenses were partially offset by higher line costs due to the expansion of the network into new markets, and higher advertising costs associated with the Company’s expansion of Glo Fiber. Broadband operating income in 2023 was $41.1 million, an increase of 98.6% compared with $20.7 million in 2022. Broadband Adjusted EBITDA2 in 2023 was $105.8 million, an increase of 17.6% compared with $90.0 million in 2022. Tower Total macro towers and tenants were 219 and 453, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 compared with 222 and 446, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Revenue decreased approximately $0.3 million, or 1.5%, in 2023 to $18.6 million compared with 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower intercompany lease revenue from ceasing Beam service in 2022. Operating expenses decreased approximately $0.3 million, or 2.8%, in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily driven by lower depreciation as a result of fewer depreciable tower assets in 2023 compared to 2022. Tower operating income in 2023 was $9.5 million, approximately flat compared with $9.5 million in 2022. Tower Adjusted EBITDA3 in 2023 was $11.6 million, a decrease of 2.8%compared with $11.9 million in 2022. 1 Non-GAAP measure.

Consolidated Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew 3.6% to $72.5 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to growth of 3.7% in the Broadband segment. Consolidated net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.6 million, compared with net loss of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $22.9 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 8.8%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 due to growth of 8.9% in the Broadband segment and 9.3% growth in the Tower segment, partially offset by a 9.2% increase in corporate expenses. Broadband Broadband revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew $2.4 million, or 3.7%, to $67.9 million compared with $65.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Residential & SMB revenue in Glo Fiber Markets increased approximately $4.7 million, or 79.2%, during 2023, primarily driven 71.7% year-over-year growth in data RGUs and 7.1% increase in data ARPU. Residential & SMB revenue in Cable Markets decreased approximately $0.4 million, or 0.8%, during 2023, primarily driven by a 11.2% decrease in video subscribers due to accelerated cord cutting. Commercial Fiber revenue decreased approximately $1.1 million, or 10.4%, primarily driven by timing of T-Mobile early termination fees. T-Mobile disconnected 338 backhaul circuits during 2023 as part of their previously announced rationalization of the former Sprint network. RLEC & Other revenue decreased approximately $0.6 million, or 15.3%, compared with 2022, primarily driven by a decline in residential DSL subscribers. Broadband operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $57.1 million compared with $61.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to $4.8 million in lower depreciation due to 2022 accelerated depreciation of Beam network assets associated with the Company’s decision to permanently cease Beam operations, for which no equivalent accelerated depreciation was present in 2023. Broadband operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10.8 million, an increase of 200% compared with $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Broadband Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $26.8 million, an increase of 8.9% compared with $24.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Tower Tower revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was consistent with revenue for fourth quarter of 2022. Tower operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.5 million, an increase of 32.2% compared with $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower depreciation and rent expense. Tower Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.0 million, an increase of 9.3% compared with $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Other Information As previously announced, on October 24, 2023, Shentel entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests in Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC for $385 million. Consideration will consist of $305 million in cash and $80 million of Shentel common stock. Closing is expected to occur in the first half of 2024 after regulatory approvals are received. The Company plans to raise additional growth capital for the FTTH network expansion, government grant projects and general corporate purposes, which may include the sale of some or all of its tower portfolio as well as exploring other strategic alternatives. Capital expenditures were $256.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with $189.6 million in 2022. The $66.9 million increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher spending in the Broadband segment driven by the expansion of Glo Fiber Markets. As of December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $139.3 million and the availability under our revolving line of credit was $100.0 million, for total available liquidity of $239.3 million. During 2023, we borrowed a total of $225.0 million under our term loans and had total indebtedness of $300 million as of December 31, 2023. On July 6, 2023, the Company closed on the sale of its 2.5 GHz spectrum for $17.3 million in cash and $3.8 million in assumed liabilities.

A reconciliation of net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below herein. Adjusted EBITDA margin is the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, divided by revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental measures of performance to evaluate operating effectiveness and assess its ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth and the scalability of the Company’s business growth strategy. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by the Company in its incentive compensation programs. The Company believes that the exclusion of the expense and income items eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company’s ongoing operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results. However, use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as analytical tools has limitations, and investors and others should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.

(SPIR) secures two framework contracts from the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) worth €8.4 million to provide satellite AIS data services for vessel tracking over a four-year period. The contracts aim to enhance global vessel monitoring, particularly in areas with limited terrestrial AIS network coverage, to improve maritime safety and environmental protection. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The awarding of two framework contracts to Spire Global, Inc. by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) represents a substantial commitment for the company, with a maximum overall budget of €8.4 million. From a market perspective, this development signals a robust demand for Spire's space-based data and analytics services and could potentially bolster investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and revenue stability.Spire's specialization in space-based automatic identification system (SAT-AIS) data services is particularly significant given the strategic importance of maritime safety and the growing need for global vessel tracking capabilities. The extension of this service to areas with limited terrestrial AIS network coverage, such as polar regions, underscores the company's ability to address niche market demands, which could lead to further specialization and market differentiation.Additionally, the integration of Spire's data into EMSA's SAT-AIS services not only enhances maritime domain awareness but also indicates potential for future contracts and collaborations with EU institutions and international entities. This could pave the way for Spire to secure a more dominant position in the space services market, potentially impacting its stock valuation positively. Financial Analyst Spire Global's receipt of these contracts could have a tangible impact on their financials. Given the multi-million euro value and the four-year duration, this deal provides a predictable revenue stream, which is a positive indicator for financial analysts and investors. The long-term nature of the contracts also suggests a degree of financial stability and may reduce the volatility of future earnings projections.It is important to note that contracts of this scale can lead to increased operational costs, as the company may need to scale up its infrastructure and capabilities to meet the service requirements. However, if managed efficiently, the increased expenditure can be offset by the revenue generated, leading to improved profit margins over time.In assessing Spire's stock market performance, one should consider the current valuation of the company against the projected earnings from this contract, as well as the potential for additional contracts that may arise from the increased visibility and credibility gained through this partnership with EMSA. Maritime Security Expert The strategic implications of Spire's contracts with EMSA extend beyond the immediate financial impact. SAT-AIS is a critical technology for maritime safety and security, enabling authorities to monitor vessel movements and behavior in real-time, which is essential for the prevention of accidents, piracy and illicit activities at sea.Spire's continued partnership with EMSA enhances the collective maritime situational awareness and contributes to global security efforts. The data provided can assist in environmental protection by monitoring shipping routes and detecting potential ecological threats. This aspect of the contract aligns with broader global initiatives aimed at protecting maritime ecosystems and ensuring sustainable use of ocean resources.The expertise of Spire in delivering high-quality, real-time SAT-AIS data is a key differentiator in the market, potentially leading to further opportunities in the maritime security sector, both within the EU and internationally. 02/21/2024 - 06:45 AM Through two framework contracts, the Company will continue to deliver global and real-time satellite AIS data for vessels tracking VIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spire Global, Inc.

The partnership aims to align with Governor Spencer J. Cox's 'One Utah Roadmap' for improved customer experience and performance management. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of CGI's collaboration with the State of Utah for the modernization of its human capital management (HCM) system represents a strategic expansion of CGI's services within the public sector. This move is significant as it reinforces CGI's role as a key player in providing IT solutions to government agencies. The investment in technology infrastructure, particularly in HCM solutions, is indicative of a broader trend where public entities are prioritizing digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency.From a market perspective, this partnership could potentially increase CGI's long-term revenue streams and bolster its market position in government IT services. The fact that CGI has been a partner to the state for over three decades may provide them with a competitive advantage in understanding the unique needs of the state agencies, which could lead to further opportunities within the state and potentially act as a case study to secure similar contracts with other states.Moreover, the focus on integrating data and managing costs while recruiting and reskilling the workforce aligns with current market trends where there is a growing emphasis on not only attracting talent but also on the sustainability of the workforce through continuous learning and development. Financial Analyst CGI's selection for the HCM solution modernization project with the State of Utah could have positive implications for CGI's financial health. The project is likely to entail a significant investment from the state, translating into a stable income source for CGI over the duration of the project. Given the scale, servicing 30 state agencies and around 23,000 employees, the deal could have a noticeable impact on CGI's financials, potentially leading to an uptick in their stock performance as investors react to the news of secured long-term revenue.Investors will also be attentive to the project's margins and cost structures, as these will influence the overall profitability of the deal. The success of the project could lead to upselling opportunities and the acquisition of new government contracts, further expanding CGI's footprint in the sector. However, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with large-scale IT projects, including potential overruns and implementation challenges, which could affect expected financial outcomes. Legal Expert The modernization of the HCM system for the State of Utah by CGI also carries legal and compliance implications. The project will need to navigate an evolving landscape of employment law and mandates. CGI's ability to ensure compliance with these regulations will be critical to the project's success. This includes adapting to changes in labor laws, data protection regulations and other legal requirements that govern human resources and payroll processes.For stakeholders, the emphasis on improving compliance is a positive sign, suggesting that CGI is prepared to handle the legal complexities of modernizing state-level HCM systems. Ensuring compliance helps mitigate legal risks for the State of Utah and, by extension, for CGI, which could otherwise face penalties or reputational damage in the event of non-compliance. This aspect of the project may also set a precedent for how CGI approaches legal compliance in future projects with other states and public entities, potentially strengthening its reputation as a reliable government IT services provider. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM Stock Market SymbolsGIB.A (TSX)GIB (NYSE)cgi.com/newsroom SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - CGI (TSX: GIB.A) (NYSE: GIB) today announced its selection by the State of Utah for modernization of the state's human capital management (HCM) solution with CGI Advantage® to improve the accuracy, efficiency and transparency of state employee payroll processes and vital human resources functions across 30 state agencies, employing approximately 23,000 employees.

Year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA driven by revenue decline and deleveraging of SG&A. Weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution decreased by 8.3% year-over-year. Full year 2024 outlook assumes a difficult operating environment with soft demand for consumer durable goods. Financial Analyst An examination of PROG Holdings' Q4 2023 financial results reveals several key points of interest to investors and market analysts. The reported consolidated revenues of $577.4 million represent a 5.7% decrease year-over-year, which may raise concerns about the company's growth trajectory, particularly in the context of a challenging retail environment. The earnings before taxes of $28.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $61.0 million indicate a tighter operational margin, which suggests that the company is experiencing pressure on profitability, possibly due to increased costs or decreased leasing activity. However, the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and a $500 million share repurchase authorization signal a strong balance sheet and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This move could potentially stabilize the stock price and provide a positive signal to the market. The share repurchase program, in particular, suggests that management believes the stock is undervalued and that there is confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Looking ahead, the company's 2024 outlook indicates cautious optimism, with a range of projected revenues and earnings that account for the current economic headwinds. The forecasted full-year diluted EPS of $2.00 to $2.34 and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $2.70 to $3.00 provide a framework for investors to gauge future performance against the backdrop of an anticipated difficult operating environment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, PROG Holdings' performance in the leasing sector and its 1.2% year-over-year growth in GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) for Progressive Leasing is modest but significant. It suggests resilience in consumer demand for leasable items during the holiday season, which is a critical period for retail and financing companies. The GMV is a vital metric for assessing the volume of goods being leased and growth in this area could indicate a competitive edge or effective marketing strategies. The company's provision for lease merchandise write-offs at 7.0% is within the targeted range, reflecting sound risk management practices. This is important for maintaining investor confidence, as it shows the company's ability to manage credit risk and minimize losses from uncollectible accounts. Furthermore, the announcement of a dividend could be seen as a strategy to attract a different class of investors, particularly those seeking regular income from their investments. This move, combined with the share repurchase plan, may also be interpreted as a signal that the company is focusing on sustainable growth and shareholder value over aggressive expansion. Economist The broader economic implications of PROG Holdings' financial results and strategic decisions can be analyzed in the context of the current economic climate. The company's acknowledgment of a difficult operating environment and soft demand for consumer durable goods reflects wider economic trends, such as fluctuating consumer confidence and potential shifts in discretionary spending. The performance of companies like PROG Holdings can serve as an economic indicator for the health of the consumer finance sector and retail market. The company's decision to initiate a dividend and authorize a substantial share repurchase program may also be indicative of a larger trend where companies are looking to bolster investor confidence during uncertain economic times. Additionally, the management's ability to maintain cost discipline while navigating challenging retail conditions could be seen as a positive sign of adaptability and prudent financial management, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. It is also noteworthy that the company is not factoring in material changes in its decisioning posture or significant increases in unemployment rates for its consumer base in its 2024 outlook. This suggests a measured approach to forecasting, recognizing the potential for economic stability or improvement while remaining cautious about external factors that could impact the company's performance. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Consolidated revenues of $577.4 million; Earnings before taxes of $28.5 million Adjusted EBITDA of $61.0 million Diluted EPS of $0.41; Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.72 Progressive Leasing GMV of $547.6 million, up 1.2% year-over-year Company initiates quarterly cash dividend, announces $500 million share repurchase authorization SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PROG Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:PRG), the fintech holding company for Progressive Leasing, Vive Financial, Four Technologies, and Build, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, and the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend for shareholders, as well as a $500 million share repurchase authorization. ""We were pleased to finish 2023 with financial results that matched or exceeded our outlook, as strong customer behavior and conversion rates during the holiday period drove a year-over-year increase in quarterly GMV, due in part to marketing and other initiatives we put in place with our retail partners,"" said PROG Holdings President and CEO Steve Michaels. ""Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to effectively manage its performance while maintaining cost discipline in the face of challenging retail conditions, enabling us to deliver strong results for both the fourth quarter and the full year.

""We believe our cash-efficient model will allow us to reinvest in the business while pursuing a balanced capital return strategy for our shareholders."" Consolidated Results Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $577.4 million, a decrease of 5.7% from the same period in 2022, driven by a lower gross leased asset balance entering the quarter. Consolidated net earnings for the quarter were $18.6 million, compared with $36.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter decreased 18.1% to $61.0 million, or 10.6% of revenues, compared with $74.4 million, or 12.2% of revenues for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by a decline in revenue and deleveraging of SG&A, partially offset by customer payment performance. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $0.41, compared with $0.73 in the year ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.72 in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $0.84 for the same period in 2022. The Company's weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution in the fourth quarter was 8.3% lower year-over-year. Progressive Leasing Results Progressive Leasing's fourth quarter GMV increased 1.2% year over year to $547.6 million, primarily driven by better-than-expected customer demand for leasable items during the holidays. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs for the quarter was 7.0%, within the Company's 6%-8% targeted annual range. Capital Returns PROG Holdings ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with cash of $155.4 million and gross debt of $600 million.

Such forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as ""continue"", ""allow"", ""believe"", ""payable"", ""expects"", ""outlook"", ""will"", ""assumes"" and similar forward-looking terminology. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as (i) continued volatility and challenges in the macro environment and, in particular, the unfavorable effects on our business of significant inflation, elevated interest rates, and fears of a recession, and the impact of those headwinds on: (a) consumer confidence and customer demand for the merchandise that our POS partners sell, in particular consumer durables; (b) our customers’ disposable income and their ability to make the lease and loan payments they owe the Company; (c) the availability of consumer credit; and (d) our overall financial performance and outlook; (ii) our businesses being subject to extensive laws and regulations, including laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties and compliance-related burdens, as well as an increased focus by federal, state and local regulators on the industries within which our businesses operate, including with respect to consumer protection, customer privacy, third party and employee fraud and information security; (iii) deteriorating macroeconomic conditions resulting in the algorithms and other proprietary decisioning tools used in approving Progressive Leasing and Vive customers for leases and loans no longer being indicative of their ability to perform, which may limit the ability of those businesses to avoid lease and loan charge-offs or may result in their reserves being insufficient to cover actual losses; (iv) the impact of the cybersecurity incident experienced by Progressive Leasing in September 2023 and expenses incurred in connection with responding to the matter, including the litigation filed in response to that incident, or any regulatory proceedings that may result from the incident; (v) a large percentage of the Company’s revenues being concentrated with several of Progressive Leasing’s key POS partners; (vi) the risks that Progressive Leasing will be unable to attract new POS partners or retain and grow its business with its existing POS partners; (vii) Vive’s and Four’s business models differing significantly from Progressive Leasing’s, which creates specific and unique risks for each of the Vive and Four businesses, including Vive’s reliance on a limited number of bank partners to issue its credit products and each of Vive’s and Four’s exposure to the unique regulatory risks associated with the laws and regulations that apply to each of their businesses; (viii) our ability to continue to protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, including the personal and confidential information of our customers, which may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, employee or other internal misconduct, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or ""hacking"", or similar disruptions, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects; (ix) our cost reduction initiatives may not be adequate or may have unintended consequences that could be disruptive to our businesses, including with respect to our global workforce strategy; (x) the risk that our capital allocation strategy, including our current stock repurchase and dividend programs, as well as any future debt repurchase program, will not be effective at enhancing shareholder value and may have an adverse impact on our cash reserves; (xi) the loss of the services of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain key talent, particularly with respect to our information technology function, may have a material adverse impact on our operations; (xii) increased competition from traditional and virtual lease-to-own competitors and also from competitors of our Vive segment; (xiii) the transactions offered by our Progressive Leasing, Vive and/or Four businesses may be negatively characterized by government officials, consumer advocacy groups or the media; (xiv) real or perceived software or system errors, failures, bugs, defects or outages, including those that may be caused by third-party vendors, may adversely affect Progressive Leasing, Vive or Four; and (xv) the other risks and uncertainties discussed under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full year 2024 and first quarter 2024 outlook exclude intangible amortization expense, restructuring expenses, and accrued interest on an uncertain tax position related to Progressive Leasing's $175 million settlement with the FTC in 2020. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 exclude intangible amortization expense, restructuring expenses, costs related to the cybersecurity incident, regulatory insurance recoveries, and accrued interest on an uncertain tax position related to Progressive Leasing's $175 million settlement with the FTC in 2020. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, exclude intangible amortization expense, restructuring expenses, impairment of goodwill and accrued interest on an uncertain tax position related to Progressive Leasing's $175 million settlement with the FTC in 2020. The amount for the after-tax non-GAAP adjustment, which is tax effected using our statutory tax rate, can be found in the reconciliation of net earnings and earnings per share assuming dilution to non-GAAP net earnings and earnings per share assuming dilution table in this press release. The Adjusted EBITDA figures presented in this press release are calculated as the Company’s earnings before interest expense, net, depreciation on property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 and first quarter 2024 outlook exclude stock-based compensation expense and restructuring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, exclude stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expenses, costs related to the cybersecurity incident and regulatory insurance recoveries. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, exclude stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expenses and impairment of goodwill. The amounts for these pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments can be found in the segment EBITDA tables in this press release. Management believes that non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, and are widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. Non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings, and adjusted EBITDA provide management and investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain items that generally arose from larger, one-time transactions that are not reflective of the ordinary earnings activity of our operations or transactions that have variability and volatility of the amount. We believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results with our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also provides management and investors with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because the measures: Are widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors. Are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness. Are used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of our operating entities and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company’s GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share and the GAAP revenues and earnings before income taxes of the Company’s segments, which are also presented in the press release. Further, we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner.

Financial Analyst The reported financials of Expro Group Holdings N.V. show a mix of growth and challenges. The 10% sequential revenue increase and 18% year-over-year growth are positive indicators of the company's operational success and could be seen as bullish signals for investors. However, the persistence of a net loss, although slightly reduced from the previous quarter, suggests that the company is still in a phase of strategic investment and may be facing operational inefficiencies or increased costs. The acquisition of PRT Offshore appears to be a strategic move to diversify and strengthen the company's service offerings, which could lead to future revenue growth.The 70% increase in Adjusted EBITDA sequentially is a strong sign of operational leverage and cost management. Investors should note that while the company is not yet profitable, its ability to generate increased EBITDA at a higher margin is a step in the right direction. The provided outlook for 2024 indicates a continued positive trend, with anticipated revenue growth and improved Adjusted EBITDA margins. This forward-looking statement could impact the stock positively if investors believe the targets are achievable. Market Research Analyst Expro's growth within the North and Latin American markets and the strategic acquisition of PRT Offshore suggest a positive trajectory for the company's market share and competitive positioning. The energy services sector is cyclical and closely tied to commodity prices and Expro's expectation of a multi-year growth cycle aligns with current industry trends toward increased energy demand and investment in oil and gas infrastructure.Furthermore, the announced acquisition of Coretrax indicates Expro's commitment to expanding its technology portfolio, which could enhance its service offerings and market differentiation. The focus on innovative technologies that reduce risk and cost, while optimizing drilling efficiency, aligns with the industry's push for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which is critical in a market that is sensitive to price fluctuations. Energy Sector Analyst The report highlights Expro's operational challenges, particularly the suspension of vessel-deployed LWI operations due to a wire failure incident. This event underscores the risks associated with complex offshore operations. It is crucial to monitor how Expro manages these operational risks and their impact on the company's reputation and future earnings potential.The emphasis on environmental capabilities and low carbon solutions, such as the CoilHose™ LWCS, is indicative of the energy sector's ongoing transition towards sustainability. Expro's positioning as an Energy Transition Pioneer could attract investors who are increasingly looking for companies that contribute to a sustainable energy future. This may also open up new business opportunities in a market that is progressively valuing environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Strong operational performance and profitable growth driven by a rebound of NLA activity and acquisition of PRT Offshore.

Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of approximately 16% for both 2023 and 2022. Provides 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Expro Group Holdings N.V. (NYSE: XPRO) (the “Company” or “Expro”) today reported financial and operational results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights • Revenue was $407 million compared to revenue of $370 million in the third quarter of 2023, a sequential increase of $37 million, or 10%, primarily driven by a rebound of activity in North and Latin America (“NLA”) and the acquisition of PRT Offshore in the beginning of the fourth quarter. • Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $12 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $14 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income1 for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Results for the fourth and third quarter of 2023 include foreign exchange losses of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, or approximately $0.04 per diluted share, for both periods. • Adjusted EBITDA was $85 million, a sequential increase of $35 million, or 70%, driven by higher activity during the fourth quarter and lower unrecoverable costs within our light well intervention (“LWI”) business. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth and third quarter of 2023 was 21% and 14%, respectively. Excluding $4 million and $15 million of unrecoverable LWI-related costs during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $89 million and $65 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 22% and 18%. The Company suspended vessel-deployed LWI operations during the third quarter of 2023 following a wire failure on the main crane of a third-party owned vessel working with Expro while the crane was suspending the subsea module of Expro’s vessel-deployed LWI system. We are continuing to work with the relevant stakeholders and independent experts to assess the incident. The well control package and lubricator components of this vessel-deployed LWI system have been safely recovered, but we have determined not to participate in the recovery of the subsea module from the seabed. We are continuing to determine the path forward for our vessel-deployed LWI operations, including what alternative service delivery options and service partner options are available to the Company, and the timing and cost (including potential damage claims) of completing customer work scopes for which our vessel-deployed LWI system was integral. At this time, we are not able to assess the timing and potential cost of completing customer work scopes but do not expect such costs to be material to Expro’s financial results. • Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $33 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $59 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital of $60 million, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $35 million. Adjusted cash flow from operations1 for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $43 million compared to $64 million for the third quarter of 2023. 1. A non-GAAP measure. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights • Revenue was $1,513 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $234 million, or 18%, compared to $1,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Activity and revenue across all geography-based operating segments increased during the year ended December 31, 2023, most notably in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (“ESSA”). • Net loss was $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $20 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $20 million, or $ 0.19 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $19 million, or $ 0.18 per diluted share. • Adjusted EBITDA increased by $43 million, or 21%, to $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $206 million for the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to higher revenue and a more favorable activity mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 16% for both 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes unrecoverable LWI-related costs in Asia Pacific (“APAC”) of $36 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes unrecoverable LWI-related costs of $28 million. Excluding unrecoverable LWI-related costs, Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 would have been $285 million and $234 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 19% and 18%, respectively. • Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $138 million compared to $80 million for year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA (as referenced above) and favorable movement in working capital, partially offset by higher payments for income taxes. Adjusted cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $170 million compared to $115 million for year ended December 31, 2022. Michael Jardon, Chief Executive Officer, noted, “Expro has delivered strong fourth quarter financial results with revenue and Adjusted EBITDA exceeding our most recent guidance ranges. We begin 2024 in a strong position. As activity is strengthening, we are continuing to see a positive demand trend for our services and solutions and believe that the energy services sector and Expro's business are in the early phase of a multi-year growth cycle. “Earlier this month we announced that Expro has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Coretrax, a technology leader in performance drilling tools and wellbore cleanup, well integrity and production optimization solutions. Coretrax has a complementary offering to Expro with little overlap and will bolster the portfolio of technology-enabled services and solutions offered through our Well Construction and Well Intervention & Integrity product lines, adding significant value to our clients from innovative technologies that reduce risk and cost, optimize drilling efficiency, extend the life of existing well stock, and optimize production. “We also celebrated 40 years since the launch of our first subsea test tree system. Since then Expro has remained at the forefront of subsea landing string technology. Recognizing our dedication to subsea well access applications, Expro was named Intervention Champion of the Year at the OWI Global Awards 2023 that was held in November. Our capabilities in this space have also been bolstered with the recent acquisition of PRT Offshore at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 and we are already making significant progress on our integration. “We built a healthy order book in 2023, capturing strategically important contract wins. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to support our customers as activity ramps up across our regions and product lines. I am very proud of the team of experts throughout the company and what they have accomplished. We believe our business is well positioned to be a leading provider of services and solutions in the international and offshore markets while delivering on the financial and other objectives of the company in the years to follow. “For 2024, we expect improving profitability to drive improved cash flow generation as we capitalize on tailwinds in our industry. Based on our strong performance in 2023 and a positive activity outlook, we currently anticipate generating revenues of between $1,600 million to $1,700 million in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 is expected to be between $325 million and $375 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 20% and 22%. Full-year guidance assumes our proposed acquisition of Coretrax will be completed at the beginning of the third quarter. Consistent with historical patterns, revenue and profitability in the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be negatively impacted by the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere and the budget cycles of our national oil company customers. First quarter revenue is expected to be within a range of $365 million and $375 million. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within a range of $63 million and $73 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 18%.” Notable Awards and Achievements Expro was named Energy Transition Pioneer of the Year at the OWI Global Awards 2023, recognizing its commitment to sustainable energy solutions. This recognition reflects Expro’s proactive efforts to contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future. The company also won Intervention Champion of the Year recognizing Expro's commitment to Subsea Well Access. In 2023 we achieved over 40 years of Subsea Test Tree Assemblies (“SSTTA”) operations and more than 3,000 subsea deployments across exploration and appraisal, completion, and intervention applications, building a strong reputation and market share that is supported by the industry’s largest large-bore global SSTTA fleet. Expro’s Tubular Running Services (“TRS”) business accomplished an industry milestone in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by successfully completing an operator’s well using a fully non-marking completion running package – a significant achievement in the field. This tubular running package provides the industry’s only truly non-marking tubular running solution, which helps preserve well integrity and extends the life cycle of the well. This was also the first deployment of the Collar Load Support (CLS™) System for Stands in the region, in which the performance of the system exceeded customer expectations. The success of this completion run was the culmination of extensive planning and testing and is another example of Expro’s ability to provide solutions and positive results for the industry’s most complex wells. Expro has been awarded a Corporate Frame Agreement to deliver well testing services for Equinor in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The four-year contract, with the potential of three two-year options, builds on Expro’s previous seven-year agreement. The scope of work includes well flow management and production optimization services to enhance Equinor’s assets across completion, intervention, production, and abandonment operations. Building on the Corporate Frame Agreement, the work scope will see the delivery of hydraulic intervention well services using Expro’s innovative CoilHose™ Light Well Circulation System (“LWCS”) that is designed to provide a more efficient and lower operational carbon footprint approach to operations. A significant portion of the contract is directly linked to a demonstrable commitment to a low carbon plan, allowing Expro to implement its environmental capabilities with Equinor and further enhance the strength and depth of this partnership. In the Middle East and North Africa, Expro’s Automated Bucking and Catwalk system delivered improved safety and record efficiency at one of its client’s challenging wells. Expro was contracted to provide a high quality, low risk tubular running services to its clients’ onshore fleet of drilling rigs. Marking an operational first for the triple catwalk in the United Arab Emirates, on the first deployment of its TRS system, Expro set a record for instantaneous tripping speed and the second-best performance overall tripping speed on 18 5/8” tubulars. The overall rate was more than twice that of the average run in the same field. The client extended their appreciation to the TRS crew along with the rig team for concluding a very challenging 18 5/8” job with reduced safety exposure to personnel and a green safety record. Finally, in the Asia Pacific region, Expro completed the deepest deployment of MK VI CoilHose™, coupled with a successful N2 lifting application in a remote location offshore New Zealand. This marked the first-ever MK VI CoilHose™ deployment in APAC, reaching an impressive depth of 8,650 feet (2,637 meters), surpassing depths achieved globally by 25%. The CoilHose™ solution provided a swift rig-up time compared to traditional coil tubing, minimizing planning and operational duration. This streamlined approach not only reduces safety risks but also lessens the environmental impact during well interventions. Segment Results Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares the quarterly results for the fourth quarter of 2023 to the results for the third quarter of 2023. North and Latin America (NLA) Revenue for the NLA segment was $145 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $40 million, or 38%, compared to $105 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional subsea well access revenue following the acquisition of PRT Offshore at the beginning of the fourth quarter, higher well flow management revenue in Mexico, and higher well construction revenue in the U.S. due to increased customer activity. Segment EBITDA for the NLA segment was $44 million, or 30% of revenues, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $20 million, or 19% of revenues, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $24 million in Segment EBITDA was attributable to higher activity and the increase in Segment EBITDA margin was attributable to a more favorable activity mix during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) Revenue for the ESSA segment was $134 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1 million, or 1%, compared to $135 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by lower well flow management revenue in Congo, partially offset by higher well flow management and subsea well access revenue in Equatorial Guinea. Segment EBITDA for the ESSA segment was $41 million, or 31% of revenues, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $2 million, or 5%, compared to $39, or 29% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to a more favorable activity mix during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Revenue for the MENA segment was $65 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $7 million, or 13%, compared to $58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by higher well flow management services revenue in Algeria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and by higher well construction revenue in Morocco. Segment EBITDA for the MENA segment was $21 million, or 33% of revenues, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $4 million, or 26%, compared to $17 million, or 29% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA margin was primarily due to higher activity and a more favorable activity mix during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Asia Pacific (APAC) Revenue for the APAC segment was $62 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $9 million, or 13%, compared to $71 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower subsea well access revenue in Australia, where we suspended vessel-deployed LWI operations, and China, partially offset by higher subsea well access revenue in Malaysia and well flow management revenue in Malaysia and Australia. Segment EBITDA for the APAC segment was $5 million, or 9% of revenues, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $9 million compared to ($4) million, or (6)% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Segment EBITDA (despite the decrease in revenues) was primarily due to lower costs within our LWI business during the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, APAC Segment EBITDA includes unrecoverable LWI-related costs of $4 million. Segment EBITDA for the three months ended September 31, 2023 includes unrecoverable LWI-related costs of $15 million. Excluding unrecoverable LWI-related costs, Segment EBITDA for the fourth and third quarter of 2023 would have been $9 million or 15% of revenue and $11 million or 15% of revenue, respectively. Other Financial Information The Company’s capital expenditures totaled $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and approximately $122 million for the full year 2023. Expro plans for capital expenditures in the range of approximately $130 million to $140 million for 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Expro’s consolidated cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, totaled $152 million. The Company had outstanding debt of $20 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s total liquidity as of December 31, 2023 was $299 million. Total liquidity includes $147 million available for drawdowns as loans under the Company’s revolving credit facility. Depreciation and amortization expense was $63 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $37 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to $19 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the subsea module (“SSM”) of Expro’s vessel-deployed LWI system and related equipment. On October 25, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an extension to the stock repurchase program first approved on June 16, 2022. Pursuant to the extended stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $100 million of its outstanding common stock from October 25, 2023 through November 24, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, under the Stock Repurchase Program we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.70 for a total cost of approximately $20 million, including shares repurchased prior to the extension of the Stock Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $11.81 per share, for a total cost of $13 million under the preceding program. Expro’s provision for income taxes was $13 million for both the fourth quarter of 2023 and the prior quarter primarily due to a similar mix of taxable profits between jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 also reflects liability for taxes in certain jurisdictions that tax on an other than pre-tax profits basis, including so-called “deemed profits” regimes. The financial measures provided that are not presented in accordance with GAAP are defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures.

Forward Looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this release include statements, estimates and projections regarding the Company’s future business strategy and prospects for growth, cash flows and liquidity, financial strategy, budget, projections, guidance, operating results, environmental, social and governance goals, targets and initiatives, estimates and projections regarding the outcome and benefits of the proposed Coretrax acquisition, the Company’s ability to achieve the anticipated synergies as a result of the proposed Coretrax acquisition and the timing of the closing of the proposed Coretrax acquisition. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management’s experience, expectations and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Such assumptions, risks and uncertainties include the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures, the availability and terms of capital, the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, volatility of oil and gas prices, unique risks associated with offshore operations (including the ability to recover, and to the extent necessary, service and/or economically repair any equipment located on the seabed), political, economic and regulatory uncertainties in international operations, the ability to develop new technologies and products, the ability to protect intellectual property rights, the ability to employ and retain skilled and qualified workers, the level of competition in the Company’s industry, global or national health concerns, including health epidemics, the possibility of a swift and material decline in global crude oil demand and crude oil prices for an uncertain period of time, future actions of foreign oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, inflationary pressures, the impact of current and future laws, rulings, governmental regulations, accounting standards and statements, and related interpretations, and other guidance. Such assumptions, risks and uncertainties also include the factors discussed or referenced in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that will be filed with the SEC, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports the Company files with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, historical practice or otherwise, except as required by applicable law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and the accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, contribution, contribution margin, support costs, adjusted cash flow from operations, cash conversion, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, which may be used periodically by management when discussing financial results with investors and analysts. The accompanying schedules of this press release provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management believes these metrics provide additional information relative to the performance of the business. These metrics are commonly employed by the management, financial analysts and investors to evaluate the operating and financial performance of Expro from period to period and to compare such performance with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, contribution, contribution margin, support costs, adjusted cash flow from operations, cash conversion, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Expro’s results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, contribution, contribution margin, support costs, adjusted cash flow from operations, cash conversion, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Expro defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for (a) income tax expense (benefit), (b) depreciation and amortization expense, (c) impairment expense, (d) severance and other expense, net, (e) stock-based compensation expense, (f) merger and integration expense, (g) (gain) loss on disposal of assets, (h) other (income) expense, net, (i) interest and finance (income) expense, net and (j) foreign exchange (gain) loss. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenue. Contribution is defined as total revenue less cost of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted for indirect support costs and stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue. Contribution margin is defined as contribution divided by total revenue, expressed as a percentage. Support costs is defined as indirect costs attributable to supporting the activities of the operating segments, research and engineering expenses and product line management costs included in cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, and general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, which represent costs of running the corporate head office and other central functions, including logistics, sales and marketing and health and safety, and does not include foreign exchange gains or losses and other non-routine expenses. Adjusted cash flow from operations is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for cash paid during the period for interest, net, severance and other expense and merger and integration expense. Cash conversion is defined as Adjusted cash flow from operations divided by Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) before merger and integration expense, severance and other expense, stock-based compensation expense, and gain (loss) on disposal of assets, adjusted for corresponding tax benefits of these items. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share as net income (loss) per diluted share before merger and integration expense, severance and other expense, stock-based compensation expense, and gain on disposal of assets, adjusted for corresponding tax benefits of these items, divided by diluted weighted average common shares. Please see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. EXPRO GROUP HOLDINGS N.V.

The company also provided a positive financial outlook for 2024, with projected revenue of $4.600 - $4.700 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $840 - $890 million. Positive Revenue for Bausch + Lomb Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.173 billion, up 18% from the same period in 2022. Full-year 2023 revenue for the company reached $4.146 billion, marking a 10% increase from the previous year. Despite a net loss of $54 million in the fourth quarter and $260 million for the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $231 million and $738 million, respectively. The revenue growth was observed across all segments, with a 12% increase on a constant currency basis for the full year. Bausch + Lomb provided a positive financial outlook for 2024, with projected revenue of $4.600 - $4.700 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $840 - $890 million. Negative Net loss attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation was $54 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $260 million for the full year, indicating financial challenges. Operating income decreased by $77 million for the full year of 2023, impacted by higher expenses and Business Transformation Costs. Cash flow from operations showed a significant decrease in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, negatively impacted by strategic inventory increases and operating results. Adjusted net income attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation decreased by $117 million for the full year of 2023 compared to 2022, signaling a decline in profitability. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Bausch + Lomb Corporation show a significant increase in revenue, both quarterly and annually, which is a positive indicator for the company's growth trajectory. The 18% and 10% growth in Q4 and full-year revenue, respectively, are above average for the industry, indicating a strong market position and successful product performance. However, the GAAP net loss figures of $54 million for Q4 and $260 million for the full year raise concerns about the company's profitability amidst this growth. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as higher interest expenses, point to underlying challenges in cost management that investors should monitor closely.Adjusted EBITDA, often used as a measure of a company's operating performance, shows an improvement, suggesting that despite the GAAP net loss, the company's core operations are generating more earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The guidance for 2024 indicates continued revenue growth, but the anticipated foreign exchange headwinds could moderate investor expectations. The lack of GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking statements may limit the transparency for investors looking to understand the expected net income figures. Market Research Analyst Bausch + Lomb's performance in the eye health sector indicates a robust demand for its products, with significant revenue growth in the Pharmaceuticals segment following the acquisition of XIIDRA and the launch of MIEBO. The Vision Care and Surgical segments also show steady growth, suggesting a well-diversified portfolio that is resonating with the market. The company's ability to grow in constant currency terms, despite foreign exchange challenges, demonstrates strong underlying demand for its products.However, the reported increase in inventory levels and the impact on cash flow from operations is a strategic decision that could either indicate anticipation of future sales growth or potential overstocking risks. Investors should consider the balance between inventory management and the potential for sales volatility in the eye health market. Additionally, the company's focus on launching new products, like the enVista® Aspire lenses and SeeNa™ diagnostic system, could sustain growth but will require careful monitoring of the associated increase in selling and administrative expenses. Medical Devices Analyst The approval of the TENEO™ Excimer Laser Platform by the FDA marks a significant milestone for Bausch + Lomb, as it is the first such platform approved in nearly two decades. This approval could enhance the company's competitive position in the LASIK surgery market and may lead to increased adoption rates by eye care professionals. The integration of SeeNa™ with Eyetelligence™ also highlights the company's commitment to innovation in surgical planning, which could streamline operations for practitioners and improve patient outcomes.The growth in premium intraocular lenses (IOLs) sales indicates a shift towards higher-margin products within the Surgical segment, which could positively affect future profitability. The medical devices industry is highly regulated and successful navigation of this landscape is crucial. Bausch + Lomb's recent regulatory successes could signal strong regulatory and development capabilities, which are critical competencies in this field. 02/21/2024 - 06:58 AM Fourth-Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue of $1.173 Billion GAAP Net Loss Attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation of $54 Million Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)1 of $231 Million Revenue Grew 18% as Reported and 19% on a Constant Currency1 Basis Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2022, Driven by Growth Across All Segments Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue of $4.146 Billion GAAP Net Loss Attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation of $260 Million Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)1 of $738 Million Revenue Grew 10% as Reported and 12% on a Constant Currency1 Basis Compared to the Full Year of 2022, Driven by Growth Across All Segments Foreign Exchange Negatively Impacted Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)1 by Approximately $68 Million and $51 Million, Respectively VAUGHAN, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bausch + Lomb Corporation (NYSE/TSX: BLCO), a leading global eye health company dedicated to helping people see better to live better, today announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results. “Revenue growth in 2023, and in the fourth quarter in particular, exceeded our expectations and set the tone for 2024,” said Brent Saunders, chairman and CEO, Bausch + Lomb. “Double-digit growth is always impressive, but even more so when you consider how we got there.

In particular, the company can offer no assurance that any spinoff transaction will occur at all, or that any spinoff transaction will occur on the terms and timelines anticipated by the company and BHC. They also include risks and uncertainties respecting the acquisition of XIIDRA® and certain other ophthalmology assets, including the company’s ability to effectively and efficiently integrate the acquired business into its existing business; the effect of the transaction on Bausch + Lomb’s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners; risks relating to potential diversion of management attention away from Bausch + Lomb’s ongoing business operations; risks relating to increased levels of debt as a result of debt incurred to finance such transaction, including in regards to compliance with our debt covenants; and risks that the company may not realize the expected benefits of that transaction on a timely basis or at all. Finally, they also include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties caused by or relating to adverse economic conditions and other macroeconomic factors, including inflation, slower growth or a potential recession, which could adversely impact our revenue, expenses and resulting margins, and economic factors over which we have no control, including inflationary pressures as a result of historically high domestic and global inflation and otherwise, interest rates, foreign currency rates, and the positional effect of such factors on revenue, expenses and resulting margins. In addition, certain material factors and assumptions have been applied in making these forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the assumption that the risks and uncertainties outlined above will not cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. In addition, management has also made certain assumptions regarding our 2024 full-year guidance with respect to expectations regarding base performance growth, expectations regarding performance of certain of our key products (including XIIDRA® and MIEBO®), currency impact, run-rate dis-synergies and inflation, expectations regarding adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP), adjusted SG&A expense (non-GAAP) and the company’s ability to continue to manage such expense in the manner anticipated and the anticipated timing and extent of the company’s R&D expense. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Bausch + Lomb undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release or to reflect actual outcomes, unless required by law. Links provided in this news release are solely for information purposes and do not constitute Bausch + Lomb affirming any forward-looking statements contained in the linked content. Non-GAAP Information To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios. Management uses these non-GAAP measures and ratios as key metrics in the evaluation of the company’s performance and the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers. The company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the company. In addition, these non-GAAP measures and ratios address questions the company routinely receives from analysts and investors, and in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, the company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These measures and ratios do not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures and ratios that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures and ratios. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures and ratios may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures and ratios of other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures and ratios, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures and ratios. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of these historic non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to the most directly comparable financial measures and ratios calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. Specific Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA (non-GAAP) is Net income (loss) attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation (its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is EBITDA (non-GAAP) further adjusted for the items described below. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), along with the GAAP measures used by management, most appropriately reflect how the company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives. In particular, the company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) focuses management on the company’s underlying operational results and business performance. As a result, the company uses Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) both to assess the actual financial performance of the company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is a useful measure to evaluate current performance. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors. In addition, cash bonuses for the company’s executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) targets. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is Net income (loss) attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation (its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) adjusted for interest expense, net, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted for the following items: Asset impairments: The company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and divestitures. The company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the company’s operating performance. Although the company excludes impairments of intangible assets from measuring the performance of the company and its business, the company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Restructuring, integration and transformation costs: The company has incurred restructuring costs as it implemented certain strategies, which involved, among other things, improvements to its infrastructure and operations, internal reorganizations and impacts from the divestiture of assets and businesses. With regard to infrastructure and operational improvements which the company has taken to improve efficiencies in the businesses and facilities, these tend to be costs intended to right size the business or organization that fluctuate significantly between periods in amount, size and timing, depending on the improvement project, reorganization or transaction. Additionally, with the completion of the Bausch + Lomb IPO, as the company prepares for post-separation operations, the company is launching certain transformation initiatives that will result in certain changes to and investment in its organizational structure and operations. These transformation initiatives arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations and, as is the case with the company’s restructuring efforts, costs associated with these transformation initiatives are expected to fluctuate between periods in amount, size and timing. These out-of-the-ordinary-course charges include third-party advisory costs, as well as certain compensation-related costs (including costs associated with changes in our executive officers, such as the severance costs associated with the departure of the company’s former CEO and the costs associated with the appointment of the company’s current CEO). Investors should understand that the outcome of these transformation initiatives may result in future restructuring actions and certain of these charges could recur. The company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the company’s operating performance, allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provide useful supplemental information to investors. Acquisition-related costs and adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets: The company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related costs and fair value inventory step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amounts and frequency of such costs and adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of its acquisitions. In addition, the company excludes the impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration non-cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates, and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreed-upon consideration. Share-based compensation: The company excludes costs relating to share-based compensation. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. Separation costs and separation-related costs: The company has excluded certain costs incurred in connection with activities taken to: (i) separate the Bausch + Lomb business from the remainder of BHC and (ii) register the Bausch + Lomb business as an independent publicly traded entity. Separation costs are incremental costs directly related to effectuating the separation of the Bausch + Lomb business from the remainder of BHC and include, but are not limited to, legal, audit and advisory fees, talent acquisition costs and costs associated with establishing a new Board of Directors and Audit Committee. Separation-related costs are incremental costs indirectly related to the separation of the Bausch + Lomb business from the remainder of BHC and include, but are not limited to, IT infrastructure and software licensing costs, rebranding costs and costs associated with facility relocation and/or modification. As these costs arise from events outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations, the company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the company’s operating performance, allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provide useful supplemental information to investors. Other Non-GAAP adjustments: The company also excludes certain other amounts, including IT infrastructure investment, litigation and other matters, gain/(loss) on sales of assets and certain other amounts that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure operating performance if and when present in the periods presented. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs, the company believes these items are not routine operating expenses. For example, legal settlements and judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this volatility, the company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not routine operating expenses. The company has also excluded certain other costs, including settlement costs associated with the conversion of a portion of the company’s defined benefit plan in Ireland to a defined contribution plan. The company excluded these costs as this event is outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations and is infrequent in nature. The company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in our industry often face litigation. Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) is net income (loss) attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for asset impairments, restructuring, integration and transformation costs, acquisition-related contingent consideration, separation costs and separation-related costs and other non-GAAP adjustments, as these adjustments are described above, and further adjusted for amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related costs and adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets, as described below: Amortization of intangible assets: The company has excluded the impact of amortization of intangible assets, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. The company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the company’s operating performance. Although the company excludes the amortization of intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, the company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Acquisition-related costs and adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets: In addition to the acquisition-related costs and adjustments as described above, the company has excluded the expense directly attributable to one-time commitment and structuring fees related to a bridge loan facility put in place prior to the acquisition of XIIDRA and certain other ophthalmology assets. The company excluded these costs as they are outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations and are infrequent in nature. The company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information to investors. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) excludes the impact of these certain items that may obscure trends in the company’s underlying performance. Management uses Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, it is management’s intention to provide investors with a meaningful, supplemental comparison of the company’s operating results and trends for the periods presented. Management believes that this measure is also useful to investors as such measure allows investors to evaluate the company’s performance using the same tools that management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. Accordingly, the company believes that Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) is useful to investors in their assessment of the company’s operating performance and the valuation of the company. It is also noted that, in recent periods, our GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation was significantly lower than our Adjusted net income (non-GAAP). Constant Currency Constant currency change or constant currency revenue growth is a change in GAAP revenue (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a period-over-period basis adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The company uses Constant Currency revenue (non-GAAP) and Constant Currency revenue Growth (non-GAAP) to assess performance of its reportable segments, and the company in total, without the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The company believes that such measures are useful to investors as they provide a supplemental period-to-period comparison. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates are part of our business, they are not within management’s control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the underlying business performance. Constant currency impact is determined by comparing 2023 reported amounts adjusted to exclude currency impact, calculated using 2022 monthly average exchange rates, to the actual 2022 reported amounts. Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) Adjusted earnings per share or Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) is calculated as Diluted income per share attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation (“GAAP EPS”) (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), adjusted for the per diluted share impact of each adjustment made to reconcile Net income (loss) attributable to Bausch + Lomb Corporation to Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) as discussed above. Like Adjusted net income (non-GAAP), Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) excludes the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the company’s underlying performance on a per share basis. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, it is management’s intention to provide investors with a meaningful, supplemental comparison of the company’s results and trends for the periods presented on a diluted share basis. Accordingly, the company believes that Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) is useful to investors in their assessment of the company’s operating performance, the valuation of the company and an investor’s return on investment. It is also noted that, for the periods presented, our GAAP EPS was significantly lower than our Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP). ____________________ 1 This is a non-GAAP measure or a non-GAAP ratio.

For additional information about the Company’s use of such non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, refer to the “Non-GAAP Information” section in the body of the news release to which these tables are attached. Constant currency revenue (non-GAAP) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is calculated as revenue as reported adjusted for the impact for changes in exchange rates (previously defined in this news release). Change in constant currency revenue (non-GAAP) is calculated as the difference between constant currency revenue for the current period and revenue as reported for the comparative period. (c) Effective in the first quarter of 2023, certain products historically included in the reported results of the Pharmaceuticals segment are now included in the reported results of the Vision Care segment and certain products included in the reported results of the Vision Care segment are now included in the reported results of the Pharmaceuticals segment. Management believes these movements are necessary in order to better align these products with the groupings of similar products.

(NYSE: R), a leader in supply chain, dedicated transportation, and fleet management solutions, announces the opening of a new logistics operation in Laredo, Texas and the expansion of its drayage yard in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The ports of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo now comprise the top inland transborder trade port between the United States and Mexico, after Mexico’s rise to the number one spot among U.S. trading partners last year. Ryder’s new and expanded facilities are designed to support growth in manufacturing, while speeding products across the border. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240221427567/en/Ryder’s new 228,000-square-foot multiclient warehouse and cross dock in Laredo, Texas is strategically located along the U.S.-Mexico border and is designed to support the growth in nearshoring. (Photo: Business Wire) Ryder’s newly built 228,000-square-foot multiclient warehouse and cross dock in Laredo is strategically located just three miles from the World Trade Bridge on the U.S.-Mexico border with easy interstate access in both directions. It has 102 dock doors, room for 143 trailers, and it’s within a six-mile radius of Ryder’s other operations in Laredo, which allows for overflow and pooling of labor and resources for added flexibility. “If you look at the market, truck border crossing activity between the U.S. and Mexico is up more than 20% annually since the pandemic, as more businesses look to nearshoring to diversify their supply chains and shorten lead times,” says Ricardo Alvarez, vice president of supply chain operations for Ryder Mexico. “The savings from manufacturing overseas can be offset by inventory sitting on ships or in seaports incurring storage fees; and, of course, by the product being unavailable to meet demand. With Mexico, you put what you need on a truck and it can be in a final-mile distribution center within days, not months.” On the Mexico side, Ryder is expanding its Nuevo Laredo drayage yard, which facilitates the transfer of freight across the border to U.S. drivers. Ryder Mexico manages more than 250,000 freight movements annually across the entire Mexican border, supporting customers in the automotive, industrial, technology, and consumer packaged goods industries.

The focus on AIGC technologies (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) is particularly significant as it aligns with current trends in content creation and consumption. By leveraging their expertise in ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TTS (Text-to-Speech) and LLM (Large Language Models), Sound Group is positioning itself at the forefront of AI innovation.From a market perspective, the expansion into AI applications is likely to open up new revenue streams and partnerships, diversifying Sound Group's portfolio and potentially increasing its market valuation. The emphasis on enhancing user productivity and fostering creativity through applications such as smart keyboards and intelligent audio recording suggests that the company is targeting both individual consumers and enterprise clients, which could lead to a broader customer base.However, the success of these ventures will depend on the company's ability to execute its strategy effectively, maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market and manage the costs associated with research and development. Investors will be watching closely for user adoption rates and the impact of these new offerings on the company's financial performance. Technology Analyst Sound Group's emphasis on AI voice and AIGC reflects a strategic alignment with industry trends towards personalized and interactive user experiences. The integration of these technologies into their product suite is indicative of a commitment to innovation and could potentially set new standards for user interface and experience within the audio-centric social and entertainment sectors.It is crucial to acknowledge the technical challenges associated with developing AI applications that are both advanced and user-friendly. The company's ability to achieve breakthroughs in ASR, TTS and LLM technologies demonstrates a high level of technical proficiency, which is essential for maintaining a competitive advantage. The development of a varied AI product matrix could also enable Sound Group to cross-sell and upsell to existing customers, thus increasing customer lifetime value.Long-term, the integration of AI into their core products could significantly enhance the scalability of Sound Group's offerings. However, the company must navigate the complexity of international markets, which includes varying consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. Investors should consider the company's track record in innovation and its ability to adapt to different market conditions when evaluating its growth prospects. Financial Analyst Sound Group's launch of new AI-powered applications is a development with potential implications for its financial health. The investment in AIGC technology is likely to increase operational expenses in the short term due to the costs associated with research and development. However, if successful, these applications could offer significant returns through new product lines and enhanced service offerings.The company's focus on continuous product innovation and the development of a diverse range of applications could lead to a more robust and resilient revenue model. By targeting the international market, Sound Group is also expanding its geographical footprint, which may contribute to revenue growth and reduce dependency on any single market.Investors should monitor the company's quarterly financial reports for increases in research and development spending and marketing expenses associated with the rollout of these new applications. Additionally, it will be important to track the revenue contribution from these new AI products to gauge their market acceptance and the effectiveness of the company's commercialization strategy. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM SINGAPORE, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sound Group Inc.

The company aims to double net new ARR in 2024 to drive accelerated revenue growth in 2025. Negative None. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial health of WalkMe Ltd., the significant improvement from a free cash flow (FCF) perspective is noteworthy. Transitioning from a cash burn of $53.9M to generating $11.5M in FCF is indicative of effective cost management and operational efficiency. The positive shift from a (22%) to a 4% margin in FCF reflects a robust turnaround strategy, likely involving cost-cutting measures and streamlining of operations. This is further corroborated by the reported Non-GAAP Operating Income of $4.8M or 7%, a stark contrast to the previous year's loss.The reported Non-GAAP Net Income per share of $0.04, against a loss of ($0.66) the prior year, suggests a successful pivot to profitability. Investors typically value consistent profitability, which can lead to a positive re-rating of the company's stock. However, it is crucial to consider the sustainability of these figures and whether they are a result of one-time gains or ongoing operations.The company's forward-looking statements project confidence in scaling growth profitably, which could be appealing to growth-oriented investors. Nevertheless, one must be cautious about the achievability of these projections, especially in a dynamic market environment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, WalkMe's positioning as a leading provider of digital adoption solutions is increasingly relevant in today's technology-driven business landscape. The company's focus on large enterprise companies and the value proposition of accelerating mission-critical workflows could resonate with potential clients facing digital transformation challenges.The growth in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and the customer base, especially those with over $1 million in ARR, is indicative of strong product-market fit and customer retention. The increase in ARR from customers with more than 500 employees from 94% to 96% suggests a strategic focus on larger enterprises, which could lead to more stable and predictable revenue streams.Moreover, being named a leader in the Everest Group Digital Adoption Platform PEAK Matrix® Assessment for the fourth consecutive year enhances the company's credibility and competitive positioning, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and customer acquisition. Legal Expert Regarding the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures, it is important for stakeholders to understand the adjustments made and the reasons why these measures may provide useful information about the company's financial performance. While non-GAAP measures can offer a clearer picture of ongoing operational profitability by excluding certain one-time costs, they are not standardized and can vary widely between companies.Investors should be aware that the inability to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP Operating Income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure could limit the transparency of the company's financial outlook. This lack of reconciliation is attributed to unpredictable factors such as share-based compensation, which can be substantial in tech companies and impact financial results significantly.It is also essential to consider the legal and regulatory environment surrounding the use of non-GAAP measures, as regulatory bodies often scrutinize these measures to ensure they are not misleading. WalkMe's compliance with these regulations and clear communication to investors is critical to maintain trust and avoid legal scrutiny. 02/21/2024 - 07:00 AM Ended 2023 generating $11.5M and 4% margin in FCF compared to a cash burn of $53.9M and (22%) last year.4Q23 Non-GAAP Operating Income of $4.8M or 7% compared to a loss of ($10.5M) or (16%) in 4Q22.Finished the year for the first time with a Non-GAAP Net Income per share of $0.04 compared to a loss of ($0.66) for 2022.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators: In addition to our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, this press release and the accompanying tables and related presentation materials may contain one or more of the following non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) attributable to WalkMe Ltd., Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per share attributable to WalkMe Ltd. and Free Cash Flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision making. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit excluding share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and non-recurring legal settlement expenses related to a complex class action lawsuit and related claims which are considered outside of the company's ordinary course of business. We exclude these items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our core operating performance during the period, and because we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We use Non-GAAP Gross Profit with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. Non-GAAP Gross Margin is calculated as a percentage of revenues. Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We define Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) as net income (loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, restructuring expenses and non-recurring legal settlement expenses related to a complex class action lawsuit and related claims which are considered outside of the company's ordinary course of business. We exclude these items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our core operating performance during the period, and because we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We use Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is calculated as a percentage of revenues. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) attributable to WalkMe Ltd. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) attributable to WalkMe Ltd. as Net Income (Loss) attributable to WalkMe Ltd. excluding share-based compensation, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, restructuring expenses, non-recurring legal settlement expenses and adjustment attributable to non-controlling interest. We exclude these items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our core operating performance during the period, and because we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We use Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) attributable to WalkMe Ltd. with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share attributable to WalkMe Ltd. is calculated based on the periodic weighted average of ordinary shares basic and diluted. Free Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors, even if negative, about the amount of cash used in our business. Our Free Cash Flow may vary from period to period and be impacted as we continue to invest for growth in our business. ARR. We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which we are negotiating a renewal). Our calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, upgrades or downgrades, or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms. In addition, the amount of actual revenue that we recognize over any 12-month period is likely to differ from ARR at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. This may occur due to new bookings, cancellations, upgrades, downgrades or other changes in pending renewals, as well as the effects of professional services revenue and acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, ARR should be viewed independently of, and not as a substitute for or forecast of, revenue and deferred revenue. Our calculation of ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies. Enterprise-Wide DAP Customers: We define Enterprise-Wide DAP Customers as those who have purchased enterprise-wide subscriptions or who have department-wide usage of our Digital Adoption Platform across four or more applications. We believe these customers are an indication of the success of our customer acquisition and expansion strategy and demonstrate the strategic demand for our Digital Adoption Platform, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation tables provided in this press release. The accompanying reconciliation tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

GALIANO GOLD RECEIVES NO OBJECTION LETTER FROM THE MINISTRY OF LANDS & NATURAL RESOURCES OF GHANA,2024-02-21T11:17:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Galiano Gold Inc. receives no objection from the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources of Ghana to become the controller of Asanko Gold Ghana Ltd. after acquiring Gold Fields Limited's 45% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine.,"GALIANO GOLD RECEIVES NO OBJECTION LETTER FROM THE MINISTRY OF LANDS & NATURAL RESOURCES OF GHANA Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Galiano Gold Inc. receives no objection from the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources of Ghana to become the controller of Asanko Gold Ghana Ltd. after acquiring Gold Fields Limited's 45% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Gold Fields Limited's 45% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine by Galiano Gold Inc. represents a significant consolidation in the gold mining sector. This move could potentially increase Galiano's resource base and production output, which are key drivers of revenue and profitability in the mining industry. The approval by the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources of the Republic of Ghana is a crucial step, removing a major regulatory hurdle and enhancing the certainty of the transaction's completion.From a financial perspective, the market will be keen on evaluating the acquisition's impact on Galiano's cash flow, debt levels and earnings per share. Investors should consider the cost of acquisition and how it will be financed, as well as the synergies expected from the integration of the Asanko Gold Mine into Galiano's portfolio. It's also important to assess the acquisition in the context of gold prices and market conditions, as these will influence the future financial performance of the combined entity. Market Research Analyst The gold mining sector is influenced by a variety of factors including geopolitical risks, regulatory changes and commodity price fluctuations. Galiano's acquisition is poised to reshape its market position, potentially improving its bargaining power with suppliers and customers and providing a more robust platform for future growth. The announcement of no further regulatory approvals needed indicates a smooth transition, which could be favorably viewed by the market.It's important to analyze the competitive landscape post-acquisition. Galiano will need to integrate the new assets efficiently to capitalize on the economies of scale and to optimize operational costs. The success of this integration will play a critical role in the company's ability to compete with other major players in the industry. Additionally, the acquisition could open up further exploration and development opportunities, contributing to long-term strategic positioning. Legal Expert The formal notification by the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources signifies compliance with Section 52 of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703) of Ghana. It's a legal endorsement that the company has met the necessary requirements to become the controller of Asanko Gold Ghana Ltd. This legal approval mitigates the risk of future disputes or regulatory challenges that could have impacted the business operations and financial stability of Galiano.Understanding the legal framework within which mining companies operate is crucial for stakeholders. The Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, governs the regulation and management of the utilization of the mineral resources in Ghana and the coordination of policies related to them. The Act's provisions ensure that mining activities are conducted in a legal and environmentally responsible manner, which can affect the operational costs and public perception of mining companies. 02/21/2024 - 06:17 AM VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Galiano Gold Inc.

The company announced a 10% dividend increase for 2024 and initiated annual guidance for the year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net sales increase of 9% to $783 million and the uptick in operating margin to 22.8% in Q4 for Gildan Activewear Inc. are indicative of robust performance in a challenging economic climate. The 89% increase in GAAP diluted EPS and the 15% rise in adjusted diluted EPS underscore the company's ability to translate sales growth into substantial earnings growth. The announcement of a 10% dividend increase signals confidence in future cash flows, potentially attracting income-focused investors. However, the stock market may have already priced in these results and the forward guidance provided will be a critical factor in future valuation adjustments.Capital allocation strategies, such as the repurchase of 5.4 million shares, reflect a shareholder-friendly approach but also suggest that management views the company's stock as undervalued or that they prefer buybacks over other investment opportunities. The net debt leverage ratio of 1.5 remains conservative, offering financial flexibility. Investors should monitor inventory levels and free cash flow, as they can be leading indicators of operational efficiency and the company's ability to sustain dividend payments and share repurchases. Market Research Analyst The activewear and hosiery markets are highly competitive, with consumer demand influenced by fashion trends, technology and economic conditions. Gildan's growth in these segments, particularly the 11% increase in hosiery and underwear sales, suggests effective market penetration and product acceptance. However, the 24% sales decline in international markets highlights the vulnerability to macroeconomic factors and underscores the need for a diversified geographic footprint to mitigate risks.As the company enters its 40th year, it is critical to assess how its 'Sustainable Growth strategy' aligns with evolving consumer preferences towards sustainability and ethical manufacturing. Gildan's emphasis on innovation, manufacturing capacity and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) could resonate well with the growing demographic of socially conscious consumers, potentially leading to brand loyalty and pricing power. Economist The broader macroeconomic context, characterized by inflationary pressures and interest rate hikes, appears to have had a mixed impact on Gildan. While net financial expenses increased due to higher interest rates, the company managed to improve its operating margin. This suggests effective cost management and pricing strategies that may shield the company from some external economic pressures. Nevertheless, the economic outlook, including consumer spending patterns and global trade dynamics, will continue to influence Gildan's performance.The company's guidance for 2024, assuming no significant market deterioration, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. The forecasted revenue growth and adjusted operating margin above the high end of the target range reflect management's confidence in operational efficiency and market positioning. The implications for stakeholders will hinge on the company's ability to navigate the uncertain economic landscape, manage supply chain risks and capitalize on market opportunities. 02/21/2024 - 06:49 AM (all amounts are in U.S. dollars except where otherwise indicated) (1) Please refer to ""Definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures"" in this press release Net sales of $783 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% vs. Q4 2022Q4 operating margin of 22.8%, adjusted operating margin1 of 19.7%Q4 diluted EPS of $0.89 up 89% and adjusted diluted EPS1 of $0.75 up 15% vs. Q4 2022Cash flow from operations of $239 million in Q4 and $547 million for the full year; free cash flow1 of $203 million in Q4 and $392 million for the full yearCapital returned to shareholders of $204 million in Q4 and $492 million for the full year, through dividends and share repurchasesCompany announces 10% dividend increase for 2024Company initiates 2024 annual guidance MONTREAL, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL: TSX and NYSE) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and initiated annual guidance for 2024. In addition, the Company announced a dividend increase of 10% for 2024. Overall, despite a challenging macro-economic backdrop and tough year over year comparative periods, 2023 was a year of strong progress on Gildan's Sustainable Growth strategy and its three key pillars focused on innovation, manufacturing capacity and ESG. Gildan finished the year with strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, an adjusted operating margin1 at the high end of the Company's target range and a return to growth in EPS. In addition, 2023 cash flow generation was robust and we closed the year with a healthy balance sheet, all of which positions us well for 2024. “Outstanding operational execution by our highly skilled team of employees across our global footprint delivered strong Q4 results"" said Vince Tyra, President and CEO. ""As the Company celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, I see a bright future ahead, where we can leverage our strengths and continue to enhance value for all stakeholders. Since joining the Company, I’ve had the opportunity to visit with hundreds of employees in Montreal and Honduras and I've met with many of our key customers during the recent industry trade shows in Las Vegas, Nevada and Long Beach, California, which fueled my excitement for the future."" We generated sales for the fourth quarter of $783 million, up 9% over the prior year, and operating margins of 22.8%. We delivered strong adjusted gross margin1 and adjusted SG&A1 performance, which together drove adjusted operating margin of 19.7%, up 90 basis points versus last year. These results yielded GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS1 of $0.89 and $0.75, up 89% and 15% respectively year over year, marking the resumption of our quarterly EPS growth. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $239 million, up $50 million, mainly driven by a normalization of inventory levels at year end compared to last year, bringing full year cash from operating activities to $547 million. After capital expenditures, we generated free cash flow1 of $203 million and $392 million, slightly below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year respectively. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares under our normal course issuer bid (NCIB) program at a total cost of approximately $173 million, bringing our total repurchases for the year close to 7% of our public float. Accordingly, the Company returned a total of $492 million of capital to shareholders in 2023 through share repurchases and dividend payments. We ended 2023 with net debt1 of $993 million and a net debt leverage ratio1 of 1.5, well within our targeted debt levels. Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsNet sales of $783 million for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2023, were up 9% over the prior year, consisting of Activewear sales of $644 million, up 8%, and sales of $139 million in the Hosiery and underwear category, up 11%. The increase in Activewear sales was due to higher volumes, driven by POS as well as higher levels of customer replenishment than the prior year. POS also reflected strength in key product categories including fleece and ring spun products, which also drove favorable mix. While we saw some POS recovery in International markets, sales were down 24% reflecting continued macro-economic challenges in these markets and the lack of inventory replenishment compared to the prior year. In the Hosiery and underwear category, the increase was mainly due to higher volumes, driven by a combination of better POS and the rollout of new programs in the mass retail channel. Despite continued industry-wide weak demand for men’s underwear and socks, we achieved a solid performance in this category. We generated gross profit of $237 million, or 30.2% of sales, versus $235 million, or 32.6% in the prior year which included an insurance gain of $25.6 million. On an adjusted basis1, gross profit of $237 million, or 30.2% of sales, was up $28 million. The resulting adjusted gross margin improvement of 110 basis points was primarily due to lower raw material costs slightly offset by lower net selling prices. As expected, we saw a sequential improvement of 270 basis points to our adjusted gross margin, as pressure from the flow-through of peak cotton costs subsided significantly in the fourth quarter. SG&A expenses of $88 million, or 11.3% of sales, were up $15 million compared to last year, reflecting higher volumes, as well as a charge of $6 million related to CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters. Adjusting for this charge, adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales of 10.5% in the quarter compares to 10.2% last year, as the impact of higher expenses more than offset the benefit of sales leverage. In the quarter, we incurred restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $11 million, mainly due to the previously announced closure of a yarn-spinning plant in the U.S., compared to $6 million of restructuring and acquisition-related costs in the prior year. Given fiscal 2023 performance and profitability projections related to our hosiery sales, we also recorded a $41 million reversal of prior hosiery-related impairment charges. After reflecting the net impact of these items in both years, operating income of $178 million was up from $93 million last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income1 of $155 million, or 19.7% of sales, compares to $136 million, or 18.8% of sales in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating income reflected higher sales and higher adjusted gross margin. The 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin was mainly due to the increase in adjusted gross margin. After reflecting net financial expenses of $21 million, up $8 million over the prior year due to higher interest rates and average net borrowing levels, and the positive benefit of a lower outstanding share base, we reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.89 and $0.75, up 89% and 15% respectively, versus diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47 and $0.65 respectively, in the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $239 million in the fourth quarter, and to $547 million for the full year, up respectively $50 million and $133 million from the prior year. Capital expenditures of $208 million for the full year, which included $36 million in the fourth quarter, came in, as expected, closer to the lower end of our target range for 2023. These investments were related to capacity and vertical integration projects, including the construction of our new large-scale, low-cost manufacturing complex in Bangladesh which continues to ramp-up. We generated free cash flow of $203 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to $392 million in 2023, up respectively $72 million and $194 million versus the prior year. For both periods, the increase in free cash flow reflected lower working capital investments versus the prior year when the Company brought inventories to higher and more optimal levels, as well as lower capital expenditures. The Company ended 2023 with net debt of $993 million, up from $874 million in 2022 and a net debt leverage ratio of 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA, well within our targeted debt levels. Full Year 2023 ResultsFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net sales of $3,196 million were down 1% year over year, as expected, reflecting a decrease of 3% in Activewear sales and a 10% increase in the Hosiery and underwear category. Activewear sales of $2,668 million were down $95 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes compared to the prior year where we saw stronger levels of distributor inventory replenishment, partly offset by slightly higher net selling prices. While overall Activewear POS was soft for the full year, we saw year over year POS trends for this category improve sequentially through the first three quarters of the year before stabilizing in the fourth quarter. International sales of $225 million were down 17% versus the prior year period mainly due to the non-recurrence of prior year restocking in addition to distributors' cautious inventory management throughout the year, in a challenged market. The strong performance in the Hosiery and underwear category, with sales of $528 million, up $50 million, was driven by growth stemming from the expansion of our private label offering and the roll-out of new underwear programs in the mass retail channel, as well as strength in hosiery. Additionally, even though industry-wide demand remained weak for these categories, we benefited from a more favorable demand environment in comparison to 2022, along with the normalization of inventories at retailers. We realized gross margins of 27.5%, down 310 basis points year over year, which includes the recognition of hurricane insurance recoveries representing 70 basis points. On an adjusted basis, gross margin of 27.4% was down 240 basis points, mainly a result of the flow-through impact of peak fiber costs on our cost of sales earlier in the year and higher manufacturing input costs, as anticipated, partly offset by slightly higher net selling prices. SG&A expenses were $330 million, or 10.3% as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the impact of CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters, detailed above, and inflation on overall costs, which were mostly offset by the impact of lower volumes, lower variable compensation expenses and the benefit from our cost containment measures. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses as percentage of sales came in line with prior year, at 10.1%. We generated operating income of $644 million or 20.1% of sales, which included the benefit of a $77 million net insurance gain, a $41 million non-cash reversal of a portion of a prior-year hosiery-related impairment charge, and a $25 million gain from the sale and leaseback of one of our U.S. distribution facilities, partly offset by higher restructuring costs of $46 million. Operating income of $603 million in 2022, or 18.6% of sales, included the non-cash impairment charge of $62 million for hosiery, partly offset by an insurance accounting gain of $26 million. On an adjusted basis, we generated operating income of $553 million in 2023, which translated to an adjusted operating margin of 17.3% compared to $639 million and 19.7% respectively last year, mainly reflecting gross margin pressure in the year. After reflecting net financial expenses of $80 million, up from $37 million last year, our net earnings and adjusted net earnings1 reached $534 million and $453 million respectively, in 2023, down 1% and 21% versus prior year. After reflecting the impact of share repurchases made under the Company's NCIB programs, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.03 and $2.57, were up 3% and down 17% respectively, versus diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.93 and $3.11 respectively, last year. OutlookOver the last year, Gildan has continued to execute on the key components of the Gildan Sustainable Growth strategy. While an industry-wide soft demand environment has meant that revenue growth during this period was challenging to achieve, we have nonetheless continued to drive market share gains in key product categories. This positions us well as we move forward, leveraging our strategy and strong capabilities, and further opportunities in the targeted markets that we serve. For 2024, we expect the following: Revenue growth for the full year to be flat to up low-single digits;Adjusted operating margin slightly above the high end of our 18% to 20% annual target range;Capex to come in at approximately 5% of sales;Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.92 to $3.07, up significantly between 13.5% and 19.5% year over year;Free cash flow above 2023 levels driven by increased profitability, lower working capital investments and lower capital expenditures than in 2023. The assumptions underpinning our 2024 guidance are as follows: Our outlook assumes that POS trends continue to improve compared to 2023, reflecting potential for recovery in various markets, as well as overall growth opportunities. Our top line guidance also takes into account the expiration of the Under Armour sock license agreement on March 31, 2024, which is expected to have minimal impact on our profitability. Excluding the impact of this agreement, full year revenue growth in 2024 would be in the low to mid-single digit range.Q1 net sales are expected to be down low single digits year over year, as the impact of higher-than-expected levels of customer replenishment realized in Q4 2023 will result in lower levels of replenishment in Q1 2024. As such, we expect Q1 adjusted operating margin to come in around the low end of our 18% to 20% target range.Given our strong free cash flow outlook, we assume share repurchases continue in 2024, with our debt leverage ratio maintained within our target range of 1 to 2 times.Though the timing of the potential enactment of legislation remains uncertain, we have incorporated the estimated impact of the implementation of draft Global Minimum Tax legislation in Canada and Barbados on our effective tax rate, retroactive to January 1, 2024, as well as certain refundable tax credits expected to be introduced in one of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which will reduce our SG&A. The above outlook assumes no meaningful deterioration from current market conditions including the pricing and inflationary environment. This outlook reflects our expectations as of February 21, 2024 and is subject to significant risks and business uncertainties, including those factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” in this press release and in our annual MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023. The board may modify, extend or terminate current or future share repurchase programs at any time. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) HighlightsAs previously announced in December 2023, the Company was included on the Dow Jones Sustainability™ (DJSI) North America Index for its ongoing efforts towards ESG initiatives, marking its 11th consecutive year of inclusion on the DJSI. More recently, Gildan was also included in the 2024 Sustainability Yearbook for the 12th consecutive year based on S&P Global’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment for its demonstrated sustainability practices. Finally, Gildan was also recently included in CDP’s leadership band for the fourth time based on its 2023 climate change disclosures.

Adjustments which impact more than one non-GAAP financial measure and ratio are explained below: Restructuring and acquisition-related costsRestructuring and acquisition-related costs are comprised of costs directly related to significant exit activities, including the closure of business locations and sale of business locations or the relocation of business activities, significant changes in management structure, as well as transaction, exit, and integration costs incurred pursuant to business acquisitions. Restructuring and acquisition-related costs is included as an adjustment in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $46 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (2022 - $0.5 million, 2021 - $8 million). Impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, net of write-downsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we reported a $32 million credit to income, as a result of an impairment reversal of $56 million and a $24 million write-off of certain intangible assets relating to the Company's Hosiery CGU. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we reported an impairment charge of $62 million relating to the Company's Hosiery CGU. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 we reported an impairment reversal of $41 million relating to the Hosiery CGU. These impairment charges and impairment reversals are included as adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. Net insurance losses (gains)Net insurance gains of $77 million (2022 - $26 million, 2021 - $46 million) for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, related to the two hurricanes which impacted the Company’s operations in Central America in November 2020. Net insurance gains relate to the recognition of insurance recoveries for business interruption losses and insurance recoveries for damaged equipment. Insurance gains relating to recoveries for business interruption losses of $74 million (2022 - nil, 2021 - nil), are recorded in insurance gains, and included as an adjustment in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. Net insurance gains and losses relating mainly to recoveries for damaged equipment, salary and benefits for idle employees of $3 million (gain), (2022 - $26 million (gain), 2021 - $46 million (gain)), are recorded in cost of sales and included as an adjustment in arriving at adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. Impact of strategic product line initiativesIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company launched a strategic initiative to significantly reduce its imprintables product line SKU count. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the Company expanded this strategic initiative to include a significant reduction in its retail product line SKU count. The objectives of this strategic initiative include exiting all ship to-the-piece activities, discontinuing overlapping and less productive styles and SKUs between brands, simplifying the Company's product portfolio and reducing complexity in its manufacturing and warehouse distribution activities. The impact of this initiative has included inventory write-downs to reduce the carrying value of discontinued SKUs to liquidation values, sales return allowances for product returns related to discontinued SKUs, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the write-down of production equipment and other assets relating to discontinued SKUs. The impact of strategic product line initiatives is included as an adjustment in arriving at adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. The charges related to this initiative in fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023, were as follows: Fiscal 2021 includes $9 million of charges included in cost of sales, consisting of $4 million in inventory write-downs related primarily to the Company's plan to discontinue its legwear and intimates product line, and the write-down of production equipment and other assets relating to discontinued SKUs of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fiscal 2022 includes $1 million gain related to the reversal of a reserve relating to Company's strategic initiatives to significantly reduce its product line SKU counts. Fiscal 2023 recoveries were nil. Gain on sale and leasebackDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a gain of $25 million ($15.5 million after reflecting $9.5 million of income tax expense) on the sale and leaseback of one of our distribution centres located in the U.S. The impact of this gain is included as an adjustment in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters Relates to the separation costs with respect to the departure of the Company’s former CEO in December 2023 and related advisory, legal and other fees and expenses related to the ongoing proxy contest and shareholder matters. The Company has recorded a charge of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, consisting of accrued termination benefits as well as advisory and legal fees, partially offset by a reversal for previously recognized stock based compensation expense. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPSAdjusted net earnings are calculated as net earnings before restructuring and acquisition-related costs, Impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, net of write-downs, the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiatives, net insurance gains, gain on sale and leaseback (new in 2023), CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023), and income tax expense or recovery relating to these items. Adjusted net earnings also excludes income taxes related to the re-assessment of the probability of realization of previously recognized or de-recognized deferred income tax assets, and income taxes relating to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of statutory income tax rate changes in the countries in which we operate. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net earnings divided by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The Company uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS to measure its net earnings performance from one period to the next, and in making decisions regarding the ongoing operations of its business, without the variation caused by the impacts of the items described above. The Company excludes these items because they affect the comparability of its net earnings and diluted EPS and could potentially distort the analysis of net earnings trends in its business performance. The Company believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses, write-offs, charges, income or recoveries that can vary from period to period. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

(2) This is a non-GAAP ratio. It is calculated as adjusted net earnings (loss) divided by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross marginAdjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiatives, and net insurance gains. The Company uses adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin to measure its performance at the gross margin level from one period to the next, without the variation caused by the impacts of the items described above. The Company excludes these items because they affect the comparability of its financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in its business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. The Company believes adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are useful to management and investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business in how efficiently the Company uses labor and materials for manufacturing goods to our customers, that could otherwise be masked by the impact of our strategic product line initiatives and net insurance gains that can vary from period to period. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

It is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by net sales excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs. Net sales excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs is a non-GAAP measure used in the denominator of the adjusted margin ratios to reverse the full effect of the SKU rationalization adjustments. Adjusted SG&A expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of salesAdjusted SG&A expenses is calculated as selling, general and administrative expenses excluding the impact of CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023). The Company uses adjusted SG&A expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales to measure its performance from one period to the next, without the variation caused by the impact of the item described above. Excluding this item does not imply it is non-recurring. The Company believes adjusted SG&A expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses and write-offs that can vary from period to period. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

It is calculated as adjusted SG&A expenses divided by net sales. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating income is calculated as operating income before restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating income also excludes impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiatives, net insurance gains, gain on sale and leaseback (new in 2023) and CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023). Adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales, excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs. Management uses adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin to measure its performance at the operating income level as we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods, without the variation caused by the impacts of the items described above. The Company excludes these items because they affect the comparability of its financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in its operating income and operating margin performance. The Company believes adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business in how efficiently the Company generates profit from its primary operations that could otherwise be masked by the impact of the items noted above that can vary from period to period. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

It is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs. Net sales excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs is a non-GAAP measure used in the denominator of the adjusted margin ratios to reverse the full effect of the SKU rationalization adjustments. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before financial expenses net, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and excludes the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, net insurance gains, the gain on sale and leaseback (new in 2023), CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023), and the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiative. Management uses adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, to facilitate a comparison of the profitability of its business on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. The Company also believes this measure is commonly used by investors and analysts to assess profitability and the cost structure of companies within the industry, as well as measure a company’s ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations, or as a common valuation measurement. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expenses, which are non-cash in nature and can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods or non-operating factors. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. This measure does not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

The Company considers free cash flow to be an important indicator of the financial strength and liquidity of its business, and it is a key metric used by management in managing capital as it indicates how much cash is available after capital expenditures to repay debt, to pursue business acquisitions, and/or to redistribute to its shareholders. Management believes that free cash flow also provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to us to service debt, fund acquisitions, and pay dividends. In addition, free cash flow is commonly used by investors and analysts when valuing a business and its underlying assets. This measure does not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

The Company considers total debt and net debt to be important indicators for management and investors to assess the financial position and liquidity of the Company, and measure its financial leverage. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

The pro-forma adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months reflects business acquisitions made during the period, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the trailing twelve month period. The Company has set a fiscal year-end net debt leverage target ratio of one to two times pro-forma adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. The net debt leverage ratio serves to evaluate the Company's financial leverage and is used by management in its decisions on the Company's capital structure, including financing strategy. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use the net debt leverage ratio to measure the financial leverage of the Company, including our ability to pay off our incurred debt. The Company's net debt leverage ratio differs from the net debt to EBITDA ratio that is a covenant in our loan and note agreements due primarily to adjustments in the latter related to lease accounting, and therefore the Company believes it is a useful additional measure. This measure does not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Return on adjusted average net assetsReturn on adjusted average net assets (Adjusted RONA) is defined as the ratio of return to adjusted average net assets for the last five quarters. Return is defined as adjusted net earnings, excluding net financial expenses and the amortization of intangible assets (excluding software), net of income tax recoveries related thereto. Average is computed as the sum of the five quarters divided by five. Adjusted average net assets are defined as the sum of average total assets, excluding average cash and cash equivalents, average net deferred income taxes, and the average accumulated amortization of intangible assets excluding software, less average total current liabilities excluding the current portion of lease obligations. Adjusted average net assets and return are non-GAAP measures used as components of Adjusted RONA. The Company uses Adjusted RONA as a performance indicator to measure the efficiency of its invested capital. Management believes Adjusted RONA is useful to investors as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our use of capital. Adjusted RONA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.

Management believes that working capital, in addition to other conventional financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provides information that is helpful to understand the financial condition of the Company. The objective of using working capital is to present readers with a view of the Company from management’s perspective by interpreting the material trends and activities that affect the short-term liquidity and financial position of the Company, including its ability to discharge its short-term liabilities as they come due. This measure is not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other public companies.

The company reported 2023 net income and non-GAAP net operating earnings, with a successful NIPSCO minority interest transaction. NiSource President and CEO, Lloyd Yates, highlights financial achievements and increased guidance, emphasizing the company's resilience and commitment to stakeholders. Positive NiSource Inc. achieves 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS at the top end of guidance range. NiSource raises 2024 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to $1.70-1.74 from $1.68-1.72. The company reaffirms 6-8% annual 2023-2028 non-GAAP NOEPS growth. NiSource reports 2023 net income and non-GAAP net operating earnings. Successful closure of NIPSCO minority interest transaction in December. NiSource emphasizes financial resilience and stakeholder commitment. Negative None. Financial Analyst A critical examination of NiSource Inc.'s financial results reveals several key indicators of the company's fiscal health and future prospects. The reported non-GAAP net operating earnings (NOEPS) of $1.60, at the higher end of the guidance range, suggests effective cost management and operational efficiency. The increase in the 2024 NOEPS guidance from $1.68-1.72 to $1.70-1.74 signals confidence in continued growth and profitability. This upward revision may influence investor sentiment positively, as guidance often serves as a proxy for future performance expectations.Furthermore, the 5-year $16 billion base capital expenditure plan is set to drive an 8-10% annual rate base growth, which is substantial for the utility sector. This investment is likely to enhance infrastructure and service quality, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and regulatory support. However, investors should be cautious of the risks associated with such significant capital outlays, including potential cost overruns and regulatory hurdles. Market Research Analyst Analyzing NiSource's market position, the successful closing of the NIPSCO minority interest transaction not only strengthens the balance sheet but also provides more financial flexibility. This strategic move may allow for more aggressive growth strategies or the pursuit of beneficial acquisitions. In the utility industry, where growth is often slow and steady, such transactions can provide a competitive edge.Additionally, the reaffirmation of a 6-8% annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth over a five-year period is an aggressive target that may set NiSource apart from its peers. This growth rate, coupled with the company's commitment to providing safe and reliable service, could enhance its reputation and brand equity, potentially leading to increased market share. Stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to meet these targets, as they will be critical in assessing the long-term sustainability of NiSource's growth strategy. Economist From an economic perspective, NiSource's financial performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The utility sector is typically considered a defensive industry, with stable demand regardless of economic cycles. NiSource's financial resilience and growth guidance suggest that it is well-positioned to weather potential economic downturns. However, the company's performance is not immune to macroeconomic factors such as interest rate changes, which could affect the cost of capital and debt servicing for its substantial capital expenditure plan.The company's decision not to provide GAAP guidance due to unpredictable factors such as weather fluctuations and asset sales underscores the inherent uncertainties in the utility industry. Investors should thus consider the potential volatility in earnings due to these factors when evaluating NiSource's financial outlook. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM Achieved 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS at top end of guidance range Raising 2024 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to $1.70-1.74 from $1.68-1.72 Reaffirming 6-8% annual 2023-2028 non-GAAP NOEPS growth Successfully closed NIPSCO minority interest transaction in December MERRILLVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today announced, on a GAAP basis, 2023 net income available to common shareholders of $661.7 million, or $1.48 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $749.0 million, or $1.70 diluted earnings per share, for the same period of 2022. NiSource also reported 2023 non-GAAP net operating earnings available to common shareholders of $716.3 million, or $1.60 diluted earnings per share, compared to non-GAAP net operating earnings available to common shareholders of $648.2 million, or $1.47 diluted earnings per share, for the same period of 2022. Schedule 1 of this press release contains a complete reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures.** NiSource is raising 2024 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to $1.70-1.74 from $1.68-1.72. The 5-year $16 billion base capital expenditure plan drives 2023-2028 annual rate base growth* of 8-10% and annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6-8%. ""Today’s 2023 earnings achievement and increased 2024 NOEPS guidance range are a testament to the resiliency of our financial commitments and our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation,” said NiSource President and CEO, Lloyd Yates. “Meanwhile, the company’s balance sheet is now strengthened and more flexible following the successful completion of the NIPSCO minority transaction in December. As we move through the winter season our more than 11,000 employees and contractors should be proud of their work providing safe and reliable service to our nearly four million customers.” *core business rate base growth; select years may exceed range **Non-GAAP Disclosure Statement This press release includes financial results and guidance for NiSource with respect to net operating earnings available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share (NOEPS), which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. The company includes this measure because management believes they permit investors to view the company’s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the company’s ongoing business performance. With respect to guidance on NOEPS, NiSource reminds investors that it does not provide a GAAP equivalent of its guidance on net operating earnings due to the impact of unpredictable factors such as fluctuations in weather, impact of asset sales and impairments and other unusual or infrequent items included in the comparable GAAP measures. The company is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on the comparable GAAP measures and, as such, is not providing guidance on a GAAP basis. In addition, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to the comparable GAAP equivalents without unreasonable efforts.

Full year 2023 saw total revenue rise by 10.4% to 256,127 kEUR from 232,023 kEUR in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was 31,397 kEUR, representing a growth of 65% from 2022. CEO emphasized resilience, growth, and strong financial position despite challenging conditions. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Materialise NV for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a positive growth trajectory, with total revenue increasing by 4.1% and 10.4% respectively. The significant growth in Adjusted EBITDA, particularly the 65% year-over-year increase, suggests operational efficiency improvements or cost management strategies that have positively impacted the bottom line. The Medical segment's performance, surpassing 100,000 kEUR in revenue, marks a substantial milestone and reflects the increasing demand for medical applications of 3D printing technology.However, the reported net loss in the fourth quarter due to non-cash impairment charges warrants attention. These charges may indicate a revaluation of certain assets, potentially due to shifts in market conditions or technology. The net profit for the full year, in contrast, shows a recovery from the previous year's net loss, which could signal a solid turnaround in the company's profitability. Materialise's strong cash position and reduced gross debt provide financial stability, which is crucial for continued investment in innovation and may positively influence investor confidence. Market Research Analyst Materialise NV's performance in the additive manufacturing and medical software sectors is reflective of broader industry trends where demand for personalized medical solutions and advanced manufacturing techniques is growing. The double-digit revenue growth in the Medical segment is particularly noteworthy, as it underscores the potential for 3D printing technology in healthcare—a sector with high barriers to entry but significant long-term growth prospects.The decrease in revenue for the Materialise Software and Manufacturing segments in the fourth quarter raises questions about market saturation or competitive dynamics within these areas. Nevertheless, the overall increase in annual revenue for these segments suggests a resilient business model. The transition towards a cloud-based subscription model for software may initially impact revenue but could lead to more stable, recurring revenue streams in the future. Medical Technology Analyst Materialise NV's success in the Medical segment is indicative of the company's ability to capitalize on the intersection of healthcare and technology. Their growth in this area can be attributed to advancements in personalized medicine and the increasing adoption of 3D printed medical devices and implants. The high Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Medical segment suggests that this area not only contributes significantly to revenue but also does so with high profitability, which is promising for future investment and development in medical applications of 3D printing.Looking forward, the company's focus on innovation and integration of a diverse product portfolio is likely to further solidify its position in the market. The emphasis on creating synergies across different product lines could lead to more efficient operations and potentially unlock new opportunities in the rapidly evolving medtech landscape. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM LEUVEN, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Materialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS), a leading provider of additive manufacturing and medical software solutions and of sophisticated 3D printing services, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

We believe our consolidated Adjusted EBIT will be a more useful guidance measure for investors and analysts going forward as Adjusted EBIT includes the periodic cost of capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our business and, as such, will allow for a better assessment of our expected performance. However, we will continue to report the segment Adjusted EBITDA of our three business segments. Mrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded, “Whereas our guidance reflects the uncertain macro-economic and geo-political environment, we believe Materialise is ideally positioned, thanks to our strong product portfolio, continued investments in innovations and strong financial foundation. We expect sales in all three of our segments to increase. The growth of our Materialise Software revenue will be further temporarily impacted by the transition towards a cloud-based subscription business model that we are continuing to implement. Based on current market conditions, we expect our full year consolidated revenues to grow to a range of 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR in 2024. The revenue growth will result in an Adjusted EBIT which we currently anticipate to total between 11,000 and 14,000 kEUR. We expect our three segments to contribute to our Adjusted EBIT in line with their contributions to our revenue growth.” Non-IFRS Measures Materialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income) and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, long term investment, rather than the performance of the company’s day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company’s indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company’s business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company’s ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company’s calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company’s presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

S (TSX:MNO), (Frankfurt/Tradegate:2MM) (OTCQB:MRRDF) (""Meridian"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the ongoing Pre-Feasibility Study (""PFS"") drill program continues to produce robust results at its Cabaçal Au-Cu-Ag deposit (""the Project""). Multiple wide zones with internal high-grade cores, such as CD-400's 25.8m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq including 9.5m @ 2.9 g/t AuEq & CD-399's 15.3m @ 1.7 g/t AuEq including 5.1m @ 4.0 g/t AuEq1 (""Figure 1""). The ongoing PFS drill program continues with the aim to convert in-pit resources to higher classifications and increase confidence in the flagship Cabaçal project.The Company is also reporting the results of the geotechnical studies that have potential to increase the Cabaçal's pit wall angles that would deliver a meaningful reduction in the strip ratio.The northwestern limit of Cabaçal deposit remains open with a new cupriferous gossan outcrop defined (""Figure 1""). Further results from Cabaçal and Santa Helena are pending.Highlights Reported TodayStrong results of gold-copper-silver mineralization including CD-400's 25.8m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq including 9.5m @ 2.9 g/t AuEq reported by Meridian Mining;Meridian drills zones of gold and copper at Cabaçal grading up to 9.5m @ 2.9 g/t AuEq;CD-399: 15.3m @ 1.7 g/t AuEq from 125.5m; including5.1m @ 4.0 g/t AuEq from 126.1m;CD-400: 25.8m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq from 48.0m; including9.5m @ 2.9 g/t AuEq from 62.5m;CD-404: 20.4m @ 1.1 g/t AuEq from 101.2m;3.8m @ 3.6 g/t AuEq from 113.5m;Cabaçal's current geotechnical studies suggest optionality to steepen pit walls to 54°;High likelihood that Cabaçal's in-pit strip ratio may decrease below PEA's 2.1:1; andNorthwestern limit of Cabaçal deposit remains open with new cupriferous gossan outcrop.Mr. Gilbert Clark, CEO, comments: ""These broad zones of open pitable mineralization, are the economic foundations of the industry leading Cabaçal economics, demonstrated in our 2023 PEA. Cabaçal's forward momentum continues with our geotechnical studies indicating good potential for steepening the pit walls, (which may lower the strip ratio, and deliver a reciprocal economic benefit in the up-coming PFS). Finding a gossan outcropping at Cabaçal's northwestern limit indicates that even after 2km of resource delineation success, near-mine extensions remain to be tested. When I look at the greater picture, I see tremendous potential for Cabaçal to emerge as another world-class Latin American VMS camp.1 See below Technical Notes for AuEq commodity prices, recoveries and equationsCabaçal Project Development And Resource Definition ProgramThe Cabaçal resource development program continues, with three rigs currently deployed. Results recently received included infill holes drilled from the Cabaçal Northwest Extension (‘CNWE'), and historical Cabaçal mine area. These results form part of the PFS process that is a crucial phase in the development and growth of the project.Drill results from the CNWE were returned from the 25m infill program. Results include:CD-395: 10.9m @ 1.3 g/t AuEq (0.1 g/t Au, 0.8% Cu & 1.4 g/t Ag) from 43.7m;Including:4.1m @ 2.8 g/t AuEq (0.2 g/t Au, 1.8% Cu & 2.9 g/t Ag) from 50.0m;CD-396: 15.6m @ 0.8 g/t AuEq (0.2 g/t Au, 0.4% Cu & 0.8 g/t Ag) from 44.4m;Including:8.7m @ 2.0 g/t AuEq (0.9 g/t Au, 0.8% Cu & 2.6 g/t Ag) from 95.0m;10.1m @ 1.3 g/t AuEq (0.3 g/t Au, 0.7% Cu & 1.1 g/t Ag) from 118.3m;CD-399: 15.3m @ 1.7 g/t AuEq (0.3 g/t Au, 1.0% Cu & 1.6 g/t Ag) from 125.5m;Including:5.1m @ 4.0 g/t AuEq (0.6 g/t Au, 2.4% Cu & 3.2 g/t Ag) from 126.1m;CD-404: 20.4m @ 1.1 g/t AuEq (0.4 g/t Au, 0.5% Cu & 0.8 g/t Ag); including 101.2m;Including:3.8m @ 3.6 g/t AuEq (1.3 g/t Au, 1.7% Cu & 2.2 g/t Ag) from 113.5m; andCD-413: 8.4m @ 1.5 g/t AuEq (0.2 g/t Au, 0.9% Cu & 1.8 g/t Ag) from 73.7m.The results form part of broader zones of mineralization (Table 1) and continue to improve modelling of grade continuity. Results show robust levels of copper mineralization at the lower contact which will improve modelling of grade continuity.Copper-stained gossaniferous exposure was observed at the limits of the CNWE, within a band of magnetite banded iron formation. The recognition of this stratigraphic unit is of great interest, as a potential favourable host unit to the gold overprint event. Some of Brazil's best gold deposits are hosted by banded iron units (Rio das Velhas greenstone belt, ""Quadrilátero Ferrífero"").Angled holes in the mine area returned:CD-393 (SCZ): 17.8m @ 1.0 g/t AuEq (0.4 g/t Au, 0.5% Cu & 1.0 g/t Ag) from 70.3m;Including:3.3m @ 4.2 g/t AuEq (1.5 g/t Au, 1.9% Cu & 3.5 g/t Ag) from 70.7m;CD-400 (CCZ): 25.8m @ 1.4g/t AuEq (0.9g/t Au, 0.4% Cu, 2.2 g/t Ag) from 48.0m;Including:9.5m @ 2.9 g/t AuEq (1.7 g/t Au, 0.9% Cu, 5.5 g/t Ag) from 62.5m;CD-414 (SCZ): 4.1m @ 3.3 g/t AuEq (1.7 g/t Au, 1.1% Cu & 4.7 g/t Ag) from 42.1m; and21.9m @ 0.9 g/t AuEq (0.4 g/t Au, 0.4% Cu & 1.9 g/t Ag) from 53.1m; andCD-427 (SCZ): 22.6m @ 1.4 g/t AuEq (0.4 g/t Au, 0.7% Cu & 3.4 g/t Ag) from 59.5m;Including:8.8m @ 2.8 g/t AuEq (0.6 g/t Au, 1.5% Cu & 7.5 g/t Ag) from 64.4m.The drilling in the mine area provides for further validation of the mine workings and the extensive open pitable mineralization left in the higher-grade pillars. In the mine area, as part of the PFS validation program, the Company is also making additional efforts to locate a number of missing historical holes, particularly those reported and mapped in the Southern Copper Zone. These holes are not in Meridian's modern drill hole data base but host multiple assays of high-grade >5.5g/t Au (including visible gold), and high-grade copper >3.5% Cu. A final program may be undertaken to target these copper-gold zones as they represent potential zones where an under-call of the resource Cabaçal may exist.The forward program will particularly focus infilling areas of where resources remain inferred to unclassified. The Company has successfully executed a number of holes at low angles following adaptations to the small footprint rig, where topographic access has been more restricted.Figure 1: Highlights from recent drilling and field mapping at the Cabaçal depositCabaçal Pit Geotechnical StudyAs part of the data generation requirements for its pre-feasibility study of the Cabaçal project, Meridian has commissioned the independent geotechnical consultancy, Fundação Luiz Englert, to undertake a geotechnical study of the Cabaçal pit in order to deliver enhanced confidence to the assumptions that were used in the Cabaçal preliminary economic study completed in March 2023.Six dedicated geotechnical holes were drilled as part of the 2023 project development campaign, and fifty-nine specific resource development holes have been geotechnically logged (""Figure 2"") using a template recommended by the Company's Brazilian consultancy, with logging ongoing in parallel with the resource development program.Figure 2: Top: perspective view of project development drilling at Cabaçal - hydrogeological holes in blue; holes with geotechnical logging in green, holes with geotechnical sampling in red, Bottom: in relation to the PEA pit shell.Conservative pit wall angles of 48 degrees were assumed for the PEA in the absence of specific geotechnical data. Mining consultants GE21 have reviewed the outcomes of the geotechnical studies and assessments indicate optionality to increase the global hanging wall in the Cabaçal pit up to 54 degrees (a 12.5% steepening of the pit wall). New data will be reviewed and fed into the Cabaçal PFS. A reduction in the volume of waste rock offers scope to improve the stripping ratio for the project. Mining lower volumes of waste rock would benefit the operating costs for the project as well as result in smaller areas required for the storage of waste rock. Final assumptions will be reviewed with the advancement of the drilling program in the lead up to the pre-feasibility.About MeridianMeridian Mining UK S is focused on:The development and exploration of the advanced stage Cabaçal VMS gold‐copper project;Regional scale exploration of the Cabaçal VMS belt; andExploration in the Jaurú & Araputanga Greenstone belts (the above all located in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil).Cabaçal is a gold-copper-silver rich VMS deposit with the potential to be a standalone mine within the 50km VMS belt. Cabaçal's base and precious metal-rich mineralization is hosted by volcanogenic type, massive, semi-massive, stringer, and disseminated sulphides within deformed metavolcanic-sedimentary rocks. A later-stage gold overprint event has emplaced high-grade gold mineralization.The Preliminary Economic Assessment technical report (the ""PEA Technical Report"") dated March 30, 2023, entitled: ""Cabaçal Gold-Copper Project NI 43-101 Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment, Mato Grosso, Brazil"" outlines a base case after-tax NPV5 of USD 573 million and 58.4% IRR from a pre-production capital cost of USD 180 million, leading to capital repayment in 10.6 months (assuming metals price scenario of USD 1,650 per ounces of gold, USD 3.59 per pound of copper, and USD 21.35 per ounce of silver). Cabaçal has a low All-in-Sustaining-Cost of USD 671 per ounce gold equivalent for the first five years, driven by high metallurgical recovery, a low life-of-mine strip ratio of 2.1:1, and the low operating cost environment of Brazil (see press release dated March 6, 2023).The Cabaçal Mineral Resource estimate consists of Indicated resources of 52.9 million tonnes at 0.6g/t gold, 0.3% copper and 1.4g/t silver and Inferred resources of 10.3 million tonnes at 0.7g/t gold, 0.2% copper & 1.1g/t silver (at a 0.3 g/t gold equivalent cut-off grade), including a higher-grade near-surface zone supporting a starter pit.Readers are encouraged to read the PEA Technical Report in its entirety.

Samples are dried, crushed with 75% passing <3 mm, split to give a mass of 250-300g, pulverized with 95% passing 150#. Gold analyses are conducted by FAA505 (fire assay of a 50g charge), and base metal analysis by methods ICP40B and ICP40B_S (four acid digest with ICP-OES finish). Visible gold intervals are sampled by metallic screen fire assay method MET150-FAASCR. Samples are held in the Company's secure facilities until dispatched and delivered by staff and commercial couriers to the laboratory. Pulps and coarse rejects are retained and returned to the Company for storage. The Company submits a range of quality control samples, including blanks and gold and polymetallic standards supplied by Rocklabs, ITAK and OREAS, supplementing laboratory quality control procedures. Approximately 5% of archived samples are sent for umpire laboratory analysis, including any lots exhibiting QAQC outliers after discussion with the laboratory. In BP Minerals sampling, gold was analysed historically by fire assay and base metals by three acid digest and ICP finish at the Nomos laboratory in Rio de Janeiro. Silver was analysed by aqua regia digest with an atomic absorption finish. True width is considered to be 80-90% of intersection width. Assay figures and intervals are rounded to 1 decimal place. Gold equivalents for Cabaçal are calculated as: AuEq(g/t) = (Au(g/t) * %Recovery) + (1.492*(Cu% * %Recovery)) + (0.013*(Ag(g/t) * %Recovery)), where:Au_recovery_ppm = 5.4368ln(Au_Grade_ppm)+88.856Cu_recovery_pct = 2.0006ln(Cu_Grade_pct)+94.686Ag_recovery_ppm = 13.342ln(Ag_Grade_ppm)+71.037Recoveries based on 2022 metallurgical testwork on core submitted to SGS LakefieldQualified PersonMr. Erich Marques, B.Sc., MAIG, Chief Geologist of Meridian Mining and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed, and verified the technical information in this news release.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSSome statements in this news release contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements for the purposes of applicable securities laws.

(TSXV: KDK) (OTCQB: KDKCF) (FSE: 5DD1) (the ""Company"" or ""Kodiak"") today reports prospecting, geophysical and geochemical survey results from the 2023 regional exploration program on its 100% owned MPD copper-gold porphyry project in southern British Columbia.Highlights Kodiak's 2023 regional exploration program identified five new targets at MPD: Agie, Leeside, Celeste, Orbit and Comet. This brings the total number of prospective areas to 24, of which only eight have been drilled by Kodiak to date. Figure 1.Regional work has confirmed significant copper-gold porphyry mineralization stretching for 20 kilometres across numerous target areas, consistent with multiple porphyry centres and highlighting the district-scale potential of the MPD Project.Two new target areas are considered drill ready (Blue and Celeste). In addition to these new drill targets, several trends drilled by Kodiak in 2023 continue to be high-priority for the 2024 drill program (South-Mid-Adit and Man-Belcarra-Gate), and further target areas are being evaluated and prioritized. Figures 2, 3 and 4At the Blue target, a new 3D Induced Polarization (3D-IP) geophysical response extends from surface to a depth of 700 metres. The anomaly is associated with a kilometre-scale copper-in soil anomaly and prospecting samples with significant copper-gold-silver, including a sample with 3.19% Cu, 0.21 g/t Au and 41 g/t Ag (news releases February 28, 2023 and February 3, 2022). Figures 2 and 3At Celeste, a new 700-metre-long copper-in-soil anomaly coincides with substantial copper-gold-silver in new prospecting samples and a historic 3D-IP response. The Celeste target occurs just 600 metres north of the drilled, high-grade West Zone (news release October 17, 2023). Grab samples collected from Celeste in 2023 include 0.69% Cu, 0.68 g/t Au and 4.5 g/t Ag Figure 4 A new soil geochemical grid covering the Star and Eclipse areas now links these two targets with a two-kilometre-long copper-in-soil trend, corroborated by high-grade copper-gold assays from bedrock samples throughout. This area has not yet been drilled tested. Figure 2Kodiak's 2023 Regional Exploration Program included the collection of 2,705 soil samples, 57 rock samples, a 3D-IP survey over 2.6 square kilometres, geological and geotechnical studies.Claudia Tornquist, President and CEO of Kodiak said, ""Kodiak's substantial regional exploration program in 2023 has once again highlighted the prospectivity of the MPD property. We have now 24 target areas, many of them hosting large, kilometre-scale anomalies. With our drilling to date, we have tested eight target areas and have results from six, with the remaining two expected soon. So far, we have hit copper at every drilled target, including mineralization from surface and to a depth of almost a kilometre. Importantly we have delineated large high-grade zones at several targets. Kodiak's team is currently preparing for our 2024 drill program which will commence in spring. With many compelling drill targets ready for testing we are excited to get back on the ground and continue proving what we have believed in from the start: that MPD is a major porphyry system with the potential to become a world-class mine in the future.""Figure 1: Plan map showing 24 Target Areas at MPD Project to date.

Samples collected in both the MPD North and South Project areas continue to return significant copper porphyry mineralization (with associated gold and silver) and have identified several polymetallic showings. A select 14 assays from the 2023 prospecting, with rock type descriptions, are included in Table 1 and Figure 5.Results SummaryThe highest copper and silver prospecting results in 2023 assayed 1.66 % Cu, 0.28 g/t Au and 699 g/t Ag from the Agie Target area (sample 222230). Samples in the historic Agie Pit and Siwash Creek areas highlight the potential for polymetallic occurrences in the northeast corner of MPD North claims.Similarly, prospecting in 2023 discovered the new Comet polymetallic showing on the MPD South claims acquired in 2023. The best sample assayed 2.87% Zn, 13.9 g/t Ag and 0.08% Cu (sample 222159) from skarn-altered host rock. More follow-up is warranted. The highest gold value was returned from follow-up sampling in the Beyer target area and assayed 0.20 % Cu, 2.39 g/t Au and 25.5 g/t Ag (sample 222163).Prospecting samples from porphyritic diorite in new target areas called Leeside and Orbit contained significant copper, gold and silver. Small soil surveys conducted at these locations were also anomalous and further work is planned. Follow up prospecting was carried out in the Celeste and 1516 areas to determine the extent of mineralization near high priority targets drill-tested in 2023. At Celeste, significant copper-gold-silver assays (samples 222239 and 222154) confirmed a new drill-ready target having a sizable copper-in-soil anomaly and historic IP response.

The 2023 3D-IP survey expanded upon survey areas completed in prior years and consisted of 51 grid line kilometres, oriented east-west and covering 2.6 square kilometres. The survey focused on assessing kilometre-scale geochemical trends and corroborating prospecting results found in the Blue and Sky target areas. Based on the survey configuration, the 3D-IP survey data is interpreted to a depth of at least 700 metres. The work also included a simultaneous magneto telluric (MT) survey. The benefit of the MT survey is deep penetration which can assist interpreting deeper drill targets. Results Summary2023 3D-IP data generated a new drill target at Blue, characterised by a broad chargeability anomaly from surface to 700 metres depth. Figure 3Much like other successful copper porphyry discoveries by Kodiak at MPD, the 3D-IP response at the Blue Target coincides with the north end of a two-kilometre-long copper-in soil trend and significant prospecting results (see news release February 3, 2022). The Blue Target area has never been drilled and corroborating results from soils, rock and geophysics highlight the potential for a sizable new copper porphyry discovery.2023 Soil GeochemicalThe 2023 soil geochemical surveying was comprised of 2,705 samples collected on seven grids targeting prospective areas across the MPD claim block, and one single claim just off-property. Samples of ""B"" horizon subsoil (300-500 grams) were collected at a nominal spacing of 50 metres along lines 100 metres apart. Figure 6Anomalous copper values up to 3,700 ppm and gold values up to 0.500 ppm were returned from the 2023 soil sampling. With grids spread over 20 kilometres of the project area, percentile analysis was separated into the MPD North and South areas to account for differences in topography and overburden depth and are included as Table 2.Results SummaryThe largest soil grid in 2023 covered seven square kilometres of prospective geology in the Star-Eclipse target area. New soil results confirmed historic work and now link these two targets with a two-kilometre-long copper-in-soil trend corroborated by high-grade copper-gold assays from bedrock samples throughout. This area has not yet been drilled tested. Figure 2Results from the 2023 geochemical survey discovered the new drill-ready Celeste target 600 metres north of the recently drilled West Zone at MPD South. This 700-metre wide ""look-alike"" copper-in-soil anomaly is verified by substantial copper-gold-silver found in recent prospecting results and coincides with a chargeability anomaly in historic IP surveying. Figure 4Metallic anomalies were present in all soil geochemical grids in 2023. This work was key in identifying, characterizing and prioritising target areas for additional follow-up and drilling.Figure 6: Staff collecting geochemical soil samples on the MPD Project in 2023.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3803/198689_6c948a57f4924b99_007full.jpgTable 2: 2023 Soil Geochemical Sampling - Value Ranges and Anomalous Thresholds for Copper-Gold-Silver.PercentileCu (ppm)n*PercentileAu (ppm)n*PercentileAg (ppm)n*MPD North Grids7567.25528750.004549750.2453090100.95212900.006216900.3721295140.00107950.010106950.5210798189.5044980.02143980.6843Min3.84Min0.0002Min0.01Max3700Max0.500Max11.65Mean59.86Mean0.004Mean0.20MPD South Grids7533.60125750.002129750.131269047.9150900.00350900.19509559.6825950.00625950.23279879.8210980.01011980.2810Min4.7Min0.0001Min0.011Max786Max0.182Max0.94Mean30.89Mean0.002Mean0.11 *Number of samples MPD is a large land package (226 square kilometres) located near several operating mines in the southern Quesnel Terrane, British Columbia's primary copper-gold producing belt.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 21, 2024) - Exploits Discovery Corp. (CSE: NFLD) (OTCQX: NFLDF) (FSE: 634) (""Exploits"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce further results from its till sampling program recently conducted on its 100% owned Gazeebow South property located along the Appleton Fault Zone (""AFZ"") in Central Newfoundland. The elevated number of gold grains from this expanded program highlights the potential for the northern Appleton Fault Zone and related splays to be a source of gold mineralization on the Gazeebow South property. Highlights Include:This expanded till program further indicates that the three previously announced areas (Sept. 28, 2023) along the Appleton Fault Zone continue to show elevated gold grain counts; reaching up to 14 times greater than the area's background levels.Infill sampling for this expanded program was conducted at 200 x 200 metres, with select local grids conducted at 100 x 100 metres.Recent additional anomalous samples include:141 Total Gold Grains of which 68 (48%) are classified as 'Modified' (28) or 'Pristine' (40)122 Total Gold Grains of which 20 (16%) are classified as 'Modified' (10) or 'Pristine' (10)86 Total Gold Grains of which 30 (35%) are classified as 'Modified' (11) or 'Pristine' (19)83 Total Gold Grains of which 14 (17%) are classified as 'Modified' (9) or 'Pristine' (5)Jeff Swinoga, President and CEO, comments, ""Results from our expanded till survey program continue to be impressive and increase our belief that gold mineralization continues northwards on the Appleton Fault Zone. Over the past four years, there have been 22 gold zones discovered over a 14 km stretch of the Appleton Fault Zone just south of our large Gazeebow property. Our Gazeebow property has 7 kms of the northern Appleton Fault Zone (approximately five times more than our Bullseye property). These results further indicate the district scale potential of this region of Central Newfoundland. We intend to continue to develop drill ready targets on Gazeebow for 2024 to potentially create a pipeline of gold discoveries in the future. ""With respect to our Bullseye property, we expect to report assay results in the coming weeks from our recently completed 2,500 metre drill program that was designed to test the eastern extension of New Found Gold's recently-discovered Jackpot zone. Our neighbours continue to build on their successful track record within the Appleton system with the announcement of their newest gold discovery called ""Honeypot"" sitting approximately 300 metres north of Jackpot and within 100 metres of our claim border at Bullseye. These are exciting times as five new gold zones have been discovered within the past year along a one-kilometre segment of the Appleton Fault Zone."" Ottawa-based Overburden Drilling Management (""ODM"") was retained to process the till samples, extract and describe the gold grains. Mike Michaud P.Geo., Vice President of ODM commented, ""The till sample processing to date has identified a property background of 0 to 10 pristine + modified gold grains per sample in the survey area on the Gazeebow South property. ODM considers till samples to be anomalous if they yield at least two to three times background levels. Samples in three discrete areas meet this anomaly threshold ranging up to 14 times background of total gold grains. Many of the anomalous gold grain counts have been corroborated by neighbouring samples with anomalous or elevated counts. Based on this extended program results, there is room for follow-up sampling to further define the anomalies and trace glacial dispersion.""Figure 1: Gazeebow South till sample overview map.

Till production through glacial erosion and deposition provides a larger target area than the surface expression of the target helping to minimize the search area over large areas of land.This till sampling program was designed to appraise the levels of gold endowment associated with he interpreted Appleton Fault Zone that transects the Gazeebow South property. Samples were collected at 500 x 500 metre gridded pattern. The Company has commenced follow-up till sampling on 100 metre spacings to better define the extent of the anomalies and identify the source of the gold.Figure 3: Example of gold grain shape/size characteristics from Sample GZS-P5-067 collected by Exploits' trained field technicians from till samples at Gazeebow South during the fall 2023 follow-up sampling campaign.

Till samples are collected from hand-dug pits that extend down to the C-Soil horizon, approximately 1 - 2 metres deep. Approximately 12 kilograms of sample material is sieved through a -8 millimetre (1/4"") mesh and placed in a sample bag with unique sample tag. All sampling equipment is thoroughly cleaned between samples.Till samples are processed by Overburden Drilling Management of Nepean, Ontario. ODM uses custom gravity concentration including shaking tables and micro-panning of the resulting heavy mineral concentrates to recover gold grains from the samples. Any gold grains present are extracted for microscopic study to determine the morphology and dimensions of the grains.National Instrument 43-101 DisclosureKen Tylee, P.Geo., VP of Exploration with Exploits, is a qualified person within the Provinces of Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador as defined by NI 43-101.

Positive Revenue increased by 2% year-over-year to $216.3 million GAAP net income for Q1 was $26.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share Non-GAAP net income was $29.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share IC revenue grew by 1% year-over-year to $157.6 million FPD revenue increased by 8% from the same quarter last year to $58.7 million Cash generated from operating activities was $41.5 million Cash balance at the end of the quarter was $508.5 million Negative None. Financial Analyst The quarterly financial results of Photronics, Inc. suggest a modest growth in revenue, with a 2% increase year-over-year. This indicates resilience in the face of what was described as weaker than anticipated seasonal demand. The increase in high-end IC revenue, particularly in the 22nm and 28nm nodes, reflects ongoing industry trends towards higher performance and cost optimization. However, the sequential decrease in revenue and net income may raise concerns about the company's short-term momentum, despite the CEO's optimistic outlook for growth in the second quarter.Photronics' operating margin improvement year-over-year is a positive sign, demonstrating enhanced efficiency or cost management. Yet, investors should note the contraction from the previous quarter, which may be attributed to increased operating expenses. The strong cash generation and solid balance sheet, with a high cash balance and manageable debt, position the company favorably for investing in growth without compromising financial stability. The guidance for the second quarter indicates potential revenue growth and an increase in non-GAAP net income, which could signal confidence in the company's business trajectory. Market Research Analyst The reported growth in high-end FPD revenue year-over-year, despite a sequential decrease, suggests that market demand for premium smartphone displays, particularly those using AMOLED technology, remains robust on a yearly basis but subject to seasonal fluctuations. This aligns with the broader trend in consumer electronics where premium products often see a surge in demand during specific periods of the year. Furthermore, Photronics' performance in the IC segment, with revenue growth in the 22nm and 28nm nodes, indicates the company's alignment with the semiconductor industry's progression towards more advanced nodes.It's important to consider the competitive landscape and technological advancements in the photomask industry when evaluating Photronics' prospects. As semiconductor companies continue to push for smaller and more efficient nodes, suppliers like Photronics must keep pace with these technological demands. The company's investments in growth, as indicated by their capital expenditures, suggest a strategic focus on maintaining and enhancing their technological capabilities to meet future market needs. Technology Industry Analyst Photronics operates in a highly specialized segment of the semiconductor industry, providing photomask technologies crucial for chip manufacturing. The mention of growth in revenue from 22nm and 28nm nodes reflects the company's foothold in an essential area of semiconductor production. These nodes are considered mature technologies but are still in high demand for various applications due to their balance of performance and cost. As semiconductor manufacturers invest in next-generation technologies, suppliers like Photronics must navigate the transition from mature to advanced nodes while maintaining revenue streams.The company's financial health, as evidenced by their cash balance and liquidity, is crucial for funding R&D and capital expenditures necessary to stay competitive in the photomask market. The ability to generate cash while investing in growth is a positive sign of operational efficiency and strategic planning. However, the sequential decline in operating margin and net income may indicate the need for careful monitoring of cost structures and operating expenses to sustain profitability amid the industry's rapid evolution. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM BROOKFIELD, Conn., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB), a worldwide leader in photomask technologies and solutions, today reported financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended January 28, 2024. “First quarter revenue increased year-over-year even though typically lower seasonal demand was weaker than anticipated, especially in the beginning of the quarter. Order rates improved through the quarter, continuing into second quarter,” said Frank Lee, chief executive officer. “High-end IC revenue increased both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily in 22nm and 28nm nodes, as customers continue migration to these nodes for improved performance and optimal cost. High-end FPD also increased over last year’s first quarter, but decreased from the fourth quarter due to typically lower seasonal demand for premium smartphone displays that use AMOLED technology. Operating margin increased year-over-year, but contracted sequentially, resulting from operating leverage in the year-over-year result and the impact of higher operating expenses in the sequential comparison. Cash generation remains strong, further strengthening our balance sheet with ample liquidity for our profitable growth investments. The Photronics team continues their outstanding performance, and with expectations for growth in the second quarter, we are building momentum for another record year in 2024.” First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results Revenue was $216.3 million, up 2% year-over-year and down 5% sequentiallyGAAP net income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders was $26.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with $14.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share in the first quarter 2023 and $44.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023Non-GAAP net income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders was $29.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $24.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the first quarter 2023 and $37.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023IC revenue was $157.6 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentiallyFPD revenue was $58.7 million, up 8% from the same quarter last year and down 7% sequentiallyCash generated from operating activities was $41.5 million, and cash invested in organic growth through capital expenditures was $43.3 million; we received $1.1 million in government incentives for investments madeCash balance at the end of the quarter was $508.5 million, with $13.0 million in short-term investments and $23.4 million in debt Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Guidance For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Photronics expects revenue to be between $226 million and $236 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to Photronics, Inc. shareholders to be between $0.50 and $0.58 per diluted share.

The company has strengthened its balance sheet, reduced debt, and improved efficiency. The outlook for 2024 includes expectations of increased profitability and growth. Positive Wolverine World Wide has completed the stabilization phase of its transformation plan. Revenue for 2023 declined by 20.8% compared to the prior year. Gross margin improved to 36.6% from 33.7% in the prior year. Inventory was reduced by approximately 50% compared to the prior year. Net Debt decreased by $285 million to $740 million. The company expects improved profitability in 2024 with cost benefits of $140 million. Gross margin for 2024 is expected to increase to approximately 44.5%. Operating margin for 2024 is expected to be around 5.7%. Adjusted operating margin for 2024 is expected to be about 7.0%. Diluted earnings per share for 2024 are projected to be between $0.43 and $0.63. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2024 are expected to be between $0.65 and $0.85. Inventory is expected to decline by at least $70 million by the end of 2024. Net Debt at year-end 2024 is expected to be approximately $575 million. Negative Revenue for 2023 declined significantly by 20.8%. Selling, General & Administrative expenses were 72.1% of revenue in Q4 2023. Adjusted SG&A expenses were 450 basis points higher than the prior year. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for 2023 were negative at $(0.30). The Company's bank-defined leverage ratio was 2.9x at the end of Q4 2023. Full-year 2023 Diluted Earnings Per Share were negative at $(0.51). Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for 2023 were $0.05, a significant decrease from the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expenses for 2023 were 250 basis points higher than the prior year. Constant Currency Earnings Per Share for 2023 were $0.15, a decrease from the prior year. Gross margin for 2023 was 38.9%, a decrease from the prior year's 39.9%. Financial Analyst Examining the recent financial results from Wolverine World Wide, Inc., we observe a strategic pivot that has influenced their balance sheet and cost structure, with implications for future profitability and growth. The reported decline in total revenue by 20.8% year-over-year and ongoing total revenue by 18.4% on a constant currency basis is a significant contraction. However, the improvement in gross margin by 290 basis points (bps) and operating margin by 3,290 bps year-over-year for Q4 2023 indicates a successful effort in cost management and inventory control. These improvements can be attributed to less promotional eCommerce sales and the sale of higher-cost inventory containing transitory supply chain costs from 2022. Furthermore, the company's net debt reduction by $285 million and the reduction in inventory levels by approximately 50% reflect a stronger liquidity position and a more efficient capital structure. The forward-looking statements for 2024, projecting a gross margin increase of 460 bps and an operating margin increase of 310 bps, suggest an optimistic outlook on profitability. However, the projected decline in revenue for 2024 should be monitored closely by investors, as it may indicate ongoing challenges in demand or market positioning. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the strategic divestitures and transition to a licensing model, particularly the sale of Keds and the U.S. and non-U.S. Wolverine Leathers business, represent a significant repositioning of Wolverine World Wide's brand portfolio. The focus on a smaller set of core brands, like Merrell and Saucony, could streamline the company's marketing efforts and potentially enhance brand equity. However, the reported declines in revenue across all segments, with the Active Group and Work Group seeing reductions of 14.2% and 18.9% respectively and a striking 46.8% decline in the 'Other' category, which includes Sperry, Keds and Hush Puppies, could be indicative of broader market challenges or a shift in consumer preferences. The intent to drive growth through 'performance-led product innovation and design' aligns with current consumer trends favoring functionality and sustainability. Wolverine's emphasis on direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels, despite the reported 17.6% decline, aligns with broader industry shifts towards DTC models, which can offer higher margins and closer customer relationships. Economist Considering the macroeconomic environment, Wolverine World Wide's financial performance and outlook must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape that includes potential headwinds such as inflation, supply chain disruptions and changing consumer spending patterns. The company's international revenue decline of 5.1% and the constant currency basis decline of 6.2% suggest that global economic factors are impacting performance and this could continue into the 2024 fiscal year. The company's proactive cost reduction measures, including a $140 million benefit from profit improvement initiatives, are essential in maintaining financial health amid economic uncertainty. The expected reduction in interest expense by approximately $20 million due to lower debt levels is a prudent financial strategy that could enhance cash flow and provide additional flexibility in an uncertain interest rate environment. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM Company Significantly Strengthens its Balance Sheet and Improves Cost Structure, Enabling an Acceleration of its Transformation to Become Great Global Brand Builders ROCKFORD, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Wolverine World Wide, Inc.

FULL-YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (in millions) December 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Y/Y Change Constant Currency Change Segment Revenue Results: Active Group $1,439.1 $1,570.2 (8.3)% (8.1)% Work Group $480.6 $590.5 (18.6)% (19.0)% Other $323.2 $524.1 (38.3)% (37.9)% Total Revenue $2,242.9 $2,684.8 (16.5)% (16.3)% Ongoing Total Revenue $2,199.3 $2,532.1 (13.1)% (13.0)% Supplemental Brand Information Merrell $675.8 $764.2 (11.6)% (11.3)% Saucony $495.8 $505.3 (1.9)% (1.2)% Wolverine $201.2 $247.5 (18.7)% (18.7)% Sweaty Betty $203.8 $211.5 (3.6)% (4.5)% Reported: Gross Margin 38.9% 39.9% (100) bps Operating Margin (3.0)% (7.8)% 480 bps Diluted Earnings Per Share $(0.51) $(2.37) 78.5% Non-GAAP: Adjusted Gross Margin 39.3% 40.7% (140) bps Adjusted Operating Margin 3.1% 6.8% (370) bps Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.05 $1.37 (96.4)% Constant Currency Earnings Per Share $0.15 $1.37 (89.1)% Revenue of $2,242.9 million represents a decline of 16.5% versus the prior year and a decline of 16.3% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 38.9% versus 39.9% in the prior year and reflects sales of higher-cost inventory due to transitory costs from 2022 and acceleration of end-of-life inventory liquidations. Selling, General & Administrative expenses were $940.7 million, or 41.9% of revenue. Adjusted SG&A expenses of $797.7 million or 36.3% of adjusted revenue, were 250 basis points higher than the prior year. FULL-YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK The outlook for 2024, and comparable results from 2023, in each case, for our ongoing business now also exclude the impact of Sperry, which was sold in January 2024. “Our expectation of improved Fiscal 2024 profitability reflects the comprehensive stabilization work completed over the last six months,” said Mike Stornant, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We expect to deliver incremental cost benefits of $140 million from recent profit improvement initiatives, allowing reinvestment into demand creation, enhanced technology, among other new capabilities needed to drive sustained growth. Solid inventory reductions already executed will benefit gross margin and allow for an increased flow of new and innovative product offerings. Successful efforts to lower debt are expected to reduce interest expense by approximately $20 million. While we expect the macro environment to remain challenging, especially in the first half of the year, we believe firmly that the business is on much stronger footing and poised to drive improved profit, cash flow and growth into the future."" Full year 2024 outlook is as follows: Revenue from our ongoing business is expected to be approximately $1.70 billion to $1.75 billion, representing a decline compared to 2023 of approximately 14.7% to 12.2% and constant currency decline of approximately 14.3% and 11.8%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 44.5% up 460 basis points compared to 2023. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 5.7%, and adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 7.0%, up 310 basis points compared to 2023. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 18%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.43 and $0.63, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.65 and $0.85. These full-year EPS projections include an approximate $0.10 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Diluted weighted average shares are expected to be approximately 80 million. Inventory is expected to decline by at least $70 million by year-end. Net Debt at year-end is expected to be approximately $575 million. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Measures referred to in this release as “adjusted” financial results and the financial results of the ""ongoing business"" are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted financial results exclude environmental and other related costs net of recoveries, non-cash impairment of long-lived assets, reorganization costs, debt modification costs, gain on the sale of businesses, trademarks and long-lived assets, costs associated with divestitures, SERP curtailment gain, receivables securitization transaction costs, and costs associated with Sweaty Betty® integration. The financial results of the ongoing business exclude financial results from the Keds business, Wolverine Leathers business and reflect an adjustment for the transition of our Hush Puppies North America business to a licensing model in the second half of 2023. The outlook for 2024, and comparable results from 2023, in each case, for our ongoing business now also exclude the impact of Sperry, which was sold in January 2024. The Company also presents constant currency information, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company calculates constant currency basis by converting the current-period local currency financial results using the prior period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to the Company's current period reported results. The Company believes providing each of these non- GAAP measures provides valuable supplemental information regarding its results of operations, consistent with how the Company evaluates performance. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors because they increase the comparability of current period results to prior period results by adjusting for certain items that may not be indicative of core operating results and enable better identification of trends in our business. The adjusted financial results are used by management to, and allow investors to, evaluate the operating performance of the Company on a comparable basis. Management does not, nor should investors, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. EARNINGS CALL INFORMATION The Company will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. EST to discuss these results and current business trends. The conference call will be broadcast live and accessible under the “Investor Relations” tab at www.wolverineworldwide.com. A replay of the conference call will be available on the Company’s website for a period of approximately 30 days. ABOUT WOLVERINE WORLDWIDE Founded in 1883, Wolverine World Wide, Inc.

The financial results of the ongoing business exclude financial results from the Keds business, Wolverine Leathers business and reflect an adjustment for the transition of our Hush Puppies North America business to a licensing model in the second half of 2023. The outlook for 2024, and comparable results from 2023, in each case, for our ongoing business now also exclude the impact of Sperry, which was sold in January 2024. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by increasing comparability to the prior period by adjusting for certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core ongoing operating business results and to better identify trends in the Company's ongoing business. The adjusted financial results are used by management to, and allow investors to, evaluate the operating performance of the Company on a comparable basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding results of operations, consistent with how the Company evaluates performance. The Company calculates constant currency by converting the current-period local currency financial results using the prior period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to the Company's current period reported results. Management does not, nor should investors, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are found in the financial tables above.

Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM First two holes from K92’s maiden drill program at the Arakompa project (“Arakompa”), located ~4.5 km from the Kainantu process plant, recorded significant mineralization, with 4 high grade lodes intersected in hole KARDD0002 recording 7.20 m at 24.76 g/t AuEq, 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq, 5.30 m at 6.06 g/t AuEq and 3.60 m at 3.38 g/t AuEq (See Fig 1), and similar mineralization to the producing high grade Kora and Judd vein systems (See Fig 5-6). Significant chalcopyrite, and also bornite observed in the 5.7 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq intersection, with the copper component grading 1.71%.The target size of Arakompa is very large, with mineralization demonstrated from drill holes, rock samples and surface workings for at least 1.7 km of strike, hosted within an approximately 150-225 m wide mineralized intense phyllic altered package, and exhibits a vertical extent of +500 m (see Fig 2-3).Between the high grade lodes, the tonalite to dioritic host rock is overprinted with porphyry style mineralization increasing the potential for bulk mining. Hole KARDD0002 recorded a bulk intersection of 219.8 m at 1.59 g/t AuEq with a higher grade core of 149.4m at 2.12 g/t AuEq, starting at 5.2 m from surface (see Fig 1). Importantly, hole KARDD0002 drilled only approximately two-thirds of the width of the mineralized corridor, with the eastern one-third untested (see Fig 2-3).Arakompa is sparsely drilled, open along strike, at depth and along its width. K92’s maiden drill results represent the first drilling on the project completed in 32 years. A total of 18 holes were drilled historically, with the vast majority shallow, recording significant high grade, including 15 intersections above 5 g/t AuEq, 8 intersections above 10 g/t AuEq and 3 intersections above 20 g/t AuEq, with highlights including: 4.00 m at 32.03 g/t AuEq, 4.00 m at 20.21 g/t AuEq, 2.00 m at 32.01 g/t AuEq, 2.80 m at 16.18 g/t AuEq and 9.20 m at 10.67 g/t AuEq (see Table 2 for historic drill holes). K92’s hole KARDD0002 is the longest hole drilled to date at Arakompa and plans are already in place to expand exploration activities near-term. Notes: (1) Drill highlights presented above are core lengths (not true widths).(2) Gold equivalent (AuEq) exploration results are calculated using longer-term commodity prices with a copper price of US$4.00/lb, a silver price of US$22.50/oz and a gold price of US$1,750/oz. John Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, stated, “We are very excited to be announcing the first two drill hole results from Arakompa, demonstrating very high potential from both the multiple intersections and significant size potential from surface sampling, drill holes and local workings covering a strike of 1.7 km, a mineralized corridor of approximately 150 to 225 metres wide, and a demonstrated vertical extent of over 500 metres. Arakompa is also near infrastructure, located closer to the process plant than Kora and Judd, with relatively gradual terrain for road access up from the Markham Valley, and importantly, represents a highly prospective opportunity to potentially grow production at Kainantu beyond the Stage 4 Expansion (see Figure 4). Plans have already been actioned to expand the program at Arakompa in the near-term.” Chris Muller, K92 Executive Vice President Exploration, stated, “The Arakompa project represents another vein system analogous to the Kora-Judd consolidated corridor, with just as much potential. In addition to the high grade massive sulphide veins, the intervening gold mineralization at Arakompa is well developed and intimately associated with widespread phyllic alteration likely representing the upper expressions of a fertile porphyry at depth. Almost all of the 18 holes drilled by former operators, Renison Goldfields Consolidated Limited and Highlands Gold Limited, intersected excellent gold-rich intercepts, even with only 1,766 metres drilled historically. Though drill tested over a substantial strike length, drilling by these companies only tested the very shallow parts of the veins. Clear indications of the vein system at surface, around 1000m RL, are a testament to even greater strike potential to the north and exceptional depth extent as well. The proximity of the Arakompa mineralized corridor to the Kainantu Gold Mine infrastructure, even closer to the Lae-Madang Highway than Kora, is a significant attribute and will enable a major drilling campaign to be carried out cost effectively. We look forward to working with our stakeholders to delineate potentially the next major resource for Papua New Guinea.” VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- K92 Mining Inc. (“K92” or the “Company”) (TSX: KNT; OTCQX: KNTNF) is pleased to announce the results of the first two drill holes completed from its maiden drill program at Arakompa at the Kainantu Gold Mine in Papua New Guinea. Arakompa is near infrastructure, located approximately 4.5 km south-east of the Kainantu Gold Mine’s processing plant, and closer to the process plant than the producing Kora and Judd vein systems, located approximately 3 km south-west of Arakompa. K92’s recently completed hole KARDD0002 is the longest hole drilled in the history of the project, intersecting significant mineralization including 4 lodes recording 7.20 m at 24.76 g/t AuEq (3.46 m true thickness), 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq (2.74 m true thickness), 5.30 m at 6.06 g/t AuEq (2.92 m true thickness) and 3.60 m at 3.37 g/t AuEq (1.73 m true thickness). One of the lodes, intersecting 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq, recorded significant chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization, with the copper component grading 1.7%. High grade lode mineralization appears to have significant similarities to Kora and Judd (see Arakompa Vein System Background below). Additionally, results from hole KARDD0002 demonstrate potential for bulk mining at Arakompa. Between the lodes, the tonalite to dioritic host rock is mineralized, overprinted with porphyry style gold-copper mineralization. Hole KARDD0002 recorded a bulk intersection of 219.8 m at 1.59 g/t AuEq (112.1 m true thickness) with a higher grade core of 149.4m at 2.12 g/t AuEq (78.4 m true thickness), starting at 5.2 m from surface (see Figure 1). Importantly, hole KARDD0002 drilled approximately only two-thirds of the width of the mineralized corridor, with the eastern one-third untested and prospective as shown via rock samples, including 5.8 g/t Au and 11.6 g/t Au. The maiden drilling results are the first holes completed in 32 years, with limited and shallow drilling completed historically (18 holes, 1,766 m drilled). Of the 18 holes drilled historically, there were 15 intersections above 5 g/t AuEq, 8 intersections above 10 g/t AuEq and 3 intersections above 20 g/t AuEq, with highlights including: 004DA92 – 4.00 m at 32.03 g/t AuEq (3.32 m true thickness)013AD92 – 4.00 m at 20.21 g/t AuEq (3.40 m true thickness)001AD92 – 2.80 m at 16.18 g/t AuEq (2.41 m true thickness)005AD92 – 2.00 m at 32.01 g/t AuEq (1.26 m true thickness)016AD92 – 6.30 m at 14.96 g/t AuEq (2.39 m true thickness)010AD92 – 9.20 m at 10.67 g/t AuEq (4.32 m true thickness) Surface field work completed historically and by K92 has demonstrated that the target size of Arakompa is significant, with mineralization observed from drill holes, rock samples and surface workings for at least 1.7 km of strike, hosted within an approximately 150 to 225 m wide mineralized intense phyllic altered package, and a vertical extent of over 500 metres. Plans are already in place to expand exploration activities in the near term. Arakompa Vein System Background The Arakompa project is interpreted to be an intrusive related gold-copper-silver epithermal vein system with similarities to the producing Kora and Judd vein systems. A significant difference at Arakompa is that it is hosted in tonalite to dioritic rock, whereas Kora and Judd are hosted predominantly in metasediments (phyllite). Mineralization at Arakompa is in pronounced vein lodes but is also widespread across a very broad envelope, hosted in strongly altered tonalite and diorite. This has been interpreted to have resulted from collapsing argillic and advanced argillic alteration and the propylitic alteration of the basement tonalite are interpreted to originate from the intrusion of a large magmatic porphyry body. Phyllic alternation appears to be associated with gold mineralization, providing a large halo (at least 100 m wide) around the vein corridor. There has likely been an upwelling of phyllic alteration from the porphyry into the high grade veins. This has resulted in mineralization between the veins, providing the potential for bulk mining. Multi-stage mineralizing events with several phases of quartz-sulphide development is apparent within the veins themselves. The sequence of early quartz deposited from a mesothermal dilute fluid followed by pyrite-copper-gold ± Bi-Te-Pb-Zn-Sn mineralization at Arakompa has many similarities to the same events encountered at Kora and Judd. The main sulphides are pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite and bismuthinite. As at Kora, chalcopyrite forms late, overprinting early phases of pyrite. Gold is documented in petrological reports and shown in photomicrographs as occurring in quartz, or often as inclusions overgrown by chalcopyrite. Porphyry evidence is widespread at Arakompa. Localised, high level B veins (quartz with centreline pyrite) are present, typical of the upper parts of a porphyry system. Magnetite-epidote alteration represents classic prograde porphyry assemblages, indicative of the inner propylitic shell. Chalcocite is also locally present, suggesting an underlying copper-enriched body. Figures A cross section showing KARDD0002 at Arakompa is provided in Figure 1. A long section showing Arakompa drilling to date is provided in Figure 2. A plan map for Arakompa is provided in Figure 3. A location map is provided in Figure 4.

Drill Hole Sampling Methodology, QA/QC and Qualified Person The diamond drill hole is first logged to determine the sampling intervals, which range from a minimum of 0.1 metres to generally 1 metre. The drill core is sawn half core cut along a reference line, with the remainder of the core returned to the core tray. Core samples are then placed in numbered calico and plastic bags, with a numbered sample ticket for dispatch to the assay laboratory. Samples are separately assayed for gold, copper and silver. K92’s procedure includes the insertion standards, blanks and duplicates. Gold assays are by the fire assay method. Copper and silver assays are by three-acid-digestion method (nitric, perchloric & hydrochloric mix). K92 maintains an industry-standard analytical quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) and data verification program to monitor laboratory performance and ensure high quality assays. Results from this program confirm reliability of the assay results. All sampling and analytical work for the mine exploration program is performed by Intertek Testing Services (PNG) Ltd, an independent accredited laboratory that is located on site. External check assays for QA/QC purposes are performed at SGS Australia Pty Ltd in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. K92 Executive Vice President Exploration, Mr. Chris Muller, PGeo, and K92 Mine Geology Manager and Mine Exploration Manager, Andrew Kohler, MAIG, both Qualified Persons under the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101""), have reviewed and are responsible for the technical content of this news release. In addition to the analytical QA/QC program outlined above, data verification also includes significant time onsite reviewing drill core, soil and outcrop sampling, artisanal workings, as well as discussing work programs and results with geology personnel and external consultants.

Such factors include, without limitation, Public Health Crises, including the COVID-19 virus; changes in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals in the world markets; fluctuations in the price and availability of infrastructure and energy and other commodities; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; volatility in price of our common shares; inherent risks associated with the mining industry, including problems related to weather and climate in remote areas in which certain of the Company’s operations are located; failure to achieve production, cost and other estimates; risks and uncertainties associated with exploration and development of the Kora, Judd, Arakompa and other projects; uncertainties relating to estimates of mineral resources including uncertainty that mineral resources may never be converted into mineral reserves; the Company’s ability to carry on current and future operations, including development and exploration activities; the timing, extent, duration and economic viability of such operations, including any mineral resources or reserves identified thereby; the accuracy and reliability of estimates, projections, forecasts, studies and assessments; the Company’s ability to meet or achieve estimates, projections and forecasts; the availability and cost of inputs; the availability and costs of achieving the Stage 3 Expansion or the Stage 4 Expansion; the ability of the Company to achieve the inputs the price and market for outputs, including gold, silver and copper; failures of information systems or information security threats; political, economic and other risks associated with the Company’s foreign operations; geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Palestine; compliance with various laws and regulatory requirements to which the Company is subject to, including taxation; the ability to obtain timely financing on reasonable terms when required; the current and future social, economic and political conditions, including relationship with the communities in Papua New Guinea and other jurisdictions it operates; other assumptions and factors generally associated with the mining industry; and the risks, uncertainties and other factors referred to in the Company’s Annual Information Form under the heading “Risk Factors”. Estimates of mineral resources are also forward-looking statements because they constitute projections, based on certain estimates and assumptions, regarding the amount of minerals that may be encountered in the future and/or the anticipated economics of production. The estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The company's ability to maintain a closing bid price above $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days signals a potential reversal of the negative trend that had previously jeopardized its listing status. This development may influence investor perception, as it suggests a degree of market confidence in the company's value proposition and future prospects.From a financial analysis perspective, restoring compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) is crucial for preventing delisting, which could have led to reduced liquidity and limited access to capital markets. For current and potential investors, this news could be interpreted as a positive indicator of the company's market performance and could possibly avert the risk of stock depreciation associated with delisting concerns. It is also important to monitor the company's future stock performance to ensure that it sustains the required bid price level and to evaluate the underlying business fundamentals driving this recovery.

INTEGRA ANNOUNCES SALE OF 1.5% ROYALTY INTEREST IN DELAMAR PROJECT TO WHEATON PRECIOUS METALS FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF US$9.75 MILLION,2024-02-21T11:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Integra Resources Corp. announces a binding agreement with Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. for a 1.5% NSR on metal production from DeLamar and Florida Mountain Deposit, with a total cash purchase price of US$9.75 million.

The Transaction is set to be completed in two installments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of a 1.5% net smelter returns royalty by Wheaton Precious Metals from Integra Resources represents a strategic financial move for both companies. The upfront capital provided to Integra in exchange for a share of future production revenue ensures a non-dilutive financing option, which is beneficial for current shareholders. This influx of cash can be utilized for further development of the DeLamar Project, potentially accelerating the timeline to production and increasing the project's net present value.From Wheaton's perspective, the NSR provides a long-term income stream that is directly linked to the success of the DeLamar and Florida Mountain Deposit. The royalty structure allows Wheaton to benefit from any upside in metal prices or production expansions without additional capital outlay. This transaction could be indicative of Wheaton's confidence in the project's viability and the metal market's outlook. Mining Industry Analyst Net smelter returns royalties are a common tool in the mining industry, allowing the royalty holder to receive a percentage of the gross revenue from metal sales, less certain specified costs. The decision by Integra to sell a 1.5% NSR can be seen as a strategic alternative to traditional debt or equity financing, which could be more costly or dilutive to existing shareholders. For investors, the NSR sale provides a clear signal of Integra's commitment to advancing the DeLamar Project without overburdening the company with debt or additional equity issuances that could depress the stock price.The valuation of the royalty at US$9.75 million provides insight into the expected revenue generation capabilities of the DeLamar Project. Investors should consider this valuation in the context of current metal prices, estimated reserves and resources and the projected cost structure of the mine. The two-installment payment structure also reflects a risk-sharing approach between Integra and Wheaton, with the latter showing a vested interest in the project reaching production. Market Research Analyst The broader implications of this transaction for the mining sector and the stock market include the potential for similar deals to occur as companies look for innovative ways to finance their operations without heavily diluting shareholder value. The mining sector may see increased activity in royalty agreements as they provide a hedge against operational risks. Market participants should pay attention to these developments, as they can affect the valuation of mining companies and the attractiveness of their stocks to investors.Moreover, the deal's impact on Integra's stock will likely be influenced by the market's perception of the fair value of the NSR and the company's ability to deploy the received capital effectively. Positive progress on the DeLamar Project post-transaction could lead to a re-rating of Integra's shares, while any delays or operational issues might negate the expected benefits of this cash infusion. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM TSXV: ITR; NYSE American: ITRG www.integraresources.com VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Integra Resources Corp.

Lower interest rates are crucial for homebuyers, with each half percent drop saving $1,400 yearly. Millennials and Gen Z are more positive about buying a home compared to Gen X and Boomers. Positive 40% of potential homebuyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop below 6%. Each half percent drop in mortgage rates saves $1,400 annually. Millennials and Gen Z show more optimism towards buying a home compared to Gen X and Boomers. Negative None. Economist The survey data indicating that 40% of prospective homebuyers would consider purchasing if mortgage rates drop below 6% reflects a significant sensitivity to interest rates within the housing market. This is a crucial factor for economists to consider when analyzing consumer behavior and its potential impact on the housing industry and broader economy. The elasticity of demand shown here suggests that even marginal decreases in mortgage rates could lead to an increase in housing market activity, as evidenced by the reported uptick in listings and contract signings with the recent rate decline.Furthermore, the generational differences in attitudes towards homebuying, with Millennials and Gen Z displaying greater optimism, could signal a shift in market demographics. Economists must consider how these attitudes might translate into future demand, especially as these generations mature financially and potentially prioritize homeownership. The long-term implications include shifts in housing demand patterns, which could affect construction trends, urban planning and related sectors. Market Research Analyst The survey's findings highlight the importance of consumer sentiment and its influence on the housing market. A key takeaway is the psychological impact of interest rates on buyer intentions. The fact that a specific rate threshold, such as 6% or below, can sway the decisions of a sizable portion of the market underscores the need for real estate businesses and mortgage lenders to closely monitor and respond to interest rate trends. Additionally, the generational data provides valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies. Real estate agents and developers may want to tailor their offerings and communications to appeal to the more optimistic younger generations, who are more likely to enter the market despite higher rates.Understanding these nuances can help professionals in the housing industry align their sales tactics with the expectations and behaviors of different demographic groups, potentially leading to increased sales and market share. Financial Analyst The potential influence of mortgage rate fluctuations on homebuying decisions has direct implications for the financial services industry, especially lenders and mortgage-backed securities investors. The survey's indication that a reduction in rates could spur homebuying activity suggests that there could be an increase in demand for mortgage products and, consequently, an uptick in the origination of loans. This could have a positive effect on the revenue streams of financial institutions specializing in home financing.However, it's also important to consider the risk management perspective. If rates were to decrease and spur a sudden increase in homebuying, it could lead to a rapid rise in home prices if supply doesn't keep pace, potentially inflating a housing bubble. Financial analysts must weigh the benefits of increased lending activity against the risks of an overheated market, which could lead to increased defaults and financial instability if not managed properly. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM 40% of Hopeful Buyers Would Consider Buying if Rates Hit 6% or below and Millennials and Gen Z Are Even More Bullish SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite a challenging few years in the housing market, the American dream of owning a home is still alive. According to a recent Realtor.com® survey, a majority of Americans think the dream is still achievable, though for many prospective buyers, it hinges on an interest rate drop to less than 6%. Though the sentiment is generally shared across generations, for Millennials and Gen Z, there may be a little more flexibility, with nearly half (47%) of Millennials and 37% of Gen Z respondents stating they'd still buy a home if rates went above 8%. ""The current market is very different from where it was before the pandemic, but many Americans still have a positive outlook towards achieving the dream of buying a home,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. ""This optimistic lens may shape the way younger shoppers in particular view mortgage rates. Although mortgage rates are up from a year ago, they have declined more than a percentage point from their recent peak. While some home shoppers and sellers are likely holding out for even lower rates, the improvement in affordability as rates fall has already ushered in an uptick in listings and contract signings."" Lower Interest Rates Are the Key for Hopeful HomebuyersBuying a home is still desired and sought after, but many people are looking for mortgage rates to come down in order to achieve it. Four out of 10 Americans looking to buy a home in the next 12 months would consider it possible if rates drop below 6%. Specifically, 18% of hopeful homebuyers say buying is feasible if the mortgage rate drops below 7%--a threshold surpassed in late 2023; an additional 22% of shoppers say they can buy if the rate drops below 6%; 32%, would enter the market if rates drop below 5%; another 18% are looking for mortgage rates below 4% and the last 9% of survey respondents aren't sure what rate would make it possible for them. Although rates are not anticipated to go below 6.5% according to Realtor.com's 2024 Housing Forecast, research shows that every half percent drop in the mortgage rate reduces the monthly payment for the typical home for sale by $120, a savings of $1,400 per year and $43,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Millennials and Gen Z Remain PositiveAmongst the generations, it's clear that Millennials and Gen Z have a more positive outlook on buying a home in today's market than their predecessors. Over half of Millennials (55%) and 40% of their Gen Z counterparts feel now is a good time to buy. Whereas only 32% of Gen X and a mere 17% of Boomers feel the same. Similarly, Millennials are the most optimistic about being able to afford to buy a home in the very near term with 43% saying they expect to be able to do so within the next year, compared to roughly 20% of Gen Zers and Xers, respectively and just 13% of Boomers. While Gen Z may only make up 4% of all homebuyers, according to the National Association of Realtors, they are not only bullish now, but they are the most optimistic out of the generations for the somewhat distant future. Forty-five percent of surveyed Gen Zers think they will be able to afford a home in the next five years, compared to 32% of Millennials, 36% of Gen X and 26% of Boomers; pointing to a bright and optimistic future for the up-and-coming home owners. ""Over the last year the real estate market has made it feel less than possible for Americans to achieve the dream of owning a home,"" said Mickey Neuberger, CMO, Realtor.com®. ""Given the reality of our current environment we are seeing an inspiring level of optimism shine through, indicating that not only is the dream alive, it's something that the American people are still working towards, and believe they can achieve.""

The uranium spot price has doubled, reaching over US$100 per pound. Namibia is a key uranium producer, with Snow Lake aiming to establish an initial mineral resource estimate soon. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent acquisition of the Engo Valley Uranium Project by Snow Lake Resources Ltd. represents a strategic shift in the company's business model towards diversifying its clean energy portfolio. This move is particularly significant given the current global focus on clean energy sources and the role of uranium as a critical mineral in this transition. The uranium market has recently experienced a cyclical uptrend, with spot prices reaching their highest levels in over a decade. This could potentially lead to increased profitability for companies like Snow Lake that are invested in uranium exploration and production.Namibia's position as the world's third-largest uranium producer provides a favorable geopolitical context for Snow Lake's expansion. The country's established infrastructure and regulatory environment for uranium mining enhance the project's viability. The immediate commencement of a 1,000m drilling program aimed at establishing an initial mineral resource estimate compliant with S-K 1300 regulations is poised to create shareholder value by potentially increasing Snow Lake's resource base and contributing to the company's growth narrative in the stock market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition of a significant stake in a uranium project with historical exploration data suggests that Snow Lake is positioning itself to capitalize on the rising demand for uranium. The clean energy sector is attracting significant investor interest due to the global energy transition and uranium's role as a fuel for nuclear power plants makes it a key commodity. The company's transition from a lithium-focused entity to a broader clean energy company may diversify revenue streams and reduce risk exposure to any single commodity's price volatility.Investors may view the exploration targets positively, considering the historic resource and the prospective targets outlined. However, the financial impact will largely depend on the outcomes of the upcoming drilling program and the ability to convert exploration targets into compliant mineral resources. The market will be closely monitoring the exploration progress for indications of resource quality and quantity, which could influence Snow Lake's market capitalization and stock performance. Mining Industry Expert The Engo Valley Uranium Project's potential based on historical drilling results and the presence of two highly prospective exploration targets is notable for industry stakeholders. The project's location in Namibia, a country with a strong mining sector and a history of uranium production, provides a strategic advantage. The drilling program's aim to establish an initial mineral resource estimate in compliance with S-K 1300 is a critical step towards determining the economic viability of the project.It is important to acknowledge that uranium exploration and mining carry specific challenges, including environmental considerations and the need for specialized expertise. The mention of an environmental clearance certificate is a positive aspect, as it indicates regulatory compliance and attention to sustainable practices. The project's success will hinge on effective exploration strategies, accurate resource estimation and the ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape of nuclear fuel minerals. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM Highlights:Snow Lake begins transition to a diverse clean energy company with exclusive option to acquire 85% of the 68,283 hectares / 683 km2 Engo Valley Uranium Project, Namibia (Figures 1, 2 and 3)The uranium spot price has doubled over the last year, recently surpassing US$100 per pound, its highest level since 20075,784m of relatively shallow drilling was drilled by Gencor on a small part of the project during the 1970's resulting in a historic resource, non-compliant with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (""S-K 1300"")Two exploration targets, the main uranium occurrence (the ""MUO"") and the D1 Extension are highly prospective exploration targets, based on the prior exploration work conducted by Gencor, and cover over 700m and 500m of strike length, respectivelyRegional potential exists over the entire 19km strike length over the broader Engo Valley target, which attains a maximum width of 5 kmSupported by an in-country team, all permits are in place for an immediate 1,000m drilling program which will aim to establish an initial mineral resource estimate in compliance with S-K 1300Namibia is the world's third largest uranium producer, accounting for 11% of global uranium production, and also boasts the following development projects:Deep Yellow's (Market Cap $1.07B AUD) Tumas Uranium Project with 132.9 Mlbs of contained U3081;Bannerman Energy's (Market Cap $496M AUD) Etango Project with 207 Mlbs of contained U3082; andForsys Metal's (Market Cap $191.5M CAD) Norosa Uranium Project with 91 Mlbs of contained U3083.Winnipeg, Manitoba--(Newsfile Corp. - February 21, 2024) - Snow Lake Resources Ltd., d/b/a Snow Lake Energy (NASDAQ: LITM) (""Snow Lake"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has begun its transition into a diverse clean energy company with the acquisition of up to an 85% interest in the Engo Valley Uranium Project located in Namibia (the ""Engo Valley Uranium Project"").CEO Remarks""We believe the opportunity to acquire this interest in the Engo Valley Uranium Project fits well with our strategy of expanding our portfolio of clean energy and critical mineral projects, thereby transitioning our company into a diverse clean energy company"" commented Frank Wheatley, CEO of Snow Lake. He continued: ""With a global focus on clean energy, uranium being a critical mineral, Namibia being one of the best mining jurisdictions in Africa with a long history of uranium exploration, development and production, we feel that the Engo Valley Uranium Project compliments our current portfolio of lithium assets in Manitoba.""""With the uranium market being in a major cyclical uptrend, the acquisition of the Engo Valley Uranium Project provides our shareholders with tremendous upside, particularly with drilling on the project to commence imminently."" ""As part of our Company's transition, we are changing our business name from Snow Lake Lithium™ to Snow Lake Energy, to better reflect our focus on a diverse range of clean energy minerals and resources projects, that will play a key role in the 21st century's energy transition.""NamibiaNamibia is ranked as the 6th highest African mining jurisdiction for mining investment according to the Fraser Institute's 2022 annual survey, and was the world's third-largest producer of uranium, accounting for 11% of global production, in 20224. The Husab Uranium Mine and the Rossing Mine are currently the only operating uranium mines in Namibia, with 5 major uranium mines currently in development.Clean EnergyNuclear energy is considered to be ""clean energy"" by the United States and Canadian governments and a source of low-carbon electricity. Three reasons why nuclear is considered to be clean and sustainable include: 1) nuclear energy protects air quality since it is a zero-emission energy source; 2) nuclear energy's land footprint is small and produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source; and 3) nuclear fuel produces minimal waste as it is extremely dense5.Uranium and nuclear energy are critical to the clean energy transition and provide reliable, affordable electricity that will help countries achieve low carbon energy security.Engo Valley Uranium ProjectOverviewThe Engo Valley Uranium Project is located in the Skeleton Coast, in the Opuwo District of the Kunene Region, along the coast of northwest Namibia, approximately 600 kilometers north of Swakopmund, Namibia (see Figures 1 and 2). Uranium mineralization was discovered in 1973 and exploration was conducted intermittently by Gencor between 1974 and 1980. The Engo Valley Uranium Project is considered to be a top tier exploration project.The project is accessible from the south via 190km of desert track roads from Mowe Bay, via the Sarusas mine. To the east there are unconfirmed track roads that connect the project area to the settlement of Orupembe.

Current Uranium Operations in NamibiaNamibia hosts many proven uranium deposits, including 3 major deposits, 2 of which are currently in production:Rossing Mine: One of the largest open pit uranium mines in the world, operating since 1976, currently producing 3,711 tonnes of uranium oxide per annum; 8% of the global output. By the end of 2021, Rossing had supplied 142,908 tonnes of uranium oxide.Husab Mine: Swakop Uranium started development of the mine in 2013 and production started at the end of 2016. The main part of the Husab mine is the Rossing South orebody, about 5 kilometers south of the Rossing mine and 45 kilometers north east of Walvis Bay, producing about 5,500 tonnes of uranium oxide per annum.Langer-Heinrich Mine: One of the largest uranium reserves in Namibia having estimated reserves of 57,000 tonnes of ore grading 0.055% uranium, with the past producing mine currently in process of resuming operations.Geological Setting- Engo Valley Uranium ProjectIn the Engo Valley Uranium Project, uranium mineralization occurs in the sedimentary strata of the Karoo Sequence: as an unconformity-related in a fluvio-glacial alluvial fan type deposit in the of the Dwyka Formation and has potential for a roll-front type deposit in the Engo Formation. Uranium mineralization occurs as disseminated carnotite in the clastic sediments of the Dwyka Formation and as fine-grained uraninite in the black shale and the pink sandstone of the Engo Formation. The pink sandstone has not been adequately investigated.The Munutum and Natas Valley area east of the Engo Valley area also has not been adequately explored. Historical airborne radiometric data indicates the potential for a shallow calcrete-hosted uranium mineralization.Historical ExplorationGencor conducted an exploration / reconnaissance program intermittently between 1974 and 1980. The program was comprised of airborne radiometric survey, ground radiometric survey, geological mapping, diamond and percussion drilling, limited resistivity work and limited radon etch survey. A total of 5,784 meters of drilling were completed, including 1,061 meters of diamond drilling.The airborne radiometric survey was confined to the western side of the License along the Engo Valley paleochannel. The survey delineated four anomalies, named D1, D2, D3 and D4. D1 was further delineated into three anomalies named D1 Extension, Main Uranium Occurrence (MUO), and Louw's Valley.Most of the historical exploration was focused in D1 and most of the drilling was concentrated in the MUO. The drilling was widespread, non-systematic and non-grid pattern. An untested anomaly, named D5, has not been evaluated for uranium and covers an area of 14 square kilometers with a strike length of 7 kilometers.A historic, non-compliant S-K 1300 mineral resource estimate was completed by Gencor in the 1970's on the MUO and D1 Extension.Proposed Work ProgramThe proposed exploration work program on the Engo Valley Uranium Project will include a review of all historical exploration data, the historical resource estimate, and all previous drilling results, to be followed by fresh twin hole drilling of historical drilling, together with grid infill drilling in order to both test the validity of the MOU and D1 exploration targets and to produce an initial SK-1300 compliant mineral resource estimate. Figure 3 sets out a map of both the historical drill holes, and the currently proposed drill holes, on the Engo Valley Uranium Project.

Dario also prices a $22.4 million equity financing concurrently with the acquisition. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Twill by DarioHealth represents a significant strategic move, signaling a potential paradigm shift in the digital health market. From a financial perspective, the nearly doubling of Dario's pro forma revenues in 2023 indicates a substantial increase in the company's scale, which could lead to improved bargaining power with suppliers and customers and possibly better economies of scale. The projected gross margins of 80-85% by 2025 are notably high for the industry, suggesting a strong pricing power or cost management that may attract investor interest.However, the financial terms of the acquisition, including the use of pre-funded warrants and convertible preferred stock, introduce complexity to the company's capital structure. Investors must carefully examine the potential dilution effects of these instruments and the performance-based vesting conditions attached to the inducement grants. The 7.5% dividend for the first four quarters, escalating to 15% in the fifth quarter, is an aggressive incentive that could impact cash reserves if not managed properly. Market Research Analyst The digital health sector is rapidly evolving and the acquisition of Twill positions DarioHealth at the forefront of this transformation. With Twill's expertise in digital-led care for chronic conditions and Dario's existing portfolio, the combined entity could address the growing market demand for integrated health solutions. The mention of reducing 'point solution fatigue' aligns with current trends where healthcare providers and payers seek to streamline operations and improve patient engagement through comprehensive platforms.Furthermore, the cross-selling opportunities and nearly non-overlapping customer bases could lead to significant revenue growth. However, the success of this strategy hinges on seamless integration and the realization of the anticipated cost synergies. The market will closely monitor the execution of these synergies and the impact on the company's competitive position. Medical Research Analyst The clinical implications of the Dario-Twill merger are profound, particularly in the context of chronic disease management and mental health. The combined data from over 4 million users and enhanced AI capabilities could lead to predictive analytics and personalized care plans, potentially improving patient outcomes. This integration could set a new standard for evidence-based digital health solutions.It's also worth noting the potential for innovation through the Twill Care digital community, which could lead to increased patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the quality of care while scaling up operations. The healthcare community will be looking for clinical data that substantiates the efficacy of the combined platform's approach to patient care. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM Expecting nearly doubling Dario's pro forma revenues in 2023 Acquisition is immediately accretive to revenue and gross margins and expected to accelerate path to profitability Concurrent with the acquisition Dario prices $22.4 million equity financing Company to host conference call today at 8:30am ET. Dial-in and replay information below NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DarioHealth Corp. (Nasdaq: DRIO) (""Dario"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has acquired Twill, Inc. (""Twill""), a leader in digital-led care. The combination enables Dario to create one of the most comprehensive digital offerings in the market for chronic conditions, spanning a wide spectrum of health and well-being needs from emotional health to the costliest chronic conditions. The transaction creates immediate scale, with three of the top eight national health plans, multiple Fortune 100 employers and several major pharmaceutical companies as customers. The acquisition of Twill is expected to nearly double pro forma 2023 revenue, and gross margins are expected to reach approximately 80-85% by 2025. The acquisition is expected to accelerate market penetration and drive greater sales opportunities as a direct result of the breadth of combined solutions, with an opportunity to increase revenue per customer through cross-selling into both companies' existing customer bases, which has almost no overlap. Dario expects to be able to realize cost synergies immediately, and expects to reach nearly 30% in annualized cost synergies within two years following the close of the transaction. The combination of revenue scale, expected improved gross margins, and significant cost synergies are expected to accelerate the path to profitability within the second-year post acquisition. ""The Twill acquisition is an incredible opportunity to bring together our complementary solutions and create an unrivaled platform for the next generation of consumer-centric digital health. The addition of Twill instantly boosts revenue and margins, leveraging a robust SaaS-like model to fuel expected rapid growth and accelerating profitability. We are confident in our ability to integrate Twill and its employees and operations, as we have a track record of integrating previously acquired businesses,"" said Erez Raphael, CEO of Dario. ""It's rare to find not just alignment, but shared passion igniting a collaboration. That's exactly what we've discovered in Twill. Their dedication to consumer empowerment through technology mirrors our own, making this union not just a strategic move, but a powerful convergence of values and goals. This unwavering belief resonated with both companies' shareholders, leading to shareholders from both companies participating in the financing. It's an injection of not just capital, but confidence in the future we're building together. With this strengthened foundation, we're poised to aggressively pursue our growth plan, fueled by a shared vision and the passion of investors and executives alike,"" concluded Erez Raphael. Twill's deep consumer experience began with Happify Health, one of the original digital mental health solutions sold directly to consumers for more than ten years. During that time, Twill helped more than 4 million users improve their emotional health before expanding to deliver broader capabilities for commercial customers which today include some of the most marquee fortune 100 employers and top payors in the country. The launch of the Twill Care digital community further bolstered the company's strength in engagement by offering an innovative approach to engaging members wherever they are in their care journey. Leveraging Twill's innovation in well-being and navigation enhances Dario's end-to-end member journey for optimization across solutions. The combined solution will be unique in its ability to enroll and engage members across their care journeys, enabling Dario to deliver outcomes across broad populations. Improved navigation capabilities will help connect members with the right solutions at the right time and expand potential for additional solution integrations. ""The market is demanding more conditions from less vendors to reduce point solution fatigue and the high cost of managing multiple vendors. The combination of our solutions provides the single solution the market wants and expands Dario's artificial intelligence and solution navigation capabilities, including immediate enhancements to Dario's current GLP-1 solution,"" said Rick Anderson, President of Dario. ""It's not just a goal, it's a pathway,"" said Tomer Ben-Kiki, Twill's Co-Founder and CEO. ""This shared vision fuels our powerful union, transforming data into a vibrant tapestry of individual health stories. Imagine three million threads of the combined company's data, interwoven with rich insights and diverse perspectives, brought to life by our AI expertise. This tapestry reveals unprecedented depth, predicting needs and optimizing treatment for every person. The spark was undeniable from the start - Dario's warmth and collaborative spirit resonated with our own. Together, we're beyond excited to create something truly groundbreaking."" Tomer Ben-Kiki, will join Dario's leadership team as Chief Operating Officer and Twill co-founder Ofer Leidner, will join as an advisor to the commercial team to support company growth. The expected doubling of pro forma revenues in 2023 is based on extrapolated, pro forma revenues through the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of $30.5 million, comprised of $16.7 million in Dario revenues and $13.8 million in Twill revenues. Financial Terms Under the terms of the Twill acquisition, Dario paid $10 million of cash and agreed to issue approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the form of pre-funded warrants for the benefit of Twill's debt holders and equity holders the warrants will vest in four equal amounts at 270 days, 360 days, 540 days and 720 days, post deal closing. Private Placement Concurrent with the acquisition, Dario priced a $22.4 million private placement of convertible preferred stock, priced at the market under Nasdaq rules, with participation from investors from both companies. Pursuant to the terms of private placement, Dario agreed to issue shares of newly designated convertible preferred stock (the ""Preferred Stock""). Each share of Preferred Stock will be sold at $1,000 per share, with conversion prices of $2.02 and $2.14, raising gross proceeds of $22.4 million. The Preferred Stock provides for holders of Preferred Stock, upon conversion, to receive a 7.5% dividend payable in common stock each quarter for the first four quarters, followed by a 15% stock dividend in the fifth quarter, for an aggregate stock dividend of up to 45%. Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into shares of the Company's common stock at the applicable Conversion Price upon the 15-month anniversary of the final closing of the offering.

("" Faraday "" or the "" Company "") (TSX:FDY)(OTCQX:CPPKF) is pleased to announce the results from four drill holes of its Phase III program at the Copper Creek Project, located in Arizona, U.S. (""Copper Creek""). Two of the holes targeted the American Eagle underground zone, one hole tested near-surface mineralization potential at the Bald area and one hole was drilled between the Copper Prince - Copper Giant breccia complex and Mammoth.Paul Harbidge, President and CEO commented, ""The drill results of two holes into the American Eagle area confirm the existence of zones in the underground domain with higher grades than predicted from the resource model, supporting the Company's thesis that the high-grade zones of American Eagle are open for expansion. Together with our district-scale exploration activities, these results confirm the significant exploration upside associated with the project.""HighlightsIntersected 380.60 metres (""m"") at 0.62% copper and 1.02 g/t silver from 721.04 m, including 163.11 m at 0.85% copper and 1.13 g/t silver from 841.33 m in drill hole FCD-23-039 at American Eagle.50 m of this 380.60 m intercept is located below and outside the underground shape used to constrain the Mineral Resource Estimate (""MRE"").Intersected 424.71 m at 0.40% copper and 0.81 g/t silver from 659.12 m, including 36.30 m at 0.83% copper and 1.69 g/t silver from 944.89 m in drill hole FCD-23-040 at American Eagle.The high-grade portion is thought to represent the root zone of the American Eagle breccia complex, suggesting potential grade continuity from surface to approximately 800 m depth. This vertical extension remains a high priority target.These drill holes are angled and drilled towards the north-northwest into an area historically drilled by widely spaced vertical drill holes. The intercepts confirm grade continuity at depth.(For true width information see Table 1.)Drill hole FCD-23-039 was collared in the Bald area and drilled towards the north-northwest (Figures 1 and 2). The copper mineralization occurs as chalcopyrite in early halo veins and as disseminations. Bornite increases with depth most notably below approximately 840 m downhole. The higher grades below 840 m are hosted in porphyry intruding granodiorite. Molybdenite veins are observed below 980 m downhole. Mineralization is interpreted to have been emplaced near the core of a porphyry mineralized centre. This drill hole also intercepted approximately 20 m of breccia-hosted mineralization from 55.07 m, which was above the mineral resource cut-off grade (reported in the Technical Report, as defined herein), highlighting the potential to identify additional near-surface mineralization in the Bald area (Figure 2).Drill hole FCD-23-040 was collared approximately 135 m to the west from drill hole FCD-23-039 and was drilled to the west-northwest (Figures 1 and 3). The mineralization is similar to hole FCD-23-039 but includes 36.30 m of chalcopyrite-rich mineralization with local presence of anhydrite in breccia and veins crosscutting potassic altered granodiorite. This zone also contains molybdenite and is interpreted to correspond to a magmatic cupola zone at the root of the American Eagle breccia. This breccia is exposed at surface and, together with this drill hole intercept, demonstrates potential vertical continuity of mineralization over approximately 800 m.Drill hole FCD-23-038 was collared at the same location as FCD-23-039 but drilled at a shallower angle (Figures 1 and 2). It targeted potential near-surface breccia-hosted mineralization. The hole intercepted breccia with pyrite and minor chalcopyrite within the first 55 m from surface, returning copper values below cut-off grade. Vein and localized breccia hosted pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization was intercepted near the end of the hole. Follow-up exploration is planned to target higher grades near surface.Drill hole FCD-23-044 was collared between the Copper Prince and Mammoth open pit resource domains in an area without historical drilling (Figure 1). The entire hole is in granodiorite with short igneous cemented breccia intervals. It intersected a zone of densely spaced pyrite-dominant veins from approximately 85 m to 102 m, which did not include significant copper intercepts. The hole was planned to also provide geotechnical information, which will be considered in future studies.Figure 1: Plan View Showing Drill Hole Locations Note: The the underground shapes are based on constraints used in the MRE as presented in the report titled ""Copper Creek Project NI 43-101 Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment"" with an effective date of May 3, 2023 (the "" Technical Report"") available on the Company's website at www.faradaycopper.com and on the Company's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca .Figure 2: Cross Section Showing Drill Holes FCD-23-038 and FCD-23-039 Note: The underground footprint is based on constraints used in the MRE as reported in the Technical Report.Figure 3: Cross Section Showing Drill Hole FCD-23-040 Note: The underground footprint is based on constraints used in the MRE as reported in the Technical Report.Table 1: Selected Drill Results from Copper CreekDrill Hole IDFromToLengthTrue WidthCuAuAgMo (m)(m)(m)(m)(%)(g/t)(g/t)(%)FCD-23-03955.0774.3919.32100.18N/A0.420.0018and407.95506.5098.55980.17N/A0.710.0003and524.00531.307.2070.67N/A1.910.0043and721.041101.64380.603800.62N/A1.020.0026Including841.331004.44163.111630.85N/A1.130.0029FCD-23-040659.121083.83424.714240.400.020.810.0054including944.891079.89135.001350.560.021.130.0092and including944.89981.1936.30360.830.031.690.0128FCD-23-038316.63328.5811.95110.20N/A0.470.0006FCD-23-044No significant interceptsNotes: All intercepts are reported as downhole drill widths.

Samples were crushed, pulverized and sample pulps were analyzed using industry standard analytical methods including a 4-Acid ICP-MS multielement package and an ICP-AES method for high-grade copper samples. Gold was analyzed on a 30 g aliquot by fire assay with an ICP-AES finish. A certified reference sample was inserted every 20 th sample. Coarse blanks were inserted every 20 th sample. Approximately 5% of the core samples were cut into ¼ core and submitted as field duplicates. On top of internal QA-QC protocol, additional blanks, reference materials and duplicates were inserted by the analytical laboratory according to their procedure. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results.Qualified PersonThe scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Faraday's VP Exploration, Dr. Thomas Bissig, P.

The company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 show significant growth in product revenues, automotive revenues, and earnings per share. Gentherm's strategic initiatives, acquisitions, and innovative technologies position it as a global leader in thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Positive Record annual revenue of $1.5 billion for Gentherm in 2023 Secured automotive business awards totaling $2.6 billion Gentherm's adjusted diluted earnings per share increased from $0.47 to $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2023 Strong growth in product revenues and automotive revenues year over year Introduction of proprietary technologies like ClimateSense® and WellSense™ Margin expansion and disciplined management of operating expenses Guidance for full year 2024 with product revenues between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion Updates to 2026 outlook with product revenues between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported annual revenue of $1.5 billion and the substantial increase in product revenues by 21.9% from the previous year indicate a robust growth trajectory for Gentherm. The company's ability to secure $2.6 billion in new automotive business awards is a testament to its competitive positioning within the thermal management and pneumatic comfort technology sectors. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the increase in light vehicle production in key markets, which aligns with the company's growth.The strategic acquisition of Alfmeier has evidently contributed positively to the company's revenue streams, a move that appears to have expanded Gentherm's product offerings and market reach. The adjusted EBITDA increase of 31.6% year over year is a strong indicator of operational efficiency and profitability, which could be appealing to investors seeking companies with improving margins.However, it's important to note the reported goodwill impairment charges, which suggest a need for vigilant monitoring of the company's acquisition-related assets and their performance. The guidance for 2024, with product revenues expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of approximately 12.5% to 13.5%, provides a clear outlook for stakeholders and suggests confidence in continued growth despite anticipated declines in light vehicle production. Market Research Analyst The automotive industry is shifting towards software-defined vehicles and Gentherm's focus on proprietary technologies like ClimateSense® and WellSense™ positions the company at the forefront of this trend. The mention of a breakthrough award for nearly all future General Motors ICE and electric vehicles indicates a strategic partnership that could have significant long-term implications for market share and revenue.Additionally, the unveiling of WellSense™ at the Consumer Electronics Show highlights Gentherm's commitment to innovation and could potentially open up new market opportunities in consumer wellness and comfort within the automotive sector. The company's international expansion efforts, particularly in Tangier, Morocco and Monterrey, Mexico, reflect a strategic move to capitalize on global growth opportunities and could lead to cost efficiencies and a stronger global footprint. Economist The overall economic context in which Gentherm operates is crucial to understanding its financial results. The increase in light vehicle production in key markets is a positive economic indicator for the automotive industry, which bodes well for Gentherm's core business. However, the company's effective tax rate of 26.6%, which is higher than the Federal statutory rate, indicates a less favorable geographic mix of earnings and the impact of non-deductible expenses such as goodwill impairment.It's also important to consider the broader macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and wage inflation, which have affected Gentherm's financials. The company's ability to manage these external pressures while still delivering increased revenue and profitability is indicative of strong management and strategic planning.The guidance provided for 2024, despite the anticipated low single-digit decline in light vehicle production, suggests that Gentherm has a resilient business model that can withstand industry cyclicality. This resilience is crucial for long-term investor confidence, especially in a sector that is sensitive to economic downturns. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM Achieves Record Annual Revenue of $1.5 BillionSecures Unprecedented Annual Automotive Business Awards of $2.6 BillionEstablishes 2024 Guidance and Updates 2026 Outlook NORTHVILLE, Mich., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gentherm (NASDAQ:THRM), the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry and a leader in medical patient temperature management systems, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, product revenues increased 5.2% year over year. Automotive revenue increased 6.6% year over year with revenue increases in all product categories except Electronics and Other Automotive. Adjusting for foreign currency translation, Automotive revenue increased 4.9% year over year. Excluding the impact from the UAW strike, phasing out the non-automotive electronics business as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both periods, Automotive revenue increased 10.1% year over year. According to S&P Global’s mid-February 2024 report, actual light vehicle production in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 12.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Gentherm Medical revenue increased 15.2% year over year, or 13.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, primarily as a result of higher Blanketrol® sales. See the “Revenues by Product Category” table included below for additional detail. Gross margin rate was 26.2% in the current year period versus 20.3% in the prior year period, primarily as a result of lower freight costs, fixed cost leverage from higher unit volume, increased productivity at the manufacturing facilities and supplier cost reductions, as well as the impairment charge related to the exit of the non-automotive electronics business in the prior year period. These were partially offset by wage inflation and lower price recoveries. Net research and development expenses of $21.4 million in the 2023 fourth quarter decreased $1.9 million, or 8.3% over the prior year period, primarily as a result of higher reimbursement for design and development costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $41.9 million in the 2023 fourth quarter increased $5.3 million, or 14.5%, versus the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. Acquisition and integration expenses of $0.6 million in the current year period were $3.7 million lower than the prior year period as a result of fewer expenses associated with the Alfmeier and Dacheng acquisitions. Restructuring expenses were $1.3 million in the current year period. As described more fully in the “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” table included below, the Company recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $49.0 million in the 2023 fourth quarter compared with $40.9 million in the prior year period, an increase of $8.1 million or 19.7%. Income tax benefit in the 2023 fourth quarter was $0.9 million, as compared with $0.06 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.56 compared with a loss of $(0.13) for the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding unrealized currency loss, non-cash purchasing accounting impact, restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration expenses, and other impacts (see table herein), was $0.90. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year period was $0.47. 2023 Full Year Financial Review For full year 2023, the Company reported product revenues of $1,469.1 million, a 21.9% increase over the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions, product revenues increased 10.0% year over year. In the Automotive segment, 2023 full-year revenue was $1,423.0 million, a 22.5% increase compared to the prior year. Revenue increased in all product categories except Electronics and Other Automotive. Adjusting for foreign currency translation and the impact of the Alfmeier acquisition, organic Automotive revenue increased 10.4% year over year. Excluding the impact from the UAW strike, phasing out the non-automotive electronics business as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both years, organic Automotive revenue increased 13.4% year over year. According to IHS Markit's mid-February 2024 report for full-year 2023, actual light vehicle production increased 11.4% compared to full year 2022 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. The Medical segment revenue was $46.1 million for full year 2023, a 7.2% increase compared to the prior year. Adjusting for foreign currency translation, Medical revenues increased 6.9%, primarily as a result of increased revenues from its Dacheng air warming blankets. Gross margin rate was 23.9% in 2023, a 120 basis point increase from 2022, primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage from higher unit volume, lower freight costs, increased productivity at the manufacturing facilities, as well as the impairment charge related to the exit of the non-automotive electronics business in the prior year period. These were partially offset by wage inflation. Net research and development expenses of $94.4 million in 2023 increased 10.1% primarily as a result of the additional expenses from the Alfmeier business as well as increased investments to support new automotive business awards. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $155.6 million in 2023 increased $22.9 million, or 17.2%, versus the prior year period. The year over year increase was primarily driven by additional expenses from acquired businesses and higher compensation expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition expenses. Acquisition and integration expenses of $5.3 million in 2023 were $17.3 million lower than the prior year as a result of expenses associated with the Alfmeier and Dacheng acquisitions and realized foreign currency loss in the prior year. The Company incurred $4.7 million restructuring expenses in 2023, compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period. The Company recorded impairment of goodwill charges of $19.5 million for the year. As described more fully in the “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” table included below, the Company recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $180.6 million in 2023 compared with $137.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $43.4 million or 31.6%.

This rate differed from the Federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings as well as the impact of the goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for full year 2023 was $1.22, as compared with $0.73 for the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding impairment of goodwill, unrealized currency loss, non-cash purchasing accounting impact, non-automotive electronics inventory charge and other impacts (see table herein), was $2.59. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year were $1.82.

Note that in recent prior periods, the Company did not exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expenses in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Forward-looking references to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin herein exclude the impact of stock-based compensation as newly defined. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by product revenues. The Company defines Adjusted EPS as earnings adjusted by gains and losses not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations and related tax effects including transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill, gain or loss on sale of business, restructuring expense, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives.

The Company defines Net Debt as the principal amount of all Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) less cash and cash equivalents. The Company defines organic revenue as revenue, excluding revenue from acquired businesses. Note that in recent prior periods, the Company used organic revenue instead to be revenue excluding foreign currency translation (see below). The Company defines revenue excluding acquired businesses and foreign currency translation as revenue, excluding the revenue from acquired businesses and the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. The Company defines revenue excluding foreign currency translation as revenue, excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company’s reconciliations are included in this release or can be found in the supplemental materials furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Form 8-K dated February 21, 2024. In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses Free Cash Flow and Net Debt as supplemental measures of its liquidity and the other non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its operating performance. Management provides such non-GAAP financial measures so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors in properly assessing the Company's performance on a period-over-period basis by excluding matters not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operating or liquidity results and therefore enhance the comparability of the Company's results and provide additional information for analyzing trends in the business. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur revenues, expenses, and cash and non-cash obligations that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There also can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. Other companies in our industry may define and calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do and those calculations may not be comparable to our metrics. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance or liquidity, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, revenue or other consolidated income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures referenced in this release and other public communications may include estimates of future Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EPS. The Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP forward-looking guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to taxes and non-recurring items, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Financial Analyst The reported revenue and earnings growth for LivaNova PLC indicate a robust financial performance in the medical technology sector. The double-digit revenue growth across all regions, particularly in the Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation segments, suggests a strong market demand for the company's products. Notably, the EssenzTM Perfusion System has been a significant contributor to this growth, reflecting successful product adoption and possibly an increase in market share.From a financial perspective, the improvement in adjusted operating margin and a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share are key indicators of operational efficiency and profitability. Investors may view these results positively, as they suggest that the company's strategic initiatives are translating into financial gains. The wind down of the Advanced Circulatory Support segment is a strategic decision that could streamline operations and potentially improve financial outcomes further, as indicated by the expected positive contribution to adjusted operating income in 2024.The appointment of a new CEO with experience from a leading global medical technology company could bring fresh perspectives and drive further growth. However, it is essential to monitor the transition for stability and continuity in leadership. Market Research Analyst The medical technology industry is highly competitive and LivaNova's significant revenue growth in its core segments indicates that the company is effectively leveraging industry trends, such as the rising demand for advanced medical devices and therapies. The focus on the Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation segments aligns with broader industry shifts towards specialized and targeted medical solutions. The decision to wind down the Advanced Circulatory Support segment suggests a refined focus on areas with higher growth potential or better strategic fit.Looking ahead, the projected revenue growth for 2024, excluding the impact of the ACS segment wind down, signals confidence in the company's core business. The forecasted increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow for 2024 also provides a positive outlook for the company's financial health and its ability to invest in future growth opportunities or return value to shareholders. Medical Device Industry Expert LivaNova's performance in the Cardiopulmonary segment, particularly with the EssenzTM Perfusion System, highlights the company's innovation and the market's receptivity to new technologies in critical care. In the Neuromodulation segment, growth across all regions suggests effective market penetration and the potential for expansion in treatments for neurological disorders. These segments are at the forefront of medical technology, where innovation can lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.The company's strategic decision to wind down the Advanced Circulatory Support segment may reflect a realignment with market demands and core competencies. Such moves are common in the industry to optimize the product portfolio and resources. The anticipated positive financial impact of this decision will need to be evaluated against the potential loss of market presence in the ACS space. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LivaNova PLC (Nasdaq: LIVN), a market-leading medical technology company, today reported results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and issued guidance for 2024.

For an explanation of these and other non-GAAP measures used in this news release, see the section entitled ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" For reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures, see the tables that accompany this news release. 2Constant-currency percent change excludes the impact from fluctuations in the various currencies in which the Company operates as compared to reported percent change. Constant-currency percent change is a non-GAAP metric. For an explanation of this and other non-GAAP metrics used in this news release, see the section entitled ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""

For more information, please visit www.livanova.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this news release, management has disclosed financial measurements that present financial information not in accordance with GAAP. Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter and year to year on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, operating performance measures as prescribed by GAAP. In this news release, the Company refers to comparable, constant-currency percent change in revenue. Management believes that referring to comparable, constant-currency percent change is the most useful way to evaluate the revenue performance of LivaNova and to compare the revenue performance of current periods to prior periods on a consistent basis. Constant-currency percent change, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in revenue between current and prior-year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period. LivaNova calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For example, forward-looking net revenue growth projections are estimated on a constant-currency basis and exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance exclude other items such as, but not limited to, changes in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration arrangements and asset impairment charges that would be included in comparable GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for constant-currency net revenue, non-GAAP adjusted tax rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share are net revenue, the effective tax rate and earnings per share, respectively. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment excluding the impact of 3T litigation settlement payments, CARES Act tax stimulus benefits and gains related to dividends received from investments and further adjusted as needed for other one-time, nonrecurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains, including associated expenses, that may not be indicative of the Company's core business. However, non-GAAP financial adjustments on a forward-looking basis are subject to uncertainty and variability as they are dependent on many factors, including but not limited to, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, gains or losses on the potential sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs, merger and integration activities, changes in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration arrangements, asset impairment charges and the tax impact of the aforementioned items, tax law changes or other tax matters. Accordingly, forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort. The Company also believes adjusted financial measures such as adjusted gross profit percentage, adjusted selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted other operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are measures by which LivaNova generally uses to facilitate management review of the operational performance of the company, to serve as a basis for strategic planning and to assist in the design of compensation incentive plans. Additionally, the Company also uses the non-GAAP liquidity measure adjusted free cash flow. Furthermore, adjusted financial measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s core performance for different periods on a more comparable and consistent basis, and with other entities in the medical technology industry by adjusting for items that are not related to the ongoing operations of the Company or incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Positive outlook for FY 2024 with expected Adjusted EBITDA of $910-$930 million. Acquisition of Accor Vacation Club enhancing the company's presence in Asia-Pacific. Negative None. Financial Analyst Travel + Leisure Co.'s financial results for Q4 and the full year of 2023 demonstrate robust performance, with a net income increase and strong adjusted EBITDA. The company's strategy to leverage the continued demand in leisure travel is reflected in the 5% revenue growth in their Vacation Ownership segment. This performance is particularly noteworthy considering the broader economic context where discretionary spending might be under pressure due to inflationary concerns. The repurchase of $307 million in common stock indicates confidence in the company's valuation and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. However, the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow year-over-year warrants attention, as it may suggest a tightening in working capital or increased capital expenditures. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Accor Vacation Club and the introduction of new brands like Sports Illustrated into Travel + Leisure Co.'s portfolio signal a strategic expansion and diversification within the leisure sector. This multi-brand strategy could potentially increase the company's market share and customer base in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Vacation Ownership segment's 11% decrease in VPG (Volume Per Guest) due to a higher mix of new owner tours may indicate a need to optimize sales efficiency and balance marketing expenses. The company's forward-looking guidance suggests a stable outlook, but it will be crucial to monitor how the projected EBITDA and VPG align with the actual performance in a post-pandemic travel market that may still be subject to volatility. Economist Travel + Leisure Co.'s leverage ratio of 3.4x and the amendment to its credit agreement are signs of proactive financial management. The refinancing of debt and the securitization of timeshare receivables at favorable rates indicate a solid credit standing and access to capital. However, the economic implications of increased marketing costs and the impact of the Sports Illustrated agreement on working capital efficiency are areas that need scrutiny. The travel industry is sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as consumer confidence and disposable income levels; thus, the company's performance is a barometer for the health of the broader leisure travel market. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Travel + Leisure Co.

Brown, President and CEO of Travel + Leisure Co. ""Our core vacation ownership business performed at or better than our expectations on every key measure, effectively leveraging continued leisure travel demand."" “Our multi-brand strategy is coming to fruition. We recently announced the acquisition of Accor Vacation Club, building upon our presence in Asia-Pacific. We start the year with a vacation ownership brand portfolio including Wyndham, Margaritaville, Sports Illustrated, which we added last September, and soon Accor. We have great momentum coming into 2024. We expect that momentum, combined with a strong leisure travel market, to drive earnings and adjusted free cash flow,” Brown concluded. (1) This press release includes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Adjusted free cash flow, Gross VOI sales and Adjusted net income, which are measures that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See ""Presentation of Financial Information"" and the tables for the definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation is available without unreasonable effort. Business Segment Results The results of operations during the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023 and 2022. Vacation Ownership $ in millions Q4 2023 Q4 2022 % change FY 2023 FY 2022 % change Revenue $776 $737 5% $3,041 $2,835 7% Adjusted EBITDA $208 $186 12% $729 $665 10% Vacation Ownership revenue increased 5% to $776 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net vacation ownership interest (VOI) sales were $410 million in the fourth quarter compared to $384 million in the prior year period, and Gross VOI sales were $540 million compared to $521 million in the prior year. Gross VOI sales were driven by 172,000 tours during the quarter compared to 147,000 in the same period last year, partially offset by an 11% decrease in VPG due to a higher mix of new owner tours. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $208 million compared to $186 million in the prior year period, with the revenue growth partially offset by an increase in marketing costs to support increased tour flow and new owner mix. Travel and Membership $ in millions Q4 2023 Q4 2022 % change FY 2023 FY 2022 % change Revenue $158 $163 (3)% $711 $735 (3)% Adjusted EBITDA $52 $57 (9)% $247 $268 (8)% Travel and Membership revenue decreased 3% to $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. This was driven by a 6% decrease in transactions offset by a 2% increase in revenue per transaction. The transaction decline was driven by lower exchange transaction propensity and a decrease in Travel Club transactions. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $52 million compared to $57 million in the prior year due to lower transaction revenue, partially offset by lower staff costs. Balance Sheet and Liquidity Net Debt — As of December 31, 2023, the Company's leverage ratio for covenant purposes was 3.4x. The Company had $3.6 billion of corporate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, which excluded $2.1 billion of non-recourse debt related to its securitized notes receivables portfolio. Additionally, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $282 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had $1.3 billion of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility availability. The Company amended the credit agreement governing its $1 billion revolving credit facility and term loan B facilities on December 20, 2023. This amendment refinanced $298 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan B and included an additional $300 million of borrowings. We expect to use net proceeds from the 2023 Incremental Term Loan B facility, together with available cash on hand and revolving credit facility borrowings to repay our outstanding $300 million 5.65% secured notes due April 2024 and pay related fees and expenses. Timeshare Receivables Financing — The Company closed on a $300 million term securitization on October 19, 2023 with a weighted average coupon of 6.78% and a 91.8% advance rate and an incremental $238 million term securitization on December 20, 2023 with a coupon of 6.51% and an 80.0% advance rate. Cash Flow — For the full-year 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $350 million compared to $442 million in the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow was $379 million in 2023 compared to $439 million in the prior year. These decreases in 2023 were primarily attributable to an increase in cash utilization for working capital, including impacts of the Sports Illustrated agreement and continued growth in our loan portfolio. Share Repurchases — During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $40 million at an average price of $35.67 per share. For the full-year 2023, the Company repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $307 million at an average price of $39.11 per share. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $170 million remaining in its share repurchase authorization. Dividend — The Company paid $32 million ($0.45 per share) in cash dividends on December 29, 2023 to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2023. For the full-year 2023, Travel + Leisure Co. paid an aggregate $136 million in dividends to shareholders. Management will recommend a first quarter dividend of $0.50 per share for approval by the Company's Board of Directors in March 2024. Other Items Taxes — During the quarter a valuation allowance associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards was partially reversed as the Company now expects that the benefit of the credits will be realized. This resulted in a diluted EPS benefit of $0.37 for the quarter and a diluted EPS benefit of $0.35 for the full year. Outlook The Company is providing guidance regarding expectations for the 2024 full year: Adjusted EBITDA to range from $910 million to $930 million. Gross VOI sales of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion VPG of $2,900 to $3,000 The Company is providing guidance regarding expectations for the first quarter 2024: Adjusted EBITDA to range from $185 million to $190 million Gross VOI sales of $460 million to $480 million VPG of $2,925 to $3,025 Travel and Membership Adjusted EBITDA of $75 million to $80 million Following are sensitivities to full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance. The impact of 100 bps change in our key Vacation Ownership drivers would be expected to be as follows: Tours: approximately $6 million change in Adjusted EBITDA VPG: approximately $11 million change in Adjusted EBITDA Sensitivities to Adjusted EBITDA are based on average system-wide trends. Operating circumstances, including but not limited to brand mix, geographical concentration or market segment variability, may cause the impact to differ materially. This guidance is presented only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable effort, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the occurrence or amount of these adjustments that may arise in the future.

Presentation of Financial Information Financial information discussed in this press release includes non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Adjusted free cash flow, gross VOI sales and Adjusted net income, which include or exclude certain items, as well as non-GAAP guidance. The Company utilizes non-GAAP measures, defined in Table 5, on a regular basis to assess performance of its reportable segments and allocate resources. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors when considered with GAAP measures as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company’s ongoing operating performance by adjusting for items which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. Management also internally uses these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. Exclusion of items in the Company’s non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Full reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the reported periods appear in the financial tables section of the press release.

The tables above reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures to their closest GAAP measure. The presentation of these adjustments is intended to permit the comparison of particular adjustments as they appear in the income statement in order to assist investors' understanding of the overall impact of such adjustments. In addition to GAAP financial measures, the Company provides Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted diluted EPS to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. We also internally use these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of adjusted measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. See ""Presentation of Financial Information"" and table 5 for the definitions of these non-GAAP measures. (a) Includes $2 million stock-based compensation expenses associated with the 2023 restructuring plans for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Includes $2 million and $3 million of stock-based compensation expenses associated with the 2023 and 2022 restructuring plans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. (b) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded from Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA. (c) Represents the tax effects on the adjustments. We determine the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments based on the nature of the underlying adjustment and the relevant tax jurisdictions. The tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based on an evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable statutory tax rate in the relevant jurisdictions. (d) All stock-based compensation is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. (e) Debt modifications are excluded from Adjusted net income, while included for Adjusted EBITDA. (f) Includes $1 million of inventory impairments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, included in Cost of vacation ownership interests on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(c) See table 3 for a reconciliation of Net income attributable to TNL shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA. (d) Represents Net cash provided by operating activities as a percentage of Net Income Table 5 Definitions Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share: A non-GAAP measure, defined by the Company as Adjusted net income divided by the diluted weighted average number of common shares. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods. Adjusted EBITDA: A non-GAAP measure, defined by the Company as net income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest), early extinguishment of debt, interest income (excluding consumer financing revenues) and income taxes, each of which is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation costs, separation and restructuring costs, legacy items, transaction costs for acquisitions and divestitures, asset impairments/recoveries, gains and losses on sale/disposition of business, and items that meet the conditions of unusual and/or infrequent. Legacy items include the resolution of and adjustments to certain contingent assets and liabilities related to acquisitions of continuing businesses and dispositions, including the separation of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and Cendant, and the sale of the vacation rentals businesses. We believe that when considered with GAAP measures, Adjusted EBITDA is useful to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods. We also internally use these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income/(loss) or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP and our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA Margin: A non-GAAP measure, represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is useful to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods. Adjusted Free Cash Flow: A non-GAAP measure, defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less property and equipment additions (capital expenditures) plus the sum of proceeds and principal payments of non-recourse vacation ownership debt, while also adding back cash paid for transaction costs for acquisitions and divestitures, separation adjustments associated with the spin-off of Wyndham Hotels, and certain adjustments related to COVID-19. TNL believes Adjusted FCF to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, its ability to grow its business through acquisitions and equity investments, as well as its ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using Adjusted free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating TNL is that Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion: A non-GAAP measure, represents Adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. We use this non-GAAP performance measure to assist in evaluating our operating performance and the quality of our earnings as represented by adjusted EBITDA, and to evaluate the performance of our current and prospective operating and strategic initiatives in generating cash flows from our earnings performance. This measure also assists investors in evaluating our operating performance, management of our assets, and ability to generate cash flows from our earnings, as well as facilitating period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted Net Income: A non-GAAP measure, defined by the Company as net income from continuing operations adjusted to exclude separation and restructuring costs, legacy items, transaction costs for acquisitions and divestitures, amortization of acquisition-related assets, debt modification costs, impairments, gains and losses on sale/disposition of business, and items that meet the conditions of unusual and/or infrequent and the tax effect of such adjustments. Legacy items include the resolution of and adjustments to certain contingent assets and liabilities related to acquisitions of continuing businesses and dispositions, including the separation of Wyndham Hotels and Cendant, and the sale of the vacation rentals businesses. Adjusted Net Income is useful to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods. Average Number of Exchange Members: Represents paid members in our vacation exchange programs who are considered to be in good standing. Free Cash Flow (FCF): A non-GAAP measure, defined by TNL as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less property and equipment additions (capital expenditures) plus the sum of proceeds and principal payments of non-recourse vacation ownership debt. TNL believes FCF to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, its ability to grow its business through acquisitions and equity investments, as well as its ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using FCF versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating TNL is that FCF does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Gross Vacation Ownership Interest Sales: A non-GAAP measure, represents sales of vacation ownership interests (VOIs), including sales under the fee-for-service program before the effect of loan loss provisions. We believe that Gross VOI sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of our vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period. Leverage Ratio: The Company calculates leverage ratio as net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. Net Debt: Net debt equals total debt outstanding, less non-recourse vacation ownership debt and cash and cash equivalents. Tours: Represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell VOIs. Travel and Membership Revenue per Transaction: Represents transaction revenue divided by transactions, provided in two categories; Exchange, which is primarily RCI, and Travel Club. Travel and Membership Transactions: Represents the number of exchanges and travel bookings recognized as revenue during the period, net of cancellations. This measure is provided in two categories; Exchange, which is primarily RCI, and Travel Club. Volume Per Guest (VPG): Represents Gross VOI sales (excluding telesales and virtual sales) divided by the number of tours. The Company has excluded non-tour sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour sales are generated by a different marketing channel. We believe that VPG provides an enhanced understanding of the performance of our Vacation Ownership business because it directly measures the efficiency of its tour selling efforts during a given reporting period.

Announces Additional Positive Results for Twelve Drill Holes from the Richmond Hill Gold Project, Including 0.050 oz/ton Gold over 140.5 ft (1.71 g/t over 42.8 m) in RH23C-070 Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Dakota Gold Corp. reports positive assay results from drill holes at the Richmond Hill Gold Project in South Dakota, expanding mineralization in previously unexplored areas. The drill holes show thick intervals, above-average grades, and potential for future resource expansion. The company aims to complete a maiden resource estimate in Q1 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Geologist The recent assay results from Dakota Gold Corp. at the Richmond Hill Gold Project indicate the expansion of mineralization into less explored areas. This could potentially lead to an increase in the estimated resources, which is a positive development for the company. The identification of a high-grade, near-surface structural zone is particularly noteworthy, as near-surface mineralization can often be extracted at lower costs compared to deeper deposits, potentially improving the project's economic viability.Furthermore, the extension of mineralization along strike and to depth, combined with the contiguous nature of the thick intervals and above-average grades, suggests the presence of a significant ore body. This could attract investor interest and impact the company's stock positively if the resource estimate and future exploration confirm the scale and grade of the deposit. Mining Analyst From a market perspective, the exploration update from Dakota Gold Corp. is a strong indicator of the company's potential for resource growth. The step-out drill holes north of the historical Richmond Hill Mine and the MW3 Zone show promising results that could lead to a substantial upward revision of resources. Investors will likely monitor the completion of the initial Richmond Hill maiden S-K 1300 resource estimate in Q1 2024, as it will provide a clearer picture of the project's value.The proximity of Richmond Hill to Coeur Mining, Inc.'s Wharf Mine, which produced 79,768 ounces of gold in 2022, suggests that the region is geologically fertile and underlines the strategic significance of Dakota Gold's ongoing exploration. If the project's economics are favorable, it could lead to partnerships, increase in stock value, or even become a takeover target. Financial Analyst Dakota Gold Corp.'s exploration results could have a material impact on its financial position. The company's discovery of new zones with higher-than-average gold grades could lead to increased reserves, which is a critical factor in the valuation of a mining company. The timing of these results, with the maiden resource estimate pending, could also have a strategic impact on the company's ability to attract investment or negotiate financing terms for further development.Investors should consider the risks associated with exploration, including the possibility that these findings may not convert into economically extractable reserves. However, given the positive preliminary results, there is potential for a re-rating of the company's shares if subsequent exploration confirms the scale of the discovery and if gold prices remain favorable. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM Lead, South Dakota--(Newsfile Corp. - February 21, 2024) - Dakota Gold Corp. (NYSE American: DC) (""Dakota Gold"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report assays from an additional 12 drill holes from the Richmond Hill Gold Project (""Richmond Hill"") in South Dakota. These drill holes are from two separate zones: north of the Richmond Hill Breccia Pipe and the MW3 Zone. The north Richmond Hill Breccia Pipe drilling expands mineralization into previously less explored areas adjacent to the historical Richmond Hill Mine. The drill holes in the MW3 Zone confirm and expand historical resources, extend mineralization along strike and to depth, and have identified a high-grade, near surface structural zone which feeds downward into the Precambrian basement rocks. These drill holes returned thick intervals, above average grades and are contiguous, defining a significant large block of mineralization not previously identified. Highlights (See Table 1):Richmond Hill Breccia Pipe Zone drill holes RH23C-060, RH23C-061 and RH23C-062 are step out drill holes north of RH23C-0591. RH23C-061 returned three significant intervals in the upper parts of the drill hole: 0.024 oz/ton Au over 57.5 feet (0.82 grams/tonne over 17.5 meters), 0.060 oz/ton Au over 12.9 feet (2.06 grams/tonne over 3.9 meters), and 0.115 oz/ton Au over 14.3 feet (3.94 grams/tonne over 4.4 meters). This zone appears to be an extension of the higher-grade interval identified in RH23C-059, located approximately 300 feet to the south and if verified, could potentially expand the area of new higher grade mineralization into previously untested terrane. MW3 Zone drill holes RH23C-063, RH23C-065, RH23C-068, RH23C-070, RH23C-071, RH23C-072 all contained thick intervals with higher-grades that surround and expand the mineral zone defined in RH23C-016 (average grade of 0.028 oz/ton Au (0.95 grams/tonne) over 1,007 feet (306.9 meters)). RH23C-063 intersected 0.058 oz/ton Au over 75.1 feet (1.99 grams/tonne over 22.9 meters) and RH23C-070 intersected 0.050 oz/ton Au over 140.5 feet (1.71 grams/tonne over 42.8 meters). Both areas have the potential to expand mineralization in future resource estimations as the assay results were returned after the cutoff date for the drilling data to be utilized in the Richmond Hill S-K 1300 compliant maiden resource, expected to be completed in Q1 2024. James Berry, Vice President Exploration of Dakota Gold, said, ""These exploration results are very positive. With each drill hole, the potential Richmond Hill resource continues to grow. The shallow mineralization is open and we are finding better grades in zones internal and external to the global resource area, which will improve the ultimate economics of the project. Once we finish the initial Richmond Hill maiden S-K 1300 resource estimate in Q1 2024, work will begin to expand it using the great results reported here today."" Exploration Update:RH23C-060, RH23C-061 and RH23C-062 were drilled from the same platform as previously reported RH23C-059 (0.249 oz/ton Au over 19.5 feet (8.55 grams/tonne over 5.9 meters)). They were all drilled north of the historical Richmond Hill Mine open pit and tested less explored areas. All of the drill holes returned narrow mineralized zones associated with altered greenstones, narrow breccia bodies or intrusive dikes. RH23C-061, the most northerly drill hole, crossed a near surface zone containing 0.115 oz/ton Au over 14.3 feet (3.94 grams/tonne over 4.4 meters) along with 0.024 oz/ton Au over 57.5 feet (0.82 grams/tonne over 17.5 meters), and 0.060 oz/ton Au over 12.9 feet (2.06 grams/tonne over 3.9 meters) and potentially correlates to the higher grade intervals found in RH23C-059 (0.249 oz/ton Au over 19.5 feet (8.55 grams/tonne over 5.9 meters)), possibly along a north-south structural zone. RH23C-063, RH23C-065, RH23C-067, RH23C-070, RH23C-071, RH23C-072 and RH23C-073 were drilled to surround the mineralization discovered in the vertical drill hole RH23C-016 (average grade of 0.028 oz/ton Au (0.95 grams/tonne) over the length of the 1,007 foot (306.9 meters) drill hole. The results confirm and expand the positive results found in RH23C-016 and many of the holes returned thicker intervals with higher-than-average grades over a contiguous area at least 750 feet long by 500 feet wide and 500 feet deep within a larger zone approximately 2,500 feet long by 1,000 feet wide by 1,000 feet deep. This zone of mineralization is interpreted to be a structural corridor within the Precambrian basement beneath a cap of Paleozoic Deadwood Formation. Replacement gold mineralization occurs in the Paleozoic sandstones and carbonates, controlled by bedding and the unconformity surface and along near vertical structures in the underlying Precambrian basement rocks, mostly hosted in the Flagrock Formation. Although historic drilling defined resources in the upper portion of this zone, Dakota Gold's drilling shows mineralization continues to depth and remains open in all directions. RH23C-068 and RH23C-069 were drilled as a step outs northwest of RH23C-016 along the presumed structural corridor as defined by model interpretation and geophysics. RH23C-068 was successful in crossing the structure and returned two significant intervals at depth (0.022 oz/ton Au over 80.5 feet (0.76 grams/tonne over 24.5 meters), and 0.025 oz/ton Au over 100.7 feet (0.87 grams/tonne over 30.7 meters)).Table 1.

The company achieved solid growth in its commercial business, particularly in the Tyvaso and Remodulin segments. Key financial highlights include a 25% increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The company's innovative pipeline and organ manufacturing programs show promising growth potential. Positive Record revenues of $2.33 billion for full year 2023, a 20% increase over 2022. Solid growth in Tyvaso and Remodulin segments, with record revenue for Tyvaso in the fourth quarter of 2023. Innovative pipeline and organ manufacturing programs driving growth potential. Successful commercial launches and increased patient utilization contributing to revenue growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of United Therapeutics Corporation for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, indicate a robust performance with a 20% growth in annual revenues, reaching $2.33 billion. This growth trajectory is particularly noteworthy given the competitive landscape of the biopharmaceutical sector and the presence of generic competition since 2019. The record revenue for the Tyvaso business and solid growth in the U.S. Remodulin business are significant contributors to this success, demonstrating effective market penetration and product lifecycle management.The company's strategic focus on innovative pipeline development and organ manufacturing programs is poised to potentially sustain long-term revenue growth. The FDA clearance for the first human clinical study of a bioengineered organ and the launch of a pathogen-free clinical supply facility are pivotal developments that could redefine treatment paradigms in organ transplantation and end-stage organ disease. These advancements may also create new revenue streams and diversify the company's portfolio.The net income increase to $984.8 million and the earnings per share growth reflect operational efficiency and a strong market position. Investors should consider the company's ability to maintain profit margins in the face of increasing R&D expenses, which have risen by 26% year-over-year, indicating substantial investment in future growth areas. The financial health of United Therapeutics appears solid, with potential for further growth driven by both existing products and innovative research endeavors. Medical Research Analyst The impressive growth in Tyvaso DPI® sales, with a 362% increase over the previous year, underscores the successful launch and adoption of the inhalation device. This growth is reflective of the demand for advanced treatment options in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), a condition with significant unmet medical needs. The shift from nebulized Tyvaso to Tyvaso DPI indicates a strategic move to enhance patient convenience and compliance, which is a critical factor in chronic disease management.Furthermore, the expansion of nebulized Tyvaso in Japan represents a strategic initiative to capture market share in international markets, diversifying the company's revenue sources. The decrease in Remodulin revenues, on the other hand, suggests potential challenges in international markets, which may require targeted strategies to bolster sales.Investments in R&D, including the acquisition of IVIVA Medical, Inc. and the progression of TETON clinical studies, demonstrate United Therapeutics' commitment to advancing their research portfolio. The potential benefits of these investments include not only the development of novel therapies but also a strengthened competitive edge in the biopharmaceutical industry. Stakeholders should monitor the outcomes of these R&D efforts as they will play a crucial role in the company's future growth and ability to meet emerging healthcare needs. Market Research Analyst The company's strategic initiatives, such as the commercial launch of Tyvaso DPI and the expansion into the Japanese market, indicate a keen understanding of market dynamics and patient preferences. The growth in Tyvaso sales, both DPI and nebulized, reflects a well-executed product differentiation strategy that caters to diverse patient needs and consumption patterns.The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and United Therapeutics' ability to grow despite generic competition highlights the strength of its brand and the efficacy of its products. The company's focus on rare diseases, such as PH-ILD, allows it to operate within a niche market, which can be advantageous in terms of pricing power and reduced competition.Looking at the broader market implications, United Therapeutics' performance can serve as a barometer for the sector's health, indicating a favorable environment for innovation and growth. The company's investment in organ manufacturing technology could disrupt the market and create new standards for treatment, potentially influencing the strategies of other players in the industry. Market stakeholders should closely observe how these advancements impact competitive dynamics and potentially drive regulatory changes. 02/21/2024 - 06:00 AM SILVER SPRING, Md. & RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Therapeutics Corporation (Nasdaq: UTHR), a public benefit corporation, today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Full year 2023 revenues rose to a record $2.33 billion, reflecting 20% growth over 2022. “Congratulations to the dedicated Unitherians who worked tirelessly to help us achieve our third straight quarter and second straight year of record revenue,” said Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D., Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of United Therapeutics. “This represents only the beginning of our growth, driven by a strong foundation in our current commercial business and upcoming enrollment milestones for our innovative pipeline. On top of this, we have continued momentum for our revolutionary organ manufacturing programs, with the first human clinical study of a bioengineered organ, the miroliverELAP, cleared by the FDA, and the recent opening of the world’s first designated pathogen-free clinical supply facility to support our upcoming xenotransplantation clinical program.” “Our commercial business remains a solid foundation supporting our innovative and revolutionary efforts to cure end stage organ disease,” said Michael Benkowitz, President and Chief Operating Officer of United Therapeutics. “To that end, in the fourth quarter we saw record revenue for our Tyvaso business, and we achieved solid growth in our U.S. Remodulin business, with strong revenue growth and a record number of patients on therapy despite the presence of generic competition since 2019.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Key financial highlights include (in millions, except per share data): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total revenues $ 614.7 $ 491.5 $ 2,327.5 $ 1,936.3 Net income $ 217.1 $ 132.1 $ 984.8 $ 727.3 Net income, per basic share $ 4.62 $ 2.88 $ 21.04 $ 15.98 Net income, per diluted share $ 4.36 $ 2.67 $ 19.81 $ 15.00 Revenues The table below presents the components of total revenues (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percentage Change 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net product sales: Tyvaso DPI®(1) $ 213.7 $ 92.2 $ 121.5 132% $ 731.1 $ 158.3 $ 572.8 362% Nebulized Tyvaso®(1) 136.9 150.1 (13.2) (9)% 502.6 714.7 (212.1) (30)% Total Tyvaso 350.6 242.3 108.3 45% 1,233.7 873.0 360.7 41% Remodulin®(2) 115.1 122.5 (7.4) (6)% 494.8 500.2 (5.4) (1)% Orenitram® 84.1 75.8 8.3 11% 359.4 325.1 34.3 11% Unituxin® 54.2 36.7 17.5 48% 198.9 182.9 16.0 9% Adcirca® 6.8 10.4 (3.6) (35)% 28.9 41.3 (12.4) (30)% Other 3.9 3.8 0.1 3% 11.8 13.8 (2.0) (14)% Total revenues $ 614.7 $ 491.5 $ 123.2 25% $ 2,327.5 $ 1,936.3 $ 391.2 20% (1) Net product sales include both the drug product and the respective inhalation device.

Total Tyvaso revenues grew by 45% to $350.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $242.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth was primarily due to an increase in quantities sold, driven by the commercial launch of Tyvaso DPI in June 2022 and continued growth in utilization by patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD). The growth in Tyvaso DPI revenues resulted primarily from an increase in quantities sold. The decrease in nebulized Tyvaso revenues was primarily due to a decrease in U.S. quantities sold following the commercial launch of Tyvaso DPI, partially offset by an increase in international nebulized Tyvaso revenues, primarily due to the commercial launch of nebulized Tyvaso in Japan in December 2022, as shown in the table below. The decrease in Remodulin revenues resulted from a decrease in international Remodulin revenues, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Remodulin revenues, as shown in the table below. The increase in Orenitram revenues resulted from a price increase and an increase in quantities sold. The increase in Unituxin revenues resulted from an increase in quantities sold and a price increase. Full Year 2023 Compared to Full Year 2022.

They returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders, increased quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, and focused on maximizing shareholder value. The company highlighted their commitment to executing corporate strategy and improving reliability across their portfolio. Positive None. Negative Refining segment reported a loss due to lower refinery gross margins and decreased EBITDA in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Renewables segment also reported a loss in Q4 2023 with decreased EBITDA compared to Q4 2022. Marketing segment income decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Lubricants & Specialties segment income decreased in Q4 2023 due to a FIFO charge from higher priced feedstock inventory consumption. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $861.0 million from September 30, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Consolidated debt was reported at $2,739.1 million in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The reported net loss of HF Sinclair for the fourth quarter, juxtaposed with the adjusted net income, presents a complex picture for stakeholders. While the net loss may initially seem alarming, the adjustments for non-cash inventory valuation suggest that underlying business operations remain profitable. The significant decrease in the reported EBITDA from the fourth quarter of the previous year indicates a challenging market environment, likely driven by compressed refining margins and operational challenges.The company's strategy to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases is noteworthy. This approach can be seen as an effort to maintain investor confidence and share value, even as operational profitability faces pressure. However, the reduction in cash and cash equivalents raises concerns about liquidity and the sustainability of shareholder returns if the company's operational headwinds persist.The increase in the regular quarterly dividend, despite the reported loss, could be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, reflecting management's confidence in the company's long-term financial health. However, it is imperative to monitor future cash flows and earnings to assess the prudence of this decision. Market Research Analyst The performance of HF Sinclair's refining segment is indicative of broader trends in the energy market. The reported 41% decrease in refinery gross margins reflects the volatility in the oil and gas sector, potentially influenced by fluctuating crude oil prices and demand dynamics. The reduction in crude oil charge compared to the previous year suggests a slight decrease in operational throughput, which may be attributed to market conditions or strategic operational adjustments.HF Sinclair's renewables segment also reported losses, which could be a result of the nascent state of this market and the costs associated with scaling up production. However, the increased sales volumes year-over-year imply growing demand for renewable fuels, which may bode well for future profitability as the segment matures and benefits from economies of scale and potentially favorable regulatory changes.The lubricants and specialties segment's performance, impacted by FIFO charges due to higher priced feedstock inventory, highlights the importance of inventory management in the face of volatile input costs. The midstream segment's improved performance, on the other hand, underscores the strategic value of diversification within the energy sector. Economist The financial results of HF Sinclair, especially the discrepancy between reported net loss and adjusted net income, can serve as an economic indicator for the energy sector. The adjustments made for inventory valuation are reflective of the accounting practices that can significantly affect reported earnings, particularly in industries like refining where inventory values are highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations.The company's decision to maintain and even increase shareholder payouts in the form of dividends, despite a challenging quarter, suggests an attempt to signal financial stability to the market. This could be a strategic move to maintain investor relations and stock price stability, but it also warrants a close examination of the company's long-term financial strategy and its alignment with market conditions and shareholder value creation.Furthermore, the decrease in cash reserves is a critical factor to consider. It raises questions about the company's future investment capacity and its ability to navigate potential market downturns. The energy sector is cyclical and capital-intensive, so maintaining a robust balance sheet is crucial for weathering periods of lower profitability. 02/21/2024 - 06:30 AM Fourth Quarter Reported net loss attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of $(62.2) million, or $(0.34) per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $164.6 million, or $0.87 per diluted share Reported EBITDA of $128.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $427.7 million Returned $247.5 million to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases Announced $0.05 increase in regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share Full Year 2023 Reported net income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of $1,589.7 million, or $8.29 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $1,822.9 million, or $9.51 per diluted share Reported EBITDA of $2,899.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3,207.1 million Returned $1,340.0 million to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HF Sinclair Corporation (NYSE:DINO) (“HF Sinclair” or the “Company”) today reported fourth quarter net loss attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of $(62.2) million, or $(0.34) per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders of $587.0 million, or $2.92 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Reconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA excluding special items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in financial statements. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, is calculated as net (loss) income attributable to HF Sinclair stockholders plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus (i) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, (ii) decommissioning costs, (iii) HF Sinclair's pro-rata share of Osage environmental remediation costs, net of insurance recoveries and (iv) acquisition integration and regulatory costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; however, the amounts included in these calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants. Set forth below is our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

Reconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements. Refinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis. Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold is total Refining segment revenues less total Refining segment cost of products sold, exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, divided by sales volumes of produced refined products sold. Net operating margin per barrel sold is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments or depreciation and amortization.

Exelon anticipates an operating EPS growth of 5-7% from 2023 to 2027. Positive Exelon's financial results for Q4 and full year 2023 were robust, with GAAP Net Income of $0.62 per share and Adjusted Operating Earnings of $0.60 per share for Q4. The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share for Q1 2024, representing a 5.6% increase over the previous quarter. Exelon plans to invest $35 billion in capital expenditures over the next four years to support customer needs, expecting a 7.5% rate base growth and an operating EPS compound annual growth of 5-7% from 2023 to 2027. The company anticipates Adjusted Operating Earnings of $2.40-$2.50 per share for 2024, driven by continued investments in energy transformations across its jurisdictions. Exelon's utilities, including ComEd and PHI, achieved best-on-record performances in outage frequency and duration, with gas utilities maintaining top decile performance in gas odor response for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company updated its financing plan to include $1.3 billion of additional equity to fund incremental capital expenditures, aligning with a balanced funding strategy. Negative None. Financial Analyst Exelon Corporation's reported increase in GAAP Net Income and Adjusted Operating Earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicates a robust financial performance. The company's ability to deliver earnings at the top end of the guidance range, despite challenges such as historically mild weather, demonstrates strong operational efficiency and effective financial management.The declared dividend growth of 5.6% reflects a positive signal to shareholders, reinforcing the company's commitment to returning value. Moreover, the substantial planned capital expenditures of $35 billion over the next four years, aimed at rate base growth and supporting energy transformation, suggest a strategic focus on long-term infrastructure investment and growth prospects. The anticipated compound annual growth rate of 5-7% in operating EPS through 2027 offers a clear earnings growth trajectory, which is crucial for investor confidence.However, investors should be mindful of the additional equity issuance of $1.3 billion to fund capital expenditures, as it could potentially dilute existing share value. The balance between equity and debt financing will be key to maintaining a healthy capital structure while pursuing growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The energy sector is increasingly influenced by regulatory outcomes, as evidenced by the rate case developments with ComEd, BGE and ACE. The approved rate increases and multi-year plans are likely to provide revenue predictability and stability, which are favorable for Exelon's business model. The approval of rate increases by regulatory bodies such as the ICC, MDPSC and NJBPU underscores the company's ability to effectively navigate the regulatory environment.From a market perspective, Exelon's operational milestones, including best-on-record performances in outage frequency and duration and sustained top decile performance in gas odor response, strengthen its market position and reliability as a utility provider. These operational efficiencies can enhance customer satisfaction and retention, contributing positively to the company's reputation and competitive edge. Energy Sector Analyst Exelon's commitment to investing in energy transformation aligns with broader industry trends towards sustainable and efficient energy solutions. The company's strategy to innovate and partner with regulators and stakeholders reflects an adaptive approach to the evolving energy landscape, which includes responding to climate change and shifting regulatory demands.The reference to the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act indicates Exelon's proactive stance in securing federal support for projects, which could enhance its financial position and enable it to undertake large-scale infrastructure improvements with external funding assistance. This strategic leveraging of federal programs can mitigate financial risks associated with capital-intensive projects.It is also important to note the implications of revenue decoupling for ComEd, BGE and PHI. This mechanism, which separates utility revenue from the volume of electricity or gas sold, provides a stable revenue stream and reduces the financial impact of fluctuating demand, contributing to the financial predictability of these utilities. 02/21/2024 - 06:50 AM Earnings Release Highlights GAAP Net Income of $0.62 per share and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $0.60 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 Introducing 2024 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings guidance range of $2.40-$2.50 per share Declaring quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share for the first quarter of 2024, representing 5.6% growth over 2023 fourth quarter dividend of $0.36 per share Projecting to invest $35 billion of capital expenditures over the next four years to meet customer needs, resulting in expected rate base growth of 7.5% and operating EPS compounded annual growth of 5-7% from 2023 to 2027 Updating 4-year financing plan to include $1.3 billion of additional equity to fund approximately 40% of $3.2 billion of incremental capital expenditures in line with a balanced funding strategy ComEd and PHI ended the year with best-on-record performances in both outage frequency and duration, and all gas utilities sustained top decile performance in gas odor response for the fourth straight quarter A settlement was approved in November by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) in Atlantic City Electric’s base rate case Orders in ComEd’s Multi-Year Rate Plan (“MRP”) and Multi-Year Grid Plan as well as BGE’s multi-year plan were received in December CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “Exelon had another strong year in 2023, both financially and operationally,” said President and CEO Calvin Butler. “We delivered in the top half of our guidance range, achieved best-on-record operational performance at multiple utilities, and advocated for a more affordable and equitable energy transformation for our customers. We successfully competed for nearly $200 million in project grants benefiting our customers, supported by the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act. In 2024, we will continue to innovate and partner with regulators and stakeholders across Exelon’s jurisdictions to support our shared energy and environmental goals, while demonstrating the power of impact for our customers and communities.” “We delivered strong financial results for the second year in a row, despite the historically mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions,” said Exelon Chief Financial Officer Jeanne Jones. “For the full year 2023, we earned $2.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our narrowed guidance range. Over the next four years, Exelon will invest $35 billion to serve our customers, resulting in 7.5% rate base growth and an expected annualized earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2027, off the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, with an expectation of being at midpoint or better in that range. We expect adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings for 2024 of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, driven by continued investment in our jurisdictions’ energy transformations and doing so as affordably and efficiently as possible.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $0.62 per share from $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $0.60 per share from $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 4. GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily reflect: Higher utility earnings primarily due to favorable impacts of the multi-year plans including the recognition of the reconciliation in 2023 at BGE. In addition, there were higher electric distribution earnings from higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates at ComEd and favorable impacts of rate increases at PECO and PHI. This was partially offset by higher contracting costs and interest expense at PHI. Higher costs at the Exelon holding company primarily due to higher interest expense and realized losses on hedging activity. Full Year 2023 Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for 2023 increased to $2.34 per share from $2.08 per share in 2022. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for 2023 increased to $2.38 per share from $2.27 per share in 2022. GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the full year 2023 primarily reflect: Higher utility earnings primarily due to higher electric distribution and transmission earnings from higher allowed ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base at ComEd and favorable impacts of rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI. In addition, at BGE, there were favorable impacts of the multi-year plans including the recognition of the reconciliation in 2023 and favorable carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit (CMC) regulatory asset at ComEd. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI, higher depreciation expense and interest expense at PECO, BGE and PHI, higher contracting costs at PHI, and higher storm costs at PECO and BGE. Higher costs at the Exelon holding company primarily due to higher interest expense and realized losses on hedging activity. This was partially offset by certain BSC costs that were historically allocated to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Generation) but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results in 2022 as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules. Operating Company Results1 ComEd ComEd's fourth quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $268 million from $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $269 million from $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates). Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. PECO PECO’s fourth quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $153 million from $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $154 million from $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to distribution rate increases and favorable impacts from lower storm costs. BGE BGE’s fourth quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $199 million from $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $199 million from $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable impacts of the multi-year plans including the recognition of the reconciliation in 2023. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. PHI PHI’s fourth quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $101 million from $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $102 million from $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases and timing of excess deferred tax amortization, partially offset by increases in contracting costs and interest expense. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. Initiates Annual Guidance for 2024 Exelon introduced a guidance range for 2024 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $2.40-$2.50 per share. There are no adjustments between 2024 projected GAAP Earnings and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings currently. ___________ 1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.

Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2023 and 2022 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%. (a) Other primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities. (b) For ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE, customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the impacts of weather and customer usage on distribution volumes. (c) For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd’s distribution formula rate and energy efficiency formula, ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI utilities transmission formula rates, and riders across all utilities, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings). (1) Reflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. (2) Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. (3) In 2022, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax benefit related to deductible transaction costs. (4) For ComEd, reflects an increase in distribution revenues due to higher allowed electric distribution ROE driven by an increase in treasury rates. For PECO, reflects an increase in revenue primarily due to higher gas distribution rates charged to customers, coupled with higher overall effective rates for both electric and gas attributable to decreased usage. For BGE, reflects an increase in revenue due to distribution rate increases. For PHI, reflects an increase in revenue primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases. For Corporate, reflects an increase in realized losses from hedging activity. (5) For ComEd, primarily reflect an increase in electric distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency revenues due to higher fully recoverable costs. For PECO, reflects a decrease in transmission and energy efficiency revenues due to regulatory required programs. For PHI, reflects higher revenues due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, which is fully offset in Interest expense and Other. For PHI, also reflects higher transmission revenues due to increased Income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, and Operating and maintenance expense, which are fully offset in a combination of Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Interest expense and Other. (6) Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For PECO, primarily reflects a decrease in other operating expenses, a decrease in program costs related to regulatory required programs, and a decrease in storm costs. For BGE, primarily reflects a decrease in other operating expense due to favorable impacts from the multi-year plan reconciliations. For PHI, primarily reflects an increase in contracting costs primarily due to the ACE employee strike. For Corporate, primarily reflects a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the Transition Services Agreement (TSA). (7) Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities and higher depreciation rates effective January 2023 for ComEd. (8) For PHI, primarily reflects higher income tax expense due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, with an offsetting increase in Other energy delivery. For Corporate, primarily reflects a decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA with an offsetting decrease in Operating and maintenance expense.

Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2023 and 2022 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%. (a) Other primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities. (b) For ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE, customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the impacts of weather and customer usage on distribution volumes. (c) For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd’s distribution formula rate and energy efficiency formula, ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI utilities transmission formula rates, and riders across all utilities, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings). (1) Reflects costs related to a multi-year Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) system implementation, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. (2) Reflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. (3) Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense and Other, net. (4) In 2022, for PECO, primarily reflects an adjustment to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. For Corporate, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax expense primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change, the recognition of valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, and nondeductible transaction costs partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit. In 2023, reflects the adjustment to state deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment. (5) For ComEd, reflects an increase in distribution revenues due to higher allowed electric distribution ROE driven by an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base. For PECO, reflects an increase in revenue primarily due to higher gas distribution rates charged to customers, coupled with higher overall effective rates for both electric and gas attributable to decreased usage. For BGE, reflects an increase in revenue due to distribution and transmission rate increases. For PHI, reflects an increase in revenue primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases. For Corporate, reflects an increase in realized losses from hedging activity. (6) For ComEd, reflects an increase in electric distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency revenues due to higher fully recoverable costs and also reflects carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory assets. For PECO, reflects an increase in transmission and energy efficiency revenues due to regulatory required programs. For PHI, primarily reflects higher revenues due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, which is fully offset in Interest expense and Other and the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable. For PHI, also reflects higher transmission revenues due to increased Income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, and Operating and maintenance expense, which are fully offset in a combination of Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Interest expense and Other. (7) Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For ComEd, reflects an increase in credit loss expense. For PECO, primarily reflects an increase in storm costs, an increase in program costs related to regulatory required programs, partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses. For BGE, primarily reflects a decrease due to favorable impacts resulting from the multi-year plan reconciliations, partially offset by an increase in storm costs. For PHI, reflects an increase in contracting costs primarily due to the ACE employee strike. For Corporate, includes the following three items: 1) a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA, 2) lower BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules (2023 includes no costs compared to one month of costs for the period prior to the separation for 2022), and 3) an increase in costs for DPA related matters. (8) Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities and higher depreciation rates effective January 2023 for ComEd. For PHI, includes the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable in Other Energy Delivery. (9) For PHI, primarily reflects higher income tax expense due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, with an offsetting increase in Other energy delivery. For Corporate, primarily reflects a decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA with an offsetting decrease in Operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by an increase in other income for the proposed settlement of the DPA related derivative claims. (10) Reflects the impact on earnings per share due to the increase in Exelon's average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of the August 2022 common stock issuance.

Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 05:31 AM Discovery hole had over 1 Oz/Tonne Combined Platinum and Palladium over 7.75 Metres TORONTO, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Power Nickel Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Power Nickel"") (TSXV: PNPN) (OTCBB: PNPNF) (Frankfurt: IVVI) is pleased to announce that the first hole of a drill program following up on the Wildcat high grade PGM intersection, appears to have encountered a mineralized zone similar to the previously announced May 10th 2023. The initial Hole PN-23-031A (Figure 1) intersected multiple chalcopyrite stringers and veinlets, almost continuously in the first sixty (60) metres of the drill hole. The thickness and density of these stringers increased at 60.50 to 68.25 m down the hole. The main mineralization is characterized by a high density of chalcopyrite veinlets and local massive chalcopyrite (Figure 2). The current hole encountered the zone at a depth of 168.5 m. Wildcat area represents an entirely new target to explore and is wide open laterally along strike and at depth (Figure 3). This new discovery is very significant with high-grade platinum and palladium associated with the copper. It is probable that the high-grade platinum and palladium originated in the underlying ultramafic unit and remobilized to the tonalite unit where the mineralization occurs. As the mineralization is remobilized, there is potential for discovery in a broader target area in vicinity of the ultramafic source rocks. Follow-up drilling will consider all other lithological units in addition to identifying the source mineralization in the ultramafic unit. ""We are very encouraged to extend this, what appears to be, a very high grade PGM rich zone another 100 metres downdip from initial discovery. Will need assay results to confirm, but it certainly looks very good. Subsequent holes will test the horizontal width of this zone while also testing east and west extensions. The PGM discovery adds an exciting and valuable dimension to the Nisk Project. High value PGM zones can add significant value to the overall discovery. We are also excited to learn about our test of the deeper Ultramafic units where we are searching for massive sulfides containing Nickel."" - Commented Power Nickel CEO Terry Lynch ""We are currently drilling this area to discover a significant volume of Copper-PGM rich mineralization, but our primary goal at Nisk is to identify and explore for ultramafic rocks hosting nickel; so, we have pushed PN-24-044 further down and intersected and untested ultramafic unit observed to the south, in the footwall of the current target. As illustrated in Figure 4, we wanted to test the Fleet ANT velocity model that was suggesting a shallower dip for the footwall ultramafic unit, and we did obtain the anticipated result confirming our interpretation. Having in hands a predictive model certainly indicates that we are having a good grasp on the geology of the system. I'm a very strong believer that a better understanding of the overall geology is the key that will lead to additional discoveries across the property."" – commented Kenneth Williamson, Power Nickel VP Exploration. Qualified Person Kenneth Williamson, Géo, M.Sc., VP Exploration at Power Nickel, is the qualified person who has reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this news release. About Power Nickel Inc.Power Nickel is a Canadian junior exploration company focusing on developing the High-Grade Nisk project into Canada's first Carbon Neutral Nickel mine. On February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CRE: TSXV). Subsequently, Power Nickel has exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Nisk Project and delivered notice to Critical Elements that it intends to exercise its second option to bring its ownership to 80%. The last remaining commitment to exercise the option was the delivery of a NI-43-101 Technical report which has now occurred. Power Nickel expects to complete the acquisition in Q1. The figure below presents a longitudinal view of the current 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate About Us Figure 1 The NISK property comprises a significant land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts. Power Nickel is focused on expanding the historical high-grade nickel-copper PGE mineralization with a series of drill programs designed to test the initial Nisk discovery zone and to explore the land package for adjacent potential Nickel deposits. About Us Figure 2 In addition to the Nisk project, Power Nickel owns significant land packages in British Colombia and Chile. Power Nickel is expected to reorganize these assets in a related vehicle through a plan of arrangement. Power Nickel announced on June 8, 2021, that an agreement had been made to complete the 100% acquisition of its Golden Ivan project in the heart of the Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle has reported mineral resources (past production and current resources) in 130 million ounces of gold, 800 million ounces of silver, and 40 billion pounds of copper (Resource World). This property hosts two known mineral showings (gold ore and Magee) and a portion of the past-producing Silverado mine, reportedly exploited between 1921 and 1939. These mineral showings are Polymetallic veins containing quantities of silver, lead, zinc, plus/minus gold, and plus/minus copper. Power Nickel is also 100 percent owner of five properties comprising over 50,000 acres strategically located in the prolific iron-oxide-copper-gold belt of northern Chile. It also owns a 3-per-cent NSR royalty interest on any future production from the Copaquire copper-molybdenum deposit sold to a subsidiary of Teck Resources Inc. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Teck has the right to acquire one-third of the 3-per-cent NSR for $3 million at any time. The Copaquire property borders Teck's producing Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile's first region.

TotalEnergies to supply Airbus with SAF for over half of its needs in Europe and collaborate on developing 100% sustainable fuels. The partnership aims to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector significantly. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The strategic partnership between Airbus and TotalEnergies marks a significant step in the aviation industry's journey towards decarbonization. The commitment to supply Airbus with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for over half of its needs in Europe is a tangible measure that may influence the energy markets, especially the SAF niche. The supply agreement could potentially lead to an increase in demand for SAF, which would encourage further investment and development within this sector. As the market for SAF expands, we might observe a positive impact on TotalEnergies' market share and revenue in the energy sector, particularly if they can scale up production to meet their target of 1.5 million tons of SAF by 2030.Moreover, the research and innovation programme to develop 100% sustainable fuels is an ambitious endeavor that could result in technological advancements with widespread applications. If successful, these innovations could create new market opportunities and set industry standards. This partnership could also serve as a catalyst for other companies to enter the SAF market, leading to increased competition and potentially driving down costs, which would be beneficial for the industry as a whole. Aerospace Industry Analyst From an aerospace perspective, Airbus's collaboration with TotalEnergies is a strategic move aimed at ensuring the company's future competitiveness in an industry where environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. The focus on SAF is particularly relevant given the aviation sector's significant contribution to global CO2 emissions. Airbus's proactive approach in integrating SAF into its operations could give it a competitive edge as airlines and customers increasingly prioritize sustainability.The partnership's emphasis on studying the non-CO2 effects, such as contrails, is also noteworthy. This research could lead to a better understanding of aviation's environmental impact and might result in additional regulatory changes. The outcomes of these studies could influence aircraft design and operational practices, potentially leading to further emissions reductions and efficiency improvements. Airbus's commitment to decarbonization through this partnership could enhance its brand reputation and align with global sustainability goals, which may have positive implications for its market position and investor perceptions. Environmental Policy Expert The Airbus and TotalEnergies alliance is an example of how industry leaders can align with international environmental goals, such as the Paris Agreement and the aviation industry's target of net carbon neutrality by 2050. This partnership could serve as a model for public-private cooperation in achieving these ambitious objectives. The successful reduction of CO2 emissions with SAF could influence environmental policy, potentially leading to more stringent regulations on aviation emissions or subsidies for SAF research and production.In the broader context, the partnership may also have a knock-on effect, encouraging other sectors to explore similar collaborations to reduce their carbon footprint. The commitment to significant SAF production targets reflects a proactive approach to environmental responsibility that could resonate with policymakers and regulators. As a result, this could shape future environmental legislation and standards, which would have far-reaching implications for businesses and the economy. 02/21/2024 - 04:25 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Airbus and TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) have signed a strategic partnership to meet the challenges of aviation decarbonization with sustainable aviation fuel. In line with the objective of achieving net carbon neutrality of aviation by 2050, this partnership aims to contribute to the reduction of the sector's CO2 emissions, in which Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) play a key role. SAF supplied by TotalEnergies can reduce up to 90% CO2 emissions over lifecycle compared to their fossil fuel equivalent. The partnership will cover two main areas: TotalEnergies will supply Airbus with sustainable aviation fuel for more than half of its needs in Europe. A research and innovation programme aimed at developing 100% sustainable fuels tailored to the design of current and future aircraft. The impact of the composition of sustainable aviation fuels on the reduction of CO2 emissions and non-CO2 effects, such as contrails, will also be studied. Airbus and TotalEnergies confirm their common ambition to promote SAF technology and to strengthen their collaboration to decarbonize the aviation industry: TotalEnergies has been supplying the SAF used by Airbus for its aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. TotalEnergies also supplied the fuel for several first SAF flights with Airbus aircraft: In May 2021, the 1st long-haul flight using French-produced SAF with an A350 between Paris and Montreal. In November 2021, the first flight of a H225 helicopter, from the ""Super Puma"" family, using 100% SAF. In March 2023, the first A321neo flight with 100% SAF. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, said: ""The development of sustainable aviation fuels is at the heart of our Company's transition strategy. We are happy to form a strategic alliance with Airbus to play our part in meeting the challenge of aviation decarbonization together. TotalEnergies has been working hard to respond to the sector’s new demand for a reduced carbon footprint. Our Company has set itself a target of 1.5 million tons of annual SAF production by 2030.” Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said: ""Accelerating the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels is essential if we are to meet our targets for reducing carbon emissions from aviation by 2030.

Positive outcomes in the DTC channel, especially in e-Commerce, validated the Group's strategic effectiveness. Ongoing strategic plans in 2023 target additional revenue growth and margin enhancement. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The Lanvin Group's reported revenue growth of 1% in FY2023, amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment, indicates a modest performance relative to the luxury fashion sector. The resilience of the APAC region, with an 8% increase, is noteworthy as it suggests a strategic pivot or robust demand in this market that may be outpacing other regions. The growth in direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels, particularly e-commerce, aligns with broader industry trends towards digital transformation and the importance of online retail in maintaining sales volume in the face of declining foot traffic in physical stores.Caruso's significant 30% revenue increase is indicative of successful brand positioning and product offerings that resonate with consumers. This could be a result of effective marketing or a strong alignment with consumer trends. Conversely, the decline in revenues for Lanvin and Sergio Rossi may reflect brand-specific challenges or a shift in consumer preferences within their respective luxury segments.The Group's emphasis on margin improvement suggests a focus on operational efficiency and product mix optimization, which could lead to improved profitability if executed effectively. However, the overall flat performance in DTC/eCommerce, with 0% growth, raises questions about the scalability of their online strategy and the need for further innovation to capture market share from competitors. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the 1% year-over-year revenue growth reported by Lanvin Group is relatively stagnant, especially considering the luxury market's potential for higher growth rates. Investors might view the performance as lackluster, especially given the global challenges that could have been leveraged as an opportunity for market consolidation and stronger growth. The flat performance in the DTC/eCommerce channel, despite being a key strategic focus for many retailers, may be a cause for concern regarding the Group's digital strategy effectiveness.However, the Group's ability to maintain stable revenues despite a reduction in its store-base by 12 stores can be seen as a positive indicator of operational efficiency and cost management. The reported focus on improved margin profiles and operating leverage built in 2023 could suggest that the Group is prioritizing profitability over top-line growth, which may appeal to investors focused on long-term value creation.The detailed revenue breakdown by brand and geography provides transparency and allows for an assessment of brand strength and regional market dynamics. The exceptional growth in the APAC region could be a signal for investors to monitor potential shifts in global luxury consumption patterns. Economist Examining the economic implications of Lanvin Group's performance, the modest revenue increase in a challenging economic climate reflects a degree of resilience within the luxury fashion industry. The regional disparities, with APAC outperforming EMEA and North America, may indicate a shift in economic power or consumer confidence within these regions. The luxury sector often serves as an economic indicator due to its sensitivity to consumer discretionary spending and overall economic health.The Group's strategic focus on core products and accessories, as seen with St. John and Caruso, suggests an adaptation to changing consumer preferences, possibly influenced by economic factors such as disposable income levels and consumer confidence. The emphasis on margin improvement is a prudent approach in times of economic uncertainty, as it can buffer against revenue volatility and ensure sustainability.Looking forward, the Group's expectation of continued market softness with regional opportunities for growth suggests a cautious economic outlook for the luxury sector. The focus on tactical growth opportunities may be a strategic response to anticipated economic headwinds, emphasizing the importance of agility in business strategy during uncertain times. 02/21/2024 - 05:00 AM Revenue of €426 million for FY2023, a 1% increase over FY 2022Despite challenging conditions, Lanvin Group grew revenue by 8% in APACResiliency through creative transition at Lanvin brand helped improve sales trend in the second half of 2023Positive signals in the DTC channel, including e-Commerce are proving the effectiveness of the Group's strategyOngoing implementation of strategic plans in 2023 to drive further revenue growth and margin improvementNEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lanvin Group (NYSE: LANV, the ""Group""), a global luxury fashion group with Lanvin, Wolford, St. John, Sergio Rossi, and Caruso in its portfolio of brands, today announced its preliminary, unaudited revenues for the full-year 2023.

Lanvin Group showed tremendous resilience and continued on its growth trajectory. 2023 was also a year that our group and our brands proved their ability to manage through adverse market conditions and execute their strategy.

The Group continued improving its retail network and expanding its e-commerce footprint. Successful product launches and marketing campaigns generated brand heat allowing for resiliency in revenues during a challenging market. Store network rationalization: The Group continued to rationalize its store footprint and had an overall reduction in its store-base by a total of 12 stores. Despite the smaller store base, Group DTC sales remained flat on a like-for-like basis. St. John and Sergio Rossi posted strong store like-for-like growth with 13% and 6%, respectively. Lanvin brand showed improving result in the second half: Lanvin brand performed better in the second half of the year in spite of the increasingly softening market. The brand successfully managed through a year of creative transition, but was impacted by a softer wholesale market.

Notably, St. John showed 14% growth in e-Commerce revenue and Sergio Rossi showed 5% growth. Lanvin and Wolford remained flat for the year. 2024 Outlook The Group anticipates that while continued softness in the overall global market will impact the business, regional economies will fare better and present opportunities for growth. Furthermore, the APAC region shows opportunities for market share gains. The Group plans to pursue tactical growth opportunities in 2024. At both Group and brand-level, ongoing initiatives will continue to drive improved margin profile.

(CSE: CCC) (FSE: BJ4) (OTC: CCCFF) (""Carlyle"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce results from its most recent diamond drill program at the Newton Gold & Silver Project. The drill program completed 840 metres of drilling across 7 (seven) drill holes, and tested multiple high priority targets with aims of increasing both tonnage and ounces of gold and silver in the Company's current National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") Newton Project Inferred Resource Calculation. HighlightsThe Company has confirmed a new, near surface, higher grade gold and silver bearing zone to the north of the current inferred mineral resource, which the Company now calls the Halo area and which remains open in multiple directions.Gold and silver mineralization was confirmed present in another farther north-western area, which the Company now calls the Sunrise area.All holes encountered gold and silver mineralization.About the Halo AreaHistorical hole 10030, located approximately 400 metres north of the current inferred mineral resource intersected 24 metres of 0.83 g/t Au from 18.0 - 42.0 metres in propylitic altered mafic volcanics associated with an IP chargeability anomaly but was never followed up on until this current phase of work.The Company drilled three shallow holes around 10030, being holes N23-093, 94, and 95, triangulating 50 metre step outs to the northeast, southwest and northwest of hole 10030 to investigate possible continuation of this mineralization. These holes were also plotted based on gold-in-soil geochemical anomalies and elevated IP chargeability anomalies proximal to hole 10030. To the southeast of 10030, hole N23-093 intersected 0.75 g/t gold over 39 metres, starting at 14.9 metres. This hole confirms the continuation of a higher grade, near surface zone that appears to be widening towards the current inferred mineral resource and remains open in multiple directions. Further drilling is required to continue defining the size of this mineralized area, integrate this discovery into the Company's inferred resource calculation, and evaluate its potential as a possible future starter pit.Mineralization also continued to the northeast of 10030, highlighted by 18 meters of 0.38 g/t gold in N23-095 starting at 54 metres. Mineralization continued to the northwest of 10030 as well, where N23-094 cut propylitic altered mafic volcanics returning 102 metres of 0.13 g/t gold from 6 metres. The stronger mineralized vectors of the Halo area currently remain open to the west, northeast, east, south and southeast.Meanwhile, more than 200 meters south of 10030, hole N23-096 was drilled between the Halo area and the current inferred mineral resource, cutting 13.25 metres of 0.40 g/t gold from 31.75 metres, within mafic volcanics. The top of the hole intersected very strongly altered felsic volcanics with disseminated and fracture controlled sulphides to a depth of 24 metres and returned 0.32 g/t gold from 2-18 metres. This suggests a possible continuation of the newly confirmed northern system this far south.The Company's intention is to continue drilling in all open directions of this newly confirmed area to further define its ultimate size, grade, and potential. About the Sunrise AreaHole N23-098 was a short 54 metre exploration hole drilled more than 700 metres northwest of the current inferred mineral resource in the Sunrise target area and returned 0.15 g/t gold from 9 to 54m. The Sunrise target is a broad area with elevated gold in soil and chargeability anomalies that correlate with historical drill logs indicating the presence of untested felsic volcanics. Hole N23-098 tested a peripheral area of this broad target and successfully confirmed elevated gold in the strongly altered felsic intrusive increasing its clear interest for Carlyle, thus warranting further investigation. Other HolesHole N23-097 was collared west of the current inferred mineral resource and intercepted elevated gold values including 0.13 AuEq from 2-81 metres.

Of main interest after this program is the triangular testing around historical hole 10030 which is located approximately 400 metres north of the current inferred mineral resource having intersected 24 metres of 0.83 g/t Au from 18.0 - 42.0 metres. To the southeast of 10030, hole N23-093 intersected 0.75 g/t gold over 39 metres, starting at 14.9 metres. Combining this result with historical higher-grade near surface drilling adds more clues and gives the Company optimism that this 'Halo' Area could be one of the keys we are seeking and definitely warrants follow-up work as soon as possible.""Mr. Jeremy Hanson, VP Exploration, stated: ""We are very pleased with these results. We have confirmed a new near surface target immediately north of the current inferred mineral resource, the 'Halo Area'; we believe there is potential to tie this target into the current known mineralization, and the fact that it is hosted in a separate lithology now adds additional theories and targets for mineralization. We also confirmed that the northwest 'Sunrise' target is bordered by strongly altered felsic intrusives enriched with gold, which we believe increases the prospectivity of the area.""Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)Carlyle Commodities has applied a rigorous quality assurance/quality control program at the Newton Project using best industry practice. All core was logged by a geoscientist. The Newton drill core was drilled at NQ diameter. The drill core was split in half using a core saw and each sample half was placed in a marked sample bag with corresponding sample tag then sealed. The remaining half core is retained in core boxes that are stored in a secure facility. The chain of custody of samples was recorded and maintained for all samples from the drill to the laboratory. All diamond drilling sample batches included 5% QA/QC samples consisting of certified blanks, standards and field duplicates. Multiple certified ore assay laboratory standards and one blank standard were used in the process. Samples were submitted to Bureau Veritas British Columbia, an independent ISO 9001: 2008 certified lab, for gold, silver and base metal analysis using Inductivity Coupled Plasma (ICP), and Fire Assay (FA) methods.Samples were prepared by crushing the entire sample to 75% passing 2mm, riffle splitting 250g and pulverizing the split to better than 85% passing 75 microns. Gold was analyzed using a 30-gram fire assay and ICP-AES. The performance on the blind standards, blanks and duplicates achieved high levels of accuracy and reproducibility and has been verified by Jeremy Hanson, a qualified person as defined by NI-43-101.Qualified Person Jeremy Hanson, P.Geo. a Qualified Person, as such term is defined by NI 43-101, has reviewed the scientific and technical information that forms the basis for this news release and has approved the disclosure herein.

The deal includes four Airbus A350-900, three Boeing 787-9, and ten Airbus A321NEO aircraft. Deliveries are scheduled from 2024 to 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The lease agreements between AerCap Holdings and Thai Airways for a mix of widebody and narrowbody aircraft represent a strategic move for both companies. From a market perspective, this transaction signals Thai Airways' commitment to fleet modernization and could potentially improve its competitive positioning in the airline industry. The addition of fuel-efficient models like the Airbus A350-900, Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321NEO is expected to enhance operational efficiency and passenger comfort, which could lead to increased demand for Thai Airways' services.For AerCap, this deal underscores its role as a leading aircraft leasing company and may positively impact its revenue streams and market share. The delivery schedule spread over multiple years indicates a stable long-term income for AerCap, which can be attractive to investors. However, the dependency on airline industry health and the associated risks, such as fluctuating fuel prices and geopolitical tensions, should be monitored closely by stakeholders. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications, the lease agreements are likely to affect both AerCap's and Thai Airways' balance sheets. For AerCap, the revenue recognition from these leases will be spread over the term of the agreements, providing a predictable cash flow. The deal may also reflect positively on AerCap's earnings forecasts and stock performance, assuming successful execution and no defaults on the lease payments by Thai Airways.For Thai Airways, the financial strategy to lease rather than purchase outright may improve its capital expenditure profile and free up resources for other operational investments. However, leasing commitments will increase its long-term liabilities, which could affect its debt-to-equity ratio. Investors should consider how these aircraft leases align with Thai Airways' overall financial recovery strategy post the challenging period it has recently emerged from. Aviation Industry Expert The significance of this deal extends beyond the immediate financial impact and speaks to broader trends in the aviation industry. The choice of aircraft indicates a push towards modernization with an emphasis on fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, aligning with global sustainability goals. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 are known for their advanced technology and lower environmental footprint compared to older models.The timing of the deliveries, coinciding with the industry's recovery from a challenging period, likely due to the global pandemic, suggests optimism about the future demand for air travel. This deal also reflects the importance of strategic partnerships in the aviation sector, with AerCap and Thai Airways maintaining a relationship that has spanned decades, demonstrating the value of long-term collaboration in navigating industry cycles. 02/21/2024 - 04:30 AM SINGAPORE, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AerCap Holdings N.V. (""AerCap"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: AER) today announced it has signed lease agreements with Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (""Thai Airways"") for seven widebody aircraft comprising four Airbus A350-900 aircraft and three Boeing 787-9 aircraft, and ten Airbus A321NEO aircraft.

The report emphasizes trade growth outpacing GDP, the shift towards national security priorities, challenges in financing supply chain resilience, and the need for reshoring strategies. Southeast Asia and Mexico are identified as key reshoring destinations. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The projection of global trade to grow at a compound rate of 3.3% through to 2028, surpassing GDP growth, is a significant indicator of the increasing interdependence of world economies. This trend suggests that companies with a strong export component may see enhanced opportunities for revenue growth. However, the emphasis on supply chain expansion in Southeast Asia and emerging markets could lead to a realignment of trade routes and distribution networks. Firms that are agile and able to navigate these changes may gain a competitive edge, while those that are slower to adapt could face logistical challenges and market share erosion.The report also touches on the implications of protectionist policies and resource-guarding for global supply chains. These factors can lead to increased production costs and create inflationary pressures that may compress corporate margins. Investors should monitor the potential impact on companies with international supply chains, as these could affect profitability and stock performance. Businesses that can mitigate these risks through strategic investments or diversification may be better positioned to withstand such economic headwinds. Supply Chain Management Expert Higher financing costs and the consequent reduction in firms' ability to invest in supply chain resilience is a critical issue. Companies are likely to prioritize strategies like reshoring and technology enhancements to mitigate risks and enhance profitability. This shift may lead to increased capital expenditures in the short term but could ultimately result in more streamlined operations and reduced long-term costs. Investors should consider the potential for these investments to drive efficiency gains and create value over time.Furthermore, the workforce growth disparity between developed and developing economies could have profound implications for supply chain dynamics. Companies in industrialized nations may face labor shortages, while those in developing markets could benefit from a growing labor pool. This could influence decisions on where to locate manufacturing facilities and how to structure global operations, potentially affecting companies' scalability and access to talent. Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) Analyst The container shipping industry's challenge in financing its decarbonization efforts highlights a critical ESG concern. With shipping accounting for a significant portion of global trade by value, the industry's inability to shoulder the cost of becoming more environmentally friendly could have broader implications for global emissions targets. Companies that are proactive in addressing these challenges may not only avoid future regulatory costs but could also appeal to increasingly ESG-conscious investors. On the other hand, firms that fail to invest in sustainable practices may face reputational damage and potential divestment.The report's insights into the strategic value of supply chains underscore the importance of ESG considerations in investment decisions. Stakeholders are likely to scrutinize how companies manage supply chain risks related to geopolitical tensions and climate change. Firms that exhibit strong ESG credentials, particularly in supply chain management, may be better positioned to attract investment and secure customer loyalty in an increasingly environmentally and socially aware market. 02/21/2024 - 04:05 AM LONDON and SINGAPORE and NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global today published the latest edition of its Look Forward research series, focusing on the most important themes that will drive the development of global supply chains through to 2030. The global supply chain industry finds itself at a juncture, grappling with pressures from geopolitical tensions, shipping disruptions and looming threats from climate change and technological advances. These developments have enabled a widespread re-evaluation of the global wave of outsourcing as countries and companies race to understand and adapt to shifting trade patterns. Against this backdrop, S&P Global's leading specialists investigate the major themes that will shape supply chains in the decade to come, offering decision-makers a comprehensive overview to chart a resilient course forward. Highlights from the report include: Trade remains the bedrock of the global economy – S&P Global expects global trade will grow at a compound rate of 3.3% through to 2028, outpacing GDP growth (2.6%). Global supply chain expansion will be led by Southeast Asia and emerging markets.Supply chain policies will continue to shift towards national security priorities – rising protectionism, resource-guarding, sanctions and investment subsidies could increase inflationary pressures.Higher financing costs reduce firms' ability and willingness to invest in supply chain resilience; businesses prefer strategies that cut risks and boost profitability, like reshoring and technology enhancements.Foreign direct investments point to Southeast Asia and Mexico as reshoring destinations.Workforce growth disparity between developed and developing economies will disadvantage industrialized market supply chains; cross-border labor mobility is expected to be held back by politics.Despite transporting 45% of global trade by value, the container shipping industry is ill-equipped to finance its decarbonization, with cost burdens remaining a powerful obstacle.""Whether in the opportunities emerging from evolving dynamics and technologies, or the risks arising across geopolitical spheres, the strategic value of supply chains has never been more evident,"" said Edouard Tavernier, President, S&P Global Mobility.

Positive JPush SDK version 5.2.3 of Aurora Mobile passed the security test by CAICT in China. The evaluation included aspects like product security, data storage, interaction security, key component security, and code/document security. Aurora Mobile emphasizes data protection, compliance, and security in its products. The company has a compliance review system from product development to launch. Aurora Mobile engages with government agencies and industry associations to establish industry-wide regulations and standards. The company aims to continue safeguarding data security and promoting compliance in the mobile application industry. Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst The recognition of Aurora Mobile's JPush SDK version 5.2.3 by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology underscores the company's commitment to robust cybersecurity practices. In the context of China's stringent cybersecurity laws, such as the Cybersecurity Law and the Personal Information Protection Law, passing this comprehensive security test is not only a testament to the technical soundness of Aurora Mobile's product but also positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly sensitive to data protection issues.For stakeholders, the immediate implication is a potential increase in trust from both current and prospective clients, which could translate into customer retention and acquisition benefits. Over the long term, this could enhance the company's competitive edge and market share within the Chinese mobile technology services sector. However, it's important to note that maintaining this level of security requires continuous investment in technology and processes, which could impact operational costs. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the successful security evaluation of JPush SDK could signal to investors that Aurora Mobile is adept at navigating the regulatory landscape and prioritizing product security—a key differentiator in the technology sector. The Chinese mobile application market is vast and still growing and data security has become a pivotal factor in user decision-making. Consequently, Aurora Mobile's enhanced security features may drive market demand and provide a leverage point in negotiating with enterprise clients.However, investors should monitor the scalability of such security measures and whether they can be applied to other products and services offered by Aurora Mobile. It's also crucial to assess how this development affects the company's reputation among peers and within the broader industry, as it could influence strategic partnerships and long-term growth opportunities. Legal Expert Legally, the compliance with CAICT's security standards indicates Aurora Mobile's proactive approach to adhering to national regulations. This proactive stance is beneficial not only for mitigating legal risks associated with data breaches but also for aligning with future regulatory changes that are likely in China's rapidly evolving legal landscape for data security and privacy. Businesses that stay ahead of the curve in terms of compliance can often avoid costly legal challenges and fines, which has a direct impact on the bottom line.Additionally, the company's involvement in shaping industry regulations and standards could provide it with a voice in the formulation of policies that affect its operational environment. This level of engagement can be particularly advantageous when new laws are being drafted, as it allows companies like Aurora Mobile to advocate for regulations that support innovation while ensuring consumer protection. 02/21/2024 - 04:00 AM SHENZHEN, China, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ: JG) (“Aurora Mobile” or the “Company”), a leading provider of customer engagement and marketing technology services in China, today announced that its push notification product JPush, specifically JPush SDK version 5.2.3 has passed the security test and evaluation in the SDK Security campaign initiated by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (“CAICT”).

(OTCMKTS:DLOC), the developer of SatennaTM, a breakthrough technology that will deliver high-speed Internet from satellites directly to smartphones all over the world, today announced that in a recent podcast, its CEO, Rich Berliner, spoke with Dr. Andrew Robson, a professor at the University of New England in Australia, about his work in remote sensing and how it aims to address agricultural challenges such as crop health monitoring and yield predictions. During the conversation, Professor Robson highlighted the significance of real-time data access to a host of scenarios, including crop applications, firefighting, and even the prevention of theft in oyster farming. He said, “There is good mobile coverage and good data coverage in the centers of the main cities. Outside of those centers, the reception is very poor for telecommunication, let alone data transfer. It gets worse if you are in an agricultural setting or amongst trees within an orchard or things like that. It’s a really big limiter of the adoption or accessibility into useful technologies. To be able to walk into your field and have data access is the missing link. We need real time data.” Professor Robson continued, ""When you talk about how data accessibility can help, there’s a lot of commercial satellites available now. There’s been a lot of work over the decades by many people on using these satellites for a range of agricultural purposes. So, looking at crop health, identifying pest or disease hotspots, seeing if your irrigation is working correctly, predicting yield and quality—all these sorts of applications can benefit from using satellite and ground-based data sensing. “The benefit this would provide, having faster data in remote locations and access to agricultural technology is a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle,” Professor Robson concluded. “It is great to hear what you are trying to achieve. You’ve nailed one that is really beneficial for a wide range of reasons.” Dr. Andrew Robson is a Professor at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia; Director of the Applied Agricultural Sensing Center; and President of the Queensland Oyster Growers Association. He earned his AS in Environmental Science at Canberra Institute of Technology in 1997 and a BS in Environmental Science from Charles Sturt University in 2002, majoring in GIS/remote sensing at both institutions. He went on to complete his PhD in this field of study at the University of Queensland in 2007. He has been involved in agricultural research since 1996, with much of that time spent developing remote sensing/GIS spatial applications for various agricultural and horticultural farming systems around the globe. He is listed as a Google Scholar at: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hOWIbmwAAAAJ. This podcast can be viewed at https://youtu.be/SWXeh39DF2Q. About Digital Locations, Inc.

The transaction includes operations in Italy, France, and Germany, generating around $90 million in sales in 2023. Dana will continue to receive components through a supply agreement with the new entity, focusing on industrial system sales. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of Dana Incorporated's European hydraulics business is a strategic move that can have significant implications for the company's focus and resource allocation. By offloading a non-core segment that generated $90 million in sales, Dana can streamline its operations and potentially improve its profitability margins. The transaction allows Dana to concentrate on industrial system sales, which may lead to better integration of its product offerings and services.This deal also illustrates a trend where companies divest specific units to specialize more deeply in their core competencies.

Financial Analyst The sale of Dana's European hydraulics business for an undisclosed amount could potentially impact its stock market performance, depending on the financial details of the transaction. Investors should consider the sale's effect on Dana's revenue, as the $90 million in sales represents a portion of their business. The supply agreement with HPI Group may offset some revenue loss and provide cost savings from reduced operational complexity.Furthermore, the market will likely scrutinize the deal's terms and regulatory approval process. The successful completion of the sale could be seen as a positive indicator of Dana's ability to execute its strategic plans, which might be reflected in investor confidence and stock valuation. Legal Expert The transaction's requirement for regulatory approvals is a critical factor in its completion. The deal involves cross-border considerations within the European Union, which means it will be subject to antitrust and competition laws. The timeframe for regulatory approval can be unpredictable and may affect the expected completion in the first half of 2024.Additionally, the supply agreement between Dana and the HPI Group post-sale is a complex legal arrangement that ensures Dana's continued access to essential components. The terms of this agreement are crucial as they will dictate the future relationship between the two entities, including pricing, quality control and delivery guarantees. It's an important aspect for stakeholders to understand, as it will influence Dana's operational capabilities and risk profile going forward. 02/21/2024 - 03:00 AM MAUMEE, Ohio, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dana Incorporated (NYSE: DAN) announced today that, as part of an ongoing evaluation of its operations and product portfolio, the company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its European hydraulics business to HPI Group, a hydraulics business jointly held by Apogee Group and EiM Capital.
