Motley Fool,Is Micron Technology Stock Going to $150? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-stock-going-150-193123523.html,Micron stock could go to $150. But how long can it stay there?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are red hot -- and Christopher Danely thinks Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock might be the red-hottest of the bunch. Writing in a note covered on StreetInsider.com Friday, the Citigroup analyst argued Micron stock that costs $93 on Friday will hit $150 a share within a year. That's an almost 61% price jump.How sure is he about that number?Pretty certain. Danely is touting Micron as Citi's ""top pick.""Is Micron stock a buy?Does Micron deserve to be your top pick, though? Focusing on the short term, Danely predicts that Micron will beat earnings expectations (for a $0.26 per share loss) and raise guidance when reporting Q2 results next Wednesday. DRAM prices look strong, and Micron is shipping a lot of high-priced, high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) to customers ordering AI systems from Nvidia.Micron probably won't be profitable this year, but earnings could race past $10 a share by 2026. Citi thinks the stock deserves a 15x multiple -- $150 a share. And while this is a 50% bigger multiple than it usually gets at peak earnings, Citi could still be right. Two semiconductor cycles ago, Micron earned $11.51 per share in 2018, and by all accounts, this current AI revolution is a lot bigger than the expansion back then.What worries me, though, is that everybody already knows AI is big. Nvidia's supersized profit margins leave no doubt about that, and Micron's competitors SK Hynix and Samsung -- both several times Micron's size in the crucial HBM market -- aren't likely to give up their market share to Micron without a fight (and a price war).With everyone producing HBM chips at breakneck speed, the seeds of the next semiconductor cyclical slowdown are being sown already today. The risk inherent in buying Micron right now isn't that it might not ""go to $150."" It's that when the downturn arrives ... it might not stay there very long.Caveat investor.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

TechCrunch,Leaked SpaceX documents show company forbids employees to sell stock if it deems they've misbehaved,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leaked-spacex-documents-show-company-191914484.html,"SpaceX requires employees to agree to some unusual terms related to their stock awards, which have a chilling effect on staff, according to sources and internal documents viewed by TechCrunch.  SpaceX also gives itself the right to ban past and present employees from participating in tender offers if they are deemed to have committed “an act of dishonesty against the company,” or to have violated written company policies, among other reasons.","SpaceX requires employees to agree to some unusual terms related to their stock awards, which have a chilling effect on staff, according to sources and internal documents viewed by TechCrunch.That includes a provision that allows SpaceX the right to purchase back vested shares within a six-month period following an employee leaving the company for any reason. SpaceX also gives itself the right to ban past and present employees from participating in tender offers if they are deemed to have committed “an act of dishonesty against the company,” or to have violated written company policies, among other reasons. Employees often aren’t aware of the “dishonesty” condition when they initially sign up on the equity compensation management platform, one former employee said. If SpaceX bars an employee from selling stock in the tender offers, the person would have to wait until SpaceX goes public to realize cash from the shares — and it’s unclear when that will happen, if it ever does.SpaceX did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Employees pay taxes on their sharesLike most tech companies, SpaceX includes stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of its compensation package to attract top talent. No doubt this has paid off: SpaceX's 13,000-strong workforce is helping to push the limits of what was thought of as possible in aerospace, deliver crew to and from the International Space Station, and build out the largest satellite constellation in history. Unlike stock in public companies, stock in private companies cannot be sold without the company’s permission. So employees can only turn that part of their pay into cash when their employer allows such transactions. SpaceX is known for generally holding buyback events twice a year – meaning SpaceX will buy the shares back from employees; this schedule, which has been fairly reliable in recent years, means that employees have biannual opportunities to liquidate assets that have likely appreciated since the vesting date. Story continuesIt’s not uncommon for additional terms to be attached to employee stock compensation at startups and employees who stay with the company long enough to vest stock may have acquired stock under various stock plans with various conditions. Yet no employee at startups and private companies are entitled to sell their stock.Indeed, at SpaceX, if an employee was fired “for cause,” the company stated it can repurchase their stock for a price of $0 per share, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch. “It sounds unusual to [a] have cause type exclusion provision in a tender offer agreement,” attorney and stock options expert Mary Russell told TechCrunch. She said it is also unusual for a traditional venture-based startup to have repurchase rights for vested shares that are unrelated to a bad-actor-type “for cause” termination.These terms “keep everyone under their control, even if they have left the company,” one former employee said because employees don’t want to be forced to return their valuable SpaceX stock for no compensation. “And since there is no urgency by SpaceX to go public, being banned from tender offers effectively zeros out your shares, at least for a long time. Even though you paid thousands to cover the taxes.”“They also try and force a non-disparagement agreement on you when you leave, either with a carrot, or a stick if they have one,” the person said.SpaceX names Elon Musk actions as a ‘risk factor’As recently as 2020, SpaceX was also providing to employees a separate document outlining the risks of investing in the company’s securities. It reads similar to an S-1 registration statement that public companies must file; given that SpaceX is private, it is a unique disclosure into the company’s risk profile. To a large extent, such documents are written to minimize the company’s legal liability. The SpaceX document rightly points out that equity investments are inherently risky, because participants are trading a highly liquid asset – cash – for highly illiquid shares. As such, they exhaustively list various material risk factors, no matter how unlikely — for example, in its risk document, seen by TechCrunch, SpaceX includes that Hawthorne, California, which is home to its headquarters, is a “seismically active region.” The company also includes a number of risk factors related to Elon Musk, its CEO and founder. “To date, the Company has been highly dependent on the leadership provided by the Company’s founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer, Elon Musk,” the document reads. “SpaceX, Mr. Musk, and other companies Mr. Musk is affiliated with, frequently receive an immense amount of media attention. As such, Mr. Musk’s actions or public statements could also potentially have a positive or negative impact on the market capitalization of SpaceX.” The document also calls out a $40 million settlement between Musk and the SEC, which came about after he tweeted in August 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Even though that tweet did not relate to SpaceX, “the settlement has implications for SpaceX,” the document says. “If there is a lack of compliance with the settlement, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings could be instituted against Mr. Musk, which could have adverse consequences for SpaceX. Most notably, the SEC could deny SpaceX the right to rely on Regulation D, which is an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for private financing transactions. A denial of future reliance on Regulation D could potentially make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital in the future.” While Tesla’s recent securities statements do call out the SEC settlement, they do not address potential media attention in the same direct manner. The document also states that there is a risk that there may never be a public market for the company’s common stock — an issue should an employee ever be barred from tender events. SpaceX is one of the most valuable private companies in the world, with the valuation topping out at $180 billion as of last December. Like other private companies, its stock is split into preferred and common stock. Employees are awarded the latter, while preferred stock is generally owned by institutional investors and entities affiliated with Musk. Preferred stock has some superior rights attached to it, including liquidation preferences and dividends. The common stock is split into three stock classes, Class A, B and C. According to an equity incentive plan approved by the SpaceX board in March 2015, and which has a termination date in 2025, employees receive Class C stock, a non-voting stock."

About $5.3 trillion are set to expire this time, according to Rocky Fishman, founder of derivatives analytical firm Asym 500.“It’s a day in which the direction of the market is very, very difficult to predict,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “The ‘internals’ get so skewed by the expiration that they don’t tell us anything. It will be important that investors don’t use today’s action when trying to decipher what is going to happen in the marketplace next week and beyond.”The options episode comes at a critical juncture for markets positioning for next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. A recent pickup in inflation isn’t likely to shift officials’ forecasts for three interest-rate cuts this year and four in 2025, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.The S&P 500 dropped to around 5,130, with trading volume that was 40% above the 30-day average. The Nasdaq 100 fell about 1%. Adobe Inc. tumbled on a weak sales outlook. Nvidia Corp. whipsawed, while heading toward its 10th straight weekly advance. Treasury 10-year yields topped 4.3%, extending this week’s increase to almost 25 basis points.“This week has been remarkably confusing on multiple fronts,” said Florian Ielpo at Lombard Odier Asset Management. “The macroeconomic news flow has made it clear that the US economy is unexpectedly slowing down, while inflation is decelerating at a slower pace. Instead of focusing on the economic slowdown, markets have fully embraced the inflation narrative.”Story continuesThe rally in equity markets could falter if sticky inflation prompts the Fed to turn more hawkish next week and signal fewer-than-expected rate cuts, according to Barclays Plc strategists led by Emmanuel Cau.“With the Fed so far endorsing current market pricing of three cuts starting in June, investors continue to see the glass half full on the soft landing narrative,” they wrote.The glide path to the Fed’s 2% inflation target is anything but smooth and the final mile to the finish line is likely to take some time and a lot more data to gauge its progress, according to Carol Schleif at BMO Family Office.“The earliest possible cut could be June, though we wouldn’t be shocked to see that delayed to later in the year if the data continues to come in hot as recent data has,” she noted. “Our base case is for three total rate cuts in 2024, though it’s possible that the Fed cuts rates even fewer times if the economic data surprises to the upside.”Corporate Highlights:Nippon Steel Corp. said it’s determined to complete its $14.1 billion acquisition of United States Steel Corp., even after President Joe Biden stated the company should stay in US hands.JD.com Inc. said it will not make an offer for British electronics retailer Currys Plc, just days after US buyout firm Elliott Investment Management also walked away.Binance Holdings Ltd. has tightened requirements for listing new digital tokens, stepping up efforts to bolster investor protections on its platform.Boeing Co. has sent a so-called multi-operator message to operators of the 787 jetliner following an in-flight incident involving the long-distance jet a few days ago, in which the plane briefly and rapidly lost altitude, injuring multiple people on board.United Airlines Holdings Inc. is close to securing three dozen or more Airbus A321neo jets from aircraft lessors as it looks to replace Boeing Co. 737 Max 10 orders that are at least five years behind schedule, according to people familiar with the matter.Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s drug Rezdiffra gained the first US approval to treat a potentially deadly liver disease that affects millions worldwide, succeeding in an area where some bigger rivals have failed.Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc plunged after a jury awarded an Illinois woman $60 million in damages, saying the company’s Enfamil baby formula led to the death of her premature baby.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 11:06 a.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.8%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.4%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%The euro was little changed at $1.0888The British pound fell 0.1% to $1.2738The Japanese yen fell 0.5% to 149.02 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 3.2% to $68,415.66Ether fell 3.5% to $3,705.4BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 4.31%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.44%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 4.10%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changedSpot gold was little changedThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Lu Wang.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of TrollsWhen It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

The digital experience segment registered similar growth, up 10% to $1.29 billion.Remaining performance obligations, a proxy for backlog, rose 16% to $17.58 billion, showing a healthy growth in demand.On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share rose from $3.80 to $4.48, topping the consensus estimate of $4.38. That didn't include a $1 billion charge related to its decision to abandon its effort to acquire Figma after the deal faced regulatory pushback.CEO Shantanu Narayen noted that the company had booked record revenue in the quarter, and said, ""We've done an incredible job harnessing the power of generative AI to deliver groundbreaking innovation across our product portfolio.""Adobe's guidance disappointsDespite the solid first-quarter results, guidance for the second quarter missed the mark. Management forecast revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion, which was short of the consensus expectation of $5.31 billion and would reflect a modest slowdown in revenue growth to 9% to 10%.On the bottom line, Adobe guided for fiscal Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40, which would equate to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%, and which would be a decline from the first quarter. However, that was in line with the consensus estimate of $4.38.Story continuesAdobe shares are priced at a premium, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, and jitters about growth tend to lead to sell-offs in such situations.

If approved by a federal court, the settlement will likely usher changes to the way consumers buy and sell homes. The NAR said it will pay $418 million over the next four years to end litigation.Real estate names slid on the heels of the NAR's groundbreaking settlement. Alongside Zillow's decline, shares of Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS), Compass (COMP), and Redfin (RDFN) fell as much as 15%, 11%, and 5%, respectively.As part of the settlement, the NAR said it would, ""put in place a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of broker compensation on the MLS,"" ending rules that had effectively required sellers to compensate a buyer's agent.The NAR's MLS, or Multiple Listing Service, is a database where 88% of sellers listed their homes last year. Brokers who list their clients' properties in the database previously had to agree to share their commissions with other MLS participants, with commissions typically standing at 6%.Beginning in July, agents will also have to enter into written agreements with homebuyers they represent.""It has always been our goal to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible,"" Nykia Wright, interim CEO, said in a statement.A ""sale pending"" sign is posted in front of a home for sale on November 30, 2023 in Larkspur, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)And at least one Wall Street analyst thinks these new rules will lead to ""commissions falling 25% to 50%.""In a note to clients on Friday, Jaret Seiberg, housing policy analyst for TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote that in addition to this drop in commissions, this ruling ""should benefit online and discount real estate brokerages. They should be able to access the Multiple Listing Service without having to meet the commission requirements that previously were in place.""Story continuesSeiberg added: ""That means they can offer lower commission rates in order to attract more business. In addition, the settlement bans the inclusion of buyer agent compensation in the listing.""In Seiberg's view, existing homeowners — who will now pay out a smaller fee upon the sale of their home — are set to benefit most, while first-time and less-wealthy buyers may see negative impacts, as smaller commissions and no pre-arranged fee structure, could hamper agent motivation to work with these clients.The settlement also heightens the financial and administrative woes the NAR has been facing in recent months. NAR CEO Bob Goldberg resigned last year just days after the $1.8 billion verdict against the organization over commissions. Goldberg's replacement, Tracy Kasper, later resigned in January after a blackmail threat regarding a past personal matter.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Business Insider,4 of the most competitive rental markets in the country added virtually no new apartments in 2023. It shows the housing crisis isn't going away.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-most-competitive-rental-markets-180301615.html,Multifamily housing construction is beginning to slow down as interest rates and construction and insurance costs stay high.,"A ""for rent"" sign is posted in front of a home on December 12, 2023 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesMany US rental markets aren't adding enough new housing, worsening affordability issues.17 of the 20 most competitive markets are building below the national average.The hardest-hit renters are the lowest-income with insufficient affordable housing available.The most competitive rental markets in the country are failing to add enough new housing.That's according to a new analysis of the country's 139 largest rental markets by RentCafe, which found that 17 of the 20 most competitive rental markets in the US are building less than the national average. Four of these markets — Oklahoma City, the Bridgeport-New Haven area in Connecticut, the Lansing-Ann Arbor, Michigan area, and Silicon Valley, California — added virtually no new apartments at the beginning of 2024.The average share of newly constructed apartments in rental markets across the country is 0.67%. Brooklyn, New York, had just 0.19% at the start of 2024, San Diego had just 0.24%, and North New Jersey had just 0.51%, RentCafe found.The report determined market competitiveness using five factors, including the percentage of apartments occupied by tenants, the number of days it takes to fill an apartment, and the share of newly constructed units.The biggest change over the last year in most markets was a rise in the number of days a typical apartment sits unoccupied in between tenants — jumping from 38 days in early 2023 to 41 days in early 2024, RentCafe found.Overall, rent growth in markets across the country has slowed a bit over the last year, in large part because cities across the country have seen a glut of newly-built apartments hit the market. But new supply is drying up as construction slows amid elevated interest rates, high construction costs, expensive insurance premiums, and flattening rents.Low-income renters are the hardest hit. No state in the country has sufficient affordable housing — there are fewer than four affordable apartments available for every 10 very low-income tenants, the National Low Income Housing Coalition reported recently.Story continuesMiami has the most competitive rental housing market in the country, the report found. More Miami renters — 14 — compete for a single apartment, on average, than anywhere else in the country. Just 3.5% of Miami's rental apartments were vacant early this year — far below the five to eight percent vacancy rate that's considered healthy.Meanwhile, the Midwest has become the most competitive region in the country over the last year, as people move to the region in part for slightly more affordable homes. Seven midwestern cities are among the top 20 most competitive markets in the US. Milwaukee is now the second-hottest market in the US after Miami and ahead of North Jersey and suburban Chicago.College towns — led by Fayetteville, where the University of Arkansas is attracting a growing student body — are also feeling the crunch.Read the original article on Business Insider"
