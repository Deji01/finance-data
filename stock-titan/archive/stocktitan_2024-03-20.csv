Negative Non-cash foreign exchange loss of over US$7 million in Q4 due to USD depreciation. Negative impact on non-GAAP net income in Q4 from foreign exchange loss. Dependence on markets outside Chinese mainland poses currency exchange risks. Competition in the fintech brokerage industry may pose challenges to market share growth. Potential regulatory changes in various markets could affect trading services and offerings. Financial Analyst The unaudited financial results released by UP Fintech Holding Limited exhibit a substantial year-over-year revenue growth of 20.9%, culminating in a total revenue of US$272.5 million for the year 2023. Despite the non-cash foreign exchange loss due to the depreciation of the US dollar, the non-GAAP net income has impressively increased to 3.4 times that of the previous year. This suggests a strong underlying financial performance, which is further underscored by the significant growth in new global account holders and funded accounts, indicating an expanding customer base.The company's strategic focus on globalization has evidently paid off, with the majority of total client assets now sourced from markets outside the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. This diversification of revenue streams may reduce geographical risk and potentially lead to more stable future earnings. The growth in total trading volume and net asset inflow from both individual and institutional clients could be indicative of UP Fintech's increasing market penetration and customer trust. However, investors should consider the scalability of such growth and the potential for increased competition in the brokerage industry which could pressure margins and market share. Market Research Analyst UP Fintech's strategic expansion into the Southeast Asian and institutional markets has been met with tangible success, with a notable 118.5% year-over-year increase in total client assets. The company's focus on Singapore, evidenced by the high proportion of new funded clients from the region, aligns with the city-state's reputation as a burgeoning financial hub. This regional emphasis could be a strategic move to capitalize on the growing wealth management demands in Asia-Pacific.The introduction of new trading products, such as Bitcoin spot ETFs and obtaining a Type 1 License in Hong Kong for virtual asset trading services, reflects UP Fintech's agility in adapting to evolving market trends and regulatory landscapes. These developments could attract a broader range of investors and position the company favorably within the fintech brokerage space. However, the extension into cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets introduces new risk factors, including regulatory uncertainty and market volatility, which stakeholders should monitor closely. Legal Expert UP Fintech's compliance with regulatory requirements, as demonstrated by the acquisition of the Type 1 License in Hong Kong, is a critical factor for its operational legitimacy and expansion capabilities. This regulatory nod provides a gateway for the company to offer a wider array of services, particularly in the burgeoning virtual asset market. It's important to note that regulatory compliance is a dynamic and ongoing process and the company's ability to navigate this landscape will be important for sustaining its growth trajectory.Moreover, the company's engagement in underwriting activities for IPOs, particularly its leading role in Hong Kong and US listings, signifies its growing presence in investment banking. However, the regulatory scrutiny associated with such activities is high and any lapses could have significant reputational and financial implications. Continuous adherence to regulatory standards and proactive risk management will be essential for maintaining the company's growth and investor confidence. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 AM SINGAPORE and NEW YORK, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- UP Fintech Holding Limited (""UP Fintech"" or the ""Company"", Nasdaq: TIGR, and all its subsidiaries and consolidated entities), a leading online brokerage firm committed to redefining global investing through next-generation technologies, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter, the Company achieved a revenue of US$70 million. For the year ended 2023, total revenues increased 20.9% year-over-year to US$272.5 million. Due to the depreciation of the US dollar in the fourth quarter, resulting in a non-cash foreign exchange loss of over US$7 million, the non-GAAP net income for the quarter amounted to US$1.1 million. For the entire year, the non-GAAP net income totaled US$42.7 million, which is 3.4 times that of 2022. During the fourth quarter, UP Fintech added 47,797 new global account holders, marking a 65.9% increase quarter-over-quarter and bringing the global total to 2.2 million, up 9.3% year-over-year.

The Company's total trading volume reached $81.8 billion during the period. With a strong brand presence in Southeast Asia and an expanding institutional business footprint, net asset inflow from both individual and institutional clients amounted to US$8.2 billion during the quarter, maintaining robust momentum. This drove a quarter-over-quarter increase of 62.1% and a year-over-year increase of 118.5% in total client assets, reaching US$30.6 billion. The retention rate of funded clients remained consistently high at 98%. Over 75% of Total Client Assets Came from Clients in Markets such as Singapore and the US Singapore Accounts for the Highest Proportion of Total Funded Clients Mr. Wu Tianhua, Founder and CEO of UP Fintech, commented, ""Over the past year, our robust globalization efforts have resulted in a doubling of our global client assets, reaching a historic high. Over 75% of our total client assets now come from clients beyond the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, including regions such as Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the US. Singapore's role as our group's headquarters has been further underscored: whether on a quarterly or annual basis, the proportion of new funded clients from Singapore has consistently been the highest. Currently, Singapore clients represent the largest share of our group's total funded clients, with over half of our monthly trading clients hailing from the Singapore market, making it the most active region among all markets. "" ""In 2024, as the Company celebrates its tenth anniversary and fifth year since going public, we reflect on the past five years of remarkable growth. Our global funded clients and assets have surged over tenfold, with revenue nearly quadrupling and net incomes compounding at a rate of 72%. Looking ahead, we are committed to furthering our globalization strategy, solidifying our market share in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong to emerge as a world-leading fintech brokerage. On the brokerage front, we'll expand our offerings and services to better cater to the diverse wealth management needs of both individual and institutional investors. For instance, in January of this year, we introduced trading for 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs, and concurrently, received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission for Tiger Hong Kong's Type 1 License uplift, enabling us to offer virtual asset trading services to local professional investors, facilitating seamless one-stop asset allocation across stocks, options, futures, and cryptocurrencies. On the institutional side, leveraging our swift account opening process, multi-asset trading capabilities, rapid response times, and customizable solutions, along with our self-developed multi-management platform, we look forward to assisting more institutional clients in enhancing their operational efficiency.""

In Singapore, the average net asset inflow per new funded client reached over US$16,000 during the period, marking a historic high. Tiger Trade remains a top choice for Singapore residents, with approximately one in three using the platform*. Tiger Trade has also gradually become the preferred platform for more local clients to trade a diverse range of products.

In 2023, the Company was once again honored with the ""Best Retail Broker"" award by the Singapore Securities Investors Association. In addition to its robust retail operations, the Company also launched a one-stop wealth management solution for major financial advisory firms and wealth management entities in Singapore. Addressing the industry's current pain points such as complex client onboarding requirements, cumbersome account opening processes, limited trading options, and low transaction settlement efficiency, the Company introduced its next-generation Turnkey Asset Management Platform (TAMP). This platform offers flexible account structures, fully online account opening, multi-market and multi-asset trading, extensive analysis and trading tools, and diversified reporting. It is also supported by a team with rich experience in business and services.

The opportunities are limitless, and Cosmo is best positioned to exploit them”. Alessandro Della Chà, Chief Executive Officer, said: “2023 has delivered beyond our expectations, with the final rush to close the Medtronic deal. The subsequent proceeds enable Cosmo to further develop and accelerate the many incoming opportunities both in pharma and AI. We are not short of exciting new ideas for the future, which we intend to relentlessly deliver”. 2024 Guidance Total revenues in the range of € 260 million - € 270 million (including a €100 million upfront payment from expansion of the agreement with Medtronic announced December 2023) versus € 96.7 million in 2023 Operating profit in the range of € 155 million - € 165 million versus € 12.2 million in 2023 Outlook 2025 Total revenues expected in the range of € 240m - € 260m Accounting matters under finalisation On the 6th of December 2023 Cosmo executed an agreement with certain former Linkverse shareholders (the “New Linkverse Agreement”) which amended certain of the provisions of an agreement entered into with the former Linkverse shareholders in 2019 (the “Old Linkverse Agreement”). The effectiveness of the New Linkverse Agreement was contingent on the effectiveness of a new agreement between Cosmo and Medtronic. Cosmo executed a new agreement with Medtronic on the 8th of December 2023 (the “New Medtronic Agreement”), this agreement was subject to certain closing conditions which were fulfilled on the 20th of February 2024 and the New Medtronic Agreement became effective on the 21st of February 2024. The terms of the New Linkverse Agreement which replaced certain terms of the Old Linkverse Agreement, therefore, also became enforceable on the 21st of February 2024. The New Linkverse Agreement amends the deferred consideration for the purchase of the non-controlling interest of Linkverse S.r.l. contained in the Old Linkverse Agreement and provides for a payment of €9.0m contingent upon payments from Medtronic. As the New Medtronic Agreement became effective in 2024 and, as a consequence, the New Linkverse Agreement also became effective and enforceable in 2024, Cosmo is of the opinion that any liabilities associated with the New Linkverse Agreement should be accounted in for 2024, when it became enforceable and in line with the accounting treatment of the New Medtronic Agreement. Furthermore, the New Linkverse Agreement provides for the grant of share options to certain former Linkverse shareholders in their capacity as employees of Cosmo. Also in this case, Cosmo is of the opinion that these new options should be accounted for only in 2024 as the New Linkverse Agreement only became enforceable in 2024. The accounting impact of this matter could be up to €3.5m. Cosmo is of the opinion that any different accounting treatment, other than as described above, would not result in a true and fair representation of Cosmo’s 2023 financial performance or position.

Financial services sector lags in addressing reputationally-damaging breaches. Single provider security solutions and AI touted as potential solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The survey results indicating a widespread recognition of the cybersecurity risks associated with APIs, yet a notable lack of investment in advanced security measures, underscores a significant disconnect within organizational priorities. It is evident that while decision-makers are aware of the potential threats, the allocation of resources does not align with the perceived risk. This could be due to a variety of factors, including budget constraints and a shortage of specialized knowledge in the field of cybersecurity.The acknowledgment that 95% of respondents have experienced API security problems within the last year is a concerning statistic. This high incidence rate highlights the critical need for organizations to reassess their cybersecurity strategies and invest in robust API security to safeguard against account takeover attacks which could lead to operational disruptions and severe reputational damage. The delay in the rollout or integration of new applications due to security concerns further emphasizes the operational impact of inadequate API security measures. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the survey results may raise red flags for investors in companies within the cybersecurity sector, as well as those in industries heavily reliant on APIs. The reported lack of action on API security could indicate a potential risk for future financial losses due to cyberattacks. This is particularly pertinent for the financial services sector, which the survey suggests is lagging in urgency to address these risks.Investors might consider the long-term implications of cybersecurity on a company's financial health. Companies that proactively address API security concerns could mitigate the risk of costly breaches and the associated fallout, which can include regulatory fines, legal fees and loss of customer trust. Conversely, companies that fail to invest in adequate security measures may face significant financial and reputational repercussions, which could negatively impact their stock performance. Risk Management Consultant From a risk management standpoint, the survey's insights point to a troubling trend where the recognition of risk does not translate into proactive measures to mitigate it. The reasons cited, such as 'insufficient budget' and a 'lack of expertise', suggest that organizations may be underestimating the potential cost of API-related cyber incidents. A comprehensive risk assessment should factor in not only the probability of cyberattacks but also the potential severity of their impact.Organizations should consider the integration of single provider security solutions and AI as a means to streamline and enhance their cybersecurity posture. The adoption of such technologies could provide a more efficient and cost-effective approach to API security, potentially overcoming the budget and expertise hurdles that currently impede action. 03/20/2024 - 03:00 AM Fastly survey reveals that 9 out of 10 decision-makers know that APIs are a trojan horse for cyber-attacks - but most don’t invest in advanced security UK is marginally ahead of the pack - but financial services sector shows a lack of urgency over the risk of reputationally-damaging cyber breaches Single provider security solutions and AI could provide answers LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A recent survey of 235 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers commissioned by Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY), one of the world’s fastest edge cloud platforms, has found that - despite the critical role of APIs - the vast majority of commercial decision-makers are ignoring the burgeoning security risk for businesses. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have long been recognised as a bedrock of the digital economy and recent figures suggest that the majority of all internet traffic is now directed via APIs. Lack of advanced API security endemic The ubiquity of APIs means they have become one of cybercriminals’ favourite gateways for account takeover attacks. In a recent survey by Fastly, 84% of respondents admitted to not having advanced API security in place. The lack of action on API breaches comes despite the vast majority of decision-makers knowing there is a problem. 95% of respondents surveyed by Fastly said they had experienced API security problems in the last twelve months. Over three quarters (79%) had delayed the rollout or integration of a new application due to API security concerns. In addition, 79% claim to place a ‘high or very high’ level of importance on API security. Asked why none of this has translated into action, ‘insufficient budget’ and a ‘lack of expertise’ were the most commonly stated reasons. Risk of operational and reputational damage Jay Coley, Senior Security Architect at Fastly, said: “The results of our survey show that decision-makers know that increased reliance on APIs creates a risk of serious cyberattacks. But so far they are not doing enough about it. This is surprising given that the operational and reputational cost of a breach far outweighs the price of deploying a consolidated web application and API security solution from a single provider.” Key areas of concern Asked which attributes of an API security platform would be the most important to their company, respondents said number one would be identifying which APIs expose personal or sensitive data (43%). Other top concerns included identifying all APIs, including those that are undocumented (40%) and logging and monitoring (28%). However, companies are increasingly struggling to identify API attacks because of the sheer volume of notifications that they receive using legacy security solutions. In Fastly’s experience, credential stuffing, business logic abuse, and DDoS attacks are just a few of the malicious automated bot attacks that are being deployed to take over accounts and perpetrate identity theft and fraud. Readily available scripts and tools make orchestrating API attacks easier than ever, and legacy bot defence techniques struggle to detect these potentially devastating incursions. AI security solutions untapped – but coming One solution to the complexity of the API landscape could be a new generation of AI-powered cybersecurity systems, but Fastly found there is currently little enthusiasm for this. Only 14% of companies surveyed regarded the use of AI technologies in API security as a priority. That said, 58% anticipate that generative AI will have a ‘large or very large’ impact on API security over a window of approximately 2-3 years. Sector-based and regional variations One concerning aspect of Fastly’s survey is that heavily-regulated sectors dealing with sensitive data are some of the worst culprits when it comes to API inaction. Only 80% of respondents in financial services placed a high or very high level of importance on API security. This compares with 89% in wholesale, retail and e-commerce. In terms of regional variations, the importance of API security was rated highly in the UK (86%) compared to a cross-border average of 79%. Zombie APIs and data scraping were cited by UK firms as priorities. Despite this, there was still a tendency in the UK not to translate thoughts into actions. “79% of UK participants said their API security was not advanced,” notes Coley, “compared with 84% across the board. This represents a huge target for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals to aim at.” One intriguing insight is the gulf in attitudes within company hierarchies. 91% of C-suite and compliance experts place ‘a high or very high’ level of importance on API security but only 74% of in-house security specialists feel the same way. The implication, perhaps, is that the security cohort is underestimating the scale of the threat – either that or they are exposed to a wider pool of threats on a day to day basis.

This move was made in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting in May 2023.","InterContinental Hotels Group PLC Announces Transaction in Own Shares - March 20 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary InterContinental Hotels Group PLC announces the purchase of its own shares through Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange. The Company bought 9,990 ordinary shares at an average price of £80.7375 per share and intends to cancel them. This move was made in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting in May 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent share repurchase by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC represents a strategic move that can have various implications for the company's market valuation and investor sentiment. Share buybacks often signal the management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company can potentially increase earnings per share (EPS), which is a key metric for assessing a company's profitability. This can lead to a positive re-rating of the stock by the market, as the perceived value of each share may increase.However, it is essential to scrutinize the context in which the buyback is taking place. The timing and price range of the repurchased shares, as well as the company's current financial position, should be evaluated. In this case, the repurchase was conducted through a reputable investment firm, Goldman Sachs International and within a narrow price range, which could indicate a well-executed transaction. Nonetheless, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such buybacks, as the funds used could have been allocated to other value-creating initiatives such as expansion or debt reduction. Financial Analyst The disclosed transaction details indicate a well-planned execution of the share buyback program. The average price paid per share, alongside the highest and lowest prices, provides transparency and allows for an analysis of the repurchase's effectiveness relative to market conditions. The cancellation of the purchased shares will reduce share dilution and could lead to a more favorable perception of the stock among investors.It's also worth noting the impact of share buybacks on the company's balance sheet. The capital used for repurchasing shares is an application of cash and will affect the company's cash reserves. This action must be weighed against the potential benefits of improved financial ratios and shareholder value. Investors should monitor the subsequent financial statements to assess the long-term impact of this buyback on the company's financial health, especially in the context of the hospitality industry's recovery from any economic downturns or global events. Corporate Governance Expert From a corporate governance perspective, it's important to consider the authorization of the share repurchase program by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. This reflects a level of transparency and adherence to corporate governance norms, as shareholders were informed and had a say in the decision. The repurchase aligns with the broader trend of companies utilizing buybacks as a method to return value to shareholders.However, one should also consider the potential impact on corporate control. As shares are repurchased and canceled, the ownership structure of the company may shift, possibly leading to a concentration of voting power among remaining shareholders. This can have both positive and negative implications for shareholder influence and control over corporate decisions. It is essential for investors to understand these dynamics and how they might affect the company's strategic direction and governance practices in the long run. 03/20/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / The Company announces that on 19 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech was US$1.8 million in Q4, compared to a net income of US$1.2 million in the same quarter of last year. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from UP Fintech Holding Limited display a notable growth trajectory in terms of revenue and net income, which is indicative of the company's successful expansion and operational strategy. The 20.9% increase in annual revenue and a significant shift from a net loss in 2022 to a net income in 2023 highlight the firm's improved profitability. Additionally, the expansion of services, such as the introduction of the Combo Option Strategy and the Fixed Coupon Notes, demonstrates a diversification in product offerings that could potentially attract a broader client base.However, a decrease in the fourth-quarter non-GAAP net income year over year raises questions about the sustainability of the company's earnings, potentially signaling a need for a deeper analysis of the underlying factors affecting profitability. The reduction in marketing expenses may reflect a strategic pivot or a response to market conditions. The increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates is concerning and warrants monitoring as it may impact future profitability. Market Research Analyst UP Fintech's aggressive customer acquisition strategy, as evidenced by the substantial increase in new funded accounts, is a clear indicator of market penetration and growth potential in the Southeast Asian regions. The reduction in the average customer acquisition cost (CAC) to US$150, coupled with the high growth in new funded accounts, suggests an efficient capital allocation towards customer acquisition and retention.The firm's ability to underwrite a significant number of U.S. and Hong Kong IPOs also positions it favorably within the investment banking sector, potentially leading to increased revenue streams from underwriting fees and strengthened industry relationships. The increase in total account balance by 118.5% year over year showcases the company's capacity to attract and retain assets under management, which is a critical metric for the sustainability and growth of a brokerage firm. Regulatory Compliance Expert The uplift of UP Fintech's Type 1 License by the Hong Kong SFC, allowing the firm to offer Virtual Asset dealing services to Professional Investors, is a significant regulatory milestone. This not only positions the company at the forefront of the digital asset space but also opens up new revenue streams and client segments. It is important to note that operating in this innovative yet heavily scrutinized sector requires stringent compliance measures.The company must navigate the complex regulatory landscape and maintain high standards of compliance to mitigate risks associated with virtual asset services. This development could potentially attract a niche market of professional investors interested in digital assets, thereby diversifying the company's client base and enhancing its competitive edge in the fintech sector. 03/20/2024 - 04:00 AM SINGAPORE, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UP Fintech Holding Limited (NASDAQ: TIGR) (“UP Fintech” or the “Company”), a leading online brokerage firm focusing on global investors, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Mr. Wu Tianhua, Chairman and CEO of UP Fintech stated: “In 2023, our topline mix benefited from our strategy execution on internationalization and the high interest rate environment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was US$70.0 million, representing a 9.6% increase compared to the same quarter of last year. The full year total revenue amounted to US$272.5 million, a 20.9% increase from 2022. In 2023, we saw significant improvement in bottom line. Full year net income attributable to UP Fintech reached US$32.6 million, compared to a net loss of US$2.2 million in 2022. Our non-GAAP full-year net income attributable to UP Fintech was US$42.7 million, approximately 3.4 times the non-GAAP full-year net income of 2022. In the fourth quarter, we added 39,034 new funded accounts, an increase of 58.6% quarter over quarter and 42.8% year over year, bringing our yearly total to 123,110, exceeding our yearly guidance of 100,000. The total number of funded accounts at the end of 2023 reached 904,600, a 15.8% increase compared to 2022 year-end. By leveraging our strong presence in the Singapore retail market and exploring online customer acquisition initiatives in the Southeast Asian regions, we achieved high growth in new funded accounts this quarter while further reducing the average customer acquisition cost (“CAC”) to US$150. Furthermore, we saw record US$8.2 billion net asset inflow this quarter, combined with US$3.5 billion mark to market gain, total account balance rose 62.1% quarter over quarter and 118.5% year over year to US$30.6 billion by the end of 2023. The record net asset inflow this quarter was primarily due to our continuous effort to serve and acquire more institutional investors. We continued to add new products on our platform to enhance user experience, which we believe is key to our long-term success. In the fourth quarter, we introduced the Combo Option Strategy feature, allowing users to execute multi-leg options trades using net margin calculation. Additionally, we launched the Fixed Coupon Notes (“FCNs”) product, offering professional investors a more diversified wealth management experience. Furthermore, in January of 2024, Hong Kong SFC uplifted our Type 1 License, now we can offer Virtual Asset dealing services to Professional Investors. This positions us as one of the first mainstream online brokerage firms in Hong Kong to receive approval for such a license upgrade. In our Corporate business, we underwrote a total of 9 U.S. and Hong Kong IPOs in the fourth quarter, including “Shiyue Daotian Group” and “J&T Express”, bringing the total number of U.S. and Hong Kong IPOs underwritten for the year to 28.

Additionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at https://ir.itigerup.com Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating our business, we consider and use non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech and non-GAAP net loss or income per ADS - diluted as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). We define non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech as net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech excluding share-based compensation and impairment loss from long-term investments. Non-GAAP net loss or income per ADS - diluted is non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech divided by the weighted average number of diluted ADSs. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation and impairment loss from long-term investments. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations. Share-based compensation and impairment loss from long-term investments have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to total operating expenses, net loss or income attributable to ordinary shareholders of UP Fintech or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review these historical non-GAAP financial measures in light of the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing our data comparatively. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The redemption of the €1,500,000,000 Undated Non-Call 5.0 Year Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate Resettable Notes by TotalEnergies SE signifies a strategic financial decision which could impact the company's debt structure and interest payment obligations. By redeeming these notes, the company is choosing to pay back its creditors on the specified Redemption Date, which is a move that could potentially improve its creditworthiness and debt-to-equity ratio. This action suggests that TotalEnergies SE is in a position to manage its long-term liabilities, possibly indicating a strong balance sheet or cash position.Investors and analysts often view such redemptions positively, as they can lead to reduced financial leverage and interest expenses, which in turn could enhance net income and earnings per share over time. However, it is also important to consider the source of funds for this redemption. If the company is using its operational cash flow, it reflects financial strength, but if it's raising new debt at potentially higher interest rates to redeem these notes, it could be less favorable.The market's response to this news will depend on the perceived rationale behind the redemption and the company's current financial health. For stakeholders, the key takeaway is to monitor TotalEnergies SE's future interest expenses and leverage metrics as they will be directly affected by this redemption. Debt Market Analyst The notice from TotalEnergies SE regarding the redemption of deeply subordinated notes is significant for the debt market, particularly for those specializing in corporate bonds. Deeply subordinated debt is often considered higher risk compared to senior debt, as it is lower in the repayment hierarchy in the event of liquidation. The redemption of such notes is a signal of a company's liquidity and its strategic prioritization of debt management.The fixed rate resettable feature of these notes is also of interest, as it suggests that the initial interest rate was set for a period of five years, after which it would be reset.

Announces Agreements to Sell Two MR Product Tankers Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Scorpio Tankers Inc. announced the sale of two 2013 built MR product tankers for $36.15 million each, with no debt repayments. The vessels are unencumbered, and the sales are set to close in the first half of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of the MR product tankers by Scorpio Tankers represents a strategic asset liquidation, which could signal a shift in capital allocation or a move to optimize the company's fleet in response to market conditions. With the vessels being unencumbered, the entirety of the $72.3 million from the sales flows directly into corporate coffers, potentially bolstering the balance sheet. This influx of capital might be allocated towards debt reduction, fleet modernization, or returned to shareholders through dividends or buybacks, each scenario having different implications for shareholder value.Investors should consider the implications of these sales on the company's operational capacity. The removal of two tankers may affect revenue streams, although this could be offset if the market for tanker charters is currently depressed or if the vessels were operating at a disadvantage compared to newer or more efficient ships. Furthermore, the age of the vessels, at 11 years, suggests a possible strategy of selling assets as they reach a certain point in their depreciation curve, which could be a prudent move to avoid escalating maintenance costs and potential declines in resale value. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the sale price of $36.15 million per vessel could provide insights into the current demand and valuation for MR product tankers. This price point may reflect industry trends and the health of the secondary market for such assets. Stakeholders should compare this transaction to recent sales of similar vessels to gauge whether Scorpio Tankers secured a favorable deal.Additionally, the decision not to repay debt with the proceeds suggests confidence in the company's liquidity and financial strategy. However, it's important to monitor how the market reacts to these sales, as it could influence the stock's performance depending on whether investors interpret the move as a positive restructuring effort or a sign of distress. The timing of the closure of these sales, slated for the first half of 2024, will also be key in understanding the immediate financial impact on the company's quarterly results. 03/20/2024 - 01:00 AM MONACO, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpio Tankers Inc.

GMJ dominates the Bhojpuri, Kannada, Gujarati, Haryanvi, and Oriya language markets, with exponential growth in the latter two. Warner Music now holds a significant presence in central Indian music, aiming to support artists and connect with fans globally. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic investment of Warner Music India into Global Music Junction (GMJ) signifies a robust move into the Indian local language market. This is particularly notable given the impressive metrics GMJ boasts, such as its reach of over 250 million subscribers and the delivery of 100 billion minutes of entertainment annually. The partnership leverages GMJ's strong presence in regional markets and Warner Music's global expertise, potentially creating a synergy that could lead to increased market share and revenue growth for Warner Music in one of the world's fastest-growing entertainment markets.From a market research perspective, the focus on local languages like Bhojpuri, which is rapidly growing, suggests a targeted strategy to capture niche markets that are experiencing a surge in content consumption. This could set a precedent for other global music entities looking to penetrate regional markets by partnering with local players. The long-term implications may include greater diversification of Warner Music's portfolio and a more resilient position against market fluctuations in other regions. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Warner Music India's investment and board seat in GMJ are multifaceted. Initially, the capital infusion might reflect on Warner Music's balance sheet as an increase in long-term investments. However, the strategic nature of the investment implies a potential for revenue growth from a market with high engagement rates—as evidenced by GMJ's substantial content consumption figures. The association with high-profile regional artists and content that has shown viral potential, like Sapna Choudhary's 'Jale 2', indicates a potential for significant return on investment through both streaming revenue and associated marketing opportunities.Furthermore, the investment in GMJ aligns with Warner Music's global expansion strategy, which could lead to improved investor confidence and possibly a positive impact on stock valuation. The key will be to monitor how effectively Warner Music leverages GMJ's regional dominance to scale operations and whether this translates into tangible financial results in subsequent quarters. Entertainment Industry Analyst The collaboration between Warner Music India and Global Music Junction underscores a significant trend in the global music industry: the localization of content. By gaining a foothold in markets that are culturally rich and linguistically diverse, Warner Music is positioning itself to tap into the burgeoning demand for local content. The entertainment industry has seen a shift towards regionalization, where local tastes and languages drive content creation and distribution.The strategic investment in GMJ not only provides Warner Music with a competitive advantage in the Indian music industry but also serves as a case study for content localization strategies. The success of this partnership could influence how other global entertainment companies approach emerging markets, emphasizing the importance of local partnerships and the adaptation of business models to cater to regional preferences. 03/20/2024 - 12:30 AM Agreement makes Warner Music India the largest player in the Indian local language market MUMBAI, India, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Warner Music India has expanded its partnership with Global Music Junction (GMJ), the music and entertainment subsidiary of JetSynthesys. The companies struck a distribution deal in 2021, but this new agreement sees Warner Music make a strategic investment in GMJ, giving it a seat on the board. The move will establish Warner Music India as the largest player in the central Indian music market. GMJ is the dominant force in the Bhojpuri, Kannada, Gujarati, Haryanvi and Oriya languages markets, recently achieving exponential growth in the latter two. Bhojpuri is the fastest-growing language in India, and this move makes Warner Music the largest player in its music market. GMJ is committed to empower artists and labels through services including content creation, events management, innovative distribution, marketing solutions, technical analytics, and legal expertise. The company has built an ecosystem that involves more than 100 partners, over 250 million subscribers, serving up more than 100 billion minutes of entertainment annually in more than 130,000 pieces of audiovisual music content. Its partners include renowned figures such as Khesari lal Yadav, Pawan Singh, Renuka, and Sapna Chaudhary, along with legends from the industry such as Salim, Shaan, and Sulaiman. GMJ also collaborates with training and production partners such as the top online music learning platform Artium Academy; Rajasthani-based movie production company Hariprem Films; and the Indian Film Academy, a prestigious acting institute. In the recent past, GMJ has achieved significant milestones with its content such as ""Jale 2"", by Haryanvi superstar Sapna Choudhary, becoming one of the fastest music videos to reach more than 300 million views on YouTube and more than 15 million Instagram Reels in India in 90 days. The video for ""Sent Gamkauwa"" by Shivani Singh accumulated more than 700 million YouTube views in just six months. Alfonso Perez Soto, President, Emerging Markets, Warner Music, says: ""This is a significant milestone in the expansion of our presence across India. Working with the amazing team at GMJ last year not only strengthened our partnership, but enabled us to better support artists from the central regions of India, bringing them the best artistic support that any company can provide, and helping them connect with fans across the country and around the world. India is one of the most exciting music markets in the world and with GMJ as a partner we're right at the heart of it."" Rajan Navani, CEO and founder of JetSynthesys, adds: ""Our journey with Warner Music has been remarkable, highlighted by some successful collaborations. The indigenous languages in which we operate, such as the Bhojpuri, Haryanvi, Oriya, Kannada and Gujarati markets in India, have seen incredible growth in the recent past. Warner Music's investment in Global Music Junction and its continued collaboration with us will fast track the increasing expansion of India's regional music industry. With our combined collective vision and understanding of audience preferences, we aim to strengthen the ecosystem by meeting the growing fan demand in the music and entertainment space. We are looking forward to more successful outcomes from our longstanding collaboration."" Jay Mehta, Managing Director of Warner Music India, adds: ""Our partnership continues to have a significant presence in the places in the Indian market which are growing most rapidly, and so enables us to be the fastest expanding music company. GMJ is a leading player in five language markets in central India and works with some of the biggest names in Indian music and showbusiness. This is a critical moment in our expansion across the country as we seek to position Warner Music India as the number one choice for all discerning artists and labels."" Rajkumar Singh, CEO, Global Music Junction, comments: ""GMJ is committed to pioneering innovative marketing strategies, fostering creativity, and elevating the digital music landscape across India. Our expanded partnership with Warner Music will help us fulfil our vision of becoming the foremost digital entertainment company in the country, while nurturing the next generation of talent. We will continue to enable our partners to focus on their artistic endeavours, while we manage their digital properties to engage users effectively.""

(TSXV: GEL) (OTCQB: GELEF) (FSE: 97G0)(""Graphano"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report initial assay results from the 2023-24 winter drilling program at its 100% owned Lac Aux Bouleaux (""LAB"") Graphite Property that is situated adjacent to Canada's only producing graphite mine in Québec, the Lac des Iles Mine.The drilling program consisted of 13 drill holes totaling 1,034 metres. The four holes reported in this update were drilled as infill holes to confirm the historically defined graphite mineralization at the Pit Zone. The remaining drill program focused on graphite zone expansion, following up the new discovery of Zone 3 in early 2023 (see news release dated February 8, 2023). Pit Zone and Zone 3 are two of the eight prospective targets which have been defined on the LAB Property to date.Luisa Moreno, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented: ""The LAB Pit Zone holds significant potential, and once fully assessed, it could play a key role in our expedited approach to bringing the LAB project to production. We are excited to validate past findings and explore opportunities for growth.""Key Highlights from the LAB Pit Zone (See Full Results in Table 1)The drilling has verified grade and spatial characteristics of graphite mineralization defined by historical drilling and correlates well with the 3D geological model being developed for ongoing Mineral Resource estimation work;Multiple graphite horizons are present. The mineralization remains open primarily to the north and east for expansion;Drill Hole LB23-59 intersected 8.26% graphitic carbon (Cg) over 4.80 metres (m) starting at 41.18m drilled depth;Drill Hole LB23-58 intersected 5.89% Cg over 5.89m starting at 92.47m drilled depth; andDrill Hole LB23-56 intersected 6.91% Cg over 4.65m starting at 71.3m drilled depth.(Note: All intersections reported are based on core length and true width is approximately 85% of the core length.)The four holes totaling 360m completed on the Pit Zone were drilled to support and validate the interpretations forming the current 3D geological solid model being utilized for ongoing Mineral Resource estimation work. The current drilling intersected stratigraphy and mineralization as expected. The graphite mineralization in the Pit Zone area occurs as multiple horizons, which remain open primarily to the North and East for expansion. Assay results from the four holes are presented in Table 1 and drill hole locations in Figure 1. Further assay results are expected to be released from the LAB Zone 3 drilling in the coming weeks.Table 1 - Drill Hole Results LAB Graphite Project PIT ZONE - Exploration Drill Results Hole No. Azimuth Dip Easting Northing From (m) To (m) Thickness(m) A1 % Cg Thickness(m) A1 x %Cg LB23-56 187 -50 458207 5133996 71.30 75.95 4.65 6.91 32 LB23-57 100 -60 458114 5133981 50 53.2 3.20 3.04 10 LB23-58 240 -60 458285 5133965 92.47 98.36 5.89 5.89 35 LB23-59 270 -66 458301 5133815 41.18 45.98 4.80 8.26 40 Notes: A1 Intervals are core length.

(SMCI) announces the pricing of a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at $875.00 per share, with potential gross proceeds of $1.75 billion. The underwriter has an option to purchase an additional 300,000 shares. The offering is anticipated to close soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Super Micro Computer's public offering of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share is a significant event for the company and its investors. This pricing situates the offering at an approximate gross of $1.75 billion, a substantial raise for the company. The market will closely monitor how these funds are intended to be used, as the deployment of such capital can greatly influence the company's strategic direction.Investors will assess the offer's fairness by comparing the offering price to current market valuations and historical pricing. A share price set above the current trading range could indicate strong investor confidence, while a price below could suggest a need for the company to incentivize purchase. Additionally, the option for underwriters to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares provides a buffer that could stabilize the stock price post-offering or generate further capital if exercised. Market Research Analyst Supermicro's decision to issue new shares can be seen as a strategic move to capitalize on its market position and current stock performance. The proceeds from such a sizable offering could be earmarked for various growth initiatives, such as research and development, expansion into new markets, or strategic acquisitions. It's important for stakeholders to consider the potential dilutive effect of this offering on current shareholders, as the introduction of additional shares can reduce earnings per share and potentially impact stock price.Furthermore, the timing of the offering is crucial. If the tech sector is experiencing bullish sentiment, the company might benefit from higher demand for its shares. Conversely, a bearish outlook could pose challenges in achieving the desired capital raise. Market reception to similar past events and the company's historical performance in managing raised funds will also play a role in investor sentiment. Economist From an economic perspective, the scale of Supermicro's offering can have a ripple effect on the technology sector and broader stock market. A successful capital raise of this magnitude signals investor confidence not only in Supermicro but also in the tech industry's growth prospects. However, it is essential to consider the macroeconomic context, such as interest rates and economic growth forecasts, as these factors influence the cost of capital and investor appetite for equity offerings.The offering's impact on Supermicro's financial leverage and credit ratings should also be scrutinized. A company's decision to raise equity rather than debt can be viewed favorably as it avoids increasing interest obligations and can lead to a stronger balance sheet. Nonetheless, the long-term value creation of this capital infusion will ultimately depend on the efficiency and effectiveness of its utilization by the company's management. 03/19/2024 - 11:44 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (“Supermicro” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SMCI) , today announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $875.00 per share.

Positive The company raised $5.9 million in funding in 2023 to strengthen its balance sheet CEO Peter Holst outlined a growth strategy focusing on organic expansion and seeking inorganic growth through partnerships or acquisitions The company is exploring strategic alternatives such as business combinations, reverse mergers, or a sale Q4 2023 financial results show $6.0 million in cash, $0.9 million revenue, a net loss of $1.2 million, and an AEBITDA loss of $0.9 million Negative Total revenue decreased from $1.4 million in Q4 2022 to $0.9 million in Q4 2023 The company reported a net loss of $1.2 million in Q4 2023, the same as in Q4 2022 AEBITDA loss was $0.9 million in Q4 2023, compared to $1.2 million in Q4 2022 Market Research Analyst The financial results reported by Oblong, Inc. reflect a contraction in total revenue year-over-year, from $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $0.9 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease is a significant indicator of the company's performance and could influence investor sentiment. The consistency of the net loss at $1.2 million across both quarters suggests that while the company's revenue streams have diminished, its cost structure may have seen parallel reductions, possibly due to the operational optimization mentioned. However, the reduction in Adjusted EBITDA loss from $1.2 million to $0.9 million indicates an improvement in operational efficiency despite the drop in revenue.From a market expansion perspective, the CEO's statement on exploring strategic alternatives, including acquisitions or mergers, indicates a proactive approach towards growth. This could be appealing to investors looking for companies with a clear strategy for market expansion. The focus on early-stage technology ventures aligns with the current market trend of investing in innovative startups with high growth potential. However, the success of such a strategy is contingent upon the company's ability to effectively integrate new acquisitions and realize synergies. Financial Analyst The raise of $5.9 million in funding in 2023, which is expected to provide liquidity through mid-2025, is a positive signal of investor confidence and financial stability. This financial cushion could give Oblong the flexibility to navigate market conditions and invest in strategic initiatives. However, it's important to note that while the current cash position of $6.0 million with no debt is a strong point, the company's ability to turn this liquidity into profitable growth is yet to be seen. Stakeholders should monitor the deployment of these funds, ensuring they are used to generate a return on investment.Given the current tech landscape's competitive nature, Oblong's strategic financing and lack of debt could provide it with an advantage over leveraged competitors, especially in a rising interest rate environment. However, the key will be how effectively the company can leverage its financial position to achieve the growth and scalability it aims for, without diluting shareholder value. Investment Analyst Oblong's strategic focus on early-stage technology companies for potential partnerships or acquisitions could be indicative of a high-risk, high-reward strategy. The pursuit of transformative technology aligns with the broader market interest in innovation-driven growth. However, the inherent risks associated with early-stage investments, such as the uncertainty of product viability and market acceptance, must be weighed against the potential long-term benefits. Investors should closely evaluate the company's criteria for selecting these ventures and the due diligence process to mitigate investment risks.The financial results, particularly the revenue decrease, could impact the stock performance in the short term as markets react to immediate financial health. Long-term implications will depend on the company's execution of its growth strategy and its ability to capitalize on the identified market opportunities. Investors should consider the balance between the potential for future growth and the current financial health of the company when making investment decisions. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oblong, Inc. (Nasdaq: OBLG) (“Oblong” or the “Company”), an innovator in collaboration solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, and provided updates on the Company’s business and strategy. During 2023, the Company diligently optimized its operations, streamlined expenditures, and strengthened Oblong’s balance sheet to position itself as a lean and agile innovator in the tech landscape. Oblong raised $5.9 million in funding in 2023 that we believe provides the Company with ample liquidity and a clear runway through mid-2025. This strategic financing underscores the confidence of Oblong’s investors in the Company’s vision and long-term strategy. ""Our strategy for growth and enhancing shareholder value is twofold. We aim to grow organically by expanding our market presence while actively seeking inorganic growth opportunities through strategic partnerships or acquisitions,"" said Peter Holst, CEO of Oblong. ""Our exploration of strategic alternatives is diverse, encompassing the consideration of a range of transformative actions. These include the possibility of a business combination; a reverse merger; or outright sale of the company. Each option is being carefully evaluated to ensure it aligns with our overarching goal of sustainable growth and value creation. Specifically, we are interested in early-stage technology companies creating transformative approaches to leveraging technology for the betterment of human life. These companies may complement our existing offerings but could also open new avenues for expansion by tapping into significant market opportunities. In our quest to find the right partners, we are particularly focused on ventures that have demonstrated their ability to innovate and capture early-stage interest of their target markets, indicating a clear path to scalability and a substantial market presence."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $6.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Total revenue was $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss of $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”) loss of $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to an AEBITDA loss of $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. AEBITDA loss is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for additional information regarding this non-GAAP financial measure, and “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation” for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net loss. Non-GAAP Financial Information Adjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”) loss, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net loss before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and expense, impairment charges, casualty loss, severance, income tax expense (benefit), and interest and other income, net. AEBITDA loss is not intended to replace operating loss, net loss, cash flow or other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rather, AEBITDA loss is an important measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company and to compare such performance between periods. AEBITDA loss as defined here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies. Therefore, AEBITDA loss should be considered in conjunction with net loss and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating loss or cash flow used in operating activities, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net loss, operating loss or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of net loss to AEBITDA loss is shown under “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation” later in this release. About Oblong, Inc.

Discloses Sources of Distribution – Section 19(a) Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Virtus Total Return Fund Inc. (NYSE: ZTR) announced a monthly distribution of $0.05 per share, payable on March 28, 2024, under its Managed Distribution Plan. Shareholders should be aware that the distribution may include a return of capital if income and gains are insufficient. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Virtus Total Return Fund Inc. about its monthly distribution of $0.05 per share is a direct indicator of the fund's current cash flow and financial strategy. The distribution is likely sourced from net investment income and realized capital gains, which reflects the fund’s performance. Investors often look for such distributions as a sign of a fund's ability to generate cash and return value.However, it's important to note that if the distributions exceed the fund's earnings, the excess could be a return of capital. This can be a red flag as it may indicate that the fund is not generating enough income and is instead returning investors' principal, which is not sustainable in the long run. This could potentially impact the fund's NAV (Net Asset Value) and might be seen as a negative by the market, potentially affecting the fund's stock price. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the nature of the distribution is essential. If the fund's distribution is indeed a return of capital, it might not be immediately taxable as income. Instead, it reduces the cost basis of the investment, which could have implications for capital gains tax when the shares are eventually sold. Investors should be aware of these nuances as they can significantly affect after-tax returns.Moreover, the Managed Distribution Plan indicates a strategy to provide shareholders with a predictable income stream. While this can be attractive, shareholders must understand the tax consequences of these distributions, as the character of the income—dividend, capital gain, or return of capital—can vary, influencing their tax liability. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtus Total Return Fund Inc. (NYSE: ZTR) previously announced the following monthly distribution on March 1, 2024: Amount of Distribution Ex-Date Record Date Payable Date $0.05 March 8, 2024 March 11, 2024 March 28, 2024 Under the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan, the Fund will seek to maintain a consistent distribution level that may be paid, in part or in full, from net investment income and realized capital gains, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if the Fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the Fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’.

The company completed significant contract awards, international deployments, and joint ventures, positioning for future growth. Positive None. Negative Significant increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023 due to non-cash stock-based compensation and other operating costs. Net loss of $77.4 million in 2023 compared to $42.1 million in 2022, driven by higher expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was negative ($10.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to negative ($8.5) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest expense increased to $23.2 million in 2023 from $20.0 million in 2022, impacting net loss. First quarter of every year typically shows negative Adjusted EBITDA for Bridger due to seasonality and working capital constraints. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Bridger Aerospace reveal a substantial increase in revenue, which surged 44% to $66.7 million in 2023 compared to the previous year. This growth is notable, especially considering it occurred during what was described as the slowest fire season in two decades. The company's strategic moves, such as securing a $60 million contract and expanding its Super Scooper fleet, indicate a strong position for future growth. However, the significant net loss of $77.4 million, up from $42.1 million the previous year, primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation, highlights the volatility and risks associated with the company's current growth strategy. Investors should be aware of the high selling, general and administrative expenses which have almost doubled, largely due to non-cash stock-based compensation. While this could be a strategic move to retain and motivate employees, it has a substantial impact on the net income. The guidance for 2024 suggests an optimistic outlook with an over 80% projected growth in adjusted EBITDA, yet it's important to monitor how the company manages its expenses and whether it can sustain revenue growth to support its ambitious targets. Market Research Analyst Bridger Aerospace's establishment of a Spanish subsidiary and the acquisition of additional Super Scoopers from the Spanish Government demonstrate a strategic expansion into international markets. The company's early deployment of Super Scoopers and surveillance aircraft to regions like Texas and Oklahoma could capitalize on the increasing demand for aerial firefighting services due to climate change-induced wildfires. Bridger's focus on a differentiated offering in the market with recent software and surveillance contracts could set it apart from competitors and provide a competitive edge. However, the company's performance must be contextualized within the broader industry trends. The aerial firefighting industry is subject to seasonality and environmental factors that can significantly impact revenue streams. Bridger's business model, relying on high fixed costs, requires consistent high utilization rates of its fleet to remain profitable. The company's ability to navigate these challenges while expanding its fleet and international presence will be critical to its long-term success. Environmental Economist Bridger Aerospace's performance reflects the growing importance of environmental services, such as aerial firefighting, in the context of global climate change. The company's record contract awards and international expansion indicate a rising demand for such services. However, the financial health of the company shows a mixed picture, with increased revenues but also heightened losses due to higher operating costs and significant non-cash stock-based compensation. From an environmental economics perspective, the investments in technology and fleet expansion could be seen as a proactive approach to address the expected increase in wildfire activity due to climate change. The company's readiness to deploy resources in anticipation of fire seasons could potentially lead to cost savings and efficiency gains in the long run. Nevertheless, the financial sustainability of these investments remains a concern, as the company must balance growth with profitability to ensure long-term viability in a market that is inherently unpredictable and dependent on external environmental factors. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM BELGRADE, Mont., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. (“Bridger”, “the Company” or “Bridger Aerospace”), (NASDAQ: BAER, BAERW), one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Company also reiterated its 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. Highlights: Record 2023 revenue of nearly $67 million despite slowest fire season in 20 yearsRecord contract awards in 2023 including a 5-year $60 million exclusive use fire surveillance and technology contract in support of the Department of InteriorFirst international deployment leads to the most territory covered in the history of the CompanyJoint Venture Partnership completed purchase of four Super Scoopers from the Spanish GovernmentEstablished Spanish subsidiary, Albacete Aero, to oversee the return to service of the four Spanish Scoopers and acquired a hangar in SpainRecent software and surveillance contracts ensure we will have a unique and differentiated offering in the marketplaceEarliest seasonal deployment of Super Scooper and surveillance aircraft to Texas and Oklahoma sets the company up for another record year of growthAdjusted EBITDA poised to grow over 80% in 2024 to between $35 million to $51 million, consistent with our previously issued 2024 guidance “Bridger accomplished a great deal in the fourth quarter including the contracted deployment of our Multi-Misson Aircraft and the completion of the purchase of four Super Scoopers from the Government of Spain through our externally financed Joint Venture Partnership,” commented Tim Sheehy, Bridger Aerospace’s Chief Executive Officer. “The Spanish transaction took multiple years to execute and positions the Company to meaningfully expand our Scooper fleet, providing growth for years to come. This fleet growth, a lean cost structure as well as the earliest deployment in the company’s history has us well positioned for 2024. With wildfires continuing to burn underneath the snow in Canada, and the wildfires in the Texas Panhandle being driven by arid conditions in the central United States; Bridger is monitoring conditions in North America and readying the balance of its fleet for service.” Full Year 2023 Results Revenue for 2023 grew 44% to $66.7 million compared to $46.4 million in 2022. After the later start to the 2023 U.S. wildfire season, fire activity increased in the third quarter in the U.S. driving record utilization of the Company’s growing Super Scooper fleet despite a shorter-than-average North American wildfire season. Cost of revenues increased 22% to $41.3 million in 2023 and was comprised of flight operations expenses of $24.4 million and maintenance expenses of $16.9 million. This compares to $33.9 million in 2022 which included $18.8 million of flight operations expenses and $15.1 million of maintenance expenses. The increase primarily relates to higher employee labor and depreciation expenses related to the two additional Super Scooper aircraft that were placed into service in September 2022 and February 2023, respectively. Gross margin increased to 38% in 2023 up from 27% in 2022 driven primarily by record utilization of the Company’s growing Super Scooper fleet in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $82.9 million in 2023, compared to $35.1 million in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to $45.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to management and employees in 2023. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to an increase in business development, insurance, professional services, and other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company in 2023 and impairment charges of $2.4 million associated with our plan to phase out our use of certain aging aircraft platforms in our aerial surveillance operations. The increase was partially offset by $10.1 million of transaction related bonuses for employees recorded in the third quarter of 2022 in connection with the business combination and preparation of becoming a public company. Interest expense for 2023 was $23.2 million compared to $20.0 million in 2022. The increase was driven by a full year of interest expense in 2023 related to the bonds issued in the third quarter of 2022. For 2023, Bridger reported a net loss of $77.4 million compared to a net loss of $42.1 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $18.7 million in 2023 compared to $3.7 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. We exclude from Adjusted EBITDA certain costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with GAAP, including stock-based compensation, business development and integration expenses, offering costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets and non-cash impairment charges, non-cash adjustments to the fair value of earnout consideration, non-cash adjustments to the fair value of Warrants issued in connection with the Reverse Recapitalization, loss on extinguishment of debt, and discretionary bonuses to employees and executives. Definitions and reconciliations of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are attached as Exhibit A to this release. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Revenue was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue is typically lower in the fourth quarter as Bridger schedules annual fleet maintenance activities after the U.S. wildfire season and, in preparation for, the following season. Cost of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.4 million and was comprised of flight operations expenses of $4.7 million and maintenance expenses of $3.7 million. This compares to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 which included $2.1 million of flight operations expenses and $3.2 million of maintenance expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by non-cash stock-based compensation related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to management and employees in 2023 as well as an increase in professional services, insurance and other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company in 2023. The increase was also partially due to non-cash impairment charges associated with our plan to phase out our use of certain aging aircraft platforms in our aerial surveillance operations. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.0 million compared to $7.0 million in the prior year period. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Bridger reported a net loss of $31.1 million compared to a net loss of $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was negative ($10.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to negative ($8.5) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Definitions and reconciliations of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are attached as Exhibit A to this release. Business Outlook Looking at Bridger’s standalone operations for the full year 2024 including our six Super Scoopers, Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to range from $35 million to $51 million on revenue of $70 million to $86 million. This guidance range is consistent with prior guidance issued in November 2023. This guidance includes the impact of recent reductions to the Company’s largely fixed cost structure and excludes any impact from the Spanish Super Scoopers acquired by the joint venture partnership between Marathon Asset Management LP, Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund, and Bridger Aerospace which are undergoing maintenance work in order to be returned to service. Given the Company’s largely fixed cost structure and seasonality of our business, Bridger typically generates positive Adjusted EBITDA in the second and third quarters each year, during the bulk of the wildfire season and negative Adjusted EBITDA in the first and fourth quarters. The first quarter of every year is typically the most working capital constrained due to fleet maintenance in the winter months coupled with low revenue. The first quarter of 2024 seasonality is expected to be slightly offset by earlier than normal flight activity in Texas and Oklahoma.

Bridger believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, and communicate internally and externally, for managing our business and evaluating its performance. Bridger also believes these measures help investors compare our operating performance with its results in prior periods in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance. Each of the profitability measures described below are not recognized under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. Such measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider any of such measures in isolation or as substitutes for our results as reported under GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used only in conjunction with our GAAP net income or loss for the period. Bridger’s management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Bridger does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where Bridger believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts, such as acquisition costs, integration costs and loss on the disposal or obsolescence of aging aircraft. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of Bridger’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, Bridger is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of the interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting financing expenses), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP profitability measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. During the periods presented, we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA certain costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with GAAP, including stock-based compensation, business development and integration expenses, offering costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets and non-cash impairment charges, non-cash adjustments to the fair value of earnout consideration, non-cash adjustments to the fair value of Warrants issued in connection with the Reverse Recapitalization, loss on extinguishment of debt, and discretionary bonuses to employees and executives. Our management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. The following table reconciles net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

What was Bridger Aerospace's revenue in 2023? Bridger Aerospace reported revenue of $66.7 million in 2023. What is the expected range for Adjusted EBITDA in 2024? Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 is anticipated to range from $35 million to $51 million. What caused the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2023? The increase was primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation and other operating costs. How did interest expense change from 2022 to 2023? Interest expense increased to $23.2 million in 2023 from $20.0 million in 2022. What is the typical pattern of Adjusted EBITDA for Bridger throughout the year? Bridger typically generates positive Adjusted EBITDA in the second and third quarters each year, during the bulk of the wildfire season, and negative Adjusted EBITDA in the first and fourth quarters."

Biotech Industry Analyst The FDA clearance of Adicet Bio's IND for ADI-001 targeting lupus nephritis marks a significant step forward for the company's clinical pipeline, potentially expanding its therapeutic reach beyond oncology into autoimmune diseases. This strategic move may diversify Adicet's portfolio and reduce reliance on its cancer therapies, potentially mitigating risk and opening new revenue streams. The initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial in 2Q 2024 positions the company as a front-runner in applying gamma delta T cell platform technology to autoimmune conditions, a space that has seen less innovation compared to cancer immunotherapy.Furthermore, the extended cash runway into 2H 2026, following a successful capital raise, provides the company with a cushion to pursue its clinical programs without the immediate need for additional financing, which is reassuring for investors concerned about dilution or funding risks. The financial stability may also give Adicet the flexibility to navigate through the typical uncertainties of clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Financial Analyst Adicet Bio's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a controlled burn rate, with R&D expenses decreasing slightly despite the company's expansion into new clinical areas. The net loss has remained relatively stable, which could be interpreted as a positive sign of financial discipline in the high-cost biotech industry. However, the reported goodwill impairment of $19.5 million reflects a significant write-down of intangible assets, which may raise concerns about the company's previous acquisitions and their integration into the current business strategy.The company's cash position, while lower at the end of 2023 compared to the previous year, is bolstered by the recent capital infusion. This financial maneuvering suggests a proactive approach to capital management, which is critical in an industry where cash flow is inherently unpredictable due to the nature of clinical development timelines and regulatory milestones. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of ADI-001 into a Phase 1 trial for lupus nephritis is a noteworthy development, given the unmet need in effective treatments for autoimmune diseases. The potential of ADI-001, based on its robust B-cell depletion and tissue tropism, underscores the innovation within Adicet's approach to cell therapy. However, the true test will come with the preliminary clinical data expected in late 2024 to early 2025, which will be critical in validating the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of the treatment.Additionally, the progress of ADI-001 in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the preclinical development of ADI-270 for renal cell carcinoma shows a promising breadth of applications for the company's gamma delta T cell technology. The upcoming clinical updates in the second half of 2024 will be pivotal in assessing the viability of these therapies and their competitive edge in the oncology market. 03/19/2024 - 04:10 PM Expanded clinical pipeline into autoimmune diseases with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for ADI-001; initiation of Phase 1 clinical trial in lupus nephritis expected in 2Q 2024 On track to file IND for ADI-270 in renal cell carcinoma in 2Q 2024 Extended projected cash runway into 2H 2026 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adicet Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACET), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancer, today reported financial results and operational highlights for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We are excited to explore the potential of our gamma delta T cell platform in autoimmune diseases following the FDA’s IND clearance of ADI-001 in lupus nephritis,” said Chen Schor, President and Chief Executive Officer at Adicet Bio. “We believe ADI-001 is ideally suited for the treatment of autoimmune diseases given its robust B-cell depletion consistent with other autologous CAR T therapies tested in autoimmune diseases, its tissue tropism potential in autoimmune diseases, and the safety and efficacy data observed in our Phase 1 study. In addition, ADI-001’s off-the-shelf availability and safety profile has the potential to make cell therapy for autoimmune diseases available to patients in community setting. We look forward to initiating the Phase 1 study in lupus nephritis in the second quarter of 2024 and are on track to expand the program to additional autoimmune indications.” Mr. Schor continued: “In addition, we are continuing to enroll MCL patients in our ongoing Phase 1 study of ADI-001 in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. With the completion of the successful capital raise and other net proceeds from stock sales under the at-the-market program in January, extending our cash runway into the second half of 2026, we are well-positioned to continue clinical execution across our pipeline through multiple upcoming milestones.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Operational Highlights: Autoimmune diseases IND clearance for ADI-001 in lupus nephritis. In December 2023, the FDA cleared the Company’s IND application for ADI-001 in lupus nephritis. Adicet plans to initiate a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADI-001 in lupus nephritis during the second quarter of 2024. Preliminary clinical data from the trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first quarter of 2025, pending study site activation progression and patient enrollment. Expansion of ADI-001 development in autoimmune diseases. Adicet expects to expand into additional autoimmune indications in the near future. The Company anticipates providing preliminary clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2024 or first half of 2025, subject to clearance of INDs in those indications as well as successful site initiation and patient enrollment in the relevant clinical protocols. Hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications Continuing to advance ADI-001 in Phase 1 GLEAN study in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The Phase 1 study of ADI-001 in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is ongoing, with enrollment focused on the MCL patient population, which demonstrated the greatest clinical benefit in the June 2023 clinical update. Adicet expects to provide a clinical update on safety, efficacy and 6-month complete response data in MCL patients in the second half of 2024. Advancing ADI-270 preclinical development in solid tumors. ADI-270 is designed to home to solid tumors, with a highly specific targeting moiety for CD70 and an armoring technology of dominant negative TGF beta receptor to address immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. Adicet remains on track to file an IND for ADI-270 in renal cell carcinoma in the second quarter of 2024 and expects to provide clinical data from a Phase 1 study in the first half of 2025, following regulatory clearance and subject to study initiation progress. Presented persistence and pharmacodynamic data from ADI-001 Phase 1 study at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. In December 2023, Adicet presented new pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the Phase 1 study of ADI-001 at the ASH Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated robust dose-dependent expansion and persistence in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL. ADI-001’s strong exposure and persistence profile observed in the study to date further validates Adicet’s gamma delta T cell technology. Corporate updates Hired Benjamin Hsu, M.D., Ph.D., as Vice President Clinical Development - Autoimmune. In March 2024, Adicet appointed Dr. Benjamin Hsu, M.D., Ph.D., as Vice President Clinical Development. Dr. Hsu brings over 20 years of experience in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry with extensive expertise in immunology and rheumatology clinical development. Dr. Hsu will lead the clinical design and execution of the clinical development plan for Adicet’s gamma delta T cell therapies for autoimmune diseases. Extended projected cash runway into 2H 2026. In January 2024, Adicet successfully raised $91.8 million in net proceeds through an underwritten public offering and received $19.3 million in net proceeds under its at-the-market (ATM) program. Financial Results for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023: Three months Ended December 31, 2023 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $24.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $25.0 million during the same period in 2022. The $0.2 million decrease was primarily driven by a $2.7 million decrease in expenses related to contract development manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), contract research organizations (CROs) and consultant costs related to our lead product candidate ADI-001. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in payroll and personnel expenses, an increase of $0.7 million in lab expenses and an increase of $0.6 million in facility and other expenses. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.6 million during the same period in 2022. The $0.2 million increase was primarily driven by an increase of $0.9 million in payroll and personnel expenses. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in professional fees and a $0.4 million decrease in facility and other expenses. Net Loss: Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $29.5 million, or a net loss of $0.69 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $4.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $29.9 million, or a net loss of $0.72 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million during the same period in 2022. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $71.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $34.8 million increase was primarily driven by an $11.5 million increase in payroll and personnel expenses resulting from an increase in overall headcount, a net $10.7 million increase in expenses related to CDMOs, CROs and consultant costs related to our lead product candidate ADI-001, a $8.5 million increase in facility and other expenses and a $4.1 million increase in lab expenses. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $0.2 million increase was primarily driven by a $3.3 million increase in payroll and personnel expenses, which includes an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.2 million, salaries and benefits of $1.0 million and contractor fees of $0.9 million and an increase in recruiting fees of $0.3 million. These increases were primarily due to increased headcount for the period. The overall increase was partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease in facilities and other related expenses. Goodwill Impairment: Goodwill was impaired by $19.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 following the results of an interim impairment test conducted during the period. This represented the entire remaining balance of goodwill. Net Loss: Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $142.7 million, or a net loss of $3.31 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $20.3 million, as compared to a net loss of $69.8 million, or a net loss of $1.70 per basic and diluted share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $17.1 million during the same period in 2022. Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $159.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $257.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company received $91.8 million of net proceeds from an underwritten public offering and $19.3 million of net proceeds under its ATM program. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, together with the proceeds raised subsequent to year end, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses into the second half of 2026.

Smith Douglas Homes Reports Full Year 2023 Results,2024-03-19T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Smith Douglas Homes Corp. (NYSE: SDHC) reported positive full-year 2023 results with net new orders increasing by 22.8%, backlog homes by 18.3%, and sales value of backlog homes by 20.1%.

The company had 69 active communities, a cancellation rate of 10.5%, and aims to double home closings in the next five years.","Smith Douglas Homes Reports Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Smith Douglas Homes Corp. (NYSE: SDHC) reported positive full-year 2023 results with net new orders increasing by 22.8%, backlog homes by 18.3%, and sales value of backlog homes by 20.1%. Despite a 1.2% revenue increase to $764.6 million, net income decreased by 12.3%. The company had 69 active communities, a cancellation rate of 10.5%, and aims to double home closings in the next five years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Smith Douglas Homes Corp.'s announcement reveals several key performance indicators (KPIs) that are essential for evaluating the company's financial health and strategic direction. A notable increase in net new orders by 22.8% suggests a robust demand for the company's homes, which is a positive sign for revenue prospects. However, the juxtaposition of growing sales and backlog against a 12.3% decline in net income raises questions about cost management and margin pressures.The reduction in net income could be attributed to various factors, such as increased material costs, labor shortages, or other operational inefficiencies. Investors should consider whether this trend is likely to continue and how it might affect future profitability. The company's debt-to-book capitalization sitting at 26.6% indicates a moderate level of leverage, which is generally manageable, but the net-debt-to-net book capitalization of 21.1%—a non-GAAP financial measure—requires careful assessment against industry benchmarks to evaluate financial stability and risk.Furthermore, the successful IPO and subsequent capital transactions have evidently bolstered the company's liquidity, potentially enhancing its ability to invest in growth opportunities. The strategic use of IPO proceeds to pay off existing debt is a prudent move that could reduce interest expenses and improve net income in the long term. Investors should monitor how effectively the company deploys its new capital towards achieving its ambitious goal of doubling home closings over the next five years. Market Research Analyst The expansion from 53 to 69 active communities indicates a significant investment in growth and a bullish outlook on the housing market by Smith Douglas. This expansion, coupled with the company's backlog growth, suggests a strategic positioning to capture increased market share. However, the relatively stable cancellation rate year-over-year implies that while demand is growing, consumer sentiment may not have shifted drastically, which is an important consideration for projecting future sales stability.It is also important to consider the broader housing market trends, such as interest rates, housing supply and economic indicators, which can greatly influence the performance of homebuilders like Smith Douglas. With the company's entry into the public market, its stock performance will now be more directly influenced by investor perception of its growth potential and risk profile.As the company looks to expand its footprint, the ability to integrate strategic opportunities in new markets without overextending will be critical. The company's strategy and business model, as endorsed by investors during the IPO, will need to be executed with precision to ensure that growth targets are met without compromising profitability or financial health. Legal Expert While the legal perspective may not directly relate to financial metrics, it is important to recognize the implications of transitioning to a public company status. Smith Douglas will now be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and will have to maintain transparency with shareholders. Compliance with financial reporting, corporate governance and market regulations will be paramount.The use of non-GAAP financial measures such as net-debt-to-net book capitalization should be communicated clearly to investors, ensuring that they understand the rationale and the method of calculation to avoid any potential misinterpretation. As the company grows and engages in new market opportunities, it will also have to navigate varying regional regulations and building codes, which can impact operational costs and timelines. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smith Douglas Homes Corp. (NYSE: SDHC) (“Smith Douglas” or the “Company”) today announced results for its year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 Full Year Results as compared to 2022: Net new orders increased 22.8% to 2,368 Backlog homes increased 18.3% to 912 Sales value of backlog homes increased 20.1% to $310.7 million Home closings increased 4.4% to 2,297 Revenue increased 1.2% to $764.6 million Net income of $123.2 million, down 12.3% Debt-to-book capitalization of 26.6% Net-debt-to-net book capitalization of 21.1%1 The Company had 69 active communities on December 31, 2023, compared to 53 a year prior. The cancellation rate was 10.5% for 2023 versus 10.9% for 2022. Greg Bennett, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are excited to begin life as a public company after executing on our highly successful IPO in January and raising over $125 million in primary net proceeds. The demand we saw from investors was humbling and clearly reflective of the belief in our strategy and business model. We are extremely happy with our 2023 results and look forward to continued growth in 2024 as we focus on our goal of doubling home closings over the next five years.” Russ Devendorf, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer added, “Concurrent with the IPO, we closed on our upsized $250 million unsecured credit facility and used a portion of our IPO proceeds to pay off all the outstanding debt.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), this press release includes net-debt-to-net book capitalization and adjusted net income. Net-debt-to-net-book capitalization Net-debt-to-net book capitalization is a supplemental measure of our leverage that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to debt-to-book capitalization or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of net-debt-to-net book capitalization may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate this non-GAAP financial measure in the same manner. We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our leverage and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We define net-debt-to-net book capitalization as: Total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, divided by Total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, plus stockholders’ equity. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool in that it subtracts cash and cash equivalents and therefore may imply that the Company has less debt than the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of this limitation, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered along with other financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We have reconciled this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the following table: Year ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) ​ ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2022 ​ ​ Notes payable ​ ​ $75,627 ​ ​ $15,000 Members’ equity ​ ​ 208,903 164,511 Total capitalization ​ ​ $284,530 $179,511 Debt-to-book capitalization ​ ​ 26.6% 8.4% Notes payable ​ ​ $75,627 $15,000 Less: cash and cash equivalents ​ ​ 19,777 29,601 Net debt ​ ​ 55,850 (14,601) Members’ equity ​ ​ 208,903 164,511 Total net capitalization ​ ​ $264,753 149,910 Net debt-to-book capitalization 21.1% (9.7)% Adjusted net income Adjusted net income is not a measure of net income or net income margin as determined by GAAP. Adjusted net income is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We define adjusted net income as net income adjusted for the tax impact using a 25% federal and state blended tax rate (assuming 100% public ownership to adjust for the impact of taxes on earnings attributable to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC was a subchapter C corporation in the periods presented). Management believes adjusted net income is useful because it allows management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and comparability to industry peers who record income tax expense on their income before tax as opposed to the income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC not being taxed at the entity level and, therefore, not reflecting a charge against earnings for income tax expense. Adjusted net income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of adjusted net income may not be comparable to adjusted net income of other companies. We present adjusted net income because we believe it provides useful information regarding our comparability to peers. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the GAAP financial measure of net income for each of the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, (in thousands) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2022 Net income ​ ​ ​ $123,180 ​ ​ $140,444 Tax-effected adjustments(1) ​ ​ ​ 30,795 ​ ​ 35,111 Adjusted net income ​ ​ ​ $92,385 ​ ​ $105,333 For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our tax expenses assumes a 25% federal and state blended tax rate (assuming 100% public ownership to adjust for the impact of taxes on earnings attributable to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC was a subchapter C corporation in the periods presented).

Positive Settlement of patent litigation enhances AOB's position in protecting its intellectual property. Demonstrates AOB's commitment to innovation and safeguarding proprietary designs. Resolves infringement claims on electronic powder dispenser and hunting blind products. Dismissal of cases with Vista Outdoor Sales and Bushnell Holdings, Inc. signifies a positive resolution. Brian Murphy emphasizes the importance of innovation in AOB's long-term growth strategy. Negative None. Intellectual Property Lawyer From a legal perspective, the settlement between American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor Sales/Bushnell Holdings is a significant event, especially in the highly competitive outdoor products market where patents can be a critical asset. The resolution of patent disputes often involves complex negotiations and can result in licensing agreements, cross-licensing, or financial settlements, all of which can have substantial financial implications for the companies involved. The dismissal of the cases suggests that the parties reached a mutually agreeable solution, which is often preferable to the uncertainty and expense of continued litigation.For stakeholders, the settlement likely preserves the status quo in the marketplace, allowing American Outdoor Brands to continue selling their products without the overhang of legal disputes. It also sends a signal to competitors about the company's willingness to defend its intellectual property rights, which can be seen as a positive in terms of maintaining a competitive edge. However, without details on the settlement, it's impossible to gauge the financial impact or any potential changes to the companies' operations or strategies. Market Analyst Settlements in patent litigation can influence investor perceptions and stock valuations. In this case, the resolution removes legal uncertainties that can overshadow a company's operational performance. Investors typically favor settlements as they eliminate the risk of negative court rulings and potentially hefty damages or injunctions that could disrupt sales and earnings.While specifics of the settlement are undisclosed, the market's reaction will hinge on perceived benefits or concessions made by American Outdoor Brands. If investors believe the settlement favors AOB, this could lead to a positive reassessment of the company's risk profile and growth prospects. Conversely, if the market suspects AOB conceded significant ground or incurred a large financial burden, the stock could face downward pressure. In the long-term, AOB's commitment to innovation, as highlighted by the CEO, could foster investor confidence in the company's ability to grow and maintain market share. Financial Analyst The announcement of a patent litigation settlement can have varying impacts on a company's financial health. The immediate financial implications are not clear due to the lack of disclosure about the settlement terms. However, it's important to consider that litigation is costly and settling can often be less expensive than ongoing legal battles. This could potentially free up resources for American Outdoor Brands to invest in further innovation and market expansion.In the long term, the protection of patents can allow a company to secure and potentially expand its market share by safeguarding unique product features. This can lead to increased revenue streams and higher profit margins if the patented products command a premium in the market. However, the absence of settlement details leaves questions about any potential licensing fees or royalty payments that could affect future earnings. Investors should monitor subsequent financial disclosures for any indications of the settlement's impact on the company's balance sheet and income statement. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM COLUMBIA, Mo., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Outdoor Brands, Inc.

The Trust received $91,035 solely from properties in New Mexico. However, the Trust's distributions are subject to fluctuations based on oil and gas prices, production, and administrative expenses. Positive None. Negative Trust distributions are expected to be materially reduced until cash reserves reach $2.0 million, potentially leading to no distributions in some periods. Substantial accumulated excess production costs may also impact Trust distributions negatively. Financial Analyst The distribution announcement by Mesa Royalty Trust is a direct indicator of the Trust's current financial health and operational efficiency. The disclosed distribution per unit provides investors with a tangible measure of return on investment. It's important to note that the Trust's distributions are heavily reliant on the performance of its oil and gas properties, particularly in the San Juan Basin. The fact that all income for March 2024 was derived from this single geographic area suggests a concentration risk which investors should monitor.Moreover, the Trust's decision to withhold cash reserves for added liquidity is a prudent measure, reflecting a strategic approach to financial management. However, this action, along with the substantial accumulated excess production costs, signals potential financial stress or a conservative approach to future uncertainties in the market. The fluctuation in monthly distributions is common in royalty trusts, yet it implies a degree of unpredictability that must be factored into investment decisions. Energy Sector Analyst The March 2024 distribution reflects the ongoing challenges faced by royalty trusts in the energy sector. Specifically, the Trust's reliance on the New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin properties underscores the geographical concentration of its assets. From an industry perspective, this reliance on a single operator, Hilcorp San Juan LP, adds an additional layer of operational risk.Furthermore, the mention of volatility in the industry, along with the impact of oil and natural gas prices, is a reminder of the external factors that can significantly influence the Trust's financial performance. The energy sector is known for its cyclical nature and the Trust's performance is a microcosm of these broader market dynamics. The Trust's ability to navigate these fluctuations will be important for maintaining stable distributions to unitholders. Market Research Analyst Investors eyeing Mesa Royalty Trust's distribution announcement should consider the broader market implications of such updates. The Trust's performance is a barometer for the health of the energy sector, particularly in the Hugoton and San Juan Basin regions. The disclosed figures provide insight into the operational success of Hilcorp Energy Company's affiliate and offer a glimpse into the potential profitability of similar trusts and operations in the region.It's also essential to recognize the long-term implications of the Trust's strategy to build cash reserves. While this may lead to reduced short-term distributions, it could position the Trust to better weather future industry downturns. Investors should weigh the immediate decrease in expected distributions against the potential for enhanced stability and resilience in the face of industry volatility. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mesa Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) (NYSE: MTR) announced today the Trust income distribution for the month of March 2024. Unitholders of record on March 29, 2024 will receive distributions amounting to $0.027776761 per unit, payable on April 30, 2024. The Trust received $91,035, all of which came from the New Mexico portion of the Trust’s San Juan Basin properties operated by Hilcorp San Juan LP, an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. No income was received in March 2024 from any other working interest owner. This month, after the Trust’s withholding for cash reserves and the payment of administrative expenses, income from the distributable net profits was $51,764. The Trust was formed to own an overriding royalty interest of the net proceeds attributable to certain producing oil and gas properties located in the Hugoton field of Kansas and the San Juan Basin fields of New Mexico and Colorado. As described in the Trust's public filings, the amount of the monthly distributions is expected to fluctuate from month to month, depending on the proceeds, if any, received by the Trust as a result of production, oil and natural gas prices and the amount of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. In addition, as further described in the Trust’s most recent filing on Form 10-Q, distributions to unitholders are expected to be materially reduced, until the Trust increases its cash reserves to a total of $2.0 million in order to provide added liquidity. Proceeds reported by the working interest owners for any month are not generally representative of net proceeds that will be received by the Trust in future periods. As further described in the Trust’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, production and development costs for the royalty interest have resulted in substantial accumulated excess production costs, which will decrease Trust distributions, and in some periods may result in no Trust distributions. The amount of proceeds, if any, received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions to unitholders) has been and will continue to be directly affected, among other things, by volatility in the industry and revenues and expenses reported to the Trust by working interest owners. Any additional expenses and adjustments, among other things, will reduce proceeds to the Trust, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. This press release contains forward-looking statements. No assurances can be given that the expectations contained in this press release will prove to be correct. The working interest owners alone control historical operating data, and handle receipt and payment of funds relating to the royalty properties and payments to the Trust for the related royalty. The Trustee cannot assure that errors or adjustments or expenses accrued by the working interest owners, whether historical or future, will not affect future royalty income and distributions by the Trust. Other important factors that could cause these statements to differ materially include delays in actual results of drilling operations, risks inherent in drilling and production of oil and gas properties, declines in commodity pricing, prices received by working interest owners and other risks described in the Trust’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in such risk factors. The Trust does not intend, and assumes no obligations, to update any of the statements included in this press release. Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to its particular circumstances.

Mesa Royalty Trust (MTR) announced an income distribution of $0.027776761 per unit for March 2024. Where did the Trust's income for March 2024 come from? The Trust received $91,035 solely from properties in the New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin fields. What factors can cause fluctuations in Mesa Royalty Trust's (MTR) monthly distributions? The Trust's distributions can vary due to production levels, oil and natural gas prices, and administrative expenses, among other factors. Why are Trust distributions expected to be reduced until cash reserves reach $2.0 million? Trust distributions are anticipated to decrease until cash reserves reach $2.0 million to enhance liquidity. How may substantial accumulated excess production costs impact Mesa Royalty Trust's (MTR) distributions? Accumulated excess production costs may lead to a decrease in Trust distributions and, in some periods, no distributions may be made. What could affect the Trust's ability to pay distributions to unitholders? Volatility in the industry, revenues, expenses reported by working interest owners, and additional expenses or adjustments may reduce cash available for distribution, potentially resulting in no distributions in certain periods."

With $53 million in cash, DiaMedica has runway till 2026. The ReMEDy2 Phase 2/3 AIS clinical developments are progressing well with multiple sites opened in the U.S. and plans for global expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the financial results and business update provided by DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc., a key takeaway is the company's cash position of $53 million, which according to the company, secures its operations until 2026. This runway is significant for investors as it implies that the company has sufficient funds to support its ongoing clinical trials without the immediate need for additional financing, which could dilute existing shareholders.Furthermore, the clinical development progress of the ReMEDy2 Phase 2/3 trial for acute ischemic strokes (AIS) is a critical factor for potential future revenue. The focus on moderate AIS and the strategic alignment with successful criteria used in other markets could improve the trial's success probability, potentially leading to a positive impact on the company's stock if the results are favorable.However, investors should consider the inherent risks of clinical trials. The interim analysis completion set for the first quarter of 2025 means that significant capital appreciation tied to this particular trial is not imminent and the stock may experience volatility as the market reacts to both incremental updates and broader sector movements. Medical Research Analyst The strategic decision by DiaMedica to modify the ReMEDy2 trial protocol to focus on moderate severity AIS is a calculated move to enhance the trial's success. This is based on the premise that moderate AIS, defined by a National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) of 5-15, represents a patient population with limited treatment options post the tPA treatment window, thereby potentially showing a more pronounced benefit from DM199 treatment.The choice to exclude posterior circulation strokes, which often have different clinical outcomes and treatment responses, could homogenize the trial population and enhance the clarity of the data. Moreover, the preliminary positive response in the Phase 2 trial among a similar patient cohort provides a rationale for this focused approach.It's important for stakeholders to understand that while the narrowing of trial criteria can improve the chances of success, it also potentially limits the market size for the treatment. Nevertheless, if the trial proves successful, it could lead to a significant advancement in the treatment of moderate AIS, which currently has limited options. Market Research Analyst The clinical site activation progress for the ReMEDy2 trial is indicative of DiaMedica's operational capabilities and reflects positively on its project management. The international expansion of the trial into Canada, Australia and plans for the United Kingdom and Europe suggests that the company is not only seeking FDA approval but is also laying the groundwork for a global market presence.The endorsement from the Canadian Stroke Consortium and the Australian Stroke Trials Network (ASTN) adds credibility to the trial and may facilitate smoother site activations and patient enrollment. This global approach could be attractive to investors looking for companies with the potential for international market penetration.From a market perspective, the successful development of treatments for neurological disorders, such as AIS, represents a significant opportunity due to the high prevalence and the substantial economic burden of these conditions. DiaMedica's progress and strategic decisions may position it well within this lucrative market, provided the clinical outcomes are positive. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM Conference Call and Webcast March 20 at 8:00 AM Eastern Time / 7:00 AM Central Time ReMEDy2 Clinical Site Activation Commenced in December 2023 Strengthened Management Team with Lorianne Masuoka, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer $53 Million Cash with Runway to 2026 MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DMAC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel treatments for neurological disorders and cardio-renal disease, today provided a business update and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management will host a conference call Wednesday, March 20, 2024, at 8:00 AM Eastern Time / 7:00 AM Central Time to discuss its business update and full year 2023 financial results. ReMEDy2 Phase 2/3 AIS Clinical Developments DiaMedica has been actively engaging with clinical study sites in the United States and globally. In the U.S., the first clinical sites were opened in December 2023 and as of the date of this press release, six sites have been opened. The majority of the U.S. sites are expected to be activated by the third quarter of 2024. With the support of the Canadian Stroke Consortium, the activation of study sites in Canada is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024. In Australia, the Company has received provisional endorsement from the Australian Stroke Trials Network (ASTN) and Australian site activation is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. Initial steps are also being taken to expand ReMEDy2 into the United Kingdom and Europe. As previously discussed, the Company submitted a protocol modification to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023 intended to enhance the probability of clinical success in the ReMEDy2 clinical trial. These modifications included focusing participant eligibility to those subjects with only moderate acute ischemic strokes (AIS) in the anterior circulation. Moderate strokes are commonly defined as those stroke patients having a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) of 5-15. Moderate severity strokes frequently result from occlusions in small vessels, and if diagnosed after the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; ACTIVASE®) treatment window has closed, typically have limited treatment alternatives as they are generally not candidates for mechanical thrombectomy. The exclusion of posterior circulation strokes aligns with enrollment criteria used by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals, the marketer of urinary-derived KLK1, called KAILIKANG®, in its registration studies in China. Given the ReMEDy2 primary endpoint of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 (excellent outcome), the Company believes that focusing on strokes of moderate severity will maximize the potential performance improvement in participants treated with DM199 vs. placebo, meaning that this change should increase the number of participants receiving DM199 achieving an excellent outcome as compared to the placebo group. This change is also consistent with results from the Company’s Phase 2, ReMEDy1 stroke trial, where the subgroup of participants with moderate strokes, not receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment, showed a greater percentage of patients on DM199 achieving an mRS of 0-1 compared to placebo, recognizing that the trial had a relatively small number of participants. At this time, based upon information obtained from current and potential clinical study sites, the Company believes that full enrollment for the 144 patients for the interim analysis will be completed in the first quarter of 2025.

Dr. Lorianne Masuoka joined DiaMedica in January 2024 with more than 25 years of experience building and expanding high value pipelines in the biopharmaceutical industry that have resulted in drug approvals and strategic alliances. She is a board-certified neurologist, experienced in treating stroke patients, who has successfully created and overseen high performing teams to lead the clinical development of new medicines, with a focus in neurology and oncology. Dr. Masuoka served as Chief Medical Officer of Epygenix Therapeutics, Marinus Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: MRNS), Cubist Pharmaceuticals ($9.5B acquisition by Merck), and Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) where, as a member of executive management, she managed teams in the areas of clinical research, pharmacovigilance, biostatistics and data management, regulatory affairs, and clinical operations. Previously, she held various roles of increasing responsibility at FivePrime Therapeutics ($1.9B acquisition by Amgen) and Chiron (now Novartis). In addition to her executive roles, Dr. Masuoka most recently served as a Board member at Pfenex Inc. ($516M acquisition by Ligand) and served as a Board member at Opiant Pharmaceuticals (up to $500M acquisition by Indivior). Dr. Masuoka received her medical degree from the University of California, Davis, where she also completed her residency in neurology. She completed her epilepsy fellowship at Yale University and is board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Lorianne also recruited a former colleague to join DiaMedica’s team as Vice President of Clinical Operations. Ms. Rebekah de Vitry Fries has over 15 years of clinical operations experience including Epygenix Therapeutics; Takeda and Marinus Pharmaceuticals. “We have been focused on engaging and activating high-quality stroke centers to set the foundation for patient enrollment,” commented Dr. Masuoka. “We are encouraged by the level of interest from quality study sites and are committed to bringing DM199 to stroke patients.” Balance Sheet and Cash Flow DiaMedica reported total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $52.9 million, current liabilities of $2.8 million and working capital of $50.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $33.5 million, $2.2 million in current liabilities and $31.7 million in working capital as of December 31, 2022. The increases in cash, cash equivalents and investments and in working capital were due primarily to the $36.8 million of net proceeds from the April and June 2023 private placements, partially offset by cash used to fund operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $18.7 million compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in operating activities was driven primarily by the Company’s higher net loss and increased amortization of discounts on purchased marketable securities, partially offset by non-cash share-based compensation and the effects of the changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2023. Financial Results Research and development (R&D) expenses increased to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, up from $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven principally by costs incurred for the in-use studies performed to address the previous clinical hold on the Company’s ReMEDy2 AIS trial, costs incurred for the Phase 1C study and increased manufacturing and process development costs for DM199. Also contributing to the increase were higher personnel costs, including non-cash share-based compensation, associated with expanding the clinical team. DiaMedica expects its R&D expenses to increase moderately as we globally expand the ReMEDy2 trial. The increases will be moderated by the completion of prior clinical trials during 2023. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, up from $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased legal fees incurred in connection with the Company’s lawsuit against Pharmaceutical Research Associates Group B.V. (PRA Netherlands) and increased personnel costs incurred in conjunction with expanding the Company’s team. Increased costs for patent prosecution and non-cash share-based compensation also contributed to the increase. DiaMedica expects that its G&A costs we will remain steady or decline slightly as compared to prior periods. Other income, net, was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.4 million for 2022. This increase was driven by increased interest income recognized during 2023 as compared to 2022, related to both higher interest rates and increased marketable securities balances during 2023.

About ReMEDy2 Trial The ReMEDy2 trial is an adaptive design, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the use of the Company’s product candidate, DM199, to treat acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. The trial is intended to enroll approximately 350 patients at up to 100 sites in the United States with planned global expansion. Patients enrolled in the trial will be treated for three weeks with either DM199 or placebo, beginning within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms, with the final follow-up at 90 days. The trial excludes patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or mechanical thrombectomy. DiaMedica believes that the proposed trial has the potential to serve as a pivotal registration study of DM199 in this patient population. About DM199 DM199 is a recombinant (synthetic) form of human tissue kallikrein-1 (rKLK1; rinvecalinase alpha). rKLK1 is identical to naturally produced KLK1, a serine protease enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of diverse physiological processes via a molecular mechanism that increases production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. In the case of ischemic stroke, the administration of DM199 is intended to enhance blood flow to infarction (blood clot) site and boost neuronal survival in the ischemic penumbra by dilating arterioles surrounding the site of the infarction and inhibition of apoptosis (neuronal cell death) while also facilitating neuronal remodeling through the promotion of angiogenesis. KLK1 deficiency may play a role in multiple vascular and fibrotic diseases such as stroke, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, vascular dementia, and resistant hypertension where current treatment options are limited or ineffective. DiaMedica is the first company to have developed and clinically studied rKLK1. Non-recombinant, tissue extracted KLK1 protein, produced from the pancreas of pigs and human urine, has been approved for decades outside the U.S. and Europe for patients in Japan, China and South Korea with a variety of ischemic conditions such as AIS, chronic renal disease, retinopathy and hypertension. DM199 is currently being studied in patients with AIS. In September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS. About DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from serious diseases with a focus on acute ischemic stroke. DiaMedica’s lead candidate DM199 is the first pharmaceutically active recombinant (synthetic) form of the KLK1 protein, an established therapeutic modality in Asia for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and other vascular diseases.

The judgment requires the defendants to retract defamatory articles and cease further publications. Safety Shot CEO, Jarrett Boon, expresses satisfaction with the outcome. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The default judgment in favor of Safety Shot, Inc. against Capybara Research and Igor Appelboom is a critical legal development with potential ripple effects across the sector. From a legal standpoint, the judgment serves as a deterrent against the dissemination of fraudulent and defamatory material aimed at manipulating market perceptions of publicly traded companies. The court's decision to mandate a public retraction and removal of the defamatory content underscores the judiciary's stance on protecting corporate reputation against unfounded accusations.For Safety Shot, the outcome not only clears the company of allegations but also reinforces its legal standing to pursue any future entities that might engage in similar conduct. This sets a precedent that could influence how research firms and individuals approach the publication of material that could impact a company's stock performance. The permanency of the injunction against further defamatory publications by the defendants ensures long-term protection for Safety Shot's reputation. Financial Analyst This judgment could have significant financial implications for Safety Shot, particularly in terms of investor confidence and stock market performance. The retraction of the defamatory article removes a cloud of suspicion that might have been affecting investor sentiment and, by extension, the company's share price. The immediate effect might be a positive correction in Safety Shot's stock as the market digests the news of the legal vindication.In the longer term, the company may experience improved relations with investors, analysts and partners, which can be important for future capital raising efforts or strategic business initiatives. However, it's important to monitor the company's forthcoming financial reports and market performance to fully assess the impact of this legal victory on its valuation and investor relations. Market Research Analyst The legal victory for Safety Shot can influence market dynamics within its industry segment. Competitors and market participants will likely take note of the strong legal repercussions of publishing unfounded claims against companies. This judgment could result in more cautious and thorough due diligence by research firms and analysts before releasing potentially damaging reports.Additionally, the settlement with Benzinga indicates a broader recognition of the consequences associated with the publication of false information. This could lead to higher standards of reporting and analysis within the financial news industry, ultimately benefiting all market stakeholders by fostering a more transparent and reliable information environment. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM The Default Judgment marks a significant victory in Safety Shot’s legal battle with Capybara Research and Igor Appelboom and Complete Vindication for the Company.

The company plans to use the proceeds for future acquisitions and debt repayment.","CTO Realty Growth Announces Sale of Mixed-Use Property in Santa Fe, New Mexico for $20.0 Million Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CTO Realty Growth, Inc. announced the sale of a mixed-use property in Santa Fe for $20.0 million, generating a gain of $4.6 million. The company plans to use the proceeds for future acquisitions and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The sale of a significant real estate asset by CTO Realty Growth, Inc., specifically a mixed-use property for $20.0 million, is notable for its impact on the company's portfolio diversification and capital allocation strategy. The exit cap rate aligns with the firm's current disposition cash yield guidance, which is a critical metric in real estate investment as it indicates the rate of return on the sale based on the income the property is expected to generate. The gain of approximately $4.6 million also contributes positively to the company's financial performance.From a strategic perspective, the divestment of non-core assets allows for a more focused investment approach and is often used to enhance shareholder value. The anticipated reinvestment into a core power center in the Orlando MSA suggests a strategic shift towards retail-centric properties, which may be influenced by market research indicating growth potential in this segment. Additionally, the use of a Section 1031 like-kind exchange could offer tax deferral benefits, effectively allowing the company to reinvest the full amount of the sale into the new property without immediate tax liability.However, the real estate market is subject to fluctuations and the success of the new acquisition will depend on various factors including location, tenant mix and consumer behavior trends. The decision to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on its revolving unsecured credit facility with the proceeds indicates prudent financial management, potentially improving the company's credit profile and reducing interest expense. Tax and Legal Expert The utilization of a Section 1031 like-kind exchange is a strategic move for CTO Realty Growth, Inc., which allows for the deferral of capital gains taxes that would otherwise be incurred on the sale of the property. This tax provision is particularly relevant in the real estate sector as it enables investors to maintain equity and leverage in their property investments. By reinvesting the proceeds into similar 'like-kind' properties, CTO can continue to optimize its investment portfolio without the immediate tax burden.However, it is important to note that the rules governing 1031 exchanges are complex and must be followed precisely to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal pitfalls. The mention of $30.7 million in proceeds held in 1031 restricted cash accounts suggests that CTO is planning further investments under this tax structure, which could significantly affect the company's investment strategy and liquidity management.Furthermore, the decision to use available proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under its revolving unsecured credit facility indicates a strategic approach to balance sheet management. Reducing debt can lower financial risk and interest costs, which could be favorable for the company's long-term financial health and investor confidence. Financial Analyst The financial implications of CTO Realty Growth, Inc.'s property sale and subsequent actions are multifaceted. The reported gain on sale of $4.6 million positively affects the company's earnings, which could be reflected in the stock price if the market perceives this as a sign of effective asset management and profitability. The strategy to reinvest in a core power center is indicative of the company's growth orientation and could be a response to market demand dynamics.Investors should also consider the impact of this transaction on the company's liquidity. With $30.7 million in proceeds held for future investments, CTO demonstrates a strong cash position, which provides flexibility for opportunistic acquisitions. However, investors should monitor how the company allocates this capital, as missteps in investment choices could affect future revenue streams and profitability.The repayment of debt using the sale proceeds will likely improve the company's debt-to-equity ratio, an important indicator of financial health. This could potentially lead to a better credit rating and lower borrowing costs, which is beneficial for long-term growth and sustainability. Investors should also be aware of the interest rate environment, as it can influence both the cost of borrowing and the valuation of real estate assets. 03/19/2024 - 04:10 PM WINTER PARK, Fla., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (NYSE: CTO) (the “Company” or “CTO”) today announced the closing of the sale of its mixed-use property totaling approximately 136,000 square feet in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico (the “Property”). The Property was sold for approximately $20.0 million, representing an exit cap rate within the range of the Company’s current guidance for disposition cash yields and generating a gain on sale of approximately $4.6 million. “In recent months, we have successfully sold many of our smaller non-core properties and nearly all of our legacy office exposure,” said John P. Albright, President and Chief Executive Officer of CTO Realty Growth, Inc. “We anticipate using the proceeds from this sale to fund the acquisition of a core power center in the Orlando MSA, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2024.” The Company expects to utilize the sales proceeds as part of a Section 1031 like-kind exchange (the “1031 Exchange”). Following the completion of the 1031 Exchange, the Company intends to use available proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under its revolving unsecured credit facility or fund future acquisitions. With the closing of this transaction, the Company has approximately $30.7 million of proceeds held in 1031 restricted cash accounts. About CTO Realty Growth, Inc.

The company reiterates guidance for fiscal 2024, showcasing growth drivers and commitment to innovation. Positive Total revenue increased by 19% to $172.6 million for fiscal 2023. GAAP operating income rose by 28% to $15.6 million with a 9% operating margin. GAAP net income surged by 117% to $8.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating income increased by 20% to $53.2 million with a 31% operating margin. Non-GAAP net income reached a record $44.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations grew by 50% to $31.6 million. Total cash and investments increased by 34% to $134.9 million. Mitek expects full-year revenue for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $180.0 million to $185.0 million, representing a 6% growth rate at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 is projected to be between 30.0% and 31.0%. Mitek signed a large multi-year mobile deposit reorder in fiscal 2023, recognizing additional license revenue of $7.0 million. The company has various growth drivers in place leveraging advanced AI and machine learning to meet customer needs. Mitek's net revenue retention rate was approximately 117% for the fiscal year. Negative Total revenue decreased by 5% year over year to $37.7 million for fiscal fourth quarter 2023. GAAP operating loss was $3.3 million with a negative 9% operating margin for the same quarter. GAAP net loss was $1.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share for fiscal fourth quarter 2023. Non-GAAP operating income decreased by 30% year over year to $6.9 million for the same quarter. Cash flow from operations decreased by 32% year over year to $3.5 million for fiscal fourth quarter 2023. Financial Analyst The reported 19% year-over-year increase in total revenue and the 117% increase in GAAP net income for Mitek Systems, Inc. suggest a strong financial performance for fiscal 2023. These figures, particularly the significant improvement in net income, indicate efficient cost management and potentially successful strategic initiatives. The company's operating margin at 9% and cash flow growth are also positive indicators of its operational efficacy.However, the reported 5% decrease in total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year raises questions about the sustainability of growth or potential market challenges. Investors should consider whether this decline is an anomaly or a sign of underlying issues that could affect future performance. Mitek's reiteration of its fiscal 2024 guidance suggests confidence in its business model, but the impact of the large multi-year mobile deposit reorder should be factored into revenue expectations, as it inflates the previous year's figures and may not be indicative of organic growth. Market Research Analyst Mitek's focus on innovation in digital identity and fraud prevention, as well as its mention of new products leveraging advanced AI and machine learning, positions the company in a high-growth industry. The net revenue retention rate of approximately 117% is a strong indicator of customer satisfaction and the stickiness of Mitek's services. This metric is particularly important for investors as it suggests that not only is the company retaining customers, but it's also expanding its revenue base within its existing customers.Given the long-term trend towards digital transactions and the increasing importance of cybersecurity, Mitek's product offerings in Check Fraud Defender, MiVIP, MiPass and ID R&D appear well-aligned with market demands. However, investors should monitor the competitive landscape and the company's ability to maintain its market position against other players in the space. Economist The financial results of Mitek Systems reflect broader economic trends such as the increasing digitization of financial services and the heightened need for security measures. The company's performance can be seen as a microcosm of the sector's health. The projected growth rate of 6% for the next fiscal year, adjusted to approximately 12% when considering the unique contract terms, is moderately optimistic, suggesting that Mitek expects to continue capitalizing on these trends.Investors should note the macroeconomic factors that could influence Mitek's performance, including regulatory changes in digital security, shifts in consumer behavior towards digital platforms and the overall economic climate that could affect IT spending. The company's ability to adapt to these external pressures will be critical for sustaining growth. 03/19/2024 - 04:08 PM Total Revenue for Fiscal 2023 Increased 19% Year Over Year; Company Reiterates Guidance for Fiscal 2024 SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mitek Systems, Inc.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release contains non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude amortization and acquisition-related costs, intellectual property litigation costs, executive transition costs, stock compensation expense, non-recurring audit fees, restructuring costs, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments, and the cash tax difference. These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors of the Company utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company’s comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of its forward outlook for non-GAAP operating margin with its forward-looking GAAP operating margin in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to quantify share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from our non-GAAP operating margin, as it requires additional inputs such as the number of shares granted and market prices that are not ascertainable due to the volatility of the Company’s share price. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company’s operations are in foreign countries and the transactional currencies are primarily Euros and British pound sterling and the Company is not able to predict fluctuations in those currencies without unreasonable efforts. Key Business Metrics We monitor net revenue retention to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. To calculate net revenue retention, the Company first calculates total revenue (including expansion revenue) and reduce that amount by revenue churn (e.g. contract expirations, cancellations, downgrades, or other reductions). To calculate net revenue retention rate, the Company specifies a measurement period consisting of the trailing 12 months from its current period end. The Company then calculates its net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing its total revenue in the second year of the measurement period by its revenue in the first year of the measurement period (i.e. the numerator excludes revenue generated by customers newly acquired in the second year of measurement). The net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and the Company presents its net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.

The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated annual tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances. The fiscal 2022 cash tax rate includes a beneficial impact of reduced taxes payable due to the utilization of research and development tax credits and the utilization of loss carryforward. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net income for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 22% and negative 3%, respectively. (2) Included in acquisition-related costs and expenses in fiscal 2022 is $0.3 million of foreign exchange and investment losses incurred in connection with the acquisition of HooYu Ltd. which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The net proceeds will be used to pay down outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Notes are offered to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons under specific regulations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Landsea Homes Corporation's $300 million Senior Notes at an 8.875% yield is indicative of the current credit market conditions and investor appetite for corporate debt. This yield is relatively high compared to historical averages, suggesting a premium is being paid by the company possibly due to perceived risk, market volatility, or increased interest rates.An analysis of the debt's structure, being senior and unsecured, means that these notes will take precedence over other potential unsecured debt obligations in the event of a default, but they are not backed by specific collateral. This positioning affects the risk profile of the Notes, making them more attractive to certain institutional investors who prioritize claim seniority.Furthermore, the use of proceeds to pay down existing debt under a revolving credit facility is a strategic move to manage the company's capital structure and liquidity. This could indicate an attempt by Landsea Homes to improve financial metrics such as leverage ratios or interest coverage, which are critical factors for credit rating agencies and investors alike. Market Research Analyst Landsea Homes Corporation's decision to issue debt could be a response to the housing market's dynamics. If the housing market is expected to experience growth, the company may be positioning itself to capitalize on this by ensuring they have the necessary capital to fund operations and potential expansions.However, if the market is in a downturn, the company might be seeking to strengthen its balance sheet against potential headwinds. The timing of the offering and the choice of debt over equity financing are critical elements that reflect the company's strategy and market conditions.It is also relevant to consider the investor base for these Senior Notes. As they are offered to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, it reflects a targeted approach to fundraising, potentially due to the regulatory and risk profile preferences of these investors. Legal Expert The offering's compliance with Rule 144A and Regulation S is a legal maneuver that allows Landsea Homes to access capital from institutional investors without the need for a public offering. This approach is often quicker and less costly in terms of regulatory compliance compared to a public issuance. However, it limits the pool of potential investors to those who meet certain criteria, which could affect the liquidity and marketability of the Notes.The legal stipulations that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain exemptions highlight the regulatory landscape that companies must navigate when raising capital. The absence of registration necessitates a reliance on exemptions, which could impose restrictions on the resale of the Notes, potentially impacting their attractiveness to investors who prioritize liquidity. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Landsea Homes Corporation (Nasdaq: LSEA) (“Landsea Homes” or the “Company”) announced today that it has priced its previously announced offering (the “Offering”) of $300,000,000 of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by all of the Company’s material wholly owned subsidiaries as of their issuance (the “Guarantors”) and will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and Guarantors. The Offering is expected to settle on or around April 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.

Borse Dubai will hold approximately 10.8% to 10.1% of Nasdaq's outstanding shares post-offering, becoming the second-largest shareholder. The offering aims to enhance capital structure and liquidity within the Borse Dubai Group. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The secondary offering by Borse Dubai of shares in Nasdaq represents a notable event in the financial markets, potentially influencing Nasdaq's stock liquidity and market perception. The sale of approximately 26.9 million shares, with an option for underwriters to purchase an additional 4 million shares, could lead to a dilution of existing shareholders' equity. However, since these are existing shares being sold by Borse Dubai and not new shares issued by Nasdaq, the direct impact on Nasdaq's capital structure is minimal.Investors should monitor the market's reaction to this offering, as large block sales can sometimes pressure the stock price due to increased supply. The lock-up agreement for an 18-month period post-offering indicates Borse Dubai's commitment to remaining a significant shareholder, which may reassure investors about the stability of Nasdaq's shareholder base. The fact that Borse Dubai will retain the right to designate a nominee to the Nasdaq board, contingent on a 10% ownership threshold, ensures its continued influence on Nasdaq's strategic direction. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transaction's relevance lies in its potential impact on Nasdaq's share price and the implications for shareholder value. Borse Dubai's decision to sell a portion of its stake may be interpreted as a move to rebalance its portfolio and enhance its own capital structure. The proceeds from the offering solely benefit Borse Dubai, which could be utilized to invest in other areas or improve its financial flexibility.Investors and analysts should evaluate the offering's size relative to Nasdaq's average trading volume to gauge potential short-term price volatility. It's also important to consider the long-term perspective, where Borse Dubai's reduced, yet still significant, stake could alter the power dynamics within Nasdaq's shareholder meetings and influence future corporate governance decisions. Corporate Governance Expert Corporate governance implications of this transaction are worth considering. Borse Dubai's ability to appoint a board member as long as it holds a 10% stake provides it with a strategic lever to influence Nasdaq's governance. This arrangement underscores the importance of significant shareholders in corporate decision-making processes.Such corporate actions often signal confidence in the company's management and strategic vision, particularly when the selling shareholder is an industry peer and partner. However, it also raises questions about the diversification of the board's composition and potential shifts in the balance of power, especially if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, further reducing Borse Dubai's stake. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK and DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ or Nasdaq) and Borse Dubai Limited (Borse Dubai) today announced the commencement of a secondary offering by Borse Dubai of 26,956,522 shares of Nasdaq’s common stock.

The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed. Nasdaq is not offering any shares in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Borse Dubai will receive all of the proceeds from the offering.

At the completion of the offering, Borse Dubai is expected to be the second largest shareholder in Nasdaq. Subject to completion of the offering, Borse Dubai intends to agree to an 18-month lock-up of its remaining shares controlled by Nasdaq, with a right to designate a nominee to the Nasdaq board of directors so long as it continues to own at least 10% of Nasdaq’s outstanding shares as of the date hereof. “Today’s offering is being conducted to enhance the capital structure and liquidity within the Borse Dubai Group. We continue to be a long-term shareholder in Nasdaq and are invested in the success of the company,” said Essa Kazim, Chairman and CEO, Borse Dubai. “The relationship between Nasdaq and Borse Dubai is multifaceted and has spanned many years. We have not only been a shareholder in Nasdaq for the past 16 years, but Nasdaq is also a key technology and brand partner for our exchange group and we believe in the strategic vision for the company. We look forward to a continued relationship as a partner.” “Borse Dubai is and continues to be a valued shareholder of Nasdaq underpinned by a shared vision for our future,” said Sarah Youngwood, Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq. “Borse Dubai’s insights and contributions have and will continue to shape our path ahead.” Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs & Co.

China Jo-Jo Drugstores Regains Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement,2024-03-19T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc. (CJJD) has regained compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's minimum bid price requirement after a 1-for-20 reverse stock split, closing the matter with Nasdaq.","China Jo-Jo Drugstores Regains Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc. (CJJD) has regained compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market's minimum bid price requirement after a 1-for-20 reverse stock split, closing the matter with Nasdaq. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement from China Jo-Jo Drugstores regarding their regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a positive signal for investors and stakeholders. This development is indicative of a stabilization in the company's market value, which had previously been under pressure due to the stock trading below the $1.00 threshold. The successful reverse stock split appears to have been a strategic move to shore up the stock price and ensure continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.From a market research perspective, the company's ability to maintain its listing can improve investor confidence and potentially increase liquidity. This is because Nasdaq-listed companies are often perceived as more credible and stable, which can attract a broader range of institutional investors. In the longer term, the company's sustained listing status could facilitate access to capital markets and support growth initiatives. Financial Analyst By regaining compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, China Jo-Jo Drugstores has averted the risk of delisting, which could have had significant financial implications. Delisting often leads to lower visibility among investors, reduced trading volumes and potentially more volatile stock prices. The reverse stock split, while dilutive to existing shareholders, was necessary to maintain the company's listing and can be seen as a remedial action to protect shareholder value.It's important to monitor the company's future financial performance to ensure that the underlying business supports a stock price above the minimum bid price in the long term. Shareholders should be aware that while the reverse stock split has immediate positive effects on the stock price, it does not change the company's market capitalization or its fundamental value. Ongoing scrutiny of the company's financial health, including revenue growth and profit margins, will be critical in assessing the sustainability of its stock price post-split. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM HANGZHOU, China, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc.

The year-over-year revenue increase of 10% in Q4 2023 is a positive sign, indicating potential recovery or growth strategies taking effect. However, the full year's 3% revenue decline suggests a challenging environment over the longer term. The significant reduction in losses and a shift to profits for the full year is commendable, especially considering the large impairment losses recorded in the previous year.Investors should note the increased selling and marketing expenses, which have risen by 33% in Q4 and 48% for the full year. This indicates an aggressive customer acquisition strategy, which, while increasing costs in the short term, may lead to higher revenue in the future as indicated by the 13% increase in Monthly Paying Users (MPU). The shift towards lower commission PC platforms could also improve margins over time. Market Research Analyst GDEV's strategic shift in marketing investment is noteworthy, with a substantial increase in marketing spend aimed at new player acquisition. This aligns with the 13% increase in MPU, a key metric for the gaming industry. The company's ability to increase its user base is a strong positive, as it may lead to higher long-term customer value. The growth in the share of advertisement sales suggests successful monetization strategies, particularly with the integration of advertisement functionality in new titles like Island Hoppers.The geographical split of bookings, with Europe showing an increase, could indicate market expansion or improved regional performance. Investors should monitor whether these changes in user acquisition and platform distribution translate into sustained growth in bookings and revenue. Gaming Industry Analyst The data indicates a strategic pivot towards the PC platform, which is traditionally associated with lower platform commissions and potentially higher profit margins. The increased investment in marketing and the subsequent rise in MPU suggests that GDEV is doubling down on user growth to offset the decline in bookings and revenue. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities, however, raises concerns about liquidity and the sustainability of current investment levels in player acquisition.The operational metrics, such as Average Bookings Per Paying User (ABPPU), which has declined by 11% in Q4 and 19% annually, may suggest a lower spending engagement among the user base or a shift in the user demographic. The company's focus on PC platforms and increased marketing spend could be an effort to address this by attracting users with potentially higher lifetime value. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM LIMASSOL, Cyprus, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GDEV Inc.

Platform commissions remained relatively stable at the level of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Game operation costs were stable at the level of $13 million. Selling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $14 million, amounting to $54 million. The growth was mainly due to substantially increased investments into new players in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the substantial decrease in marketing investments in 2022 driven by the challenging market environment in that year. General and administrative expenses remained relatively stable decreasing by only $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 vs. the same period in 2022. As a result of the factors above, together with: (i) the effect of an impairment of goodwill and investments in equity accounted associates recorded in Q4 2022 in the amount of $63 million vs. nil in Q4 2023; (ii) an impairment loss on trade receivables and loans receivable recorded in Q4 2023 in the amount of $0.4 million vs. $24 million in Q4 2022; and (iii) share of loss of equity accounted associates of $4 million in Q4 2022 vs nil in Q4 2023, profit for the period, net of tax, amounted to $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a loss of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 amounted to $10 million, an increase of $19 million compared to the respective period of 2022 due to the same factors (other than the effect of the goodwill and investments impairment, share of loss of equity-accounted associates and certain other items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA). Cash flows generated from operating activities amounted to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease from $17 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease is mostly due to a substantial increase in cash outflows associated with more investments into new players in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in cash inflows from bookings generated in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. Full year 2023 financial performance In 2023 our revenue decreased by $15 million (3%) year-over-year and amounted to $465 million, driven primarily by a decrease in bookings in the amount of $28 million (6%) year-over-year. This was partially offset by an increase of $13 million in change of deferred revenues during 2023 vs. 2022. Platform commissions decreased by 16% in 2023 compared with 2022. The decrease in platform commissions was primarily due to a 6% decrease in the revenue generated from in-game purchases when compared to the prior period. This was amplified by an increasing share of revenue being derived from our PC platform which is associated with lower commissions in comparison with other platforms. Game operation costs increased by $8 million (17%) in 2023 vs. 2022 to reach $52 million. The increase in game operation cost was primarily due to an increase in average employee salaries as a result of the relocation of personnel from Russia in the second half of 2022. This was amplified by increased software support expenses related to an increase in the scale of our games. Selling and marketing expenses in 2023 increased by $73 million, amounting to $226 million. The growth can mainly be attributed to considerably more investments into new players in 2023 compared to the substantial decrease in marketing investments in 2022 driven by the challenging market environment in 2022. General and administrative expenses decreased by $7 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the loss on disposal of our former Russian subsidiaries in the amount of $5 million in the third quarter of 2022 vs. nil in 2023. As a result of the factors above, together with (i) the effect of an impairment of goodwill and investments in equity accounted associates recorded in 2022 in the amount of $63 million vs. nil in 2023; (ii) an impairment loss on trade receivables and loans receivable recorded in 2023 in the amount of $6 million vs. $30 million in 2022; (iii) change in the fair value of share warrant obligation and other financial instruments of $11 million in 2023 vs. $3 million in 2022; and (iv) share of loss of equity accounted associates of $0.5 million in 2023 vs. $10 million in 2022, we recorded profit for the period, net of tax, of $46 million for 2023, compared to $7 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $43 million, a decrease of $53 million compared with 2022 due to the same factors (other than the effect of the goodwill and investments impairment, share of loss of equity-accounted associates and certain other items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA). Cash flows generated from operating activities amounted to $18 million in 2023, compared to $116 million in 2022. The decrease is mostly due to a substantial increase in cash outflows associated with more investments into new players in 2023 together with decrease in cash inflows from bookings generated in 2023 compared with 2022.

This can be attributed to the fact that 2022 was characterized by significantly lower marketing investments into the acquisition of new players who could potentially provide support to bookings in 2023. However, our significant investment into marketing in 2023 resulted in an increase in MPU by 13% both in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which in turn is expected to positively impact our bookings in the future. As a result, we recorded a moderate growth of bookings in the fourth quarter of 2023 vs. the same period of 2022. The share of advertisement sales as a percentage of total bookings increased in both the fourth quarter and full year 2023 to 6.5% and 7.2% respectively, compared to 4.3% and 4.5% in the respective periods of 2022. The increase was driven by substantially increased monthly active users (due to increased investments into new players) as well as by the successful implementation of advertisement functionality in Island Hoppers from the start of the second quarter of 2023.

Presentation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with IFRS throughout this press release, the Company has provided the non-IFRS financial measure “Adjusted EBITDA” (the “Non-IFRS Financial Measure”).

The Company uses this Non-IFRS Financial Measure for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. The Company believes that this Non-IFRS Financial Measure is a useful financial metric to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. This Non-IFRS Financial Measure is not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of the Company’s financial results in accordance with IFRS. The use of the Non-IFRS Financial Measure terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures.

Strategic focus on preparing for potential PRGN-2012 commercial launch in 2025 and evaluating financing opportunities for balance sheet strength. Negative None. Biotech Industry Analyst The recent developments announced by Precigen, Inc. indicate a strategic progression in their pipeline, particularly the advancement of PRGN-2012 towards a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission. This step is significant as it reflects the transition from research and development into the potential for market entry. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA is a pivotal milestone that can expedite the review process, potentially reducing time to market for PRGN-2012, a treatment for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare disease with limited treatment options.From a financial perspective, the company's focus on cost containment, as seen by the reduction in SG&A costs, is a positive indicator of management's commitment to financial discipline. However, the decrease in total revenues and the impairment charge related to the Exemplar subsidiary raise concerns about the company's revenue streams and asset valuation. Investors should monitor the balance between R&D expenses and the potential revenue from the company's pipeline products. The cash position of $62.9 million provides a buffer for ongoing operations, but the need for additional financing, as mentioned by the CFO, suggests upcoming capital raises that could dilute current shareholders or add debt to the balance sheet. Medical Research Analyst The clinical advancements for Precigen's immunotherapies and UltraCAR-T cell therapies represent a leap forward in the treatment of various cancers and autoimmune diseases. The AdenoVerse platform's ability to elicit immune responses against HPV-infected cells could have a transformative impact on patients with RRP and HPV-associated cancers. The 50% Complete Response rate in the Phase 1 portion of the study for PRGN-2012 is notable, as it suggests a strong efficacy profile.Moreover, the UltraCAR-T therapies, such as PRGN-3006 for AML/MDS, show a promising approach with a 27% ORR in a heavily pre-treated patient population. This alternative to traditional CAR-T therapies, with a built-in safety switch and mbIL15 for prolonged T cell persistence, could offer a competitive advantage in the market. The preliminary data expected in the second half of 2024 will be important in determining the therapies' long-term viability and efficacy. Stakeholders should be cognizant of the clinical data's impact on the company's valuation and partnership opportunities. Healthcare Market Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and Precigen's push towards commercial readiness for PRGN-2012 in 2025 positions the company in a potentially lucrative niche market for RRP. The Orphan Drug Designation in both the US and EU underscores the unmet medical need and could grant Precigen market exclusivity, enhancing the commercial prospects of PRGN-2012. The market response to the interim data from the ongoing studies of their UltraCAR-T therapies will be telling of the potential market size and penetration these products could achieve.Investors should also consider the implications of the company's current financial position and the need for additional funding. While the cash reserves appear adequate in the short-term, the long-term success hinges on the successful commercialization of its pipeline products and the ability to secure favorable financing without excessively diluting shareholder value. The anticipated data releases in 2024 will likely be a catalyst for stock volatility, with positive data potentially leading to partnership deals or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM – Significant progress made in the development of the PRGN-2012 AdenoVerse immunotherapy for the treatment of RRP; Precigen plans to submit a BLA under an accelerated approval pathway in the second half of 2024; ramping up commercial readiness activities for a potential launch in 2025 – – Precigen's PRGN-2012 received the first Breakthrough Therapy Designation and accelerated approval pathway from the FDA for the treatment of RRP – – Precigen received IND clearance for a randomized Phase 2 study of PRGN-2009 AdenoVerse immunotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab in HPV-associated recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer; study now active and recruiting patients – – Interim data from the ongoing Phase 1b study of PRGN-3006 UltraCAR-T in relapsed/refractory AML anticipated in the second half of 2024 – – Preliminary data from the Phase 1 study of PRGN-3007 next generation UltraCAR-T in ROR1+ advanced cancers anticipated in the second half of 2024 – – Cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments totaled $62.9 million as of December 31, 2023 – – Continued focus on cost containment resulted in a reduction in SG&A costs of 16% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year period – GERMANTOWN, Md., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Precigen, Inc.

Salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs increased $2.8 million due to an increase in the hiring of employees to support the growth in the Company's development activities, and to a lesser extent, increases in salaries of our continuing employees. These increases were offset by less expenses incurred related to preclinical research programs for the comparable period. SG&A expenses decreased $7.6 million, or 15.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in professional fees of $6.5 million, due to decreased legal fees associated with certain litigation matters, and $0.7 million decreased insurance-related premiums. Total revenues decreased $20.7 million, or 76.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Collaboration and licensing revenues decreased $14.6 million, or 99.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the prior year period non-cash recognition of revenue related to historical collaboration agreements for which revenue was previously deferred. Product and services revenues decreased $5.9 million, or 48.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is related to reductions in services performed at Exemplar as well as the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2022 related to agreements for which revenue was previously deferred that did not occur in 2023. Total other income, net, increased $8.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to $6.3 million in reduced interest expense associated with the Convertible Notes as they were fully retired in the second quarter of 2023, and $3.1 million increased interest income due to higher interest rates on investments. This increase was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in gain recorded on the early retirement of a portion of our Convertible Notes compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company recorded a $10.4 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to its Exemplar subsidiary as a result of the Company's annual goodwill impairment test. Loss from continuing operations was $95.9 million, or $(0.39) per basic and diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $79.8 million, or $(0.40) per basic and diluted share, in year ended December 31, 2022.

UltraCAR-T®UltraCAR-T is a multigenic autologous CAR-T platform that utilizes Precigen's advanced non-viral Sleeping Beauty system to simultaneously express an antigen-specific CAR to specifically target tumor cells, mbIL15 for enhanced in vivo expansion and persistence, and a kill switch to conditionally eliminate CAR-T cells for a potentially improved safety profile. Precigen has advanced the UltraCAR-T platform to address the inhibitory tumor microenvironment by incorporating a novel mechanism for intrinsic checkpoint blockade without the need for complex and expensive gene editing techniques. UltraCAR-T investigational therapies are manufactured via Precigen's overnight manufacturing process using the proprietary UltraPorator® electroporation system at the patient's medical center and administered to patients only one day following gene transfer. The overnight UltraCAR-T manufacturing process does not use viral vectors and does not require ex vivo activation and expansion of T cells, potentially addressing major limitations of current T cell therapies. UltraCAR-T® Clinical ProgramPrecigen's UltraCAR-T platform is currently under clinical investigation for hematological and solid tumors, including a Phase 1/1b study of PRGN-3005 UltraCAR-T in patients with advanced, recurrent platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer (NCT03907527), a Phase 1/1b study of PRGN-3006 UltraCAR-T in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (NCT03927261) and a Phase 1/1b study of PRGN-3007 UltraCAR-T incorporating PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in patients with ROR1-positive (ROR1+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (NCT05694364). PRGN-3006 UltraCAR-T has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation in patients with AML by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). UltraCAR-T® Library ApproachPrecigen's UltraCAR-T library approach is designed to transform the personalized cell therapy landscape for cancer patients. Precigen's goal is to develop and validate a library of non-viral plasmids to target tumor-associated antigens. Enabled by design and manufacturing advantages of UltraCAR-T, coupled with the capabilities of the UltraPorator® system, Precigen is working to empower medical centers to deliver personalized, autologous UltraCAR-T treatment with overnight manufacturing to any cancer patient. Based on the patient's cancer indication and biomarker profile, one or more non-viral plasmids would be selected from the library to build a personalized UltraCAR-T treatment. After initial treatment, this approach has the potential to allow for redosing of UltraCAR-T targeting the same or new tumor-associated antigen(s) based on the treatment response and the changes in antigen expression of the patient's tumor. Precigen believes that the combination of the advanced UltraVector® DNA construction platform and the ease of overnight manufacturing gives this library approach a proprietary advantage over traditional T-cell therapies. UltraPorator®The UltraPorator system is an exclusive device and proprietary software solution for the scale-up of rapid and cost-effective manufacturing of UltraCAR-T therapies and potentially represents a major advancement over current electroporation devices by significantly reducing the processing time and contamination risk. The UltraPorator device is a high-throughput, semi-closed electroporation system for modifying T cells using Precigen's proprietary non-viral gene transfer technology. UltraPorator is being utilized for clinical manufacturing of Precigen's investigational UltraCAR-T therapies in compliance with current good manufacturing practices. AdenoVerse™ ImmunotherapyPrecigen's AdenoVerse immunotherapy platform utilizes a library of proprietary adenovectors for the efficient gene delivery of therapeutic effectors, immunomodulators, and vaccine antigens designed to modulate the immune system. Precigen's gorilla adenovectors, part of the AdenoVerse library, have potentially superior performance characteristics as compared to current competition. AdenoVerse immunotherapies have been shown to generate high-level and durable antigen-specific T-cell immune responses as well as an ability to boost these responses via repeat administration. Superior performance characteristics and high yield manufacturing of AdenoVerse vectors leveraging UltraVector® technology allows Precigen to engineer cutting-edge investigational gene therapies to treat complex diseases. AdenoVerse™ Immunotherapy Clinical ProgramPrecigen's AdenoVerse immunotherapy platform is currently under clinical investigation in a Phase 1/2 study of PRGN-2009 AdenoVerse immunotherapy alone or in combination with an anti-PDL1/TGF-Beta Trap in patients with HPV-associated cancers (NCT04432597), a Phase 2 study of PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab in newly diagnosed patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (NCT05996523), a Phase 2 study of PRGN-2009 AdenoVerse immunotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (NCT06157151), and a Phase 1/2 study of PRGN-2012 AdenoVerse immunotherapy in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (NCT04724980).

The company closed a $200 million financing, received FDA designations, and initiated new studies. Financially, TYRA has a pro-forma cash position of over $400 million.","Tyra Biosciences Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Highlights Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Tyra Biosciences, Inc. reports strong financials and progress in clinical development with TYRA-300, TYRA-200, and SURF301 studies. The company closed a $200 million financing, received FDA designations, and initiated new studies. Financially, TYRA has a pro-forma cash position of over $400 million. Positive TYRA reported positive financial results and recent corporate progress for 2023 and the start of 2024. The company closed a $200 million Private Placement Financing in February 2024, strengthening its financial position. TYRA-300 received FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of Achondroplasia. The SURF301 Phase 1/2 Study for Oncology is advancing, with initial results expected to be reported in the second half of 2024. TYRA is planning to initiate a Phase 2 Achondroplasia (ACH) Study and has already initiated the Phase 1 SURF201 Study for TYRA-200. The company's in-house precision medicine discovery engine, SNÅP, continues to progress in developing therapies for targeted oncology and genetically defined conditions. TYRA's financial data for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 showed increased net loss and expenses compared to the previous year. As of December 31, 2023, TYRA had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $203.5 million, which increased to approximately $403.5 million after the PIPE financing in February 2024. Negative - TYRA reported increased net loss and expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. - The company's financial results indicate a growing need for capital to support its clinical and operational milestones through at least 2026. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Tyra Biosciences, Inc. regarding their financial results and ongoing clinical studies presents a multifaceted perspective on the company's current status and future prospects. The substantial Private Placement Financing (PIPE) of approximately $200 million is a significant liquidity event, underscoring investor confidence and expanding the company's runway. This capital infusion, bolstering the pro-forma cash position to over $400 million, is pivotal for a biotech firm like Tyra, as it ensures adequate funding for their research and development activities through at least 2026.From a financial standpoint, the increased R&D expenses, which rose to $62.5 million in 2023 from $43.0 million in 2022, reflect the company's aggressive investment in its pipeline. This is particularly relevant for investors as it signals a strategic allocation of resources towards potential high-value indications, such as achondroplasia and various cancers, with the TYRA-300 and TYRA-200 compounds. However, the reported net loss widening from $55.3 million to $69.1 million year-over-year indicates that the company is still in a heavy investment phase, which is typical for clinical-stage biotech companies. Investors should weigh the potential long-term benefits of the company's current R&D spending against the short-term financial performance. Medical Research Analyst The progression of Tyra Biosciences' oncology studies, particularly the SURF301 and SURF201 Phase 1 studies, represents a critical step in the company's efforts to address unmet medical needs within oncology. The Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) biology is a promising target in cancer treatment and the company's focus on developing precision medicines in this area could potentially lead to breakthrough therapies. The ongoing trials aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), which are important for the subsequent stages of clinical development.Furthermore, the Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) Designation received from the FDA for TYRA-300 for achondroplasia treatment is noteworthy. This designation, along with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD), could provide certain regulatory and financial incentives, including a possible priority review voucher upon marketing approval. These designations are significant as they reflect regulatory acknowledgment of the potential benefit of TYRA-300 for a rare and serious condition, which could lead to expedited development and review processes. Market Research Analyst Investor sentiment towards Tyra Biosciences appears strong, considering the successful completion of a sizable PIPE and the participation of notable investors such as RA Capital Management and OrbiMed. The biotech sector often sees heightened investor interest in companies that demonstrate a clear path to clinical milestones and possess a robust pipeline with potential blockbuster therapies. Tyra's focus on FGFR biology taps into a niche but growing segment of precision medicine in oncology, which is gaining traction due to its promise of more effective and personalized treatments.Moreover, the company's in-house precision medicine discovery engine, SNÅP, could be a key differentiator in the long term, potentially enabling the rapid development of targeted therapies. As the industry continues to shift towards precision medicine, Tyra's technological capabilities and strategic focus might position it well within the competitive landscape. However, the market will be closely monitoring the upcoming data readouts in 2024, which will be pivotal in assessing the clinical viability of Tyra's pipeline and could significantly influence the company's valuation and stock performance. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM - Advanced SURF301 Phase 1 oncology study; Initial Phase 1 results to be reported in 2H 2024 -- TYRA-300 Phase 2 ACH IND submission on track for 2H 2024 -- Initiated SURF201 Phase 1 study and dosed first patient with TYRA-200 -- Strengthened balance sheet with approximately $200 million PIPE in Q1 2024; pro-forma cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $403.5 million - CARLSBAD, Calif., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tyra Biosciences, Inc.

Gambling.com Group Secures New $50 Million Credit Facility,2024-03-19T20:05:00.000Z,Moderate,Very Positive,"Gambling.com Group  (Nasdaq: GAMB) secured a new $50 million Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, enhancing financial flexibility for growth and shareholder value. The facility includes a $25 million revolving credit and term loan, with potential incremental increase. CFO Elias Mark highlighted the strong balance sheet and liquidity, aiming for organic and inorganic growth opportunities.","Gambling.com Group Secures New $50 Million Credit Facility Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Gambling.com Group (Nasdaq: GAMB) secured a new $50 million Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, enhancing financial flexibility for growth and shareholder value. The facility includes a $25 million revolving credit and term loan, with potential incremental increase. CFO Elias Mark highlighted the strong balance sheet and liquidity, aiming for organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The establishment of a new $50 million credit facility by Gambling.com Group with Wells Fargo is a strategic move that offers the company a more robust financial structure. The facility, split between a revolving credit and a term loan, provides the company with liquidity to support its ongoing operations and growth initiatives. The option to increase the facility by $10 million adds a layer of financial flexibility, potentially beneficial in capitalizing on market opportunities.From an investor's perspective, the terms of the credit are noteworthy. The interest rates tied to various benchmarks plus a margin reflect the cost of capital for the company. The Base Rate Loans are particularly interesting, as they are pegged to the highest of three rates, potentially increasing the cost of borrowing during periods of rising interest rates. The SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is a critical benchmark for dollar-denominated derivatives and loans and its usage here indicates compliance with recent shifts in financial regulations away from LIBOR.Overall, this move signals management's confidence in their growth trajectory and commitment to shareholder value. However, investors should keep an eye on how this debt impacts the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage, which could affect its financial health and stock performance in the long term. Market Research Analyst The online gambling industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing digitalization and the relaxation of regulatory constraints in various jurisdictions. Gambling.com Group's decision to secure additional funding through a credit facility suggests an aggressive pursuit of market share. The company's focus on both organic and inorganic growth indicates a potential for future acquisitions, which could consolidate its position in the industry.For stakeholders, the key question is how effectively Gambling.com Group can deploy this capital to drive revenue and EBITDA growth. The company's track record, as highlighted by the CFO, suggests a positive trend, but the competitive landscape of online gambling necessitates continuous innovation and strategic partnerships. The ability to settle deferred consideration also indicates a proactive approach to managing liabilities and optimizing the balance sheet.Investors should monitor the company's operational performance closely, as the benefits of this credit facility hinge on successful execution of growth strategies and the management of interest expenses. Legal Expert It's important to consider the legal implications of the new credit facility secured by Gambling.com Group. The terms outlined, including the maturity date and interest rate stipulations, are standard for such agreements. However, the facility's dependency on approval by Wells Fargo for incremental increases suggests a level of oversight and potential for renegotiation based on the company's financial performance.Moreover, the use of SOFR as a benchmark for Term SOFR Loans is indicative of the industry's transition away from LIBOR, which has been phased out due to regulatory scrutiny over its credibility and accuracy. This transition is a critical compliance aspect for financial contracts and could affect the company's financial strategy.Investors should be aware of the regulatory environment surrounding online gambling, as changes in legislation can significantly impact the operational scope and profitability of companies like Gambling.com Group. The legal landscape will continue to shape the strategies and risk profiles of companies in this sector. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gambling.com Group Limited (Nasdaq: GAMB) (“Gambling.com Group” or the “Company”), a leading provider of player acquisition services for the regulated global online gambling industry, today announced the closing of a new credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) in the principal amount of $50 million, comprised of a $25 million revolving credit facility and a $25 million term loan facility.

The study achieved a 70.8% median reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and a 71.3% responder rate in the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) on an intent to treat basis. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Nyxoah regarding the DREAM U.S. pivotal study highlights the potential for a significant advancement in the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The study's reported responder rates for Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) suggest that the Genio hypoglossal nerve stimulation system (HGNS) could offer a considerable improvement over current therapies. It's important to note that the responder rate is an indicator of the proportion of patients experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in their condition.From a medical research perspective, the median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8% is particularly noteworthy, as AHI is a widely used metric for assessing the severity of OSA. A reduction of this magnitude could have significant implications for patient health outcomes, including reduced risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders often associated with OSA. However, while the safety profile is described as favorable, the presence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in 8.7% of subjects, including device-related incidents, warrants a closer look to assess the risk-benefit ratio for potential patients. Financial Analyst The positive outcome of the DREAM study is likely to have a favorable impact on Nyxoah's market positioning and financial performance, especially with the potential FDA approval on the horizon. Investors should consider the size of the OSA market in the United States, which is substantial and growing due to increased awareness and diagnosis rates. The unique bilateral stimulation technology of the Genio system could enable Nyxoah to capture a significant market share, provided that the FDA approval process concludes successfully.However, the cost of commercialization and the competitive landscape should be taken into account. The company's ability to scale production, manage regulatory hurdles and penetrate the market against established treatments will be critical factors in realizing the potential revenue growth. Additionally, the timing of the FDA approval and the subsequent product launch will be key determinants of financial impact in the short term. Healthcare Market Analyst The Genio system's non-implanted battery solution and bilateral stimulation represent a technological innovation in the field of sleep apnea treatment, which may lead to increased adoption rates among patients dissatisfied with or unable to tolerate CPAP devices. The patient-centric design could be a differentiating factor that enhances patient compliance and treatment efficacy.Market acceptance will depend on several factors, including insurance coverage, healthcare provider endorsement and patient-reported outcomes. The commercial learnings from Europe will be instrumental in shaping the marketing strategy in the U.S. It is also essential to monitor how the competitive dynamics within the OSA treatment landscape evolve, as new technologies and treatments emerge. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM Nyxoah Announces DREAM U.S. Pivotal Study Meets Primary Endpoints Reports an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) responder rate of 63.5% on an intent to treat (ITT) basis (p=0.002)Reports an Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate of 71.3% on an intent to treat (ITT) basis (p<0.001)Median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8% Mont-Saint-Guibert, Belgium – March 19, 2024, 9:05pm CET / 4:05pm ET – Nyxoah SA (Euronext Brussels/Nasdaq: NYXH) (“Nyxoah” or the “Company”), a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), today announced the DREAM U.S. pivotal study achieved a statistically significant reduction in the co-primary endpoints of 12-month AHI responder rate, per the Sher criteria, and ODI responder rate, both on an ITT basis. The DREAM study is a pivotal trial, being conducted under an investigational device exemption (IDE) and is designed to support the marketing authorization of the Genio® hypoglossal nerve stimulation system (HGNS) in the United States. This multicenter, prospective, open-label, interventional study enrolled 115 patients and has co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) responder rate, per the Sher criteria, and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate, both measured at 12 months*. Subjects also were required to sleep supine for at least 60 minutes at their 12-month polysomnography test (PSG). More information regarding the study can be found in section 1.5.4 of the Company's annual report regarding financial year 2022, which can be found on the Company’s website using the following link: Nyxoah Annual Report 2022 EN.pdf. Study participants entered the DREAM study with a mean AHI of 28.0, mean ODI of 27.0 and mean body mass index of 28.5. At 12 months, 73 subjects were determined to be AHI responders, per the Sher criteria, resulting in an ITT AHI responder rate of 63.5% (p=0.002), and 82 subjects were determined to be ODI responders, resulting in an ODI responder rate of 71.3% (p<0.001). Subjects demonstrated a median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8%, with similar AHI improvements in supine and non-supine sleeping positions. The safety results for the investigational treatment were favorable, with 11 serious adverse events, or SAEs, in ten subjects resulting in an SAE rate of 8.7%. Out of the 11 SAEs, three were device related and there were three explants. “DREAM is a pivotal, multicenter, international study of Genio, a next generation HGNS technology offering patients bi-lateral stimulation with a non-implanted battery solution powered and controlled by a wearable. With the DREAM data, Genio has demonstrated positive efficacy results that OSA patients, having failed traditional medical therapies, have come to expect. Notably, Genio’s unique bilateral stimulation provides the potential for improved outcomes for a wider spectrum of OSA patients. I am excited that Nyxoah and Genio are working towards expanding options and advancing HGNS therapy for OSA, and I look forward to offering it to my patients upon FDA approval,” commented B Tucker Woodson, MD, Chief, Professor – Medical College of Wisconsin and Principal Investigator of the DREAM study.” “I am excited to report the positive DREAM results, as they pave the way for Genio to shift the OSA treatment paradigm in the U.S. With Genio’s patient centric design, strong clinical data and commercial learnings from Europe, we are confident Nyxoah can become a leading OSA company.” commented Olivier Taelman, Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are finalizing the fourth and final module submission in the PMA application and I look forward to launching Genio in the U.S, pending FDA approval.” Conference call and webcast presentation Company management will host a conference call to discuss the DREAM results today beginning at 9:30pm CET / 4:30pm ET.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported annual revenue growth of 360% and a 550% increase in self-mined Bitcoin for TeraWulf Inc. are indicative of robust financial performance and operational efficiency. The outperformance of company guidance on the cost of power further underscores management's ability to control operational costs, which is particularly significant in the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining. The reduction in net debt by 41% year-over-year and an additional 32% to $58.0 million as of February 2024 enhances the company's financial flexibility and reduces interest expense, potentially improving net income margins going forward.Moreover, the strategic expansion plans to increase operational capacity from 8 EH/s to 300 MW by the end of 2024 and further to 550 MW by the end of 2025, indicate an aggressive growth trajectory. This could be a positive signal to investors about the company's future revenue prospects, although it also implies significant capital expenditures that may affect short-term profitability. The current cash and Bitcoin holdings provide a cushion for these investments and operational expenditures.However, it is essential to consider the volatility of Bitcoin prices which can significantly impact the company's profitability. The company's reliance on the cryptocurrency market's performance is a potential risk factor for investors as fluctuations in Bitcoin value can lead to unpredictable revenues despite increases in mining capacity. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, TeraWulf's substantial growth in self-mining capacity and the reduction in power costs positions the company competitively within the cryptocurrency mining industry. With a cost of power well below industry norms, TeraWulf may have a competitive edge over other mining operations, particularly during periods of lower Bitcoin prices when cost efficiency becomes even more critical.The company's focus on zero-carbon energy sources also aligns with growing investor interest in environmentally sustainable practices. This could attract ESG-focused investors and potentially provide a buffer against regulatory risks associated with environmental concerns. The exploration of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications further diversifies the company's revenue streams and reduces dependency on Bitcoin mining alone.It is important to monitor industry trends, such as changes in global hash rates, regulatory developments in cryptocurrency and advancements in mining technology, as these factors can have significant implications for TeraWulf's market position and operational strategy. Economist The economic implications of TeraWulf's financial results extend beyond the company itself. The reported growth and operational efficiency improvements contribute to a broader understanding of the cryptocurrency mining sector's potential for scalability and profitability. The company's ability to reduce power costs to 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, significantly lower than the industry average, reflects advancements in energy efficiency and technological innovation within the sector.Furthermore, TeraWulf's debt reduction strategy and capital structure optimization are reflective of a broader trend in corporate finance where companies are seeking to strengthen their balance sheets in anticipation of potential economic downturns or increased market volatility. This prudent financial management is especially pertinent given the historically cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets.The company's investment in infrastructure and exploration of new technologies like AI and HPC also indicate a strategic pivot towards diversification, which can be seen as a microcosm of the broader economic shift towards digital and sustainable energy solutions. However, the capital-intensive nature of these investments and the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency valuation fluctuations must be carefully weighed against the potential long-term economic benefits. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM Annual Revenue Grows 360% Year-Over-Year; Annual BTC Self-Mined Increases 550% to 3,407 Reports Realized Cost of Power of 3.2 Cents Per Kilowatt Hour in 2023, Outperforming Company Guidance of 3.5 Cents Per Kilowatt Hour by 9% Self-Mining Operating Capacity Reaches 8 EH/s, More Than Quadrupling Capacity Since Beginning of 2023 Reports Current Cash and Bitcoin Holdings of $49 million as of February 29, 2024 EASTON, Md., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TeraWulf Inc.

Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 360% to $69.2 million compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue is attributable to a 550% increase in bitcoin production year-over-year following the energization of Building 2 (50 MW) in June. Building 3 (45 MW) was subsequently completed in December, bringing online capacity at the Lake Mariner facility to 160 MW. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $41.9 million (61% of revenue), as compared to $4.0 million (26% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $37.9 million (or 961%) resulting from the aforementioned increase in operational capacity. Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $71.3 million, as compared to $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cost of operations was primarily driven by higher depreciation expense due to the increase in mining operations at the Lake Mariner facility in 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $30.7 million, as compared to a loss of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, and February 29, 2024, the Company held $56.2 million and $49.1 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin on its balance sheet. As of the same periods, the Company had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $139.4 million and $106.0 million, respectively. The Company anticipates an additional repayment of approximately $30.0 million during the first week of April, thereby reducing the debt balance to $76.0 million.

Company presents adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s non-GAAP “Adjusted EBITDA” excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) costs related to non-routine regulatory activities, which costs management does not believe are reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; and (vi) gains and losses related to discontinued operations that are not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus. Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these items allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenue. The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating (loss) income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Preclinical data supports precision medicine strategy in ARID1A- and SMARCA-mutated cancers. Management will host a conference call at 4:30 pm ET today. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals regarding their progress on fadraciclib and plogosertib represents a significant milestone in the company's pipeline development. From a financial perspective, the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 studies is a pivotal moment that often leads to a reassessment of the drug's commercial potential and, consequently, the company's valuation. The specificity of Cyclacel's approach, targeting mutational profiles, aligns with current trends in precision medicine, which could lead to higher efficacy and market differentiation. However, investors should monitor the burn rate as clinical trials advance and consider the implications of potential capital raises on shareholder dilution.Moreover, the mention of final data from the fadraciclib 065-101 dose escalation study is of interest as it could influence the company's short-term stock volatility. Positive data could lead to investor optimism, whereas any setbacks might have a converse effect. Long-term, the success of these drugs could significantly alter Cyclacel's revenue projections and strategic partnerships, making it a company to watch in the oncology space. Oncology Doctor The clinical progress reported by Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals in the development of fadraciclib and plogosertib is notable for its potential impact on treatment paradigms in oncology. Fadraciclib's differentiation from other CDK inhibitors could offer therapeutic advantages, especially for patients with CDKN2A/CDKN2B alterations, which are common in several cancer types. The observed clinical activity in T cell lymphoma also suggests a broader applicability of the drug beyond solid tumors.For plogosertib, the focus on ARID1A- and SMARCA-mutated cancers is intriguing, given the unmet need in these patient populations. The switch to a new oral formulation with improved bioavailability could enhance patient compliance and treatment outcomes. As an oncologist, the transition of these drugs into later-stage trials is encouraging, but I remain cautiously optimistic until larger, controlled studies confirm their safety and efficacy profiles. Medical Research Analyst The progression of Cyclacel's pipeline drugs into later stages of clinical development is a critical indicator of their potential efficacy and safety. The pharmaceutical industry places considerable emphasis on Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies as they provide a more definitive signal of a drug's therapeutic benefit. Cyclacel's strategy to evaluate patient cohorts based on mutational profiles is aligned with the precision medicine approach, potentially increasing the likelihood of clinical success. This could lead to a competitive advantage if the drugs prove to be effective in these specific patient subgroups.Additionally, the company's plan to present at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024 is a strategic move to gain visibility within the scientific community and could attract collaboration or licensing opportunities. The preclinical data for plogosertib targeting ARID1A- and SMARCA-mutated cancers, while early, could open new avenues for treatment if the clinical hypothesis holds true in human studies. Close monitoring of these developments is important for stakeholders interested in the oncology sector's evolving landscape. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM – On Track to Start Oral Fadraciclib Phase 2 Proof of Concept in 1H 2024 – – Expect to Report Final Data from Fadraciclib 065-101 Dose Escalation – – Oral Plogosertib Preclinical Data Support Precision Medicine Strategy in ARID1A- and SMARCA-Mutated Cancers – – Management to Host Conference Call at 4:30 pm ET Today – BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYCC, NASDAQ: CYCCP; ""Cyclacel"" or the ""Company""), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines based on cancer cell biology, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and provided a business update. “Following the recently announced precision medicine strategy for oral fadraciclib, our CDK2/9 inhibitor, we have determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and are ready to start proof-of-concept studies,” said Spiro Rombotis, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We expect two key data readouts for fadraciclib this year. These include pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), safety and activity data from the dose escalation part of the 065-101 Phase 1/2 study. In addition, we expect to report initial clinical activity from the Phase 2 proof of concept part, evaluating cohorts of patients selected for their mutational profile and/or Phase 1 activity in various solid tumors and lymphoma. At the upcoming AACR Annual Meeting 2024, independent investigators will present preclinical proof-of-concept data for fadraciclib further demonstrating fadraciclib’s differentiated properties from other next generation CDK inhibitors.” “We have observed CDKN2A/CDKN2B alterations, including loss of function, in multiple, pretreated patients with various cancers, including gynecological, hepatobiliary, lung, and pancreatic, who benefitted from fadraciclib monotherapy. In addition, we have observed clinical activity in patients with T cell lymphoma,” said Brian Schwartz, M.D., interim Chief Medical Officer. ""We expect to report final Phase 1 results including details on patient genomic profiles at an upcoming medical conference. A precision medicine strategy is also emerging for plogosertib, our PLK1 inhibitor. Preclinical data from independent groups have shown that certain ARID1A- and SMARCA-mutated cancers may benefit from treatment with plogosertib. Before testing this hypothesis in our 140-101 dose escalation study, we plan to switch to a new oral formulation of plogosertib with improved bioavailability. We are excited about the potential precision medicine strategies for both our clinical programs, with initial data from the fadraciclib Phase 2 proof-of-concept study.""

(SLS) completes a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants, raising approximately $20 million for research and development activities. Positive SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. successfully closed a registered direct offering of 13,029,316 shares of common stock and warrants. The offering was priced at $1.535 per share with accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,029,316 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.41 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering amount to approximately $20 million. The net proceeds will be utilized for research and development activities, working capital, and general corporate purposes. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners served as the sole placement agent for the offering, while Maxim Group acted as a financial advisor to the Company. The offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the SEC. The private placement of the warrants was conducted in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D. Negative None. Financial Analyst The offering from SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. represents a significant capital infusion, amounting to approximately $20 million before expenses. This direct offering, coupled with the concurrent private placement of warrants, indicates a proactive approach in securing funds to fuel the company's research and development efforts. The pricing of the warrants at $1.41, which is below the offering price of the common stock, suggests an incentive for investors to participate while providing the company with a potential future capital source if the warrants are exercised.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, is a common strategy to strengthen a company's balance sheet. However, investors should be aware that the dilutive effect of increasing the number of shares could potentially depress the stock price in the short term. Long-term benefits, however, may be realized if the company successfully advances its cancer therapies, leading to increased shareholder value. Biotech Market Analyst In the biopharmaceutical industry, timely and efficient funding is essential for the progression of clinical trials and the development of new therapies. SELLAS' focus on a broad range of cancer indications could address significant unmet medical needs, potentially tapping into lucrative markets. The gross proceeds of $20 million are earmarked for research and development, which is a positive move for the company's pipeline progression.Investors typically look for companies with a clear path to market and a strong pipeline. SELLAS' ability to secure funding through a registered direct offering indicates investor confidence in its strategy and pipeline potential. However, it is important to monitor the company's burn rate and the progress of its clinical trials to assess the long-term sustainability of its business model. Legal Expert The legal framework utilized by SELLAS, including a shelf registration statement and reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the private placement, is a textbook approach for raising capital while complying with SEC regulations. Investors should note that the securities issued in the private placement are subject to restrictions on resale, which could limit liquidity for those particular shares.Furthermore, the fact that the offering was priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules provides transparency and fairness in the pricing mechanism. It is important for investors to review the prospectus supplement filed with the SEC to understand the specific terms of the offering and the associated risks. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.

The merger agreement includes a cash price per share of $2.5879 for Kinnate stockholders, with the Offer extended until April 2, 2024. The acquisition is subject to certain conditions and is expected to close in April 2024. Positive XOMA to acquire Kinnate Biopharma Inc. for $2.5879 per share Approximately $9.5 million to be added to XOMA's balance sheet Offer extended until April 2, 2024 Kinnate stockholders holding 46% of shares have signed support agreements for the merger Acquisition expected to close in April 2024 Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Kinnate Biopharma by XOMA Corporation represents a strategic consolidation within the biopharmaceutical industry. The addition of $9.5 million in cash to XOMA's balance sheet is a significant liquidity boost. However, the impact on the company's financial health should be assessed in the context of the acquisition cost and the potential for the early-stage programs to contribute to XOMA's royalty portfolio. The use of non-tradeable contingent value rights (CVRs) is an innovative approach to financing acquisitions, aligning the interests of Kinnate's shareholders with the future success of the programs.The tender offer at $2.5879 per share, inclusive of the maximum additional cash amount, is a pivotal detail for Kinnate's shareholders. The support of approximately 46% of Kinnate's shareholders indicates a positive reception to the terms. For current and potential investors in XOMA, the extended offer period may reflect due diligence in securing the necessary majority and ensuring all conditions are met. It's essential to monitor the tender process completion and the subsequent merger, as they will determine the immediate financial impact and integration efficacy. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, XOMA's acquisition of Kinnate could signal a broader trend of consolidation in the biotech sector, which may affect competitive dynamics. The strategic value of adding several early-stage programs could position XOMA favorably if these programs lead to successful treatments and subsequent royalty streams. However, the inherent risks associated with drug development must be considered, as early-stage programs have a lower probability of reaching market approval.The transaction's structure with CVRs allows XOMA to potentially mitigate some of these risks by tying a portion of the acquisition cost to the future success of Kinnate's programs. This could be an attractive proposition for investors, as it suggests a level of confidence in the acquired assets' value. Nonetheless, the true impact on the market will only be measurable in the long term, based on the successful development and commercialization of the acquired programs. Legal Expert The legal implications of the merger agreement between XOMA and Kinnate, particularly the provision of CVRs, are noteworthy. CVRs are a complex financial instrument that requires careful structuring to ensure compliance with securities laws and fair treatment of all shareholders. The rights of shareholders who properly demanded appraisal under Delaware law must also be considered, as this could affect the final cost of the acquisition for XOMA.The extension of the tender offer indicates a meticulous approach to satisfying all legal prerequisites for the merger. For stakeholders, the adherence to these legal frameworks provides a layer of security regarding the transaction's legitimacy. The successful navigation of these legal complexities can set a precedent for similar future transactions within the industry. 03/19/2024 - 04:05 PM Upon closing, XOMA anticipates adding approximately $9.5 million in cash to its balance sheet and several early-stage programs to potentially add to its royalty portfolioEMERYVILLE, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As previously announced on February 16, 2024, XOMA Corporation (“XOMA” or the “Company”; Nasdaq: XOMA) entered into a merger agreement to acquire Kinnate Biopharma Inc. (“Kinnate”; Nasdaq: KNTE) for (i) a base cash price per share of Kinnate common stock of $2.3352 per share and (ii) an additional cash amount of not more than $0.2527 per share (together with the base price, the Cash Amount), plus one non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) representing the right to receive 85% of the net proceeds from any out license or sale of Kinnate programs effected within one year of closing of the merger and 100% of the net proceeds from any out license or sale executed prior to the closing. On March 4, 2024, XOMA commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Kinnate common stock (“the Offer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, based upon Kinnate’s estimated calculation of cash, net of transaction costs, wind-down costs and other liabilities at closing, the additional cash amount has been determined to be the maximum $0.2527 per share. Therefore, the Cash Amount that Kinnate stockholders will receive in the Offer is $2.5879 per share. Additionally, XOMA has extended the Offer’s expiration date, so that the Offer and related withdrawal rights will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on April 2, 2024, unless the expiration date is further extended in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Stockholders who previously have tendered their shares do not need to re-tender their shares or take any other action in response to the determination of the additional cash amount or extension of the Offer. As previously announced, Kinnate stockholders holding approximately 46% of Kinnate common stock have signed support agreements to tender their shares in the Offer prior to the expiration date and support the merger. The closing of the Offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of Kinnate common stock representing at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares, the availability of at least $120.0 million of cash, net of transaction costs, wind-down costs, and other liabilities, at closing, and other customary closing conditions. Promptly following the closing of the Offer, Kinnate will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of XOMA, and all remaining shares not tendered in the Offer, other than shares held in treasury by Kinnate or shares owned by a stockholder who was entitled to and properly demanded appraisal of such shares pursuant to Delaware law, will be converted into the right to receive the same cash and CVR consideration per share as is provided in the Offer. The acquisition is expected to close in April 2024.

The offering includes Anaphylm™ for severe allergic reactions and Libervant™ for seizure clusters. Positive None. Negative The dilution effect on existing shareholders due to the public offering of common stock. Potential market reaction to the offering and its impact on stock price volatility. Financial Analyst The public offering by Aquestive Therapeutics, with an aim to raise $75 million through the sale of approximately 16.7 million shares, is a strategic move to bolster the company's financial position. The pricing of shares at $4.50 indicates a calculated approach to attract investors while trying to minimize dilution for current shareholders. The capital raised is earmarked for development and commercialization of their key products, Anaphylm™ and Libervant™, which could potentially lead to increased market share and revenue streams in the pharmaceutical sector. However, investors should be mindful of the potential risks associated with such offerings. The dilution of shares might negatively impact the stock price in the short term. Additionally, the success of the products in the pipeline is not guaranteed and the company's performance will be closely tied to their market acceptance and the competitive landscape. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Aquestive's focus on innovative delivery technologies for severe allergic reactions and epilepsy represents a targeted approach in niche medical markets. The demand for fast-acting, user-friendly treatments like sublingual and buccal films is growing, as they offer advantages over traditional delivery methods. If Anaphylm™ and Libervant™ capture a significant portion of their respective markets, this could translate into substantial revenue growth for Aquestive. Nevertheless, the market's response to the public offering and the potential increase in share count will need to be observed. The company's ability to meet its development milestones and manage the increased capital efficiently will be critical in maintaining investor confidence. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The allocation of the net proceeds towards the development of Anaphylm™ and Libervant™ is a clear indication of Aquestive's commitment to its product pipeline. These products address critical medical conditions and the successful commercialization of such treatments could lead to a significant competitive edge. Particularly, the pediatric indication for Libervant™ could meet an underserved need in the epilepsy market. Investors should consider the regulatory hurdles and the time-to-market for these products. The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and any delays in FDA approval or unexpected clinical trial results could impact the projected use of funds and the company's growth trajectory. 03/19/2024 - 09:49 PM WARREN, N.J., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc.

Trading under the ticker symbol 'ALAB' on Nasdaq begins on March 20, 2024.","Astera Labs Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary Astera Labs, Inc. announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 19,800,000 shares of common stock at $36.00 per share, expecting gross proceeds of approximately $604.4 million. The offering includes shares from Astera Labs and existing stockholders, with underwriters having an option to purchase additional shares. Trading under the ticker symbol 'ALAB' on Nasdaq begins on March 20, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Astera Labs is a significant event in the semiconductor industry, indicating the market's appetite for investment in technology firms specializing in connectivity solutions for data-centric systems. The pricing of shares at $36.00 suggests a strong valuation by the underwriters, reflecting investor confidence and the company's growth potential. This IPO could serve as a bellwether for other tech companies considering going public, especially within the semiconductor sector.The gross proceeds of approximately $604.4 million, before expenses, provide Astera Labs with substantial capital to accelerate its R&D, expand its product portfolio and potentially pursue strategic acquisitions. However, the fact that Astera Labs will not benefit from the sale of existing stockholders' shares is a common arrangement in IPOs, meant to provide liquidity for early investors without diluting the capital raised for the company's use. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the IPO's success hinges on Astera Labs' ability to deploy the raised capital effectively to generate growth and profitability. Investors will scrutinize the company's subsequent quarterly earnings reports for evidence of efficient capital utilization. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could indicate further confidence in the stock's performance post-IPO, potentially stabilizing the stock price in the volatile early days of trading.It's important to note the role of the underwriters and co-managers in this IPO. The presence of top-tier banks like Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, alongside a broad array of co-managers, suggests a robust interest in ensuring a wide distribution of shares and a successful market debut. The involvement of these institutions can also be seen as a stamp of credibility for Astera Labs.

Financial Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Intelligent Group Limited represents a significant milestone for the company, signaling both a new phase of capital financing and a vote of confidence from institutional investors. The pricing of the IPO at $4 per share, resulting in expected net proceeds of approximately $6.2 million, is a key factor for potential investors. It's important to assess the company's valuation in the context of the industry average Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and the growth prospects outlined by the management.Investors would be interested in how the proceeds are intended to be used. The earmarking of funds for technology development and commercialization indicates a forward-looking strategy, focusing on growth and expansion. However, the market will watch closely for how effectively the company deploys these funds to generate revenue and whether it can achieve profitability in line with projections.Furthermore, the 45-day option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares could potentially dilute the stock’s value or provide a safety net against market volatility post-IPO. The involvement of reputable legal counsel and underwriters like WestPark Capital, Inc. also adds a layer of credibility to the Offering. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the entry of Intelligent Group Limited into the Nasdaq Capital Market could attract attention from investors interested in the financial public relations sector. The company's performance post-IPO will likely be scrutinized for indications of the sector's health and investor sentiment towards new market entrants. It's important to analyze the demand for the company's offerings in the current economic climate and how it stands against competitors.Additionally, the timing of the IPO could be influenced by market conditions. A bullish market may welcome new IPOs with increased enthusiasm, while a bearish market could result in a more tepid response. Tracking the stock's performance after it begins trading will provide insights into the immediate market reaction and the confidence investors have in the company's future prospects. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the involvement of multiple legal counsels, including Loeb & Loeb LLP and Haneberg Hurlbert PLC, underscores the complexity and importance of compliance with regulatory requirements in IPOs. The role of Ogier as British Virgin Islands legal counsel indicates a cross-jurisdictional element to the IPO, which may involve additional regulatory hurdles and considerations.The effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form F-1 and the role of the SEC in declaring it effective is a critical step in the IPO process, ensuring that all necessary disclosures and legal requirements have been met.

Announces Anticipated Late Filing of Financial Statements Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kolibri Global Energy Inc. announces potential delay in filing audited financial statements for 2023, applies for Management Cease Trade Order, and engages new auditor for NASDAQ listing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The delay in filing annual financial statements by Kolibri Global Energy Inc. suggests potential issues in the financial reporting process, which can be concerning for investors. The application for a Management Cease Trade Order indicates the company is taking regulatory compliance seriously, aiming to prevent insider trading during the period of uncertainty. This could be seen as a measure to maintain market integrity, though it also highlights the gravity of the delay.Investors should monitor the bi-weekly default status reports as they may contain critical updates on the company's financial health and any emerging risks. The inability of insiders to trade shares could stabilize the stock price in the short term; however, the transparency of these reports will be key for long-term investor confidence. The engagement of Marcum LLP, a firm with NASDAQ experience, may enhance credibility once the filings are complete, but until then, the market may react to the uncertainty with increased volatility in Kolibri's share price. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the delay in Kolibri Global Energy's financial reporting could influence investor perception of the energy sector, particularly for companies listed on multiple exchanges. Investors often look for consistent and timely financial disclosures to gauge a company's performance and reliability. The extended timeline for filing, set to no later than May 31, 2024, creates a prolonged period of uncertainty that could affect not only the company's stock but also the sector's attractiveness.Additionally, the situation may prompt investors to scrutinize the audit processes of other energy firms, especially those with recent listings or auditor changes. While the delay is not indicative of financial instability, as the company is not undergoing insolvency proceedings, it places the company's operational efficiency under question. The market's reaction once the filings are made will be telling of the overall confidence in the company's management and financial practices. Legal Expert The legal implications of Kolibri Global Energy's filing delay and the subsequent MCTO are significant. The MCTO is a preventative measure that can mitigate legal risks associated with insider trading during periods of non-compliance with disclosure requirements. It is a clear indicator that the company is navigating within the legal frameworks set by Canadian securities laws and the British Columbia Securities Commission.Investors should be aware that the MCTO restricts certain insiders from trading, which can be a double-edged sword. It is a protective legal step, but also a signal that there may be material information not yet disclosed to the public. Compliance with NP 12-203's alternative information guidelines demonstrates a commitment to transparency, but any deviations or additional delays could have legal ramifications and further erode investor trust. 03/19/2024 - 10:00 PM THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kolibri Global Energy Inc. (the ""Company"") announced today that it will likely miss its filing deadline of April 2, 2024 to file audited annual financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis and related CEO and CFO certificates for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 (collectively, the ""Annual Filings""), as required under applicable Canadian securities laws. In connection with the Company's inability to file the Annual Filings on time, the Company has applied for a Management Cease Trade Order (""MCTO"") under National Policy 12-203 – Management Cease Trade Orders (""NP 12-203"") and is waiting for the British Columbia Securities Commission approval. The Company recently engaged Marcum LLP as the Company’s new auditor due to the Company’s listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The Company and Marcum LLP are performing their due diligence and procedures to meet regulatory requirements. The additional time will provide its auditors with the opportunity to thoroughly perform their audit procedures. This approach underscores the Company's commitment to maintaining rigorous financial compliance and ensuring the highest levels of accuracy and transparency for its shareholders. The Company expects to file the Annual Filings as soon as they are available and by no later than May 31, 2024. The Company will issue a news release once the Annual Filings have been filed. Until the Company files the Annual Filings, it will comply with the alternative information guidelines set out in NP 12-203. The guidelines, among other things, require the Company to issue bi-weekly default status reports, in the form of news releases, for so long as the Annual Filings have not been filed. During the MCTO, the general investing public will continue to be able to trade in the Company's common shares listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange. However, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and such other directors, officers and persons as determined by the applicable regulatory authorities will not be able to trade in the Company's common shares, nor will the Company be able to, directly or indirectly, issue securities to or acquire securities from an insider or employee of the Company except in accordance with legally binding obligations to do so existing as of April 2, 2023, being the date of the Company’s anticipated continuous disclosure default.

Sunrise Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Notification Regarding Minimum Bid Price Requirement,2024-03-20T00:55:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Sunrise New Energy Co.,  (NASDAQ: EPOW) received a Notification Letter from Nasdaq stating it no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.

The Company has 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum bid price of US$1.00 for 10 consecutive business days. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The notice received by Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd. from Nasdaq regarding the minimum bid price requirement is a signal to investors about potential liquidity and valuation concerns. While this does not immediately affect the company's listing, it does put the company on notice for potential delisting if the issue is not resolved within the given timeframe. Investors often view such notices as a red flag, which can influence stock performance and investor confidence.From a market perspective, the underlying concern is whether the company can improve its stock price organically through business performance or if it will resort to measures like a reverse stock split to maintain compliance. The latter can sometimes be seen as a cosmetic fix, which might not bode well for long-term investor sentiment. The stock's ability to meet the minimum bid price consistently over 10 consecutive business days will be a key indicator to watch. Financial Analyst For Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd., the notification from Nasdaq is a financial hurdle that could have implications for its access to capital. Companies listed on major exchanges are perceived as more credible and delisting can affect their ability to raise funds. Additionally, institutional investors and index funds often have mandates to invest in listed stocks, so a delisting could lead to a sell-off from these stakeholders.The company's next steps are crucial; they must either improve their financial health to boost investor confidence and stock price or explore strategic alternatives to regain compliance. The company's statement about monitoring the stock price and considering options suggests they might already be weighing strategies such as financial restructuring or strategic partnerships. Investment Advisor The notification from Nasdaq serves as a cautionary note for both current and potential investors in Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd. It's important to differentiate between the stock's market performance and the company's operational health. While the company states that its business operations are unaffected, investors should closely monitor the company's fundamentals and any strategic moves it makes to address the stock price issue.Investors should consider the broader market dynamics affecting renewable energy companies and how these might influence Sunrise's stock price recovery. Diversification in investment portfolios is key in such situations to manage risk. Furthermore, the company's response to this challenge could serve as an indicator of the management's capability to navigate financial distress, which is valuable information for investors' long-term decision-making. 03/19/2024 - 08:55 PM ZIBO, China, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd. (“Sunrise”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) (NASDAQ: EPOW), today announced that it has received a letter (the ""Notification Letter"") from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") on March 14, 2024, notifying the Company that it no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Notification Letter has no immediate impact on the listing or trading of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq. The Notification Letter does not affect the Company’s business operations, its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements, or contractual obligations.

Based on the closing bid price of the Company's Class A ordinary shares for the 30 consecutive business days from January 30, 2024 to March 14, 2024, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at this time.

The offering is managed by top financial firms and follows SEC regulations.,"Athene Prices $1,000,000,000 Investment Grade Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Athene Holding announced the sale of $1 billion in senior notes due 2054 to support general corporate purposes and organic growth. The offering is managed by top financial firms and follows SEC regulations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $1 billion in senior notes with a 6.25% interest rate by Athene Holding Ltd. is a significant move that could indicate the company's strategy for capital allocation and long-term financing. Considering the current interest rate environment, a 6.25% rate could be seen as relatively high, suggesting that Athene is willing to pay a premium to secure long-term funding. This could be indicative of the company's confidence in its future cash flows and ability to cover the interest payments.Investors might interpret this as a positive signal for the company's growth prospects, given that the proceeds are earmarked for supporting organic growth within its insurance subsidiaries. However, it's also important to note that such a move increases the company's leverage, which could impact its credit ratings and financial flexibility in the future. The involvement of top-tier investment banks as book-runners and lead managers also adds a layer of credibility to the offering. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the decision by Athene to issue senior notes can be seen as a response to the current market conditions and investor appetite for fixed-income securities. The demand for such securities, especially from reputable issuers, is often driven by the search for yield in a low interest rate environment, despite recent hikes. The choice of a long-dated maturity in 2054 suggests that Athene is locking in current rates in anticipation of potential interest rate fluctuations.Furthermore, the distribution of roles among the various financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank Securities and Goldman Sachs, as joint book-runners and others as joint lead managers, reflects a strategic approach to tap into different investor bases and ensure a successful capital raise. This also shows Athene's understanding of the capital market dynamics and its ability to navigate through complex financial operations. Insurance Industry Analyst In the context of the insurance industry, Athene's move to bolster its capital through a senior notes offering is a strategic approach to strengthen its capital base for supporting growth initiatives. Insurance companies often require substantial capital to underwrite new policies and expand their business. By contributing capital to its insurance subsidiaries, Athene is likely positioning itself to take advantage of market opportunities and meet regulatory capital requirements.It is also important to consider the potential implications of this capital injection on Athene's competitive positioning within the insurance market. The ability to raise a significant amount of capital in this manner could provide Athene with a competitive edge, allowing it to invest in technology, expand its product offerings, or improve its underwriting capabilities. 03/19/2024 - 06:56 PM WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athene Holding Ltd.

The solution aims to manage Consumer Energy Resources like rooftop solar and battery storage to maintain network stability amidst the energy transition challenges in Australia.","Itron Unveils Cutting-Edge Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management System (LV DERMS) for Australian Market at Energy Networks 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Itron, Inc. introduces its innovative Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management Solution (LV DERMS) for Australian utilities at the Energy Networks Conference. The solution aims to manage Consumer Energy Resources like rooftop solar and battery storage to maintain network stability amidst the energy transition challenges in Australia. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The introduction of Itron's Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management Solution (LV DERMS) in the Australian market is a strategic move in response to the country's increasing adoption of Consumer Energy Resources (CERs) such as rooftop solar and battery storage. With over 30% rooftop solar penetration and a shift away from base-load coal, Australia is at the forefront of energy transition, making the stability and efficiency of the low-voltage network a pressing concern for utilities.From an energy market perspective, the ability of LV DERMS to provide Centralised Control and Visibility and Dynamic System State Estimation is significant. These features enable utilities to manage the grid more effectively by understanding real-time constraints and forecasting future scenarios. This is particularly important in a market that is moving towards a decentralized model with a high penetration of CERs. The solution's emphasis on real-time data and forecasting aligns with the broader trend in the energy sector towards data-driven decision-making.Furthermore, the Energy Market Participation functionality indicates a shift towards a more integrated and dynamic energy market. By facilitating a consistent interface for aggregator relationships and DOE compliance, Itron's LV DERMS could streamline the process for utilities to interact with the market and manage distributed energy resources. This is likely to become increasingly important as electric vehicle adoption grows and further strains the grid. Renewable Energy Technology Specialist The deployment of Itron's LV DERMS in Australia represents a technological advancement in the management of distributed energy resources within a low-voltage network. The integration of Distributed Intelligence into the LV DERMS is a critical feature that allows for autonomous control at the edge of the grid. This decentralized approach is essential for managing the complexity and variability introduced by high volumes of CERs.Technologically, the use of GridQube's DSSE engine for state estimation is a notable improvement over traditional power flow models, especially in the context of low-voltage networks where data hierarchy can be imperfect. The ability to provide reliable, real-time results is a game-changer for utilities that need to ensure network stability amid fluctuating energy generation and consumption patterns.Additionally, the Enhanced DOE Compliance Validation feature is an important development for ensuring that individual premises adhere to the dynamic operating envelopes, which are critical for maintaining grid integrity. The technological advancements in Itron's LV DERMS are likely to set a precedent for future solutions in the renewable energy sector, emphasizing the importance of real-time data processing and distributed control mechanisms. Environmental Policy Analyst The introduction of Itron's LV DERMS aligns with Australia's environmental policy goals of decarbonization and increased reliance on renewable energy sources. By providing utilities with advanced tools for managing CERs, Itron's solution could potentially accelerate the country's transition towards a cleaner energy mix.The policy implications of this technology are far-reaching. With the Proven Scalability of Itron's platforms, utilities are better equipped to handle the increased load from CERs without compromising on network stability. This is important for meeting future scalability requirements as Australia moves towards its decarbonization targets.The capability of Itron's LV DERMS to adapt to market reforms suggests a broader trend of regulatory frameworks evolving to accommodate new technologies and market participants. This could lead to more efficient energy markets and a greater emphasis on sustainability in policy decisions. As such, Itron's solution is not just a technological innovation but also a facilitator of policy progress in the renewable energy landscape. 03/19/2024 - 06:00 PM Itron LV DERMS to Deliver New Functionalities for Australian Utilities to Better Manage Generation Resources LIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ: ITRI), which is innovating new ways for utilities and cities to manage energy and water, is unveiling its Low Voltage Distributed Energy Resource Management Solution (LV DERMS) for the Australian market at the Energy Networks Conference, taking place in Adelaide, Australia, from March 19-21, 2024. Itron’s innovative solution delivers a unique, data-driven method for managing Consumer Energy Resources (CERs), such as rooftop solar or battery storage, while maintaining network stability within the low-voltage network. Australia has over 30% rooftop solar penetration, an aggressive plan to reduce base-load coal and a growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs). The challenges of the coming energy transition will result in grid instability originating in the LV network, which must be addressed. The top-down model-based solutions that are commonly used to address this challenge do not provide the necessary information for balancing the changes CERs will cause in the LV network. Itron’s LV DERMS applies a bottom-up approach and, when integrated with existing back-office systems such as an advanced distribution management system (ADMS), it’s designed to shift the planning and operating risks caused by CERs into opportunities, through the core and unique capabilities of the solution that include: Centralised Control and Visibility – Insight into the capabilities of CERs within the LV network and orchestration based on real-time understanding of state, forecast and constraints. Itron’s LV DERMS can be scaled and adapted as the scale of CERs requires market reforms from emergency back stop mandates to adoption of non-wires alternatives applied across multiple market roles. Dynamic System State Estimation (DSSE) – Itron’s LV DERMS solution uses GridQube’s DSSE engine for the validation of LV topology and real-time calculation of constraints and Dynamic Operating Envelopes (DOEs). In contrast to power flow models, state estimation techniques are uniquely well suited to LV applications as they produce reliable results, in real-time, even in the face of imperfect hierarchy data. State of the Art Forecasting – The same Itron engines that today provide real-time operational forecasts for the National Energy Market and the Wholesale Electricity Market are used in Itron’s LV DERMS to forecast from high-voltage to the premise and are applied to operations, DOE generation and scenario analysis. Enhanced DOE Compliance Validation – Itron’s LV DERMS is uniquely able to validate premise-level DOE compliance in near real-time within constrained areas of the LV network. Energy Market Participation – Itron’s LV DERMS provides a consistent single market-facing interface for: Tracking standing aggregator relationships for all CERs to ensure accurate, near real-time publishing of DOEs to the market responsible participant. An extension of Itron’s Australian Market Transaction System, Distributed Energy Resource Publisher provides tracking of standing aggregator relationships for all CERs and NMIs to ensure distribution of DOEs and other data to the appropriate responsible party. Enabling the key interface for connecting to aggregators and CERs in real-time with a IEEE 2030.5 CSIP-AUS utility server that provides premise level messaging and reporting for field CER assets. Proven Scalability – Today, Itron’s platforms regularly collect and process data from millions of LV network devices and CERs in a single instance. With this strong foundation, Itron’s solutions can help utilities be well advanced in meeting the future scalability requirements in Australia towards full decarbonization. Empowering LV DERMS with Distributed Intelligence - As utilities progress toward full decarbonization, the number and variety of CERs is projected to increase dramatically. Native integration to Itron’s distributed intelligence platform enables LV DERMS to be pushed to the edge of the grid in a highly distributed architecture enabling autonomous control to balance the LV network cost efficiently. “Australia’s plan for decarbonization is unique in its heavy reliance on rooftop solar and the number of market participants that must be coordinated to make it work. As a company that spends time solving problems at the edge of the LV network, Itron has developed a unique set of capabilities to deliver increasingly real-time outcomes based on actual measurement data, to enable utilities to control and balance the LV network,” said Paul Nelsen, vice president of Customer and Market Experience, APAC at Itron. “Over the past 20 years, Itron has worked closely with our utility customers to address several step-changes in scale and complexity driven by Australian market reforms. Itron’s LV DERMS is specifically tailored to bring together the global and local technologies to address Australia’s unique needs for CER optimization in the LV network.” To explore these solutions and to learn more about the LV DERMS or Distributed Intelligence for Australia, visit Itron in booth #81 at Energy Networks in Adelaide, Australia, from March 19-21, 2024.

The offering includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares. Borse Dubai will receive all proceeds, holding approximately 10.8% to 10.1% of Nasdaq's outstanding shares. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The secondary offering of Nasdaq's common stock by Borse Dubai is a significant liquidity event that may influence Nasdaq's stock price in the short term. The pricing at $59.00 per share provides a clear reference point for the market, potentially affecting investor perception of Nasdaq's valuation. The size of the offering, representing a substantial share of Nasdaq's outstanding stock, could lead to increased volatility as the market absorbs the additional shares.Furthermore, Borse Dubai's post-offering ownership stake is a factor for consideration. A reduction in ownership from approximately 10.8% to 10.1% if the underwriters' option is exercised in full indicates a potential shift in the influence that Borse Dubai may wield over Nasdaq's corporate decisions. Investors would do well to monitor any strategic changes that might follow this realignment of ownership. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the secondary offering, it's noteworthy that Nasdaq will not receive any proceeds from the sale. This indicates that the offering is purely for Borse Dubai to liquidate part of its holdings, rather than Nasdaq raising capital for operational needs or growth initiatives. Investors should consider the implications of this cash infusion for Borse Dubai and whether it signals any strategic moves on their part.It's also important to evaluate the role of the underwriters, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, in stabilizing the offering price. Their ability to manage the sale and possibly exercise the over-allotment option could be indicative of institutional confidence in Nasdaq's stock, potentially impacting investor sentiment.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders, each a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating ZTO's operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to its U.S. GAAP financial measures are shown in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details about the non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders help identify underlying trends in ZTO's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses and gains that the Company includes in income from operations and net income. The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by ZTO's management in its financial and operational decision-making. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share attributable to ordinary shareholders presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to ZTO's data. ZTO encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Greenfield projects Pitbull and Zenaida in Chile rank lower than BC exploration portfolio. Interra plans to divest projects in Chile due to high overhead costs and unfavorable government policies. 03/19/2024 - 05:55 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 19, 2024) - Interra Copper Corp. (CSE: IMCX) (OTCQB: IMIMF) (FSE: 3MX) (""Interra"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to issue the following letter from its Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Rick Gittleman, updating shareholders on the Company's plans for unlocking value from its assets while executing on a prudent yet strategic work plan in 2024.To our fellow shareholders of Interra Copper Corp.,I'm writing to you today with great enthusiasm for a busy and productive 2024. Over the year, Interra's leadership will be focused on maximizing shareholder value through exploration on multiple projects and initiatives. The team has spent time prioritizing and re-evaluating the Company's projects - re-interpreting data to identify the best targets and regions within those projects. The overall goal was to determine optimal exploration programs and to also eliminate non-productive assets and costs that are generating no real value for the Company.We ended 2023 on a positive note - closing on a multi-round non-brokered flow-through private placement financing raising C$1.14 million in December 2023 and positioning the Company for near term exploration work in British Columbia. We are especially excited to put this money to work and commence exploration at the Rip Copper-Molybdenum Project, the newest addition to our exploration assets. In December 2023, in connection with the Rip Project, we acquired an option for up to an 80% earn-in and joint venture agreement with ArcWest Exploration Inc. Rip's geological attributes make a compelling case for prioritized exploration. The fully permitted exploration project is located in central British Columbia (BC), an established mining region on Canada's west coast, and situated in a prolific belt of Late Cretaceous intrusions (Bulkley Plutonic Suite), host to numerous past producing mines and well-known Copper and Molybdenum deposits, such as Huckelberry, Endako, Granisle and Granduc.Together with our partner, ArcWest, we have begun to develop a significant exploration plan for the Rip Project. New work, completed in late 2023, included a modest till cover geochemical sampling program. Follow-up work to aid with drill target definition will include a drone supported high resolution magnetic survey in addition to a 3D Induced Polarization survey this summer. The Rip technical committee is also currently in the process of finalizing options and costs for a modest drill program based on an assumption of success with the early exploration. Interra has flow-through qualified CEE ""Canadian Exploration Expenses"" funds available to support both of our BC projects, with funds not going to Rip in 2024 to be dedicated to our other exciting BC porphyry project, the Thane Project.Our 100% owned Thane Project is a district scale copper-gold project covering a 20,658-hectare concession within the Quesnel Terrane in Northern British Columbia. The Quesnel Terrane is a prolific porphyry belt with significant copper, gold, silver, molybdenum mineralization. Thane sits amongst existing mines and other known significant deposits, such as Centerra Gold's Mt. Milligan Mine and Kemess North Deposits, North-west Copper's Kwanika and Stardust and Pacific Ridge's Kliyul Deposits and the Company classifies it as underexplored. Six mineralized copper-gold target areas have been identified to date and in late 2023 Interra engaged in an independent review to re-assess past work and re-interpret the project data with a view to an integrated life of project dataset and a new strategy for discovery. Our consultant has extensive and relevant experience with Northern Cordillera copper-gold systems both as a senior exploration specialist with major mining companies and with specific direct experience in the district surrounding Thane Project as a technical adviser on the same style of deposits Thane has the potential to host.Based upon the results of the review, we are anticipating work contemplated for 2024 will include both ortho-imagery and high-resolution topographical surveys to support field reviews and targeted rock geochemistry to help vector towards mineral centres. This work will be focused on maximizing the use of previously invested data and ensuring a well thought out systematic discovery program can be developed for the next phase of work. This next stage of work is expected to include detailed magnetic geophysical surveys and focused geological mapping of the mineralization and alteration of specific copper-gold target zones to prepare for discovery drilling. Given the large size of the property and multiple mineral centres identified to date, Interra has also begun a search for a senior company partner in order to accelerate these plans and provide support to a longer-term discovery strategy to maximize the value of the asset. Exploration plan details for 2024 will be shared with the market in the coming weeks.While Thane is fully permitted for all planned work in 2024, ahead of this work, we have continued previous discussions with local First Nations representatives to ensure open and transparent communication with the Nations and local communities and to allow for integration of traditional territories. Interra is committed to responsible exploration in the regions in which we operate and we look forward to working closely with local First Nations and partners as we further advance our assets in this region.Chile has proven to be of decreasing attractiveness especially over the past twelve to eighteen months, culminating with what amounts to a burdensome ""tax"" on exploration ventures and capital. Management does not see this policy improving anytime soon. Our drilling program at Tres Marias yielded no positive results. Pitbull and Zenaida are greenfield projects in very early stages of exploration which technically rank lower than our BC exploration portfolio. Unfortunately, the government of Chile this year increased significantly the annual claim fees that need to be paid to maintain the concessions; claim fees that amount to unacceptable overhead costs to the Company and that represent a drastic increase from previous years. Accordingly, based upon the results at Tres Marias, the Interra board of directors (Board) has consented to divesting these projects for nominal compensation or to return the claims to the government. Nonetheless, we are very excited about both Rip and Thane. We need to use our resources prudently. Accordingly, these projects will be pursued with much greater focus and resources. We believe that our funds can and must be better spent in jurisdictions like BC, Canada.Interra anticipates 2024 will be a pivotal year for the Company, both in terms of improving market conditions, and with new discovery focused programs initiating at two projects in British Columbia. With the backdrop of strong metals prices, particularly copper and gold, we look forward to unlocking the potential of our highly prospective exploration assets located in a great jurisdiction. Additionally, consistent with our corporate strategy, the Company continues its search for brownfield and resource-level copper development project opportunities with the potential for high impact. We continue to seek out special opportunities that will prove valuable to the Company and our shareholders.Finally, and on a personal note, it has been a great pleasure working with my colleagues on the Interra Board and with the Interra management team. I have also been extremely impressed by our shareholders who stand by and support the Company. The support I have received is meaningful to me personally. Originally it was not my intent to take on the role of the Chief Executive Officer on a permanent basis as recently announced, however, the past six months have convinced me that the Interra team and vision is the right one and that the shareholders of Interra need a CEO fully committed to the Company's success. Moreover, I have, along with other Board members, increased our shareholdings in Interra and financially invested in the Company through participating in the recent and current private placements.Thank you again to you, the shareholders, for your ongoing support coming out of what has been a very tough market. Interra has a very skilled and dedicated leadership team with a long track record of success. We remain committed to creating value through our focused copper-gold discovery programs.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst With CNH Industrial Capital LLC pricing $600 million in aggregate principal amount of notes, this becomes a noteworthy event for investors. The interest rate of 5.100% is competitive, indicating a strong demand for this debt instrument in the current market. This interest rate is also reflective of the company's creditworthiness and the prevailing economic conditions.Investors should observe the issue price of 99.157%, which is slightly below par. This discount can make the notes more attractive to potential buyers, as it implies a higher yield to maturity. The use of proceeds for working capital and other corporate purposes, including the purchase of receivables, signals CNH Industrial's strategy to strengthen its liquidity position and potentially finance its operations more efficiently.Considering the maturity date of April 20, 2029, these notes provide a medium-term investment horizon. The semi-annual interest payments offer a regular income stream for bondholders. The fact that the notes are senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by CNH Industrial Capital America LLC and New Holland Credit Company, LLC, subsidiaries of CNH Industrial Capital LLC, adds an extra layer of security for investors. Market Research Analyst The involvement of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers, such as BofA Securities and Citigroup Global Markets, suggests a high level of confidence in CNH Industrial's financial stability and market reputation. The presence of multiple book runners also helps in distributing the risk and ensuring a successful issuance.From a market perspective, the offering could be a response to the company's assessment of the interest rate environment. If rates are expected to rise, locking in a fixed rate now could be advantageous. The capital raised could also be a strategic move to prepare for acquisitions, debt refinancing, or expansion, which may have a positive impact on the company's long-term growth trajectory. Debt Capital Markets Expert The decision to apply net proceeds to repay CNH Industrial Capital LLC’s indebtedness as it becomes due is a prudent approach to debt management. It suggests a proactive strategy in managing the company's capital structure and reducing potential refinancing risks associated with future market volatility.Furthermore, the offering being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing the company to act swiftly in favorable market conditions to optimize its capital structure. This agility in the capital markets can be beneficial for CNH Industrial in terms of cost savings and financial flexibility. 03/19/2024 - 05:30 PM Basildon, March 19, 2024 CNH Industrial N.V.

BRAMPTON, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DATA Communications Management Corp. (TSX: DCM; OTCQX: DCMDF) (“DCM” or the ""Company""), a leading provider of marketing and business communication solutions to companies across North America, today reported its fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter 2023 financial results. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY “We are pleased to report on the results of our performance in 2023,” said Richard Kellam, President & CEO of DCM. “This was a transformative year for DCM highlighted by the completion of our acquisition of Moore Canada Corporation (“MCC”) and the significant progress we made in our post-merger planning and execution.” “Our focus throughout the year was to build on the positive momentum we experienced in our business prior to the announcement of the MCC acquisition and to set a clear direction for our entire team beginning on Day 1 of the combined business in late April. We moved quickly to bring our teams together, design our new organization and select key leadership to take us forward, prioritizing our large Commercial and Operations teams. We completed this effort within the first six months of Day 1.” “We also moved quickly to complete a thorough analysis of our manufacturing footprint and announced a decision in early July to consolidate our plant network from 14 to 10 facilities to drive greater efficiencies in producing and delivering our products and services. We completed the closure of the first of these facilities in Edmonton, Alberta before the end of the year and are on track with our detailed plan to close the remaining three plants and transfer production to other facilities in our network.” “Our Commercial team delivered solid performance throughout the year, expanding revenue with existing clients, winning new logos, and building a strong new business pipeline focused on the value we can deliver to clients with our combined product and service offerings. We are pleased to report that in a year of significant change, the team delivered organic year over year revenue growth of 2%, which we believe is a great start for this new team.” 1 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted net income (loss) as a percentage of revenues are non-IFRS measures. For a description of the composition of these non-IFRS measures, and a reconciliation to their most comparable IFRS measure, net income, see the information under the heading “Non-IFRS Measures”, the information set forth on Table 2 and Table 3 herein, and our Management Discussion & Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Revenues of $130.0 million were up +77.9%, or +$56.9 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit of $32.8 million, increased +39.1%, or +$9.2 million compared to last year. Gross profit came in at 25.2% of revenue compared to 32.2% last year. SG&A expenses were 19.5% of revenues or $25.3 million, up modestly from 18.7% of revenue year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.0 million, up +19.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA represented 11.6% of revenues compared to 17.2% of revenues last year. OTHER BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS In June 2023 and December 2023 respectively, DCM completed the sale and leaseback of its Oshawa, Ontario warehouse facility and its Fergus, Ontario manufacturing plant, each of which was acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of MCC. The total gross proceeds from these transactions amounted to $30.5 million. Total net proceeds of $29.5 million were used to repay an acquisition-related credit facility. On January 11, 2024, DCM completed the sale and leaseback of its Trenton, Ontario warehouse facility, also acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of MCC. DCM realized gross proceeds on the Trenton sale of $9 million and net proceeds of $8.5 million have been applied towards paying down the Company’s revolving credit facility. DCM management to date has focused on four key areas of post-merger integration in connection with the MCC acquisition: Operational initiatives primarily intended to drive higher levels of gross profit as a percentage of revenues by reducing our overall cost of goods sold and implementing operating efficiencies, including the planned consolidation of four plants. Organizational initiatives primarily intended to drive both higher levels of gross profit and lower levels of SG&A expenses, including the integration of key functional teams, particularly our Commercial and Operations teams and the reduction of duplicative positions. Procurement initiatives, primarily intended to lower our consolidated purchasing costs and secure improved terms. Revenue growth focus, primarily through aligning our commercial selling efforts, including expanding and leveraging our combined print and communications workflow solutions and our digital offerings. DCM continues to expect total annualized synergies from the MCC acquisition of between $30 million to $35 million to be substantially realized over the next 12 months from these operational, organizational and procurement initiatives. 2024 PRIORITIES DCM has established the following strategic priorities for 2024: To substantially complete the integration of MCC by moving ahead with our plant consolidation plans and harmonizing our back-office systems; Remain focused on driving improvements in our gross profit margins, particularly in the legacy MCC business; Continue to focus on growing our business, by taking advantage of our larger scale, our expanded product and service offerings, and the capabilities of our combined team; Generate continued increases in free cash flow, to enable us to reduce our net debt further and allow us to consider further strategic opportunities for investment and capital allocation.

When used in this press release, words such as “may”, “would”, “could”, “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect DCM’s current views regarding future events and operating performance, are based on information currently available to DCM, and speak only as of the date of this press release. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. They should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or not such performance or results will be achieved. Many factors could cause the actual results, performance, objectives or achievements of DCM to be materially different from any future results, performance, objectives or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We caution readers of this press release not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements since a number of factors could cause actual future results, conditions, actions, or events to differ materially from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in these forward-looking statements. The principal factors, assumptions and risks that DCM made or took into account in the preparation of these forward-looking statements and which could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are described in further detail in our Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023, and include but are not limited to the following: Our ability to successfully integrate the DCM and MCC businesses and realize anticipated synergies from the combination of those businesses, including revenue and profitability growth from an enhanced offering of products and services, larger customer base and cost reductions; The expected annualized synergies that the Company expects to derive from the MCC acquisition have been estimated by the Company based on its experience integrating previously acquired businesses, other facilities and completing previous restructuring initiatives, and includes estimated benefits expected to be derived from the acquisition, including those related to facility sales and consolidations, operational improvements, eliminating redundant positions, and purchasing synergies; Our expected total annualized synergies estimates are principally based upon the following material factors and assumptions: (a) given the significant overlap in the nature of the two businesses, DCM will be able to eliminate duplication of overhead expenses across the combined DCM and MCC businesses in its SG&A functions; (b) given significant overlap in the nature of DCM’s and MCC’s production processes and available combined excess capacity, DCM will be able to consolidate manufacturing plants; (c) further operational and SG&A costs savings will be achievable once the above-noted initiatives are completed; (d) the combined business will achieve more favourable purchasing terms by virtue of the fact it is approximately twice the size of each of DCM and MCC pre-acquisition, and therefore able to command lower pricing from vendors based on larger volumes, and its expected ability to better harmonize purchasing strategies to leverage more favourable purchasing terms than each company had individually for similar goods or services; and (e) the combined business will be able to generate certain revenue synergies from cross-selling each other’s broader, combined, suite of capabilities; and Such expected annualized cost savings have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, nor has a reconciliation to IFRS Accounting Standards been provided, and the Company evaluates its financial performance on the basis of these non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures. Therefore, the Company does not consider their most comparable IFRS Accounting Standards measures when evaluating prospective acquisitions. Additional factors are discussed elsewhere in this press release and under the headings ""Liquidity and capital resources"" and “Risks and Uncertainties” in DCM’s Management Discussion and Analysis and in DCM’s other publicly available disclosure documents, as filed by DCM on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this press release as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Unless required by applicable securities law, DCM does not intend and does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

Shareholders to vote on the proposal on March 27, 2024. Keyarch's board recommends approval. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the SEC's approval of the registration statement for ZOOZ Power Ltd.'s business combination with Keyarch Acquisition Corporation is a significant milestone in the merger process. This step indicates regulatory compliance and sets the stage for shareholder voting. As a Market Research Analyst, it's important to note that the timing of this announcement is critical as it provides shareholders and potential investors with a defined timeline for the completion of the merger.Investors should consider the strategic implications of this merger. ZOOZ's flywheel-based power boosting technology could potentially disrupt the EV charging infrastructure market by offering more efficient solutions. The market for EV charging is expected to grow substantially with the global push towards electric vehicles. Therefore, the success of this merger could position the combined entity to capitalize on this burgeoning market.However, investors should also be aware of the risks inherent in mergers and acquisitions, such as integration challenges and the possibility of not realizing projected synergies. The unanimous recommendation from Keyarch's board of directors suggests confidence in the deal's potential, but the actual performance post-merger will be the true test of this transaction's success. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the effectiveness of the Form F-4 registration statement is a precursor to a significant liquidity event for the shareholders of both companies. As a Financial Analyst, I would look closely at the financials disclosed in the proxy statement/prospectus to understand the valuation metrics applied to the deal. The terms of the definitive agreement, such as the exchange ratio and any earn-out provisions, are key details that will impact shareholder value.It's also worth considering the broader market sentiment towards SPACs and their performance. While the SPAC structure has been popular, it has also faced scrutiny regarding post-merger performance. Investors should assess the long-term financial projections of the combined entity against industry benchmarks and consider the management team's ability to execute on their business plan.Lastly, the fact that shareholders of record as of the Record Date are the ones entitled to vote introduces a fixed timeline for investor decision-making. This could lead to increased trading volume as the meeting date approaches and investors position themselves either in support of or against the transaction. Legal Expert The declaration of effectiveness by the SEC is a legal compliance checkpoint that indicates ZOOZ's disclosure meets the regulatory standards required for public companies. As a Legal Expert, I would highlight the importance of the proxy statement/prospectus, as it contains essential legal disclosures regarding the business combination, including risk factors, management discussion and financial statements.Shareholders must review these materials carefully to make an informed vote, as the legal ramifications of their decision could affect their investment. The role of Keyarch's board in unanimously recommending the proposals also carries legal weight, as it reflects their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the shareholders.It is also important for shareholders to understand their voting rights and the procedures for the extraordinary general meeting. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus will outline these procedures and any deviation from standard practice should be noted. Shareholders should also be aware of their rights in the event of dissent with the proposed business combination, including any appraisal rights they may have under corporate law. 03/19/2024 - 04:55 PM NEW YORK, N.Y., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Keyarch Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq:KYCH) (“Keyarch” or the “Company”), a special purpose acquisition company, and ZOOZ Power Ltd. (“ZOOZ”), a leading provider of flywheel-based power boosting solutions for the EV charging infrastructure market, today jointly announced that the registration statement on Form F-4 filed by ZOOZ relating to their proposed business combination was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 18, 2024. Keyarch will hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders (the “Meeting”) at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, March 27, 2024, for consideration and voting on the approval of the business combination agreement, dated July 30, 2023, as amended (the “definitive agreement”), and related proposals described in the registration statement’s proxy statement/prospectus. Keyarch’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Keyarch shareholders vote “FOR” all of the proposals to be voted upon at the extraordinary general meeting, including approval of the proposed business combination and definitive agreement. Keyarch shareholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2024 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting. Keyarch will commence mailing the definitive proxy statement/prospectus and related materials to such shareholders on or about March 20, 2024. Keyarch’s shareholders may submit publicly held ordinary shares of Keyarch for redemption in connection with the proposed business combination and proposals at the Meeting described in the proxy statement/prospectus until the deadline of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on Monday, March 25, 2024, whether or not such shareholders hold shares as of the Record Date. Shareholders who wish to withdraw their previously submitted redemption requests may do so prior to the Meeting by requesting Keyarch’s transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer& Trust Company to return such shares. The registration statement on Form F-4 of ZOOZ, declared effective by the SEC on March 18, 2024, serves as both a proxy statement of Keyarch (for the extraordinary general meeting of Keyarch shareholders) and as a prospectus (registering ZOOZ shares to be issued under the definitive agreement). A copy of the registration statement and its definitive proxy statement/prospectus is accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Keyarch shareholders who need assistance in completing the proxy card, need additional copies of the proxy materials or have questions regarding the extraordinary general meeting may contact Keyarch’s proxy solicitor, Advantage Proxy, Inc., by calling toll-free at 877-870-8565. Important Information and Where to Find It In connection with the proposed business combination (the “Business Combination”), ZOOZ has filed with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form F-4, as amended, which includes a prospectus for ZOOZ securities and a proxy statement for Keyarch’s shareholders (the “Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, on March 18, 2024.

(DSGN) announces the development of new drug products for Friedreich Ataxia, Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy, and Huntington's Disease. The company plans to start patient trials in 2025, with a strong financial position supporting its operations for the next five years. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The development of DT-216P2 for Friedreich Ataxia (FA) represents a significant advancement in the treatment of this genetic disorder. The improved pharmacokinetic profile suggests increased drug absorption and sustained release, potentially leading to better therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the favorable injection site safety profile may enhance patient compliance. The transition from preclinical studies to patient trials is a critical phase that will determine the drug's efficacy and safety in humans. The anticipation of completing GLP studies by the end of 2024 to start patient trials in 2025 indicates a strategic roadmap that could impact the company's valuation and investor interest as these milestones approach. Financial Analyst Design Therapeutics' cash position of $281.8 million at year-end 2023 appears robust, underpinning a five-year operational runway. This financial cushion is important for the company's R&D strategy, allowing it to advance up to four programs to clinical proof-of-concept without immediate funding concerns. However, investors should monitor the burn rate associated with the R&D expenses, which totaled $57.1 million for the year, to assess whether the runway aligns with the company's projected timelines for drug development and potential revenue generation. The net loss of $66.9 million for the year reflects the company's current pre-revenue status, which is typical for biotech firms in the development stage. Genomics Therapeutics Expert The GeneTAC™ platform's versatility, as evidenced by the new program for Huntington’s Disease (HD) and advancements in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) and Myotonic Dystrophy Type-1 (DM1) treatments, showcases the company's commitment to addressing a range of degenerative diseases. The allele-selective approach in HD is particularly noteworthy, as reducing mutant huntingtin gene expression could be transformative for patients. The progress towards IND submissions for these programs will be pivotal in validating the platform's potential and could have a profound impact on the company's scientific credibility and market position. 03/19/2024 - 04:01 PM New Drug Product for Friedreich Ataxia (FA) DT-216P2 with Favorable Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic and Injection Site Safety Profile; Complete GLP Studies by Year-end 2024 to Start Patient Trials in 2025 IND Cleared for DT-168 for Treatment of Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) with Phase 1 Development to Start in 2024; Observational Study Underway to Confirm Patient Characteristics and Evaluate Potential Endpoints New Program Unveiled for Huntington’s Disease (HD) Targeting Reduction of Mutant Huntingtin with a GeneTAC™ Small Molecule Cash and Securities of $281.8 Million at Year-end 2023 Support Five-Year Operating Runway and Advancement of Up to Four Programs to Clinical Proof-of-Concept Conference Call and Webcast to be Held Today at 4:30pm ET CARLSBAD, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Design Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: DSGN), a biotechnology company developing treatments for serious degenerative genetic diseases, today provided an update on the progress of its platform of GeneTAC™ portfolio assets and reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. “At Design, our vision is to develop a portfolio of first or best-in-class small molecules capable of treating a host of degenerative diseases by working with a patient’s natural genome to restore cellular health. In recent months we have undertaken important work to evaluate the scope of our GeneTAC™ platform, which we believe has the potential to deliver clinical proof-of-concept in up to four programs, subject to research and development results, under our current cash runway through the next five years,” said Pratik Shah, Ph.D., chairperson and chief executive officer of Design Therapeutics. Dr. Shah continued, “Our lead program in FA has a new drug product, DT-216P2, that we have designed to have an improved pharmacokinetic and injection site safety profile, which positions us to resume clinical development for this debilitating, degenerative, neuro-muscular genetic disease. This work builds on encouraging data in FA patients from our previous clinical trial. In addition, our FECD program, DT-168, which has the potential to be the first effective treatment addressing the root cause of this degenerative corneal disease, now has an IND that was cleared by the FDA. Finally, we are highlighting an exciting new program for Huntington’s Disease, an indication of tremendous unmet medical need, which further demonstrates the depth and versatility of our differentiated approach to genomic medicines.” Pipeline Updates and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones Friedreich Ataxia (FA) Design has developed a new drug product, DT-216P2, for patients with FA that demonstrates an improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and a favorable injection site safety profile in nonclinical studies. When compared to the prior formulation, DT-216P2 demonstrated greater than 10-fold exposures that are more sustained over time. DT-216P2 also appears suitable for intravenous or subcutaneous routes of administration.Design previously reported Phase 1 data using its prior formulation that showed increased levels of frataxin (FXN) mRNA in peripheral blood cells and skeletal muscle, confirming activity in patients with FA. Based on these findings, Design is advancing DT-216P2 for FA, with plans to complete GLP studies by year-end 2024 to start patient trials in 2025. Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for DT-168 in FECD. To evaluate the potential impact of DT-168 on this degenerative corneal disease, the company is conducting an observational study designed to confirm disease characteristics and progression and evaluate potential endpoints prior to initiating an interventional treatment trial. The observational study is expected to enroll 200 patients with a follow-up of two years. Design expects to initiate Phase 1 development for DT-168 in 2024.Huntington’s Disease (HD) Design announced a new program in HD that targets allele-selective reduction of mutant huntingtin (HTT) gene expression with a GeneTAC™ small molecule. In preclinical studies, the company’s HD GeneTAC™ candidate molecules selectively dial-down the expression of the mutant HTT gene by over 50% in the brain striatum with systemic administration. The company is working toward selection of a development candidate in anticipation of a future IND submission.Myotonic Dystrophy Type-1 (DM1) Design is also advancing its preclinical characterization of several lead molecules for the treatment of DM1, a multi-system genetic disorder. The company’s DM1 GeneTAC™ small molecules potently dial-down the expression of the mutant DMPK gene in DM1 patient cells, eliminating foci and restoring normal splicing. Design is working toward selection of a development candidate in anticipation of a future IND submission. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results R&D Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $11.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.G&A Expenses: General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.Net Loss: Net loss was $11.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.Cash Position and Operating Runway: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $281.8 million as of December 31, 2023.

Oncology Doctor The recent advancements in the clinical development of soquelitinib by Corvus Pharmaceuticals represent significant progress in the field of oncology, particularly for patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The updated interim data showing objective responses, including complete responses (CRs) and partial responses (PRs), suggest that soquelitinib could potentially fill an unmet medical need, given that there are currently no FDA fully approved agents for the treatment of relapsed PTCL.The Orphan Drug Designation granted by the FDA could provide Corvus with critical benefits that facilitate drug development. This includes tax credits, FDA fee exemptions and seven years of marketing exclusivity post-approval, which can be a substantial incentive for the company's investment in this drug's development. As an oncologist, the potential of a novel therapeutic that demonstrates increases in cytotoxic killer T cells and reductions in markers of T cell exhaustion is promising, as it could lead to improved patient outcomes and a new standard of care in a disease with limited treatment options. Medical Research Analyst Corvus Pharmaceuticals' strategy to leverage ITK inhibition in immunomodulation presents a multifaceted approach to drug development. The initiation of a Phase 3 trial for PTCL and a Phase 1 trial for atopic dermatitis indicates a broad therapeutic potential for soquelitinib. The preclinical data for next-generation ITK inhibitors, which suggest the possibility of precise T-cell modulation, could represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of various immune diseases. This diversification strategy could mitigate risk and maximize the potential of the ITK inhibitor programs.Financially, the reduction in R&D expenses in 2023 compared to the previous year reflects a strategic allocation of resources, which is vital for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The net proceeds generated from the sale of common stock through the at-the-market program provide a important capital infusion for the continued development of their pipeline. However, the decrease in cash reserves year-over-year will likely necessitate further financial strategies to ensure the continuation of their clinical programs without interruptions. Market Research Analyst The investment community will likely monitor Corvus Pharmaceuticals closely, as the progress of soquelitinib could impact the company's valuation and stock performance. The advancement towards a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for PTCL and a randomized Phase 1 trial for atopic dermatitis has the potential to catalyze investor interest due to the breadth of applications and the significant market opportunities in these indications.While the orphan drug status for soquelitinib may provide competitive advantages, investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The successful execution of the trials and positive outcomes are not guaranteed and any setbacks could adversely affect the company's financial position and stock price. The appointment of a new Chief Business Officer with a focus on maximizing the ITK inhibitor programs suggests a proactive approach to business development and may signal to investors the company's commitment to strategic growth and partnership opportunities. 03/19/2024 - 04:02 PM Soquelitinib advancing towards initial enrollment for registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for PTCL and randomized Phase 1 clinical trial for atopic dermatitis Orphan drug designation and new interim data from Phase 1/1b clinical trial further demonstrate soquelitinib’s potential to address the need for new treatments for PTCL Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT BURLINGAME, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Corvus or the Company) (Nasdaq: CRVS) (GLOBAL NEWSWIRE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “Corvus is pioneering the development of ITK inhibition with a focus on advancing our lead program, soquelitinib, into a registrational Phase 3 trial for patients with relapsed PTCL,” said Richard A. Miller, M.D., co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Corvus. “We believe we are well positioned to execute on this trial, with recent positive updates from our Phase 1/1b clinical trial, alignment on the final study protocol with FDA, interest from leading academic centers in North America, and the receipt of Orphan Drug Designation for soquelitinib. We also continue to expand our knowledge and experience with ITK-mediated immunomodulation as a novel therapeutic for a broad range of cancers and immune diseases. We have several exciting opportunities in immunology, including plans for a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial of soquelitinib in atopic dermatitis. In addition, we continue to progress our next-generation ITK inhibitors, which have been designed to optimize T cell modulation for specific immune indications. Based on current timelines, we anticipate the atopic dermatitis trial will be initiated in the second quarter of 2024 with initial data potentially available by year end, and we anticipate the PTCL trial will be initiated in the third quarter.” Business Update and Strategy Prioritized Program: Soquelitinib (formerly CPI-818, Corvus’ selective ITK inhibitor) Soquelitinib for T Cell Lymphoma Corvus continues to follow patients with relapsed T cell lymphoma in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating single agent therapy with soquelitinib. Updated interim data as of January 22, 2024 (data shown below in Figures 1-2): A total of 23 patients were enrolled in the Phase 1/1b trial at the optimum 200 mg two-times a day dose and meet the eligibility criteria for the planned registrational Phase 3 clinical trial based on ≥1 and ≤3 prior therapies (eligible patient population), including 21 evaluable patients.For the 21 evaluable patients, objective responses (complete response, CR plus partial response, PR) were seen in seven patients, including four CRs and three PRs. Compared to the prior data (as of November 21, 2023) reported from the trial in December 2023 in conjunction with the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, one of the patients achieving a PR continued to respond and achieved a CR.Disease control (CR, PR and stable disease) was seen in 12 of 21 patients. The stable disease group included five patients who achieved tumor reductions that did not meet the criteria for a PR, with two of these patients continuing to receive therapy. Several patients experiencing tumor regression are continuing to receive therapy. The Company presented a poster at ASH that included additional data from the Phase 1/1b clinical trial and complementary preclinical data, including the evaluation of blood samples and tumor biopsies from eight patients who participated in the trial. The results support soquelitinib’s novel mechanism of action, and demonstrated increases in cytotoxic killer T cells and reductions in markers of T cell exhaustion. Figure 1: Waterfall Plot for Patients in the 200 mg Dose Cohort of the Soquelitinib Phase 1/1b Clinical Trial for Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma. The plot shows the best percent change in tumor volume in the 21 evaluable patients (eligible patient population), as of January 22, 2024, that were measurable by CT scan or by Modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for patients with cutaneous involvement. Figure 2: Swimmer Plot of Eligible Patient Population Demonstrating Response and Time on Therapy. Tumor histologies, as of January 22, 2024, are also shown indicating different types of T cell lymphoma. PTCL-NOS, peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified; CTCL, cutaneous T cell lymphoma of either Sezary or mycosis fungoides type; NKTCL, natural killer cell T cell lymphoma; ALCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma; AITL, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. In February 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation for soquelitinib for the treatment of T cell lymphoma, providing potential benefits including assistance in the drug development process, tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees and seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity. The Company has also obtained alignment with FDA on its protocol for a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of soquelitinib in patients with relapsed PTCL and anticipate initiating the trial in the third quarter of 2024. There are currently no FDA fully approved agents for the treatment of relapsed PTCL. Soquelitinib for Immune Diseases Corvus plans to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial of soquelitinib in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the second quarter of 2024, with the potential for initial data from the trial before year end 2024. The trial is planned to enroll 64 patients that have failed at least one prior therapy across four different 28-day dosing regimens of soquelitinib compared to a placebo group. The endpoints include safety and improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (“EASI”). Patients and physicians will be blinded to treatment assignment.In February 2024, Corvus presented preclinical data for soquelitinib at the Keystone Symposia on Systemic Autoimmunity and Autoinflammatory Diseases. The data included the first description of Corvus’ next-generation ITK inhibitor preclinical product candidates, which were designed to deliver precise T-cell modulation that is optimized for specific immunology indications. These preclinical product candidates exhibit specific biologic properties that are anticipated to enable more precise inhibition of Th1, Th2 and/or Th17 cell function. Atopic dermatitis and asthma are thought to be mediated primarily by Th2 lymphocytes. Th17 cells are associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The results suggest that chemical structures may be refined to perform more specific biologic functions and may enable targeting of various types of immune disease. This data builds on the publication of preclinical data on soquelitinib as a preprint at bioRxiv in November 2023 that demonstrated ITK’s selective inhibition which produced therapeutic benefits in several autoimmune and allergy preclinical models including psoriasis, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma and graft versus host disease.In February 2024, the Company appointed Jeffrey Arcara as Chief Business Officer, with responsibility for leading corporate strategy, business development, portfolio strategy, and new product planning. This includes an initial focus on maximizing the potential of the Company’s ITK inhibitor programs, both internally and through partnerships. Mr. Arcara previously served as senior vice president, head global marketing & portfolio and strategy for the innovative medicines and biosimilars business at Teva Pharmaceuticals. Partner Led Programs: Ciforadenant (adenosine 2a receptor inhibitor) and Mupadolimab (anti-CD73) The Kidney Cancer Research Consortium is enrolling a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating ciforadenant as a potential first line therapy for metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1). The Phase 1b portion of this trial has been completed and patients are now being enrolled in the Phase 2 portion. The clinical trial is expected to enroll up to 60 patients and initial data is anticipated in the first half of 2024.Angel Pharmaceuticals, Corvus’ partner in China, is enrolling patients in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of mupadolimab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC). In this clinical trial, patients will receive mupadolimab monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Financial ResultsAs of December 31, 2023, Corvus had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $27.1 million as compared to $42.3 million as of December 31, 2022. During the year ending December 31, 2023, the Company sold 2,461,903 shares of its common stock through its at-the-market program, generating net proceeds to the Company of approximately $7.8 million. Research and development expenses for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $4.0 million and $16.5 million, respectively, compared to $4.1 million and $24.5 million for the same periods in 2022. For the full year 2023, the decrease of $8.0 million was primarily due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing costs associated with the development of mupadolimab. The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $6.7 million compared to a net loss of $9.8 million for the same period in 2022. Total stock compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.6 million and the non-cash loss from Corvus’ equity method investment in Angel Pharmaceuticals was $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $4.6 million in the same period in 2022.

About Corvus PharmaceuticalsCorvus Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of ITK inhibition as a new approach to immunotherapy for a broad range of cancer and immune diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is soquelitinib, an investigational, oral, small molecule drug that selectively inhibits ITK. Its other clinical-stage candidates are being developed for a variety of cancer indications. For more information, visit www.corvuspharma.com. About SoquelitinibSoquelitinib (formerly CPI-818) is an investigational small molecule drug given orally designed to selectively inhibit ITK (interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase), an enzyme that is expressed predominantly in T cells and plays a role in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune function. The immunologic effects of soquelitinib lead to what is known as Th1 skewing and is made possible by the high selectivity of soquelitinib for ITK. Research on soquelitinib’s mechanism of action suggests that it has the potential to control differentiation of normal T helper cells and enhance immune responses to tumors by augmenting the generation of cytotoxic killer T cells and the production of cytokines that inhibit cancer cell survival. Soquelitinib has also been shown to prevent T cell exhaustion, a major limitation of current immunotherapy and CAR-T therapies. Optimal doses of soquelitinib have been shown to affect T cell differentiation and induce the generation of Th1 helper cells while blocking the development of both Th2 and Th17 cells and production of their secreted cytokines. Th1 T cells are required for immunity to tumors, viral infections and other infectious diseases. Th2 and Th17 helper T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and allergic diseases. The Company believes the inhibition of specific molecular targets in T cells may be of therapeutic benefit for patients with cancers, including solid tumors, and in patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases. About Peripheral T Cell LymphomaPeripheral T cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of malignancies accounting for about 10% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) in Western populations, reaching 20% to 25% of NHL in some parts of Asia and South America. The most common subtypes are PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and T follicular helper cell lymphoma. First line treatment for these diseases is typically combination chemotherapy, however, approximately 75% of patients either do not respond or relapse within the first two years. Patients in relapse are treated with various chemotherapy agents but have poor overall outcomes with median progression-free survival in the three to four month range and overall median survival of six to 12 months. There are no approved drugs in relapsed PTCL based on randomized trials. PTCL is a disease of mature helper T cells that express ITK, often containing numerous genetic mutations and frequently associated with viral infection. Most often the malignant cells of PTCL express a Th2 phenotype. About CiforadenantCiforadenant (CPI-444) is an investigational small molecule, oral, checkpoint inhibitor designed to disable a tumor’s ability to subvert attack by the immune system by blocking the binding of adenosine to immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment. Adenosine, a metabolite of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate), is produced within the tumor microenvironment where it may bind to the adenosine A2A receptor present on immune cells and block their activity. Ciforadenant has been shown to block the immunosuppressive effects of myeloid cells present in tumors and preclinical studies published in 2018 demonstrated synergy with combinations of anti PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. About MupadolimabMupadolimab (CPI-006) is an investigational, potent humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to react with a specific site on CD73. In preclinical studies, it has demonstrated immunomodulatory activity resulting in activation of lymphocytes, induction of antibody production from B cells and effects on lymphocyte trafficking. While there are other anti-CD73 antibodies and small molecules in development for treatment of cancer, such agents react with a different region of CD73. Mupadolimab is designed to react with a region of the molecule that acts to stimulate B cells and block production of immunosuppressive adenosine. Mupadolimab is being studied in combination with pembrolizumab in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced head and neck cancers and in patients with NSCLC that have failed chemotherapy and anti-PD(L)1 therapy. It is postulated that the activation of B cells will enhance immunity within the tumors of these patients, leading to improved clinical outcomes.

(LGVN) announces a 1-for-10 reverse stock split to increase per-share trading price and regain Nasdaq compliance. The split will convert every ten shares into one, reducing outstanding shares significantly. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is a strategic maneuver often employed by companies seeking to uplift their share price to meet exchange listing requirements. In the case of Longeveron Inc., executing a 1-for-10 reverse split directly addresses the NASDAQ's minimum bid price condition. This move is fundamentally cosmetic, as it does not inherently alter the company's market capitalization or its operational efficiency. However, it can have psychological effects on investor perception, potentially attracting investment by presenting a higher per-share price.From a liquidity standpoint, the reduced number of shares may lead to increased volatility due to a lower float. Investors should monitor the stock's behavior post-split to assess the market's reception of this change. Historically, the market's reaction to reverse splits has been mixed and it's not uncommon to see a short-term increase in share price followed by a decline as the underlying issues necessitating the split persist. Market Research Analyst Reverse splits can also signal to the market that a company is taking proactive steps to improve its standing on a stock exchange, which could be interpreted as a commitment to corporate governance and shareholder interests. However, the effectiveness of this strategy in the long term is contingent upon the company's subsequent performance. For Longeveron Inc., which operates in the biotechnology sector—a field characterized by high research and development costs and long timelines to profitability—the impact of the reverse split might be overshadowed by the company's progress in its clinical trials and the potential of its regenerative medicine pipeline.Investors would be wise to evaluate Longeveron's fundamentals and development milestones, rather than focusing solely on the reverse split. The adjustment in outstanding warrants and equity awards is a standard procedure to preserve the economic interests of existing stakeholders, which maintains fairness in the restructuring process. Securities Lawyer From a legal perspective, the reverse split follows a clear, regulated path, having been approved by shareholders and disclosed in a manner consistent with securities laws. It is important for shareholders, especially those holding physical certificates, to adhere to the instructions provided by the transfer agent to ensure their holdings reflect the post-split adjustments. The rounding up of fractional shares to the nearest whole number is a shareholder-friendly policy that avoids the disenfranchisement of small shareholders who might otherwise receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, potentially at a disadvantageous valuation.For potential investors and current shareholders, it is important to understand that while the reverse split does not impact the intrinsic value of the company, it does alter the number of shares they hold and could affect the granularity with which they can trade their shares. The unchanged total authorized number of shares post-split indicates that the company is not reducing its potential for future equity financing, which could dilute existing shareholders if utilized. 03/19/2024 - 04:01 PM MIAMI, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc. (NASDAQ: LGVN) (“Longeveron” or “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing regenerative medicines for unmet medical needs, announced today that the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-10 reverse split of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “common stock”) (the “Reverse Split”). The Reverse Split was previously approved by the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting held on February 21, 2024 The Reverse Split will legally take effect at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on March 26, 2024. The Company’s Class A common stock will open for trading under a new CUSIP number 54303L 203 on The Nasdaq Capital Market on March 27, 2024, on a split-adjusted basis under the current ticker symbol “LGVN.” The Reverse Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Company’s common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Reverse Split will automatically convert every ten current shares of the Company’s common stock, whether issued and outstanding or held by the Company as treasury stock, into one share of fully paid and nonassessable common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of the Company’s common stock following the Reverse Split will be entitled to rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split will reduce the aggregate number of shares of outstanding Class A common stock from approximately 10,295,426 shares to approximately 1,029,543 shares, and the number of shares of outstanding Class B common stock from approximately 14,839,993 shares to approximately 1,484,000 shares (based on outstanding shares as of March 18, 2024). The total authorized number of shares will remain unchanged. The terms of all outstanding warrants currently exercisable for shares of Class A common stock, and all equity awards granted under the Company’s equity plans, including the per share exercise price of options and the number of shares issuable under such options, will be proportionally adjusted to maintain their economic value, subject to adjustments for any fractional shares as described above. In addition, the total number of shares of shares of common stock that may be the subject of future grants under the Company’s equity plans, as well as any plan limits on the size of such grants will be adjusted and proportionally decreased as a result of the Reverse Split. Stockholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-Reverse Split shares. Stockholders owning shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split, subject to brokers’ particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Split. For those stockholders holding physical stock certificates, the Company’s transfer agent, Colonial Stock Transfer Company, Inc., will send instructions for exchanging those certificates for shares held electronically in book-entry form or for new certificates, in either case representing the post-Reverse Split number of shares, including the impact of any rounding to the nearest whole number of shares in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable.

The company also provided financial results for 2023 and future milestones. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Taysha Gene Therapies regarding the REVEAL Phase 1/2 trial outcomes for TSHA-102 in treating Rett syndrome signifies a pivotal advancement in gene therapy. The data indicating the therapy's tolerability and efficacy in adult patients, with no serious adverse events and sustained improvement in several clinical measures, is noteworthy. This information is of particular interest to stakeholders as it suggests potential for clinical success and future commercialization, which could influence the company's valuation and investment appeal.From a medical research perspective, the utilization of miRARE technology to regulate MECP2 expression is a sophisticated approach that avoids the risk of overexpression, which has been a concern in gene therapies. The fact that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has approved the progression to a higher dose cohort indicates confidence in the initial safety data, which is a positive sign for the drug's development trajectory. The long-term implications of this could be substantial, as successful trials may lead to a new standard of care for Rett syndrome, a condition with limited treatment options. Financial Analyst The financial results from Taysha Gene Therapies, with a significant increase in revenue from $2.5 million in the previous year to $15.5 million, reflect the company's growing operational capabilities and successful research and development activities. The decrease in research and development expenses, as well as general and administrative expenses, suggests improved operational efficiency and cost management. Investors should note, however, that the company reported a net loss, which is not unusual for a clinical-stage biotech company focusing on long-term product development.The company's statement regarding its cash runway extending into 2026 provides a cushion for continued research without immediate need for further financing, which is reassuring for investors concerned about dilution. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor the company's burn rate and future financing strategies, as clinical trials and potential commercialization efforts will likely require substantial capital. Market Research Analyst Considering the orphan drug status of treatments like TSHA-102, the market potential is typically characterized by lower competition and higher pricing flexibility. The positive trial results and advancements to higher dose cohorts may enhance Taysha's positioning within the gene therapy market, particularly for central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, the expansion of the trial into the U.S. and U.K. markets indicates a strategic approach to regulatory approval and market access, which could facilitate faster adoption upon successful completion of clinical trials.It's important to recognize that the market for Rett syndrome therapies is niche, but Taysha's progress could set a precedent for future gene therapy approvals. The company's collaboration with Audentes Therapeutics (a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma) could also provide strategic advantages in terms of resources and expertise to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and accelerate the path to market. 03/19/2024 - 04:01 PM Data from first adult patient in REVEAL Phase 1/2 trial showed TSHA-102 (low dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) was well-tolerated with no treatment-emergent SAEs as of 35-week assessment, with sustained improvement across key efficacy measures at decreased steroid levels and new improvement in RSBQ at month six Data from second adult patient showed TSHA-102 (low dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) was well-tolerated with no treatment-emergent SAEs as of 19-week assessment, with sustained improvement across key efficacy measures, significantly reduced seizure events and new improvement in R-MBA at week 12 Principal Investigator observed sustained and new improvements across multiple clinical domains following completion of steroid taper for patient one through 35-weeks post-treatment and for patient two through 19-weeks post-treatment at decreased steroid levels Received Independent Data Monitoring Committee approval of Company’s request to proceed to early advancement to cohort two (high dose, 1x1015 total vg) in REVEAL adolescent and adult trial, and approval to dose second pediatric patient in cohort one (low dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) in REVEAL pediatric trial Initial data from cohort one (low dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) in REVEAL pediatric trial expected mid-2024; initial data from cohort two (high dose, 1x1015 total vg) in both trials (adolescent/adult and pediatric) expected in 2H 2024 Conference call and live webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time DALLAS, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Taysha Gene Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSHA) (Taysha or the Company), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing and commercializing AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), today reported financial results for the full-year ended December 31, 2023, and provided corporate and clinical updates. “We are highly encouraged by the safety profile and durable response reported in the longer-term data from the low dose cohort in our REVEAL adolescent and adult trial. Importantly, following completion of the steroid taper for the first patient and at decreased steroid levels for the second patient, both patients showed sustained improvements across multiple clinical domains, as well as new improvements compared to earlier post-treatment assessments, which supports the transformative potential of TSHA-102,” said Sean P. Nolan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Taysha. “These continued improvements in both adult patients with advanced stage four Rett syndrome and the initial clinical data from the first pediatric patient were reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and enabled us to proceed to earlier dose escalation in the adolescent and adult trial, which will expedite and further inform our clinical development and regulatory strategy for the dose expansion portion of the studies. With this progress, we believe we are well-positioned to focus on generating clinical data in a broad range of ages and stages of patients with Rett syndrome across multiple geographies this year.” Dr. Elsa Rossignol, M.D., FRCP, FAAP, Associate Professor in Neuroscience and Pediatrics at the Université de Montréal, and Principal Investigator of the REVEAL trial at the CHU Sainte-Justine added, “Both adult patients treated with TSHA-102 showed sustained and new improvements across key areas of disease impacting activities of daily living, including multiple aspects of autonomic function, social communication, motor skills, and experienced stabilized or significantly reduced seizures. The first patient sustained improvements at week 35 post-treatment after the completion of her steroid taper, with restored movement in her legs, the gained ability to sit unassisted for the first time in over a decade and gained function in her non-dominant hand. She has also sustained improvements in breathing dysrhythmia and sleep quality and duration, including the gained ability to sleep through the night for the first time in 20 years. Notably, she has vastly increased interest in social communication and activities at week 35 compared to earlier post-treatment assessments. She is more alert and socially interactive, with increased vocalizations and enhanced ability to use an eye-driven communication device. The second patient showed sustained improvements at decreased steroid levels at week 19 post-treatment, including reduced hand stereotypies for the first time since regression at age three, and sustained improvements in breathing dysrhythmia, including hyperventilation and reduced apneic spells. As of week 19 post-treatment, she’s experienced a significant reduction in seizures at a lower dose of anti-seizure medication. Collectively, these continued improvements in both adult patients with different genetic mutation severity and phenotypic expression are encouraging and support the potential of TSHA-102 to bring meaningful change to the lives of patients and their caregivers.” Data Summary from Cohort One (Low Dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) of the REVEAL Phase 1/2 Adolescent and Adult Trial TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome: a self-complementary intrathecally delivered AAV9 gene transfer therapy in clinical evaluation for Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene. TSHA-102 utilizes a novel miRARE technology designed to mediate levels of MECP2 in the CNS on a cell-by-cell basis without risk of overexpression. The safety and preliminary efficacy of TSHA-102 are being evaluated in female patients aged 12-years and older with Rett syndrome due to MECP2 loss-of-function mutation in the REVEAL Phase 1/2 adolescent and adult trial, a first-in-human, open-label, randomized, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study taking place in Canada and the United States (U.S.). Dose escalation will evaluate two dose levels of TSHA-102 sequentially. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) established in Part A will then be administered during dose expansion in Part B of the study. Results from the first patient (large MECP2 deletion; associated with severe phenotype) and second patient (missense MECP2 mutation; associated with milder phenotype) with late motor deterioration stage four Rett syndrome dosed with TSHA-102 in the low dose cohort (5.7x1014 total vg): Generally well-tolerated with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) as of 35-week assessment post-treatment for patient one and 19-week assessment post-treatment for patient twoSustained and new improvements observed across multiple clinical domains, as of 35-weeks post-treatment for patient one following completion of steroid taper at week 33, and 19-weeks post-treatment for patient two at decreased steroid levels (taper began at week 17), based on clinical observations by the Principal Investigator (PI), including: Autonomic function: improved breathing patterns, sleep quality/duration and circulation (patient one), and improved breathing patterns and circulation (patient two)Socialization/Communication: improved social interest, vocalization and ability to use eye-driven communication device (patient one), and improved social interest (patient two)Motor skills: improved hand function and gained ability to sit unassisted and move legs (patient one), and improved hand stereotypies (patient two)Seizures: stable seizure events (patient one), and significantly reduced seizure events (patient two) Seizure Diary showed stable seizure events at lower levels of anti-seizure medication relative to baseline through 35-weeks post-treatment in patient one, and significantly reduced seizure events with lower levels of anti-seizure medication relative to baseline through 19-weeks post-treatment in patient two, based on caregiver-reported medical history Clinical improvements seen across key efficacy measures in both patients include: Patient one at six-month assessment: Sustained improvement in Clinical Global Impression–Improvement (CGI-I), Clinical Global Impression–Severity (CGI-S), Parental Global Impressions–Improvement (PGI-I), Revised Motor Behavior Assessment (R-MBA), Rett Syndrome Hand Function Scale (RSHFS) and Seizure Diaries, at decreased steroid levels, with new improvement in Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ)Patient two at 12-week assessment: Sustained improvement in CGI-I, PGI-I and RSBQ, with new improvement in R-MBA and Seizure Diaries Figure accompanying this announcement is available here.

Designed as a one-time treatment, TSHA-102 aims to address the genetic root cause of the disease by delivering a functional form of MECP2 to cells in the CNS. TSHA-102 utilizes a novel miRNA-Responsive Auto-Regulatory Element (miRARE) technology designed to mediate levels of MECP2 in the CNS on a cell-by-cell basis without risk of overexpression. TSHA-102 has received Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA and has been granted Orphan Drug designation from the European Commission. TSHA-102 has also received Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway designation from the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. About Rett SyndromeRett syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is essential for regulating neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. The disorder is characterized by loss of communication and hand function, slowing and/or regression of development, motor and respiratory impairment, seizures, intellectual disabilities and shortened life expectancy. Rett syndrome progression is divided into four key stages, beginning with early onset stagnation at 6 to 18 months of age followed by rapid regression, plateau and late motor deterioration. Rett syndrome primarily occurs in females and is one of the most common genetic causes of severe intellectual disability. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies that treat the genetic root cause of the disease. Rett syndrome caused by a pathogenic/likely pathogenic MECP2 mutation is estimated to affect between 15,000 and 20,000 patients in the U.S., EU, and U.K. About Taysha Gene TherapiesTaysha Gene Therapies (Nasdaq: TSHA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system.

Financial Analyst The reported fiscal year revenue growth of 16% and a significant turnaround from a net loss to a net income highlight a robust financial performance for HealthEquity, Inc. This turnaround is particularly noteworthy as it reflects not just an increase in revenue but also effective cost management and operational efficiency, as evidenced by the 500 basis points expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin.From a financial perspective, the shift from a net loss in FY23 to a net income in FY24 could be attributed to multiple factors including scale economies, successful integration of acquisitions and perhaps, improved margins on HSA custodial services. The increase in non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA by 70.7% and 36% respectively, indicates a strong underlying business performance that outpaces revenue growth, suggesting an enhanced profitability profile.The company's liquidity position, with an increase in cash and a reduction in outstanding debt, is another positive sign for stakeholders. This improved balance sheet strength provides the company with strategic flexibility for future investments or to weather potential economic downturns. However, investors should be mindful of the ongoing debt level and monitor the company's ability to service and reduce it over time. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio is a strategic move that is likely to contribute to HealthEquity's market share growth. With approximately $2.8 billion of HSA Assets and 665,000 customer accounts being added, this could significantly bolster the company's position as a leading HSA custodian. The sector's growth is driven by the increasing adoption of high-deductible health plans and the rising demand for health savings accounts, which offer tax advantages and serve as a tool for medical expense planning.The company's outlook for fiscal 2025 suggests confidence in its growth trajectory, projecting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increases of approximately 15% and 20% respectively. This outlook may influence investor sentiment positively, as it reflects management's expectation of continued strong performance and market expansion.However, it is essential to consider industry trends such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics and consumer behavior shifts in health savings and investment decisions. These factors could impact the company's growth and profitability and thus should be monitored closely by investors. Healthcare Financial Management Expert HealthEquity's notable increase in HSAs and total HSA assets represents a growing consumer preference for health savings accounts as a means to manage healthcare expenses. This trend is consistent with the broader movement towards consumer-directed healthcare, where individuals are taking more control over their healthcare spending and savings.The reclassification of revenue streams to better align with the underlying drivers is a positive step towards transparency in financial reporting. It allows stakeholders to have a clearer understanding of the company's revenue generation sources. Such clarity is beneficial for informed decision-making by investors.Considering the long-term implications, HealthEquity's growth in account numbers and assets under management indicates a scalable business model that could lead to sustained revenue streams through custodial and service fees. However, the company must continue to innovate and provide competitive services to retain and grow its customer base in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive. 03/19/2024 - 04:01 PM Highlights of the fiscal year include: Revenue of $999.6 million, an increase of 16% compared to $861.7 million in FY23.Net income of $55.7 million, compared to net loss of $26.1 million in FY23, with non-GAAP net income of $195.5 million, compared to $114.5 million in FY23.Net income per diluted share of $0.64, compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.31 in FY23, with non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.25, compared to $1.36 in FY23.Adjusted EBITDA of $369.2 million, an increase of 36% compared to $272.3 million in FY23.8.7 million HSAs, an increase of 9% compared to FY23.Total HSA Assets of $25.2 billion, an increase of 14% compared to FY23.15.7 million Total Accounts, including both HSAs and complementary CDBs, an increase of 5% compared to FY23.The Company agreed to acquire the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio.

DRAPER, Utah, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HealthEquity, Inc. (NASDAQ: HQY) (""HealthEquity"" or the ""Company""), the nation's largest health savings account (""HSA"") custodian, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. “We delivered fiscal 2024 with a record of nearly $1 billion in revenue as well as over 500 bps expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin,” said Jon Kessler, President and CEO of HealthEquity. “Building on these results, we believe we are well-positioned to continue our growth in fiscal 2025 as our technology investments enable us to continue taking market share, with an initial outlook for increases of approximately 15% in revenue and 20% in Adjusted EBITDA.” Fiscal year financial results Revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was $999.6 million, an increase of 16% compared to $861.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications relate primarily to recordkeeping and advisory fees associated with HSA investments of $25.6 million, $21.8 million, and $16.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which were reclassified from custodial revenue to service revenue to better align our financial statement presentation with the underlying drivers of our revenue streams.

The reclassifications had no impact on our total revenue, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), cash flows, or stockholders' equity.

Business outlook For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, management expects revenues of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion.

Its outlook for non-GAAP net income, calculated using the method described below, is between $247 million and $262 million, resulting in non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.79 to $2.96 (based on an estimated 89 million weighted-average shares outstanding). Management expects Adjusted EBITDA of $438 million to $458 million. See “Non-GAAP financial information” below for definitions of our Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used throughout this release to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included with the financial tables at the end of this release. Conference call HealthEquity management will host a conference call at 4:30 pm (Eastern Time) on Tuesday, March 19, 2024 to discuss the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and year-end results. The conference call will be accessible by dialing 1-833-630-1956, or 1-412-317-1837 for international callers, and referencing conference ID ""HealthEquity, Inc. call."" A live audio webcast of the call will be available on the investor relations section of our website at http://ir.healthequity.com. Non-GAAP financial information To supplement our financial information presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, merger integration expenses, acquisition costs, gains and losses on equity securities, amortization of incremental costs to obtain a contract, costs associated with unused office space, and certain other non-operating items.Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adding back to GAAP net income (loss) before income taxes the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, merger integration expenses, acquisition costs, gains and losses on equity securities, costs associated with unused office space, and losses on extinguishment of debt, and subtracting a non-GAAP tax provision using a normalized non-GAAP tax rate.Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company cautions investors that non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from GAAP; accordingly, its use can make it difficult to compare current results with results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies. In addition, while amortization of acquired intangible assets is being excluded from non-GAAP net income, the revenue generated from those acquired intangible assets is not excluded. Whenever we use these non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the applicable non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed in the tables below.

(CMG) announces a 50-for-one split of its common stock, marking one of the biggest stock splits in NYSE history. The split, subject to shareholder approval, will provide 49 additional shares for each share held to shareholders of record as of June 18, 2024. Chipotle's shares are expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on June 26, 2024. The company also announced a special one-time equity grant for restaurant general managers and crew members with over 20 years of service. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Chipotle Mexican Grill's proposed 50-for-1 stock split is a significant move that is likely to have a broad impact on the market perception and liquidity of CMG shares. Stock splits are often perceived as bullish signals by the market, as they suggest that the company's management is confident about the future performance and wants to make the shares more accessible to a wider base of investors. The increase in the number of shares outstanding can potentially enhance liquidity, making it easier for investors to trade the stock.However, it is important to note that a stock split does not inherently change the company's valuation, as the market capitalization remains the same; it merely increases the number of shares while reducing the price per share proportionately. This move could be particularly appealing to retail investors who might have found the pre-split share price too high for their investment portfolios. Additionally, post-split, the stock may be included in more indices that have price criteria, potentially increasing institutional ownership.From a financial perspective, the timing of the split, following a period of strong financial performance, may further amplify positive sentiment. Nevertheless, investors should focus on the fundamentals of the company, such as revenue growth, profit margins and strategic initiatives, rather than the psychological effects of a lower share price. Compensation and Benefits Specialist The provision of a special one-time equity grant to restaurant general managers and crew members with more than 20 years of service is a strategic move that aligns with current trends in human resources. By extending equity to these employees, Chipotle is not only recognizing their contributions but also investing in their continued loyalty and motivation. Equity grants can serve as powerful retention tools and can help in aligning the interests of the employees with those of shareholders.Furthermore, this form of compensation can enhance the sense of ownership among staff, which may translate into improved performance and customer service. It's a way to share the financial success of the company with those who contribute directly to its day-to-day operations. However, the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the perceived value of the equity by the employees and the actual performance of the stock post-split.While this move is commendable, the long-term impact on the company's financials will depend on the cost of this equity grant and its effect on employee turnover and productivity. It's essential to monitor how these grants affect operating expenses and whether they provide a return on investment through heightened employee performance and reduced turnover costs. Market Research Analyst Chipotle's decision to undertake a stock split, the first in its 30-year history, is a reflection of the company's growth trajectory and its recent all-time high stock performance. This action is likely to be well-received by the market, as it indicates a company that is not only growing but also cognizant of its share structure and investor base. Historically, stock splits have been followed by increased investor interest, especially from smaller investors who may have been priced out previously.It is also an indication of the company's strategy to broaden its investor base and make the stock more accessible to its employees, which may boost morale and incentivize performance. By offering a special equity grant to general managers and long-serving crew members, Chipotle is reinforcing its culture of employee appreciation, which can have a positive impact on the brand image and customer loyalty.However, investors should be cautious and not let the mechanics of a stock split overshadow the underlying financial health of the company. They should continue to assess Chipotle's market position, competitive dynamics and growth prospects in the fast-casual dining sector. The long-term value will be determined by the company's ability to sustain its growth and manage operational challenges, such as food safety, labor costs and market saturation. 03/19/2024 - 05:45 PM RESTAURANT GENERAL MANAGERS WILL RECEIVE SPECIAL EQUITY GRANT NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Negative None. 03/19/2024 - 04:30 PM Vancouver, BC, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd.’s (TSX-V:SYH) (OTCQX:SYHBF) (Frankfurt:SC1P) (the “Company”) partner company Azincourt Energy (“Azincourt”), is pleased to announce that mobilization is set to begin later this week for the 2024 winter drill program at the East Preston uranium project in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada. Project Location – Western Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/Sky_EastPreston_20231219.jpg Winter 2024 Drill Program: Azincourt is undertaking a drill program for the winter of 2024, consisting of up to 1,500 meters of drilling in a maximum of five (5) diamond drill holes. The priority will be to follow up on the clay alteration zone with elevated uranium that was identified in the winter of 2023 with a focus on the area of transition between the K and H Zones. Drilling in 2023 identified an illite clay alteration halo extending from the top of Zone K to Zone H as far as drill hole EP0053. Within this illite alteration zone, dravite and kaolinite are present in the north end of Zone H. Illite and kaolinite are both indicators of hydrothermal alteration typically found within alteration halos of unconformity uranium deposits. Dravite is a boron-rich clay which is found within the larger clay package proximal to uranium mineralization in the hydrothermal system. Both illite and dravite have been identified as being significant vectors for the 2022 JR Zone discovery by F3 Uranium approximately 60 km to the northwest of the East Preston project. The program will utilize one helicopter supported drill rig and be based out of a local contractor camp, with reduced disturbance due to the lack of an access road. Drill and crew mobilization is underway with drilling expected to commence by the last week of March. “Following up the clay alteration in the K- and H- Zones is a high priority”, commented Azincourt’s VP Exploration Trevor Perkins. “This alteration is what would be expected where a uranium deposit is present. This area between the K- and H zones is a zone we need to drill test further, and all indications are that we are vectoring in on something. A significant number of deposits in the Athabasca Basin have been found by identifying and chasing these types of alteration patterns,” continued Mr. Perkins. East Preston Targets: The primary target area on the East Preston Project is the conductive corridors from the A-Zone through to the G-Zone (A-G Trend) and the K-Zone through to the H and Q-Zones (K-H-Q Trend). The selection of these trends is based on a compilation of results from the 2018 through 2020 ground-based EM and gravity surveys, property wide VTEM and magnetic surveys, and the 2019 through 2022 drill programs, the 2020 HLEM survey indicates multiple prospective conductors and structural complexity along these corridors. 2024 Target Areas at the East Preston Uranium Project:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/2023-24-Target-areas-at-the-East-Preston-Uranium-Project.png Drilling has confirmed that identified geophysical conductors comprise structurally disrupted zones that are host to accumulations of graphite, sulphides, and carbonates. Hydrothermal alteration, anomalous radioactivity, and elevated uranium have been demonstrated to exist within these structurally disrupted conductor zones. Permitting and Community Relations: Permits are in hand to conduct exploration activities at the East Preston property through the summer of 2026. Azincourt recognizes that the granting of these permits does not negate the rights of the local communities for meaningful consultation as the project progresses. Azincourt looks forward to a continued close working relationship and regular consultation with CRDN and other rights holders to ensure that any potential impacts and concerns are addressed and that the communities can benefit from activities in the area through support of local business, employment opportunities, and sponsorship of select community programs and initiatives. Local businesses are engaged to provide services and supplies and members of the Clearwater River Dene Nation and surrounding communities have been directly employed on site or to provide support and services to keep the camp and programs running. The involvement of the local communities is essential for continued advancement of the East Preston Project. About East Preston: Skyharbour and Dixie Gold entered into an Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Azincourt whereby Azincourt had an earn-in option to acquire a 70% working interest in a portion of the Preston Uranium Project known as the East Preston Property. Azincourt earned a majority interest in the project by completing CAD $2.5 million in staged exploration expenditures and making a total of CAD $1 million in cash payments as well as issuing shares of Azincourt divided evenly between Skyharbour and Dixie Gold. Azincourt now owns 85.8% as operator of the Project with Skyharbour retaining a minority interest of 9.5% in the Project. Three prospective conductive, low magnetic signature corridors have been discovered on the property. The three distinct corridors have a total strike length of over 25 km, each with multiple EM conductor trends identified. Ground prospecting and sampling work completed to date has identified outcrop, soil, biogeochemical and radon anomalies, which are key pathfinder elements for unconformity uranium deposit discovery. The East Preston Project has multiple long linear conductors with flexural changes in orientation and offset breaks in the vicinity of interpreted fault lineaments – classic targets for basement-hosted unconformity uranium deposits. These are not just simple basement conductors; they are clearly upgraded/enhanced prospectivity targets because of the structural complexity. The targets are basement-hosted unconformity related uranium deposits similar to NexGen’s Arrow deposit and Cameco’s Eagle Point mine. East Preston is near the southern edge of the western Athabasca Basin, where targets are in a near surface environment without Athabasca sandstone cover; therefore, they are relatively shallow targets but can have great depth extent when discovered. The project ground is located along a parallel conductive trend between the PLS-Arrow trend and Cameco’s Centennial deposit (Virgin River-Dufferin Lake trend). Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by David Billard, P.Geo., a Consulting Geologist for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with twenty-nine projects, ten of which are drill-ready, covering over 587,000 hectares (over 1.45 million acres) of land. Skyharbour has acquired from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, a 100% interest in the Moore Uranium Project which is located 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine. Moore is an advanced-stage uranium exploration property with high-grade uranium mineralization at the Maverick Zone that returned drill results of up to 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres including 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres at a vertical depth of 265 metres. Adjacent to the Moore Uranium Project is Skyharbour’s recently optioned Russell Lake Uranium Project from Rio Tinto, which hosts historical high-grade uranium drill intercepts over a large property area with robust exploration upside potential. The Company is actively advancing these projects through exploration and drill programs. Skyharbour has joint-ventures with industry-leader Orano Canada Inc., Azincourt Energy and Valor Resources at the Preston, East Preston and Hook Lake Projects, respectively.

Its versatility complements a variety of exterior architectural coating colors. “Black Walnut has rich tones that add complexity to a modern white or black exterior, but its natural warmth also works well with earthy paint colors and warm neutrals,” McCollum said. “Of course, I particularly love seeing it paired with PPG’s 2024 Color of the Year, Limitless.” PPG’s woodcare experts recommend Black Walnut in OLYMPIC® MAXIMUM® Semi-Transparent stain and sealant for preserving and enhancing the natural beauty and longevity of woods. They also recommend semi-transparent Black Walnut in Pittsburgh Paints & Stains PARAMOUNT™ Exterior stain and sealant in one, for a perfect blend of cutting-edge paint and color technology and style expertise. “Exterior wood details help build the character of a structure, whether new construction or a historic property,” said Maureen Taylor, PPG marketing manager, U.S. woodcare brands, Architectural Coatings. “Color and product choice go hand-in-hand when thinking about protecting and preserving the character and beauty of a home or building.” Olympic Maximum enables DIYers to clean and stain their decks on the same day, regardless of the temperature.

Crescent Energy Announces Pricing of $700 Million Private Placement of 7.625% Senior Notes Due 2032,2024-03-19T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Crescent Energy Company (CRGY) prices $700 million Senior Notes due 2032 at 7.625% interest rate.

The Notes are guaranteed by the Issuer's subsidiaries and are expected to close on March 26, 2024.","Crescent Energy Announces Pricing of $700 Million Private Placement of 7.625% Senior Notes Due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Crescent Energy Company (CRGY) prices $700 million Senior Notes due 2032 at 7.625% interest rate. The offering aims to fund the redemption of existing 2026 Notes. The Notes are guaranteed by the Issuer's subsidiaries and are expected to close on March 26, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Crescent Energy Company's $700 million Senior Notes at 7.625% represents a significant financial event for the company and its investors. The interest rate, notably higher than the current average corporate bond yield, indicates a potentially higher risk profile or a premium demanded by investors for the long-term commitment until 2032. This move appears to be a strategic effort to manage the company's debt profile by using the proceeds to address the outstanding 7.250% Senior Notes due 2026.Investors should note that the decision to issue new debt at a higher interest rate to pay off existing debt could signal management's confidence in future cash flows, despite the cost. The tender offer and redemption plan for the 2026 Notes also suggest an active approach to liability management. However, this could also impact the company's interest expenses and financial leverage, potentially affecting future profitability and stock performance.Considering the current economic climate, with rising interest rates and potential recession concerns, the company's ability to secure such a deal may reflect its creditworthiness and investor confidence. Nevertheless, stakeholders should monitor the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics closely, as these will be critical in understanding the long-term impact of this financial maneuver. Debt Market Analyst The decision by Crescent Energy to price the Senior Notes at par and offer them through a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S suggests a targeted approach towards institutional investors and international markets. This method of offering bypasses the general public and is tailored for sophisticated investors, likely due to the nature of the unregistered securities involved.The 7.625% interest rate, while attractive to investors seeking higher yields, could reflect underlying market conditions and investor sentiment towards the energy sector. The energy market's volatility, driven by fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes, can impact the risk assessment and pricing of such financial instruments.As the offering is contingent upon the completion of the tender offer and redemption of the 2026 Notes, it's essential to consider the success of these transactions. Should the market conditions change or investor appetite wane, the company could face challenges in fulfilling its strategic financial plans. Observers should also be aware of the implications of such debt restructuring on the company's long-term financial health and its ability to respond to market or operational shifts. 03/19/2024 - 04:30 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crescent Energy Company (NYSE: CRGY) (“we” or “our”) announced today that its indirect subsidiary Crescent Energy Finance LLC (the “Issuer”) has priced its previously announced private placement pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to eligible purchasers of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”).

(TPST) reported positive randomized first-line HCC data for TPST-1120 combination therapy, new biomarker data, and plans for Phase 3 trials. Financially, Tempest ended 2023 with $39.2 million in cash, showing improved net loss and reduced expenses compared to 2022. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. regarding their TPST-1120 combination therapy marks a significant milestone in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. The therapy's progression into a pivotal Phase 3 trial is a critical step, as it indicates potential efficacy and safety that may surpass current standard-of-care treatments. This development is particularly notable for patients with PD-L1 negative and b-catenin mutant HCC, who may benefit from the therapy's mechanism of action (MoA).From a medical research perspective, the ability of TPST-1120 to show clinical superiority in terms of confirmed objective response rate (cORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) suggests that the drug could offer a meaningful improvement in treatment outcomes. The hazard ratio (HR) data provided suggests a favorable trend towards TPST-1120, although it is important to note that these figures are not yet mature and should be interpreted with caution. The well-tolerated safety profile further underscores the potential of this therapy as a first-line treatment option.Looking ahead, the transition of TPST-1120 into Phase 3 trials will be closely monitored, as the results will have significant implications for patient care and could potentially shift the treatment paradigm for HCC. Financial Analyst Tempest Therapeutics' financial results and corporate update carry considerable weight for investors and stakeholders. The company's successful capital raise through the issuance of common stock, resulting in a year-end cash position of $39.2 million, demonstrates investor confidence and provides a solid financial runway into the second quarter of 2025.From a financial perspective, the decrease in net loss from $35.7 million in 2022 to $29.5 million in 2023, alongside a reduction in research and development expenses, suggests effective cost management. This, combined with a slight decrease in general and administrative expenses, may indicate an operational efficiency that could be favorable for long-term financial health.Investors should consider the implications of the upcoming Phase 3 trial for TPST-1120, as positive results could lead to increased market potential and partnerships. Conversely, any setbacks in the trial could impact the company's valuation. The future performance of TPST-1495, which is advancing into a Phase 2 study, should also be monitored, as it represents another avenue for growth and diversification of the company's portfolio. Oncology Clinical Trial Expert The advancement of TPST-1120 into a Phase 3 clinical trial is a testament to its potential as a novel therapeutic agent in oncology, specifically for HCC. The reported data indicating an increased objective response rate and prolonged progression-free survival in comparison to the current standard-of-care is promising. Furthermore, the identification of biomarkers in subpopulations such as PD-L1 negative and b-catenin mutant patients may allow for more personalized treatment approaches, which is a growing trend in oncology.It is also noteworthy that the study has reported a well-tolerated safety profile, a important factor in the adoption of new therapies. The upcoming Phase 3 trial will be a significant determinant of TPST-1120's efficacy and safety on a larger scale, which could potentially lead to FDA approval and commercialization. The translational biomarker findings presented at AACR and SITC meetings suggest a robust scientific approach, which may enhance the credibility of the study's outcomes and facilitate regulatory approval. 03/19/2024 - 04:25 PM Announced positive randomized first-line HCC data showing superiority of TPST-1120 combination therapy across multiple study endpoints compared to standard of careReported new biomarker data in two important subpopulations, PD-L1 negative and b-catenin mutant patients, consistent with MoA of TPST-1120Preparing to move TPST-1120 into a pivotal Phase 3 trial in HCC and TPST-1495 into a Phase 2 in FAP BRISBANE, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: TPST), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing first-in-classi targeted and immune-mediated therapeutics to fight cancer, today reported financial results for the year ended 2023 and provided a corporate update. “2023 was a transformative year for Tempest. We announced strong positive randomized data showing the benefit of TPST-1120 combination therapy compared to standard-of-care in first-line liver cancer,” said Stephen Brady, president and chief executive officer of Tempest. “These data also showed the predicted positive effect of TPST-1120 in two subpopulations that are common in liver cancer, i.e., patients with PD-L1 negative and cold tumors, as well as patients with a b-catenin mutation, and we believe set up the program for a pivotal Phase 3 trial. We look forward to 2024 as the year Tempest evolves towards becoming a late-stage clinical organization.” 2023 Accomplishments TPST-1120 (clinical PPARα antagonist): Reported positive interim data in April 2023 from the ongoing randomized Phase 1b/2 clinical study evaluating TPST-1120 in combination with the standard-of-care regimen of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), compared to patients treated with the standard of care regimen alone.

Fourth quarter and year-end 2023 figures show positive trends in net revenues, gross margin, and core net income. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of 47% for the full year signifies a robust expansion for Harrow, indicative of effective market penetration and product acceptance. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA by 116% is a strong signal of improving operational efficiency and cost management. However, the widening GAAP net loss from $(14.1 million) to $(24.4 million) raises questions about the sustainability of growth and potential increases in operating expenses or investment activities that may not be immediately accretive to earnings.Furthermore, the marginal decrease in GAAP gross margin could suggest pricing pressure or increased cost of goods sold, which might be a concern if the trend continues. The core gross margin improvement, from 73% to 77%, on the other hand, may reflect a positive shift towards higher-margin products or improved cost controls. The liquidity position, with $83 million in cash and cash equivalents, appears solid and should provide the company with a buffer to support ongoing operations and investment in growth. Market Research Analyst The expansion into the North American ophthalmic pharmaceuticals market and the successful launch of key products like IHEEZO, VEVYE and TRIESENCE contribute to a diversified portfolio and may enhance market share. The focus on branded products is a strategic move that can lead to higher profit margins and customer loyalty. Attracting experienced talent suggests a strategic emphasis on human capital to drive future growth.However, the challenge lies in maintaining the momentum of product launches and managing the competitive landscape. The company's confidence in significant growth prospects for IHEEZO and the success of the VEVYE launch need to be monitored closely for execution risks and market acceptance. The availability of TRIESENCE could also be a critical factor in sustaining revenue growth. Medical Research Analyst The emphasis on Harrow's transition from a compounded business to a branded product line in the ophthalmic pharmaceuticals sector indicates a strategic pivot towards higher-value, potentially more regulated products. The success of this strategy hinges on the continued innovation and regulatory approval of new products, which can be a complex and risk-laden process.The company's investment in talent acquisition, particularly those with connections and experience, is likely to enhance its research and development capabilities. This could lead to a more robust pipeline of products, which is essential for long-term sustainability in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the actual impact of these products on the company's financial health will depend on their market performance and the ability to navigate regulatory environments. 03/19/2024 - 05:45 PM Full-Year 2023 Highlights: Revenues of $130.2 million, an increase of 47% over 2022 revenues of $88.6 million.

Baum, CEO of Harrow. “In addition to the significant revenue and Adjusted EBIDTA growth the team delivered, we launched products and began to generate cash from our Big Three products – IHEEZO, VEVYE and TRIESENCE. Finally, we also attracted experienced, well connected, and highly motivated talent to join Harrow – setting the table beautifully for 2024 and for many years to come, when we expect significant growth from IHEEZO, continued success with our VEVYE launch, and having TRIESENCE back in inventory and available, potentially this year. In summary, supported by the tremendous progress we made in 2023, this year, too, is shaping up to be another exciting year of growth. I am confident that we have the products, resources, and people to take full advantage of the opportunities we see ahead of us today and for many years to come.” Fourth quarter and year-end 2023 figures of merit: For the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net revenues $ 36,355,000 $ 20,329,000 $ 130,193,000 $ 88,595,000 Gross margin 69 % 70 % 70 % 71 % Core gross margin(1) 75 % 71 % 77 % 73 % Net (loss) income (9,148,000 ) 1,055,000 (24,411,000 ) (14,086,000 ) Core net (loss) income(1) (7,016,000 ) 2,103,000 (11,512,000 ) (1,375,000 ) Adjusted EBITDA(1) 2,563,000 1,089,000 28,119,000 13,017,000 Basic and diluted net (loss) income per share (0.26 ) 0.04 (0.75 ) (0.51 ) Core net (loss) income per share(1): Basic (0.20 ) 0.08 (0.35 ) (0.05 ) Diluted (0.20 ) 0.07 (0.35 ) (0.05 ) (1) Core gross margin, core net (loss) income , core basic and diluted net (loss) income per share (collectively, “Core Results”), and Adjusted EBITDA are non‑GAAP measures.

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Results are considered “non‑GAAP” financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting its business. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Core Results provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making; (ii) they exclude the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance; and (iii) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Core Results, and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non‑GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the way they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, excluding the effects of stock‑based compensation and expenses, impairment of intangible assets, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, investment (income) loss, net, and, if any and when specified, other non-recurring income or expense items. Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit or net loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, or financing activities as a measure of ability to meet cash needs.

Core Results Harrow Core Results, including core gross margin, core net (loss) income, and core basic and diluted loss per share exclude (1) all amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software development costs, (2) net gains and losses on investments and equity securities, including equity method gains and losses and equity valued at fair value through profit and loss (“FVPL”), and preferred stock dividends, and (3) gains/losses on forgiveness of debt.

Fiscal 2024 guidance reaffirmed with adjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst Amcor's announcement of CEO Ron Delia's retirement due to health reasons and the appointment of Peter Konieczny as Interim CEO is a significant event that could influence market perceptions. CEO transitions can often lead to short-term volatility in a company's stock as investors assess the potential for changes in strategic direction. However, the impact may be mitigated by Konieczny's existing role within the company and his familiarity with Amcor's operations and strategy. Investors will likely monitor the transition closely, with particular attention to the continuity of leadership and the maintenance of the strategic initiatives that have driven Amcor's growth under Delia's tenure.The reaffirmation of fiscal 2024 guidance alongside this leadership change suggests stability and confidence in the company's current trajectory. This may reassure investors looking for signs that the transition will not disrupt financial performance. The detailed breakdown of the expected earnings per share (EPS) and the factors influencing it, such as share repurchases and the sale of the Russian business, provides transparency that can help investors understand the underlying drivers of the company's performance. The projected solid growth in Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a positive indicator of the company's financial health and its ability to generate cash from its operations. Sustainability Analyst Amcor's focus on sustainability has been highlighted as a key component of its operating and strategic agenda under CEO Ron Delia. With the appointment of Peter Konieczny, who has been responsible for the company's sustainability and innovation agendas, it appears that Amcor is poised to continue integrating sustainability into its core business practices. This commitment to sustainability is increasingly important to investors who are looking for companies with responsible environmental practices and long-term viability. The ability to lead in sustainability can also provide a competitive advantage in the packaging industry, where environmental impact is a significant concern for consumers and regulators alike.Given the current market trends, where sustainability is a growing factor in investment decisions, Amcor's continued dedication to embedding these practices into its business model could be a positive signal to environmentally-conscious investors. The emphasis on innovation within this context suggests that Amcor may pursue new technologies and materials that not only reduce environmental impact but also potentially open up new markets and revenue streams. Financial Analyst The financial details provided in Amcor's guidance offer a comprehensive view of the company's expected performance. The mention of underlying business performance being potentially down a low-single digit percentage to up a low-single digit percentage indicates a relatively stable but cautious outlook. The benefits from share repurchases reflect a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy that can support EPS growth. However, the negative impact from higher estimated net interest and tax expense suggests that there may be increased financial costs that could weigh on net income.The sale of the Russian business is noted as a negative impact, which is likely a result of geopolitical risk management. It's important for investors to consider how the divestiture might streamline the company's operations and potentially reduce exposure to future geopolitical or economic instability in the region. The potential currency translation benefits underscore the importance of understanding Amcor's exposure to foreign exchange risks, particularly in a global business environment where currency volatility can significantly affect reported earnings.Overall, the financial analysis of Amcor's guidance indicates that while there are several moving parts that could affect the company's financials, the company is navigating these with a degree of cautious optimism. The forecasted growth in Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a particularly strong point, as it suggests operational efficiency and the potential for further capital returns to shareholders or reinvestment in the business. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM ZURICH, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Amcor (NYSE: AMCR; ASX: AMC), a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging solutions, announced today that after nine years as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ron Delia has informed the Board of Directors of his decision to retire from the Company and step down from the Board for health reasons, effective April 15, 2024.

The company is advancing its Phase 3 program for REL-1017 for major depressive disorder. They also plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial for REL-P11 in obese patients. Financially, there was a decrease in R&D and an increase in G&A expenses for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. The net loss for Q4 2023 was $25.2 million. Positive Relmada Therapeutics is progressing with its Phase 3 program for REL-1017 for major depressive disorder. The company plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial for REL-P11 in obese patients to define its pharmacokinetic profile. There was a decrease in research and development expenses for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. The net loss for Q4 2023 was $25.2 million, showing a decrease from the previous year. Negative The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $98.8 million, compared to $157.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The company had a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023. There was an increase in general and administrative expenses for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The preliminary financial results of Relmada Therapeutics indicate a significant reduction in research and development expenses from $113.3 million in the previous year to $54.8 million. This reduction is attributed to the completion of several clinical trials, which is a common occurrence in the biotechnology industry as trials reach their endpoints. The decrease in R&D spend could be viewed positively by investors as it reflects cost-saving measures and a potential move towards commercialization. However, the company's net loss has decreased, but they still reported a substantial loss of $98.8 million for the year. The cash burn rate has also improved, with net cash used in operating activities halved from the previous year.From a balance sheet perspective, the company's cash reserves have decreased by over $50 million. This is a critical figure for biotech companies, which often rely on sufficient cash reserves to fund ongoing research until they reach profitability. The current cash position may necessitate future capital raising, which could lead to dilution for existing shareholders. The stock market typically reacts to these financial indicators as they provide insight into a company's operational efficiency and long-term viability. Medical Research Analyst Relmada Therapeutics' focus on CNS diseases, particularly their Phase 3 program for REL-1017 as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, is noteworthy. The advancement to late-stage clinical trials is a critical juncture that can significantly impact a biotech company's valuation. Positive top-line data, expected in the second half of 2024, could be a major catalyst for the company's stock price. However, it is important to note that the success of clinical trials is never guaranteed and any setbacks could adversely affect investor sentiment.Furthermore, the initiation of a Phase 1 trial for their metabolic psilocybin program represents diversification within their pipeline, which may mitigate risk. However, with clinical proof-of-concept data not expected until the first half of 2025, this program is still in early stages and its impact on the company's financials will not be immediate. Investors often look for a balanced pipeline with both near-term and long-term prospects, as well as a clear path to market for lead candidates. Market Research Analyst Relmada's strategic update highlights their commitment to addressing major depressive disorder, a condition with a significant unmet medical need and a large potential market. The global antidepressant drugs market is projected to grow and Relmada positioning itself with a novel treatment could capture a sizeable market share if approved. This potential is something that investors would monitor closely, as market entry and penetration rates could drive revenue growth substantially.Additionally, the company's exploration into psilocybin for obesity taps into the growing interest in psychedelic compounds for various indications. While still early in development, the market for obesity treatments is vast and innovation in this area could present a lucrative opportunity. Investors interested in long-term growth prospects may find this diversification appealing, as it suggests the company is not solely reliant on a single product or market. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM CORAL GABLES, Fla., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Relmada Therapeutics, Inc.

The distribution will be paid on March 28, 2024, with an ex-date of March 8, 2024. The Fund aims to maintain a consistent distribution level sourced from net investment income and realized capital gains. Shareholders should be aware that any shortfall in income and gains may result in a return of capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the distribution announcement by Virtus AI & Technology Opportunities Fund, it is pertinent to assess the sustainability of the $0.15 per share distribution. The distribution policy implies a potential return of capital if net investment income and realized capital gains are insufficient to cover the distribution amount. This scenario could lead to a gradual depletion of the fund's asset base over time, which might be a red flag for investors seeking long-term capital growth.Furthermore, the fund's performance should be evaluated in the context of the overall market conditions, especially within the technology sector, which can be volatile. Investors would benefit from understanding the fund's portfolio diversification and how it mitigates sector-specific risks. The reliance on realized capital gains for distributions in a fluctuating market could introduce additional risk to the fund's ability to maintain its distribution levels consistently. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a consistent distribution level by the fund is an attractive feature for income-focused investors. However, it's essential to analyze the fund's historical payout ratios and compare them with industry averages. A payout ratio that is too high could signal that the fund is over-distributing, which might not be sustainable in the long run. Market sentiment towards such funds can be influenced by their distribution policies and any changes or perceived risks in the ability to maintain distributions can impact the fund's market price.Additionally, the fund's strategy in artificial intelligence and technology sectors should be scrutinized for alignment with current market trends and future growth areas. As these sectors are rapidly evolving, the fund's adaptability and management's expertise in selecting high-potential investments are critical for maintaining investor confidence and justifying the distribution levels. 03/19/2024 - 04:25 PM HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (NYSE: AIO) previously announced the following monthly distribution on March 1, 2024: Ticker Amount of Distribution Ex-Date Record Date Payable Date AIO $0.15 March 8, 2024 March 11, 2024 March 28, 2024 Under the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan, the Fund will seek to maintain a consistent distribution level that may be paid, in part or in full, from net investment income and realized capital gains, or a combination thereof. Shareholders should note, however, that if the Fund's aggregate net investment income and net realized capital gains are less than the amount of the distribution level, the difference will be distributed from the Fund's assets and will constitute a return of the shareholder's capital. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’.

They also closed the sale of 35 million shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD) through a global secondary offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Altria Group, Inc. regarding the initiation of an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction is a significant move, signaling the company's confidence in its stock and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The repurchase of $2.4 billion in common stock represents a substantial capital allocation, reflecting a positive outlook by the company's management regarding future cash flows and earnings potential. The ASR allows for an immediate and substantial return of capital, which can be favorable for the stock price in the short term due to the reduction in the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS).However, the use of ASRs can be a double-edged sword. While they may provide a short-term boost to the stock price, they also reduce the company's cash reserves, which could be used for other value-creating opportunities such as investments in growth or paying down debt. Investors will need to monitor the company's leverage and liquidity ratios post-transaction to assess the impact on its financial health. Market Research Analyst Altria's decision to engage in an ASR is a reflection of broader market practices where companies look to optimize their capital structure and deliver shareholder value. This move is likely to be well-received by the market, as share repurchases are often interpreted as a sign that the company believes its stock is undervalued. It is also indicative of Altria's strategic shift following the sale of a significant portion of its stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev. This divestiture, combined with the ASR, suggests a reallocation of assets that could point to potential new investments or a strategic pivot.The lockup commitment of 180 days for the remaining ABI shares indicates a short-term limitation on Altria's liquidity, which could impact its ability to react to unforeseen market changes. This could be a point of consideration for investors looking at the company's near-term financial flexibility. Legal Expert Altria's press release includes a disclaimer regarding forward-looking and cautionary statements, which is a standard legal practice to protect the company from potential litigation related to future performance. The disclaimer also serves as a reminder to investors that the share repurchase program is subject to changes based on market conditions and board discretion, which introduces an element of uncertainty. The adherence to securities laws and regulations, as mentioned in the context of the sale of ABI shares, underscores the company's commitment to compliance and the importance of regulatory considerations in such financial transactions.The lockup period and the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares are contractual elements that investors should be aware of, as they can affect the stock's liquidity and available float. Understanding these legal nuances is essential for stakeholders to fully grasp the implications of Altria's recent financial activities. 03/19/2024 - 04:15 PM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announces that we entered accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transactions under separate agreements with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC on March 15, 2024, to repurchase $2.4 billion of our common stock. Under the terms of the ASR agreements, on March 19, 2024, we received an initial share delivery of approximately 85% of the shares to be repurchased, based on the closing price per share of our common stock on March 15, 2024. We expect the remainder of the shares to be delivered no later than the end of the second quarter of 2024. Under certain circumstances specified in the ASR agreements, we may be required to deliver shares or pay cash, at our option, upon settlement of the ASR agreements. The total number of shares ultimately purchased under the ASR agreements will depend upon final settlement and will be based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the terms of the ASR transactions, less a discount. The ASR transactions are part of our expanded $3.4 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by December 31, 2024. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. We also announce the closing of our sale of 35 million shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (Euronext: ABI) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) through a global secondary offering (offering) comprised of a public offering of ABI ordinary shares represented by American depositary shares (ADS) in the United States, a public offering of ABI ordinary shares in the United States, a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and an offering of ABI ordinary shares, including ABI ordinary shares represented by ADSs, in other countries outside the United States, at a price of $61.50 per ADS, corresponding to €56.17 per ABI ordinary share. In addition, ABI repurchased $200 million of ordinary shares directly from us, concurrently with the completion of the offering. We granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 5.25 million of our ABI shares at the price per ADS paid by the underwriters in the offering, exercisable within 30 days of the underwriting agreement, executed on March 14, 2024. In conjunction with the offering, we committed to a 180-day lockup from the date of the underwriting agreement with the lead underwriter for our remaining ABI shares.

Financial Analyst The announcement of a 1-for-15 reverse stock split by Moleculin Biotech reflects a strategic move to comply with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirements. Reverse stock splits are often executed by companies facing delisting risks due to their stock trading below a certain threshold. By consolidating shares, Moleculin aims to increase its stock price to a level that meets Nasdaq's standards.Investors should consider the implications of such corporate actions. While the reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, it often leads to a temporary increase in stock price due to a perceived improvement in the company's financial health. However, the long-term effects depend on the company's ability to improve its fundamentals. If the underlying business issues are not addressed, the positive effects of a reverse stock split may be short-lived.It's important to note that the reverse stock split reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can lead to increased volatility due to a smaller float. Moreover, the psychological impact on investors can be mixed, as some may view this as a sign of trouble, while others may see it as a company taking necessary steps to maintain its listing status. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Moleculin's reverse stock split can be seen as a proactive approach to maintain its appeal to institutional investors and ensure compliance with trading platforms' regulations. The reduction in the number of outstanding shares to approximately 2.2 million from 33.4 million sharpens the focus on the company's stock liquidity and trading dynamics.Historical data suggests that the market's reaction to reverse stock splits can be varied. While some investors may interpret this as a red flag, signaling distress, others might view it as a reset that could pave the way for future growth. The key for Moleculin will be to communicate its growth strategy effectively post-split to maintain investor confidence.Additionally, the retention of the 100 million authorized shares post-split provides Moleculin with the flexibility to raise capital in the future without immediately diluting the stock. This could be beneficial for funding ongoing clinical programs or other strategic initiatives, but it also leaves room for potential dilution down the line, which investors should monitor closely. 03/19/2024 - 04:30 PM HOUSTON, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Moleculin Biotech, Inc., (Nasdaq: MBRX) (""Moleculin"" or the ""Company""), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a growing pipeline, including Phase 2 clinical programs, for hard-to-treat tumors and viruses, today announced a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of its common stock.

The partnership includes educational efforts, EV awareness campaigns, and funding for public EV chargers. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The partnership between Stellantis and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) underscores a strategic push within the automotive industry towards electrification and sustainability. The industry is undergoing a significant transformation and Stellantis's commitment to expanding its electric vehicle (EV) lineup is indicative of the broader market trend. The investment of over €50 billion in electrification and the target sales mix for BEVs in Europe and the United States by 2030 reflect a proactive approach to meeting regulatory demands and consumer preferences. These moves may influence investor confidence in Stellantis's ability to adapt to a low-carbon economy and may position the company favorably against competitors in terms of innovation and market share growth in the EV sector.Stellantis's plan to introduce new BEV models and its partnership aimed at reducing carbon emissions could potentially impact stock performance by signaling to investors the company's commitment to long-term growth and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the collaboration with CARB and Veloz for EV awareness and infrastructure development is a strategic move that could enhance the company's brand image and customer loyalty, potentially translating into increased sales and market penetration. Environmental Policy Expert The agreement between Stellantis and CARB is a testament to the evolving landscape of environmental policy and corporate responsibility. The projected reduction of 10-12 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions aligns with global efforts to mitigate climate change. This partnership may serve as a benchmark for other states and countries, promoting similar collaborations that could lead to stringent regulations affecting the automotive industry.Stellantis's pledge to help disadvantaged communities access EVs and to invest in public EV charging infrastructure is a significant step towards environmental justice and equity. These initiatives may not only improve public perception but also encourage other corporations to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices. The long-term implications for the industry could include a shift in consumer demand towards companies that prioritize sustainability, potentially influencing market dynamics and investment patterns. Energy Sector Analyst The emphasis on expanding charging infrastructure as part of the Stellantis-CARB partnership has implications for the energy sector, particularly utilities and renewable energy providers. The additional $10 million investment in public EV chargers by Stellantis indicates a growing market for energy services related to EVs. This could stimulate further investments in grid modernization and renewable energy sourcing to meet the anticipated increase in electricity demand from EVs.Securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity and establishing six battery manufacturing plants demonstrates Stellantis's commitment to supply chain resilience and could encourage similar investments by other automakers. The energy sector may see increased demand for battery components and raw materials, influencing commodity prices and the strategies of mining companies. The ripple effects of such large-scale commitments to electrification could be extensive, impacting various subsectors within the energy industry. 03/19/2024 - 04:31 PM Stellantis and California Partner to Drive Carbon Emissions Reduction Efforts Agreement will avoid 10-12 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in the United StatesCustomers across the U.S. will benefit from having full access to the five plug-in hybrids and two battery electric vehicles available now, with eight new battery electric vehicles coming this yearStellantis will continue its efforts that promote electric vehicle awareness, expand charging infrastructure and drive dealer readiness AMSTERDAM, March 19, 2024 – Stellantis today announced a partnership with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) demonstrating the Company’s resolve to achieve its industry-leading ambition to be carbon net zero by 2038, aligned with its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.

The company no longer operates Natal airport, impacting statistics.","Corporación América Airports S.A. Reports February 2024 Passenger Traffic Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Corporación América Airports S.A. (NYSE: CAAP) reports a 5.4% YoY increase in passenger traffic, reaching 92.8% of February 2019 levels. International passenger traffic is 4.2% above pre-pandemic levels. The company no longer operates Natal airport, impacting statistics. Positive None. Negative Passenger traffic in Brazil decreased by 4.8% YoY, reaching 78.4% of February 2019 levels, impacted by financial and aircraft constraints in local airlines. Cargo volume in Brazil decreased by 40.8% YoY, reaching 59.2% of February 2019 levels. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in passenger traffic for Corporación América Airports S.A. suggests a positive trend in the aviation sector, particularly as international passenger traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. This reflects a recovery trajectory that could bolster investor confidence in the industry. The growth in international traffic by 4.2% compared to pre-pandemic levels indicates a resurgence in global mobility, which could signal a broader economic rebound and increased demand for travel-related services. The detailed statistics, showing mixed performance across different regions, highlight the uneven nature of the recovery. Argentina and Italy's performance is noteworthy, as they show significant YoY improvements, which may be attributed to successful marketing strategies or regional economic conditions favoring travel. However, the decline in Brazil's passenger traffic and the financial constraints impacting local airlines there could be a concern for investors, hinting at potential market-specific risks. The cargo volume increase by 10.6% YoY, despite not reaching pre-pandemic levels, suggests a strengthening in trade activities, which is a positive indicator for businesses reliant on air freight. The reported data implies a cautiously optimistic outlook for CAAP's operational performance and potential revenue growth. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Corporación América Airports S.A.'s traffic report are multifaceted. The YoY increase in passenger traffic and cargo volume suggests a growth trajectory that could translate into higher revenue streams for the company. The surpassing of international passenger traffic over pre-pandemic levels is particularly promising, as international routes typically yield higher margins due to longer distances and potentially higher ticket prices. This could positively impact the company's bottom line and make it an attractive prospect for investors seeking to capitalize on the post-pandemic recovery phase. However, it is essential to consider the operational costs associated with increased traffic, such as staffing and maintenance, which may offset some revenue gains. Furthermore, the regional disparities in recovery, especially the underperformance in Brazil, could signal volatility in future earnings. Investors should monitor such regional performances closely, as they may affect the stability of the company's overall financial health. The report's indication of reaching near pre-pandemic levels in several metrics provides a baseline for forecasting future performance, but it is important to remain vigilant about the potential for new disruptions in the travel industry. Economist The data presented by Corporación América Airports S.A. offers insights into broader economic trends. The increase in passenger traffic, particularly on international routes, suggests a recovery in global economic activity and consumer confidence. This is a positive indicator for sectors beyond aviation, such as tourism and hospitality, which benefit from increased travel. The cargo volume growth aligns with the expansion of trade activities, possibly reflecting a rebound in global supply chains. However, the variance in recovery rates across regions underscores the uneven economic impact of the pandemic and the ongoing disparities in recovery speeds. The strong performance in Argentina and Italy could be indicative of regional economic strengths or successful containment of pandemic-related disruptions. Conversely, the challenges faced in Brazil may reflect broader economic issues that could have ripple effects on regional stability. Overall, the aviation sector's health is often seen as a barometer for the global economy and the current trends suggest cautious optimism but also warrant attention to the fragility of the recovery, especially given the potential for new economic headwinds. 03/19/2024 - 04:31 PM Total passenger traffic up 5.4% YoY, reaching 92.8% of February 2019 levels International passenger traffic 4.2% above pre-pandemic LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corporación América Airports S.A.

The ongoing Phase 2 study in chronic migraine to have an interim analysis with data expected in Q2 2024. The company plans to release top-line data for the complete cohort in Q3 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The alignment between AEON Biopharma and the FDA on the design and endpoints for the upcoming Phase 3 trials of ABP-450 signifies a critical step forward in the drug's development cycle. This is particularly noteworthy for investors as it indicates a level of regulatory confidence in the potential of ABP-450 as a preventive treatment for migraines, which could translate into market advantage upon successful trial outcomes. The decision to conduct an interim analysis could provide an earlier indication of the drug's efficacy, potentially influencing AEON's stock volatility in the lead-up to the full data release.Given the substantial burden of migraine on healthcare systems and patients' quality of life, a successful treatment could capture significant market share. With over 300 participants completing two 12-week treatment cycles, the statistical power to show efficacy will be closely watched by stakeholders. The patented treatment paradigm involving fewer injections could also be a differentiator in the competitive landscape of migraine treatments, possibly impacting adoption rates and patient compliance. Financial Analyst The interim Phase 2 data release scheduled for Q2 2024, followed by the complete cohort data in Q3 2024, introduces a timeline for investors to monitor AEON's progress closely. The company's share price could be influenced by these milestones, as positive data may lead to increased investor confidence and vice versa. The involvement of multiple study sites across different regions, including the United States, Canada and Australia, underscores the scale of the study and hints at the market potential for ABP-450.The drug's efficacy in reducing mean monthly migraine days will be the primary endpoint. This metric is important for demonstrating the drug's value proposition to both patients and insurers. Secondary outcome measures, such as the percentage of patients achieving significant reductions in migraine days, will further define the drug's profile. These data points could be pivotal in negotiating reimbursement rates with insurers, which would have a direct impact on AEON's revenue potential. Market Research Analyst Understanding the competitive landscape for migraine treatments is essential for evaluating AEON's business potential. Migraine affects a significant portion of the population, with chronic migraine sufferers representing a high-need, underserved patient group. The market demand for effective preventive treatments is strong and ABP-450's progression to Phase 3 trials suggests it may become a key player if proven effective.The emphasis on fewer injections could improve patient adherence and satisfaction, which are important factors in treatment success and market acceptance. Additionally, the use of a consistent primary endpoint across Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may streamline the regulatory process and assist in comparing efficacy across different stages of development. The ability to demonstrate a consistent treatment effect could position AEON favorably in a market crowded with multiple treatment options. 03/19/2024 - 04:30 PM – FDA and AEON align on the design and endpoints for the proposed pivotal Phase 3 trials for the preventive treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine – – An interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 2 study in chronic migraine will now be conducted and data are expected in Q2 2024; previously stated timeline for top-line data on the complete cohort remains on track for Q3 2024 – IRVINE, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AEON Biopharma, Inc. (“AEON” or the “Company”) (NYSE: AEON, AEON WS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a proprietary botulinum toxin complex for the treatment of multiple debilitating medical conditions, today announced a productive end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following the Phase 2 data in episodic migraine previously released in October 2023, that supports advancing ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) injection into the proposed pivotal Phase 3 program. As part of the updated development plan, the Company will now conduct an interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine and anticipates releasing the data in the second quarter of 2024. “We are pleased to announce a productive end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, during which we aligned on the proposed study design and the primary endpoint for the pivotal Phase 3 program with ABP-450 injection for the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine,” commented Marc Forth, President and Chief Executive Officer of AEON. “The insights from our Phase 2 study in episodic migraine were well received by regulators and provide an exciting next step to conduct an interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 program in chronic migraine with the same primary endpoint we plan to utilize in the proposed Phase 3 trials. With data from over 300 participants that have completed the two 12-week treatment cycles, the interim analysis of the Phase 2 study in chronic migraine is statistically powered to show efficacy.” “We are excited to announce the advancement of our migraine program. The dedication and hard work of our clinical and regulatory teams have been essential in bringing us to this point, and we are incredibly thankful for their efforts,” commented Marc Forth, President and Chief Executive Officer of AEON. “We extend our sincere thanks to the patients, caregivers, and investigators who dedicated their time and effort to participate in our Phase 2 study focusing on episodic and chronic migraine.” The ongoing Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABP-450 for the prevention of chronic migraine in adults who suffer from 15 or more headache days per month and at least 8 migraine days per month. In December 2023, the study completed the enrollment of 492 patients across approximately 50 sites in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Patients have at least a one-year history of migraine (with or without aura) according to the ICHD-3 (2018) definition and diagnostic criteria. Study subjects were randomized evenly across a low-dose group receiving 150 units of ABP-450, a high dose group receiving 195 units of ABP-450, and a placebo group. All patients will receive two treatment cycles 12 weeks apart utilizing the Company’s patented treatment paradigm (U.S. Patent No. 11,826,405) involving fewer injections than the current botulinum toxin treatment option for migraine. The interim analysis will include approximately 100 chronic migraine patients in each of the three arms that have completed the two 12-week treatment cycles. At the end of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, the FDA confirmed the primary endpoint to evaluate the change in mean monthly migraine days (MMD) across the entire second injection cycle (weeks 13-24) relative to the 4-week baseline period, as compared to placebo. The EOP2 meeting also confirmed the use of this same primary endpoint for the final analysis of the Phase 2 chronic migraine cohort, as well as for the planned Phase 3 studies in the prevention of both episodic migraine and chronic migraine. This 12-week evaluation period (weeks 13-24) will also flow through to the secondary endpoints and was based on the improved effect observed in the Phase 2 episodic migraine study. The key secondary outcome measures for the chronic migraine group will include the percentage of patients achieving a reduction of ≥50% in MMD from the 4-week baseline period to Weeks 13 to 24 treatment period, the percentage of patients achieving a reduction of ≥75% in MMD from the 4-week baseline period to Weeks 13 to 24 treatment period, the change in mean monthly headache days (MHD) from the 4-week baseline period to Weeks 13 to 24 treatment period, and overall mean change from baseline in MHD throughout the study. About Migraine Migraine is a complex neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of headaches that affects approximately 40 million people in the United States and approximately a billion people worldwide, making migraine the third most prevalent illness in the world. Patients that live with migraine experience symptoms that include recurring throbbing headache pain, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, touch and smell. Migraine can be categorized as episodic migraine or chronic migraine. The Company projects that approximately 9.4 million Americans live with episodic migraine, which is characterized by fewer than 15 headache days per month and between 6 to 14 migraine days per month, but each individual attack can be just as debilitating. About ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) Injection ABP-450 contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type-A complex produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The active part of the botulinum toxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDa of the complex is made up of accessory proteins that the Company believes help with the function of the active portion of the botulinum toxin. When injected at therapeutic levels, ABP-450 blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle. About AEON Biopharma AEON is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing its proprietary botulinum toxin complex, ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) injection, or ABP-450, for debilitating medical conditions, with an initial focus on the neurosciences market. AEON recently completed a Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the treatment of cervical dystonia, released topline data from its Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine, and has an ongoing Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. ABP-450 is the same botulinum toxin complex that is currently approved and marketed for cosmetic indications by Evolus under the name Jeuveau. ABP-450 is manufactured by Daewoong in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, in a facility that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, Health Canada and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. AEON has exclusive development and distribution rights for therapeutic indications of ABP-450 in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and certain other international territories. The Company has built a highly experienced management team with specific experience in biopharmaceutical and botulinum toxin development and commercialization.

Successful outcome from FDA meeting supports advancement of ABP-450 into Phase 3 trials. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement of $15 million in senior secured convertible notes by AEON Biopharma, Inc. with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., LTD is a strategic move that could bolster the company's financial position. The capital injection is earmarked for late-stage clinical development of ABP-450, a botulinum toxin complex and for general working capital purposes. This influx of funds is significant as it demonstrates investor confidence in AEON's pipeline, particularly in the advancement of ABP-450, which has shown promising Phase 2 data in treating episodic migraine.The termination of the forward purchase agreements (FPAs) is another critical aspect. While this decision could be seen as a loss of potential future funding, it also eliminates future obligations and simplifies the capitalization structure. This simplification may appeal to investors who prefer transparency and a more straightforward equity picture. However, the FPA Providers retaining 6,275,000 shares could dilute existing shareholders' equity, potentially impacting the stock price negatively in the short term. Market Research Analyst The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive. AEON's successful end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the FDA and its plans for Phase 3 trials position the company favorably in the market. The ability to move forward with a clear regulatory path is a positive indicator for potential investors and partners. However, the market will be closely monitoring the upcoming interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 program for chronic migraine, as this will provide further insights into ABP-450's efficacy and safety profile.Daewoong's involvement, particularly the appointment of a senior management member to AEON's Board of Directors, could signal deeper strategic collaboration. This relationship may provide AEON with additional expertise and potentially access to new markets, especially in Asia where Daewoong is based. The long-term impact of this partnership will depend on the success of ABP-450's clinical development and the execution of AEON's growth strategy. Biotech Industry Analyst AEON's focus on botulinum toxin complex development is part of a broader industry trend towards specialized, targeted therapies. The botulinum toxin market is expected to grow, driven by an increasing number of therapeutic applications beyond cosmetic uses. AEON's ABP-450, if successful, could capture a significant market share, especially in the migraine treatment space where there is a high unmet medical need.Investors should note that the biotech industry faces high regulatory hurdles and significant research and development costs. While AEON's recent FDA meeting is a positive development, the true test will be the Phase 3 trials' outcomes. These trials are more extensive and expensive and their results will be critical in determining ABP-450's commercial viability. The strategic funding through convertible notes offers flexibility but also indicates potential for future equity dilution when the notes convert, which investors should monitor closely. 03/19/2024 - 04:29 PM -- Termination of the Forward Purchase Agreements simplifies AEON’s capitalization structure -- -- AEON to expand its Board of Directors with appointment of candidate selected by its strategic partner following full funding of transaction -- IRVINE, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AEON Biopharma, Inc.

This could lead to increased market penetration and customer base expansion for Sun Life, as these employers are provided with a more manageable way to offer competitive benefits. The move may also stimulate economic growth in the regions where FLI is offered, as it can improve worker satisfaction and productivity, which are key drivers of economic performance. Human Resources Consultant As an HR consultant, the introduction of Sun Life's FLI in additional states is noteworthy for its potential impact on workplace culture and employee well-being. The ability for employees to take paid leave without the stress of financial instability can lead to a healthier, more engaged workforce. This initiative can also serve as a catalyst for companies to reevaluate their benefits offerings in light of changing employee expectations and to remain competitive in the job market.For employers, the decision to integrate FLI into their benefits package can also be seen as an investment in their human capital. Companies that support their employees during critical times, such as family or medical leave, often see a return in the form of loyalty and reduced turnover. The fact that Sun Life's FLI is aligned with existing tax credits makes it an even more attractive proposition for employers, as it eases the financial burden of providing such benefits. Economist From an economic standpoint, the expansion of FLI by Sun Life U.S. could have a ripple effect on the labor market and overall economic health. Paid family leave policies have been shown to support labor market attachment by enabling workers to take necessary leave without exiting the workforce. This can lead to a more stable employment landscape and can help reduce the long-term costs associated with employee turnover and retraining.Additionally, by supporting the legislative proposal for an employer paid leave tax credit, Sun Life is aligning with public policy that incentivizes businesses to offer such benefits. This alignment may suggest a growing trend of private-public partnerships in addressing workforce needs, which could lead to more comprehensive and sustainable economic policies. As more states potentially approve the offering, there could be a broader national impact, fostering a more uniform approach to family leave across different state jurisdictions. 03/19/2024 - 02:24 PM WELLESLEY, Mass., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sun Life U.S. has expanded its Family Leave Insurance (FLI) offering to Florida, with more states on the way. Sun Life currently offers FLI in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas. The fully insured offering broadens workers' access to paid leave, giving more employers the option to provide a valuable benefit to their employees more easily. Sun Life has long been an advocate for paid leave, working with state programs to include a private option and supporting the recent legislative proposal from Senators Deb Fischer and Angus King to expand access to the employer paid leave tax credit. Sun Life FLI aligns with the current tax credit and will align with changes in the future. ""We believe every worker in this country should have the option to take paid leave, and no one should have to choose between their job and caring for a loved one,"" said David Healy, president, Group Benefits, Sun Life U.S. ""While the Family and Medical Leave Act provides unpaid leave up to 12 weeks, many employees have the difficult decision of whether they can afford to take time off to address their needs. Employers in Florida can choose to offer paid family leave benefits to their employees, who will have the ability to care for a loved one when necessary and return to work less stressed, and ready to be productive."" Built on decades of industry experience and expertise on leave, absence management, and return-to-work models, Sun Life FLI fills a substantial benefits gap for employers in states without government programs. Sun Life FLI is offered as fully insured coverage, helping small and mid-size employers offer the benefit without the risk of self-funding. ""In addition to giving workers access to paid leave, FLI gives employers a powerful tool for talent recruitment and retention, as more often, workers seek out a robust benefits offering when considering jobs,"" said Sheila Sokolski, assistant vice president, Product and Marketing, Sun Life U.S. ""We are pleased to expand this benefit in more states, which will also contribute to their economic growth."" With Sun Life FLI, employees get the benefit of Sun Life's online claims submission, and employers can track employees' leave details, supporting overall health and productivity management. Sun Life FLI is available for quoting in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Tennessee and Texas on April 1, with additional states expected to approve filing in the coming months.

As a complete upgrade for the original flight deck, Garmin's industry-leading avionics solutions will fully replace the legacy systems, modernizing the airplane and reducing pilot workload by bringing new capabilities and safety-enhancing technologies. The all-Garmin retrofit will include TXi™ flight displays, GTN™ Xi navigators, GFC™ 600 digital autopilot and several more optional upgrades. ""Garmin has decades of experience serving Citation aircraft and we are excited to bring a transformative Garmin cockpit experience to the CJ2, including fully coupled descent VNAV with the GFC 600, the GWX™ 8000 StormOptix weather radar and the PlaneSync™ connected aircraft management system. This all-Garmin avionics upgrade program for the CJ2 brings new technologies and unmatched capabilities, focused on reducing pilot workload and providing pilots of this high performance, single-pilot certified aircraft the safety benefits of automation found in today's modern cockpits."" –Carl Wolf, Garmin Vice President of Aviation Sales and Marketing Specifically tailored to the CJ2 airframe and operator, the all-Garmin avionics upgrade program transforms the current fragmented avionics architecture to an integrated cockpit experience. Here's a closer look at what's included in the full retrofit solution: Flight displays and navigation The all-glass cockpit upgrade features two G600 TXi flight displays providing advanced primary flight display (PFD) and multi-function display (MFD) capabilities with a touchscreen interface. Primary flight data is displayed with a wide horizon view on Garmin synthetic vision technology (SVT™) for optimal awareness in IFR, marginal VFR or nighttime conditions. The PFD also offers a map view within the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) to show weather, traffic, airport diagrams and more without requiring a full MFD window. The CJ2 upgrade includes the GI 275 standby flight instrument on the pilot-side, with an option for an additional instrument on the copilot-side. GI 275 is available with Garmin SVT and seamlessly integrates with the primary flight displays to sync heading, altimeter, airspeed and altitude selections. A notable improvement with the upgrade is the availability of the pilot's side PFD and each GI 275, while operating on the aircraft's emergency electrical bus. The system includes situational awareness features specific to the CJ2, such as Stabilized Approach monitoring and aural V-speed alerting during takeoff. Stabilized Approach monitoring provides an additional layer of protection. While on approach, the system monitors the aircraft to ensure it's operated in a stabilized manner. Aural annunciations — such as ""speed,"" ""course,"" ""glidepath"" and ""sink rate"" — notify the pilot if the aircraft is exceeding predetermined speed, course or vertical descent rates. The TXi Engine Indication System (EIS) will be certified to replace the legacy EIS solution and features a newly refined gauge layout and user interface. EIS-generated or user-selected N1 targets for takeoff, go-around and max continuous thrust settings are integrated and displayed on TXi EIS. N1 reference bugs, which take into account engine and anti-ice status, as well as outside air temperature, are computed automatically and integrated into the TXi EIS display. Pilot-defined N1 reference bugs are also available in the system. Additionally, CJ2 pilots can take advantage of integrated timers on the TXi EIS display, helping pilots respect transient engine limitations during the engine start. GTN Xi navigators add next-generation GPS/NAV/COMM capabilities to this light jet, enabling coupled descent vertical navigation (VNAV) in combination with the GFC 600 autopilot and allowing pilots to create and execute holding patterns over a published or user-defined waypoint. Pilots can easily visualize the entire flight plan, including departures, arrivals, visual/instrument approaches and more on the navigators 6.9-inch display. For simplified IFR routings, GTN Xi allows pilots to view airway segments available from a waypoint as well as corresponding exit options. Additionally, the flight crew can wirelessly1 load flight plans and share traffic, weather and more from their compatible mobile device. GFC 600 brings new autopilot capabilities The GFC 600 digital autopilot delivers CJ2 pilots superior in-flight characteristics and new operational capabilities such as coupled VNAV descents and coupled go-around capability while executing a missed approach, allowing automation to assist during high workload procedures. Guidance from the GTN Xi allows the GFC 600 to seamlessly link the enroute, terminal and approach procedures, allowing continuous descents and smooth VNAV transitions through the instrument approach, simplifying the pilot's workload in the terminal environment. The CJ2 solution also features Emergency Descent Mode (EDM). In the event of a loss of cabin pressurization, EDM can automatically descend the aircraft to a preset altitude without pilot intervention to help avert hypoxic situations. A color display and flight level change (FLC) mode round out new GFC 600 features on a modernized mode controller for this installation. GWX 8000 weather radar with Auto Mode The GWX 8000 StormOptix weather radar simplifies operations and brings peace of mind to single-pilot and crewed aircraft while operating in and near complex weather. Auto Mode lets pilots simply set the range, and the radar automatically adjusts tilt and gain settings to accurately profile weather cells, so pilots can analyze returns from hazardous storm cell activity. The system displays the weather with 16 colors while also showcasing hail and lightning prediction, turbulence detection and advanced ground clutter suppression. The weather radar integrates with TXi flight displays and GTN 750Xi navigators to display radar returns. The new display grouping feature lets pilots operating in the crewed environment look at individual tilts and returns on their side of the cockpit when in manual mode. The GWX 8000 weather radar upgrade is offered as an option, and for more details, visit Garmin.com/GWX8000. Jet management made easier with PlaneSync Using a 4G LTE cellular or Wi-Fi ® connection provided by the optional GDL® 60 datalink, the PlaneSync connected aircraft management system can help simplify the complexities of owning and operating the CJ2. PlaneSync automatically downloads avionics database updates2 and leverages high-speed integration amongst the avionics to quickly synchronize updates across the displays. The system can operate with a dedicated battery so that operators don't need to be present and conduct time-consuming manual updates via data card. PlaneSync can also allow pilots to remotely check fuel quantity, database status, GPS location, temperatures and more via the Garmin Pilot™ app3 to help avoid surprises when they arrive at the aircraft. With added capability expected in 2025, PlaneSync can also automatically transmit flight and engine log data to secure cloud storage after landing. Completing the All-Garmin CJ2 Upgrade Program CJ2 operators can also take advantage of other optional upgrades to add new capabilities to their aircraft. The GMA™ 35C audio panel adds audio processing with advanced capabilities including auto squelch, 3D audio and Bluetooth® wireless connectivity to allow music or telephone audio from a mobile device. Additionally, the GTX™ 345R transponder can provide ADS-B ""Out"" capability with optional antenna diversity, while also providing ""ADS-B ""In"" weather and traffic benefits. Other options include the GDL 69A SiriusXM datalink, GTS™ series traffic systems and GSR 56 datalink for weather, calling and messaging connectivity. The full retrofit solution in the Cessna Citation CJ2 is expected to be available in Q2 of 2024 through Garmin Authorized Dealer network. Garmin plans to certify a similar avionics upgrade program for the Cessna Citation CJ1.To learn more, visit Garmin.com/CJ2.

FedEx Invests USD 350 Million in New State-of-the-Art Hub at Dubai World Central Airport in Dubai South,2024-03-19T18:15:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"FedEx Express inaugurates a new MEISA hub at Dubai World Central Airport, investing over USD 350 million in the UAE's economy.

The hub aims to enhance global connectivity and support trade and commerce, aligning with the nation's economic growth agenda. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The establishment of a new FedEx hub in Dubai represents a strategic expansion that could potentially enhance the company's competitive edge in the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent and Africa (MEISA) region. By investing over USD 350 million into this advanced facility, FedEx is poised to capitalize on the strategic location of Dubai, which serves as a crossroads for east-west trade. This move aligns with broader economic trends where logistics companies are expanding their networks to ensure faster delivery times and improved service quality in response to rising e-commerce demands.From a market perspective, this development could be seen as a response to the increasing importance of logistics in global trade efficiency. The investment in infrastructure and technology at the Dubai hub is likely to result in operational efficiencies and cost savings over the long term. These improvements may lead to higher profit margins and could be a driver for stock performance, as investors typically look favorably upon expansions that promise to enhance a company's market position and future profitability. Financial Analyst Financially, the USD 350 million investment in the Dubai hub is a significant capital expenditure for FedEx. The short-term impact on cash flow and earnings may be negative due to the upfront costs associated with the construction and implementation of the hub. However, investors often evaluate such investments with a long-term perspective. The hub's potential to streamline operations and reduce delivery times can lead to increased market share and revenue growth in the MEISA region, which is a key emerging market.Furthermore, this move should be analyzed in the context of FedEx's global strategy and financial health. If FedEx manages to leverage this hub to enhance its logistics network, it could see a positive impact on its balance sheet through improved asset utilization and potentially higher returns on investment. The long-term financial implications will depend on how effectively FedEx integrates this hub into its global operations and whether it can achieve the projected efficiencies and market penetration. Economist The investment by FedEx into the UAE economy is indicative of the broader economic diversification efforts in the region. The UAE's 'National Agenda for Non-oil Export Development' aims to increase foreign trade and reduce reliance on oil revenues. The presence of a major logistics hub can significantly contribute to this goal by facilitating trade and attracting foreign investment.The hub could have a multiplier effect on the local economy, creating jobs and stimulating ancillary businesses. In the long run, this could contribute to sustainable economic growth in the region, which in turn could create a positive feedback loop, reinforcing Dubai's status as a major business and logistics hub. However, it is important to note that the success of such large-scale investments is contingent upon stable geopolitical conditions and the continued liberalization of trade policies in the region. 03/19/2024 - 02:15 PM Elevating the UAE's Position in Global Logistics: The New FedEx Hub Highlights Innovation and EfficiencyDUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES / ACCESSWIRE / March 19, 2024 / FedEx Express (FedEx), a subsidiary of FedEx Corp.

Advertisers can access thousands of Liveboards in subway stations for targeted brand messaging. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of OUTFRONT Media's programmatic capabilities within the MTA system signifies a substantial step forward in the digital out of home (DOOH) advertising space. By increasing the number of programmatic signs to 3,800 across strategic locations, OUTFRONT leverages high traffic volumes to offer advertisers unprecedented reach. This move is likely to enhance the company's revenue streams and attractiveness to advertisers who prioritize targeted and flexible ad placements.Advertisers' ability to tailor their messaging based on time, day and location variables aligns with the growing demand for data-driven marketing strategies. As brands seek to navigate the post-cookie digital landscape, OUTFRONT's offering provides a valuable alternative to traditional online advertising channels. The potential for precise targeting and comprehensive campaign reporting could attract a broader clientele, potentially impacting OUTFRONT's market share within the OOH industry. Financial Analyst OUTFRONT Media's strategic initiative to digitize and expand its programmatic transit network is likely to be positively received by investors, given the scale and potential impact on the company's financial health. The deployment of thousands of Liveboards could lead to an increase in ad inventory and, consequently, higher ad sales. This expansion positions OUTFRONT to capitalize on the shift towards DOOH and could result in a competitive edge over other OOH media providers.Investors should observe the uptake of OUTFROUNT's programmatic offerings by major brands, as evidenced by partnerships with entities like The Trade Desk and the NBA. Successful adoption by high-profile clients can serve as a bellwether for future growth. However, it's essential to monitor how these investments in infrastructure translate into revenue growth and whether the costs associated with the rollout are offset by the gains in market share and ad sales. Advertising Technology Expert The digitization of transit advertising through programmatic technology represents a significant evolution in the OOH sector. OUTFRONT Media's initiative taps into the trend of integrating real-time data and automated ad buying, which has revolutionized online advertising. This approach offers advertisers agility in their campaigns, allowing for rapid adjustments based on audience behavior and environmental factors.Programmatic DOOH also presents an opportunity for brands to engage with consumers in a cookie-less world, where traditional online targeting methods are increasingly restricted. The ability to deliver full-motion video content in high-traffic areas further enhances ad recall and engagement, making it a compelling proposition for brands seeking to maximize their visibility and impact.

Announces Closing of $6.0 Million Underwritten Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary C3is Inc. (CISS) announces a public offering generating $6.0 million in gross proceeds. The offering includes Common Units and Pre-Funded Units with various warrants. The net proceeds will be used for capital expenditures, vessel acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes. Aegis Capital Corp. exercised its over-allotment option. The offering was managed by Aegis Capital Corp. and made under an effective registration statement. Positive None. Negative The offering may dilute existing shareholders' ownership due to the issuance of new Common Shares and Warrants. The Company still has a significant remaining purchase price for the Aframax tanker acquired in July 2023, which may impact its financial position. The Company has not yet identified the vessels it intends to acquire with the proceeds, introducing uncertainty into its future operations. Financial Analyst The public offering by C3is Inc. represents a strategic move to raise capital for the company's growth and operational needs. The gross proceeds of $6.0 million, though not substantial for a large-cap company, indicate a targeted approach to funding specific capital expenditures. The company's decision to use the proceeds for payment towards the Aframax tanker and potential acquisitions suggests a focus on expanding its fleet and possibly diversifying its service offerings beyond dry bulk and tanker sectors.The pricing of the Common Units at $0.05 and Pre-Funded Units at $0.04, below the current market price, could potentially dilute existing shareholders' value. However, it also offers an attractive entry point for new investors. The inclusion of Class C-1 and C-2 Warrants with a five-year expiration and exercise prices set at a premium to the offering price is a common incentive mechanism to encourage investment while providing the company with a potential future capital inflow if the warrants are exercised.The over-allotment option exercised by Aegis Capital Corp. and the role of Aegis as the sole book-running manager indicate confidence in the offering's success. However, investors should consider the implications of the additional warrants on future earnings per share and the company's ability to meet its capital needs through this offering and subsequent warrant exercises. Market Research Analyst The maritime shipping industry is subject to cyclical trends and is influenced by global economic conditions, trade volumes and commodity prices. C3is Inc.'s offering comes at a time when the industry is recovering from disruptions caused by global events and is facing new challenges such as environmental regulations and fuel costs. By raising capital, C3is Inc. is positioning itself to navigate these challenges and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.The choice to potentially diversify into other seaborne transportation sectors could be a strategic hedge against the volatility associated with dry bulk and crude oil markets. However, it also introduces risks related to entering new markets where the company may have less experience. The impact of this strategy on the company's market position and financial performance will be closely watched by investors and industry analysts.Investors should also monitor the utilization of the net proceeds, as effective deployment in capital expenditures and vessel acquisitions can enhance C3is Inc.'s competitive edge, while any missteps could lead to underperformance relative to peers. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, C3is Inc.'s offering has been conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, as indicated by the effective registration statement on Form F-1 with the SEC. The company's compliance with securities laws and the involvement of legal counsel, Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel LLP, for the book-running manager, provides a level of assurance to investors regarding the due diligence of the offering process.The final prospectus filed with the SEC is a critical document that investors should review to understand the offering's terms, risks and the company's financial position. It also serves as a legal safeguard, ensuring that all material information has been disclosed and reducing the risk of future litigation related to the offering.While the press release clearly states that the offering is not a solicitation in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful, investors should be aware of the legal implications of investing in securities and the potential for changes in regulations that could affect the company's operations and the value of these securities. 03/19/2024 - 12:44 PM ATHENS, Greece, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- C3is Inc. (Nasdaq: CISS) (the “Company”), a ship-owning company providing dry bulk and crude oil tanker seaborne transportation services, today announced the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $6.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses payable by the Company. The offering consisted of 120,000,000 Common Units or Pre-Funded Units, each consisting of one share of common stock (“Common Share”) or Pre-Funded Warrant, one half of a Class C-1 Warrant to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.075 per share (or 150% of the price of each Common Unit sold in the offering) or pursuant to an alternative cashless exercise option, which warrant will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the ""Class C-1 Warrants"") and one Class C-2 Warrant to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.085 per share (or 170% of the price of each Common Unit sold in the offering) which warrant will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the ""Class C-2 Warrants"" and together with the Class C-1 Warrants, the ""Warrants""). The purchase price of each Common Unit was $0.05, and the purchase price of each Pre-Funded Unit was $0.04 (which is equal to the public offering price per Common Unit minus $0.01). The Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures, including for payment towards the $38.7 million remaining purchase price for the Aframax tanker it acquired in July 2023, or acquisitions of additional vessels which it has not yet identified, which may include vessels in seaborne transportation sectors other than the dry bulk and tanker sectors, in which the Company currently operates, working capital, or for other general corporate purposes, or a combination thereof. In addition, the Company has granted Aegis Capital Corp. (“Aegis”) a 45-day option to purchase up to 15% of the number of Common Shares and/or Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the offering, and/or additional Warrants representing up to 15% of the Warrants sold in the offering solely to cover over-allotments, if any. On March 19, 2024, Aegis exercised its over-allotment exercise with respect to 7,450,000 Class C-1 Warrants and 14,900,000 Class C-2 Warrants.

Electronic copies of the final prospectus may be obtained by contacting Aegis Capital Corp., Attention: Syndicate Department, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 27th floor, New York, NY 10105, by email at syndicate@aegiscap.com, or by telephone at +1 (212) 813-1010.

Construction is Underway on Second Utility-Grade Solar Site in West Virginia,2024-03-19T16:31:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"FirstEnergy Corp.'s subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison are constructing a new solar site in West Virginia to boost renewable energy production and support economic growth. The Rivesville site will generate 5.5 MW of power, benefiting from a brownfield location. The company plans to build a total of five solar sites in the state, aiming for a collective generation of 50 MW.","Construction is Underway on Second Utility-Grade Solar Site in West Virginia Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FirstEnergy Corp.'s subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison are constructing a new solar site in West Virginia to boost renewable energy production and support economic growth. The Rivesville site will generate 5.5 MW of power, benefiting from a brownfield location. The company plans to build a total of five solar sites in the state, aiming for a collective generation of 50 MW. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The construction of Mon Power and Potomac Edison's new solar site represents a significant step in the energy transition within West Virginia. This move is not only about expanding renewable energy capacity but also about aligning with the growing corporate demand for green energy, which can be a competitive advantage in attracting businesses to the area. The initiative to transform a brownfield site into a utility-grade solar facility is a strategic use of land that has been previously underutilized, potentially mitigating environmental concerns and contributing to the company's corporate social responsibility profile.The investment in local manufacturing for the solar panels and equipment underscores a commitment to domestic sourcing, which may resonate positively with stakeholders and consumers increasingly concerned with supply chain ethics and sustainability. Moreover, employing local union workers for the construction can foster community goodwill and stimulate the local economy through job creation.The cumulative goal of generating 50 megawatts across all five planned sites could have a material impact on FirstEnergy's energy mix and operational efficiency. However, the financial implications for FirstEnergy will depend on the project's cost, the ability to secure customer subscriptions and the regulatory environment, particularly any incentives or subsidies for renewable energy projects. Financial Analyst FirstEnergy's investment into solar infrastructure is indicative of the broader industry trend where utilities are diversifying their energy portfolios. Investors will likely assess the long-term revenue potential from these renewable assets against the upfront capital expenditures and ongoing operational costs. The solar sites' ability to attract customer subscriptions is key, as it directly affects revenue projections. The mention of seeking final approval from the Public Service Commission suggests regulatory hurdles that could influence project timelines and financial outcomes.The stock market typically reacts to such developments with a focus on future earnings potential and cost savings from renewable energy sources. However, the market will also be vigilant about the execution risks associated with construction and regulatory compliance. The strategic shift towards renewables may be viewed favorably if it aligns with investor sentiment on sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.It is important to monitor FirstEnergy's quarterly financials following the solar sites' completion to evaluate the return on investment and the impact on the company's overall profitability and market valuation. Environmental Economist The construction of the Rivesville solar site by FirstEnergy is a pertinent example of how environmental and economic objectives can converge. The site's projected capacity to power a significant number of homes with renewable energy illustrates the potential for job creation and economic stimulation in the short term, while contributing to emissions reduction in the long term.The choice of a brownfield site for the solar installation is economically efficient, leveraging land that might otherwise remain unused. This approach can also reduce the opportunity cost typically associated with greenfield developments. The environmental benefits extend beyond clean energy production, potentially improving local land values and contributing to community revitalization.However, the transition to renewable energy can have complex economic implications, including the potential for stranded assets in the fossil fuel sector and the need for new investments in grid infrastructure to accommodate intermittent power sources like solar. The success of such projects in delivering economic benefits will depend on careful management of these transitions and the responsiveness of the market and regulatory frameworks. 03/19/2024 - 12:31 PM Mon Power and Potomac Edison's Rivesville site stimulating economy in Marion County and beyond FAIRMONT, W.Va., March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison have begun construction on their second utility-grade solar site in West Virginia to help meet the state's energy needs and further encourage economic growth. Click here to view and/or download drone footage of the Rivesville site construction. The Rivesville solar site in Marion County will be situated along Morgan Ridge Road on approximately 27 acres. Once installed, the solar panels there will produce up to 5.5 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. One MW of solar energy powers a national average of 173 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The property, owned by the companies, is a brownfield site that has gone unused since the Rivesville Power Station was deactivated in 2012. Jim Myers, President of FirstEnergy's West Virginia Operations: ""We are proud to be transforming a former coal ash disposal site into a source of clean renewable energy for our customers. We believe the energy generated by our West Virginia solar sites will continue to encourage economic development in the state because a growing number of companies require a portion of the electricity they purchase to be generated by renewable sources."" The Rivesville solar site is the second of the companies' five planned solar sites in West Virginia. The companies' first solar site, which sits on 80 acres at the Fort Martin Power Station, was connected to the distribution grid in January 2024 and can produce up to 18.9 MW of solar energy per hour. The Rivesville solar site is being constructed by local union workers, just like the Fort Martin site. In recent weeks, crews have prepared the Rivesville site by removing trees, constructing roads and installing fences ahead of upcoming electrical and mechanical work. The solar panels, racking systems and supporting electrical equipment for the site are made in the United States. Ultimately, the companies' five sites are expected to collectively generate 50 megawatts of renewable energy. Construction of the Rivesville site and a third site in Berkeley County (5.7 MW), is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The companies also plan to seek final approval from the Public Service Commission of West Virginia to build the additional two solar sites in Davis, Tucker County (11.5 MW), and Weirton, Hancock County (8.4 MW), once customers subscribe to the energy they will produce. To subscribe or find out more about the solar program, Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia can submit their information through the website at firstenergycorp.com/WVSolar or by calling 1-800-505-7283.

Takeda Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) in Adult Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL,2024-03-19T16:20:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Takeda's ICLUSIG receives FDA approval as the first targeted treatment for frontline Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the U.S., showing superior results in MRD-negative Complete Remission rates compared to imatinib.","Takeda Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) in Adult Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags fda approval Rhea-AI Summary Takeda's ICLUSIG receives FDA approval as the first targeted treatment for frontline Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the U.S., showing superior results in MRD-negative Complete Remission rates compared to imatinib. Positive ICLUSIG granted FDA approval for treating adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. Approval based on MRD-negative CR at the end of induction from the Phase 3 PhALLCON trial. ICLUSIG demonstrated over two-fold improvement in MRD-negative CR compared to imatinib. Safety profile of ICLUSIG found to be comparable to imatinib with no new safety signals identified. ICLUSIG's approval supported by Real-Time Oncology Review program for expedited delivery of cancer medicines. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The approval of ICLUSIG for frontline treatment in Ph+ ALL represents a significant advancement in the management of this aggressive cancer. The use of MRD-negative CR as a primary endpoint for FDA approval is noteworthy, as it signifies the shift towards more precise and predictive measures of treatment efficacy. MRD-negative status is strongly associated with improved survival outcomes and thus, this approval could potentially enhance long-term patient survival rates. However, it is important to monitor the long-term outcomes through confirmatory trials, as the accelerated approval is contingent on these results.Furthermore, the direct comparison of ICLUSIG to imatinib, a standard treatment and demonstrating a two-fold improvement in MRD-negative CR rates is a compelling clinical finding. It suggests that ICLUSIG could become a preferred treatment option, potentially leading to changes in treatment guidelines. However, the safety profile will need continuous monitoring, as kinase inhibitors can have significant adverse effects. The comparability to imatinib in terms of safety is reassuring, but the long-term side effect profile will be essential for determining its position in therapy. Medical Research Analyst The accelerated approval of ICLUSIG by the FDA, facilitated by the RTOR program, underscores the agency's commitment to bringing potentially life-saving treatments to patients more swiftly. The data from the PhALLCON study suggests that ICLUSIG has a superior efficacy profile in achieving MRD-negative CR when compared to imatinib. This is a critical consideration for investors, as the drug's performance in the market will depend on its clinical benefits and its adoption by oncologists.Investors should also be aware that the continued approval of ICLUSIG in this new indication depends on the outcomes of future confirmatory trials. The potential for expanded market share is significant, but there is also a risk if the long-term benefits do not align with the initial findings. The drug's success in this new indication could impact Takeda's revenue and market positioning within the oncology sector, especially considering the rarity and aggressiveness of Ph+ ALL. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Takeda's expansion of ICLUSIG's label to include frontline treatment for Ph+ ALL is a strategic move that could open up a new revenue stream for the company. The rarity of Ph+ ALL means that the market size is relatively small, but the lack of effective treatments creates a high unmet need, which ICLUSIG is now positioned to fill. The drug's superior efficacy in achieving MRD-negative CR could drive its adoption, despite its accelerated approval status.Moreover, the approval under the RTOR program may give Takeda a competitive edge by potentially shortening the time to market for ICLUSIG in this new indication. However, investors should consider the implications of the drug's pricing, reimbursement challenges and the cost associated with the required confirmatory trials. The impact on Takeda's stock will likely depend on how these factors balance against the drug's clinical success and market uptake. 03/19/2024 - 12:20 PM − ICLUSIG Becomes the First and Only Targeted Treatment Approved in the U.S. for Frontline Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Combination with Chemotherapy − First FDA Approval in Ph+ ALL Based on Novel Primary Endpoint of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative Complete Remission (CR) − Accelerated Approval Based on Data from the Phase 3 PhALLCON Trial, in which ICLUSIG Demonstrated Superiority in MRD-negative Complete Remission Rates and Comparable Safety to Imatinib OSAKA, Japan & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Takeda (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in combination with chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission (CR) at the end of induction. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. This accelerated approval application was granted Priority Review and evaluated under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, an FDA initiative designed to expedite the delivery of cancer medicines by allowing components of an application to be reviewed before submission of the complete application. “This label expansion for ICLUSIG is an incredibly exciting milestone, allowing U.S. adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL to have an approved, targeted treatment option in the frontline,” said Awny Farajallah, MD, chief medical officer, oncology at Takeda. “We are thrilled that the FDA has recognized the potential of ICLUSIG to fill a large gap in care for these patients and look forward to seeing the impact this can have on people with this rare and aggressive form of cancer.” The approval was supported by data from the PhALLCON study – the first, global, Phase 3, registrational, head-to-head clinical trial in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. The study, in which patients received either ICLUSIG or imatinib, plus reduced-intensity chemotherapy, met its primary endpoint of MRD-negative CR at the end of induction. MRD-negative CR is a composite endpoint defined in alignment with the FDA that reflects deep molecular and clinical responses and is an important prognostic indicator for long-term outcomes for patients with Ph+ ALL. ICLUSIG demonstrated superiority compared to imatinib, with patients who received ICLUSIG achieving a greater than two-fold improvement in the rate of MRD-negative CR at the end of induction (cycle 3). In the trial, the safety profile of ICLUSIG was comparable to imatinib, and no new safety signals were identified. “Ph+ ALL is an extremely aggressive cancer and patients with this disease suffer from poor outcomes. There has long been a need for a potent TKI that can suppress mutation development and elicit deep responses in the frontline,” said Elias Jabbour, MD, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and lead investigator of the PhALLCON trial. “Ponatinib may help address these factors and impact long-term outcomes.” ICLUSIG is a kinase inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD-negative CR at the end of induction. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In addition, it is approved as monotherapy in Ph+ ALL for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL, chronic-phase (CP) CML with resistance or intolerance to at least two prior kinase inhibitors, accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated or T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase). ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML. About the PhALLCON Trial The PhALLCON study is a Phase 3, randomized, international, open-label multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ICLUSIG versus imatinib, in combination with reduced-intensity chemotherapy as a frontline therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. A total of 245 patients were randomized 2:1 and treated with ICLUSIG or imatinib plus reduced-intensity chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 54 and 52 in the ICLUSIG and imatinib arms, respectively. 164 patients were treated with ICLUSIG receiving a starting dose of 30mg/day and 81 patients were treated with imatinib at a starting dose of 600mg/day. All patients received either ICLUSIG or imatinib with reduced-intensity chemotherapy through induction, consolidation and maintenance phase. After combination therapy, patients continued to receive single-agent ICLUSIG or imatinib until relapse from CR, progressive disease (PD), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), start of alternative therapy or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was MRD-negative CR rate at the end of induction (3 cycles of treatment). Event-free survival, the key secondary endpoint of the trial, is not yet mature. About Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) Ph+ ALL is a rare form of ALL that affects approximately 25% of adult ALL patients in the U.S. and is characterized by the presence of an abnormal gene, known as the Philadelphia chromosome. In patients who are Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), an abnormal chromosome is formed when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 switch with each other. This forms a longer chromosome 9 and a shorter chromosome 22, which leads to the development of BCR::ABL1 and is associated with Ph+ ALL. About ICLUSIG® (ponatinib) tablets ICLUSIG is a kinase inhibitor targeting BCR::ABL1, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in CML and Ph+ ALL. ICLUSIG is a targeted cancer medicine developed using a computational and structure-based drug-design platform, specifically designed to inhibit the activity of BCR::ABL1 and its mutations. ICLUSIG inhibits native BCR::ABL1, as well as all BCR::ABL1 treatment-resistant mutations, including the most resistant T315I mutation. This mutation has been associated with resistance to all other approved TKIs. ICLUSIG received full approval from the FDA in November 2016. ICLUSIG is a kinase inhibitor indicated in the U.S. for adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD-negative CR at the end of induction. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In addition, it is approved as monotherapy in Ph+ ALL for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL, chronic-phase (CP) CML with resistance or intolerance to at least two prior kinase inhibitors, accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML for whom no other kinase inhibitors are indicated, or T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase). ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: ARTERIAL OCCLUSIVE EVENTS, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Arterial occlusive events (AOEs), including fatalities, have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. AOEs included fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. Monitor for evidence of AOEs. Interrupt or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. Consider benefit-risk to guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG. Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor for evidence of VTEs. Interrupt or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor for heart failure and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt or discontinue ICLUSIG for new or worsening heart failure. Hepatotoxicity, liver failure and death have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. Monitor liver function tests. Interrupt or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Arterial Occlusive Events (AOEs): AOEs, including fatalities, have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. These included cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events. In PhALLCON, 6% of 163 patients experienced AOEs; 3.7% experienced Grade 3 or 4. The incidence of AOEs in OPTIC (45 mg-> 15 mg) was 14% of 94 patients; 6% experienced Grade 3 or 4. In PACE, the incidence of AOEs was 26% of 449 patients; 14% experienced Grade 3 or 4. Fatal AOEs occurred in 0.6% of patients in PhALLCON, 2.1% of patients in OPTIC, and in 2% of patients in PACE. Some patients in PACE experienced recurrent or multisite vascular occlusion. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed with these events in PACE were history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and non-ischemic cardiac disease. In PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE, AOEs were more frequent with increasing age. In PhALLCON, patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or diabetes were excluded. Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, venous thromboembolism, clinically significant atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmias, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 6 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were also excluded. In OPTIC, patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease were excluded. In PACE, patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG were excluded. Consider whether the benefits of ICLUSIG are expected to exceed the risks. Monitor for evidence of AOEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Consider benefit-risk to guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG. Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs): Serious or severe VTEs have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PhALLCON, VTEs occurred in 12% of 163 patients, including serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 3.1% of patients. One of 94 patients in OPTIC experienced a VTE (Grade 1 retinal vein occlusion). In PACE, VTEs occurred in 6% of 449 patients including serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) VTEs in 5.8% of patients. In PhALLCON and PACE VTEs included deep venous thrombosis, embolism, pulmonary embolism, superficial vein thrombosis, thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss. The incidence of VTEs in PACE was higher in patients with Ph+ ALL (9% of 32 patients) and BP-CML (10% of 62 patients). Monitor for evidence of VTEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Heart Failure: Fatal, serious or severe heart failure events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PhALLCON, heart failure occurred in 6% of 163 patients; 1.2% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) heart failure. Heart failure occurred in 13% of 94 patients in OPTIC; 1.1% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4). In PACE, heart failure occurred in 9% of 449 patients; 7% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or higher). In PhALLCON the most frequently reported heart failure event (>1 patient) was increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (2.5%). In OPTIC, the most frequently reported heart failure events (>1 patient each) were left ventricular hypertrophy (3.2%) and BNP increased (3.2%). In PACE, the most frequently reported heart failure events (≥2%) were congestive cardiac failure (3.1%), decreased ejection fraction (2.9%), and cardiac failure (2%). Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and manage heart failure as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG for new or worsening heart failure. Hepatotoxicity: ICLUSIG can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in 3 patients, with hepatic failure occurring within 1 week of starting ICLUSIG in one of these patients. These fatal cases occurred in patients with BP-CML or Ph+ ALL treated with monotherapy. Hepatotoxicity occurred in 66% of 163 patients in PhALLCON, in 28% of 94 patients in OPTIC and in 32% of 449 patients in PACE. Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity occurred in PhALLCON (30% of 163 patients), in OPTIC (6% of 94 patients), and in PACE (13% of 449 patients). The most frequent hepatotoxic events were elevations of ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at a reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Hypertension: Serious or severe hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated and manage hypertension as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop ICLUSIG if hypertension is not medically controlled. For significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt ICLUSIG and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis. Pancreatitis: Serious or severe pancreatitis has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Elevations of lipase and amylase also occurred. In the majority of cases that led to dose modification or treatment discontinuation, pancreatitis resolved within 2-3 weeks. Monitor serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. Evaluate for pancreatitis when lipase elevation is accompanied by abdominal symptoms. Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML: In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML, single agent ICLUSIG 45 mg once daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the ICLUSIG arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, ICLUSIG-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Neuropathy: Peripheral and cranial neuropathy occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. Some of these events in PhALLCON and PACE were Grade 3 or 4. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Ocular Toxicity: Serious or severe ocular toxicity leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. The most frequent ocular toxicities occurring in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE were dry eye, blurred vision, and eye pain. Retinal toxicities included age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment. Hemorrhage: Fatal and serious hemorrhage events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Fatal hemorrhages occurred in PACE and serious hemorrhages occurred in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. In PACE, the incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most frequently reported serious hemorrhages. Events often occurred in patients with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Monitor for hemorrhage and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Fluid Retention: Fatal and serious fluid retention events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PACE, one instance of brain edema was fatal and serious events included pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and angioedema. In PhALLCON serious fluid retention included pericardial effusion. The most frequent occurrences of fluid retention in patients who received ICLUSIG were peripheral edema and pleural effusion. Monitor for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular, atrial arrhythmias, tachycardia, syncope, atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC, and PACE. For some patients, events were serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) and led to hospitalization. Monitor for signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness) and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Myelosuppression: Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. In PACE, the incidence of myelosuppression was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL treated with monotherapy than in patients with CP-CML. Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated. If ANC less than 1 x 109/L or platelets less than 50 x 109/L, interrupt ICLUSIG until ANC at least 1.5 x 109/L and platelets at least 75 x 109/L, then resume at same or reduced dose. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Serious TLS was reported in ICLUSIG-treated patients in PhALLCON, OPTIC and PACE. Ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating ICLUSIG. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): RPLS (also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been reported in patients who received ICLUSIG. Patients may present with neurological signs and symptoms, visual disturbances, and hypertension. Diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Interrupt ICLUSIG until resolution. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG in patients upon resolution of RPLS is unknown. Impaired Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Impaired wound healing occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Withhold ICLUSIG for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Permanently discontinue in patients with gastrointestinal perforation. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 3 weeks after the last dose. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (occurring in >20% of patients) are: ICLUSIG as a single agent: rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, dry skin, hypertension, fatigue, fluid retention and edema, pyrexia, nausea, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, hemorrhage, anemia, hepatic dysfunction and AOEs. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) are platelet count decreased, neutrophil cell count decreased, and white blood cell decreased. ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy: hepatic dysfunction, arthralgia, rash and related conditions, headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, hypertension, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neuropathy peripheral, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, fluid retention and edema, vomiting, paresthesia and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) are decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil cell count, decreased platelet count, decreased lymphocyte cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased lipase and increased alanine aminotransferase. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals at 1-844-817-6468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration or reduce ICLUSIG dose if coadministration cannot be avoided. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 1 week following last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ICLUSIG. Ponatinib may impair fertility in females, and it is not known if these effects are reversible. Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment: For patients with CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL receiving monotherapy, reduce the starting dose of ICLUSIG to 30mg orally once daily for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment as these patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions compared to patients with normal hepatic function. For patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, no dosage adjustment is recommended.

The program offers proactive solutions leveraging AI-driven data and expert insights to drive competitive advantage. Three tailored offerings cater to different customer needs, including free resources, expert collaboration, and hands-on support. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Yext's service and support portfolio, particularly the introduction of the Yext Customer Success program, appears to be a strategic move to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. By shifting from a reactive to a proactive service model, Yext is aiming to differentiate itself in the competitive digital marketing landscape. This proactive approach could potentially lead to increased customer retention and acquisition, as businesses often seek partners that offer not just tools, but also strategic insights and actionable recommendations.From a market perspective, investors might view this enhancement as a positive indicator of Yext's commitment to growth and customer-centric innovation. If successful, the new program could lead to an uptick in subscription renewals and an expansion of the customer base, which in turn, could have a favorable impact on Yext's revenue streams and market position. However, the effectiveness of such a program will largely depend on its execution and the actual value delivered to customers. Financial Analyst Yext's introduction of tiered offerings within its Customer Success program—Essential, Enhanced and Elite—suggests a strategic monetization approach that caters to different levels of customer needs and budget constraints. This tiered model could potentially increase average revenue per user (ARPU) by encouraging customers to opt for more comprehensive, higher-tier services. Moreover, the mention of leveraging AI-driven data for actionable insights hints at Yext's investment in advanced technology, which could enhance its value proposition and justify potential premium pricing for its services.Analyzing the financial implications, if Yext can effectively convert these service enhancements into higher customer lifetime value (CLV), it could see an improvement in its long-term financial health. Investors should monitor customer feedback and adoption rates of the new program to gauge its impact on Yext's financial performance. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the costs associated with the development and maintenance of such a program, as well as the competitive responses that may arise. Digital Marketing Expert Yext's move to expand its service portfolio is a reflection of the evolving needs in the digital marketing space, where data-driven decisions are paramount. By providing a service that not only addresses customer inquiries but also proactively identifies opportunities for business growth, Yext is positioning itself as a leader in the digital presence management field. The ability to turn vast amounts of business location data into actionable insights is a significant advantage for multi-location brands looking to optimize their digital marketing strategies.As businesses increasingly rely on digital channels to reach customers, Yext's enhanced service offerings could become a key factor in their digital marketing efforts. The impact on the stock market will depend on how the business community perceives the value of such services. If Yext's program leads to demonstrable results for clients, it could result in positive sentiment among investors, potentially influencing the company's stock price positively. 03/19/2024 - 12:00 PM Yext expands service and support portfolio to accelerate customer results NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Yext (NYSE: YEXT), the leading digital presence platform for multi-location brands, today announced the launch of its new customer success program.

The technology allows for quick EV charging without major upgrades, revolutionizing EV adoption in large residential complexes. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The introduction of ADS-TEC Energy's ChargeBox at the Marina Palms Yacht Club and Residences presents a notable advancement in addressing the infrastructure challenges of electric vehicle (EV) charging in multi-family residential settings. The ability of ChargeBox to deliver ultra-fast charging without necessitating extensive electrical upgrades is particularly significant for property developers and managers. This technology potentially reduces the capital expenditure and disruption typically associated with installing high-powered charging infrastructure, thus enhancing the appeal of EVs to residents and supporting broader EV adoption trends.In the context of the energy sector, this deployment could signal a shift towards more scalable and cost-effective solutions for EV charging infrastructure. The operational efficiency of ChargeBox, which can service a high volume of EVs using minimal space, aligns with the growing demand for sustainable and convenient energy solutions. As urbanization continues and the number of multi-family residences increases, the ability to integrate such technologies seamlessly could be a competitive differentiator for real estate developments. Financial Analyst ADS-TEC Energy's strategic move to penetrate the U.S. market with its ChargeBox technology could have positive implications for the company's financial performance, given the rising demand for EV infrastructure. The cost savings associated with the installation of ChargeBox, as opposed to traditional Level 2 chargers, could lead to higher adoption rates among property managers, which in turn may drive revenue growth for ADS-TEC Energy. Furthermore, the partnership with Porsche and the planned expansion into additional U.S. locations underscore the company's growth strategy and potential to capture a significant share of the EV charging market.The stock market often reacts favorably to innovative solutions that address existing market gaps, especially in high-growth industries such as EVs. Investors may view the deployment at Marina Palms and the planned U.S. expansion as indicators of ADS-TEC Energy's market potential and scalability. However, it is important to monitor the company's execution of its rollout plan and its ability to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving industry. Real Estate Development Expert The integration of EV charging solutions like ADS-TEC Energy's ChargeBox into multi-family residential complexes represents a forward-thinking approach to real estate development. As EV ownership increases, the availability of charging stations becomes a critical amenity for residents. The ChargeBox solution addresses space constraints and infrastructure limitations, which are common hurdles in densely populated urban environments.From a real estate development perspective, the ability to offer ultra-fast EV charging could enhance property values and attract a demographic of environmentally conscious, tech-savvy residents. This amenity could become a key selling point for new developments and a factor in retaining current residents. Moreover, the minimal disruption and quick installation time associated with ChargeBox may encourage more rapid adoption among developers looking to future-proof their properties without incurring prohibitive costs. 03/19/2024 - 12:00 PM Battery-buffered, ultra-fast ADS-TEC ChargeBox overcomes challenges faced by large multi-family residences to deliver EV charging to growing populations of EV drivers. ChargeBox powers up EVs in minutes, yet typically requires no major electrical upgrades or construction, and a single system can serve a sizable population. Condominium association and homeowner association boards, property managers and developers are all seeking the most cost-effective, least-disruptive ways to integrate EV charging into existing and future projects, and the Marina Palms deployment leads the way in Miami—and the country—in showing how this can be done. With ChargeBox, ultra-fast charging will soon be as ubiquitous as air conditioning and elevators at these developments. MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ADS-TEC Energy plc (NASDAQ: ADSE), a global leader in battery-buffered, ultra-fast charging technology, today unveiled the first deployment of its ChargeBox at a multi-family residential complex during a special ceremony at the Marina Palms Yacht Club and Residences in North Miami Beach. The solution allows EV drivers at the 470-unit residential property to charge their EVs in just minutes yet required no extensive construction or upgrades to high-powered electrical infrastructure. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240319428589/en/ADS-TEC Energy unveiled the first deployment of its ChargeBox at a multi-family residential complex during a special ceremony at the Marina Palms Yacht Club and Residences in North Miami Beach. (Photo: Business Wire) Access to fast and readily available EV charging is one of the biggest hurdles to the adoption of EVs. This challenge is compounded by the fact that almost a third of U.S. housing is comprised of large, multi-family residences. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 80% of EV charging takes place at home, but in large residential buildings, the charging landscape is much more complicated than in single family homes and small multi-unit dwellings. Electrifying each or a share of parking spaces with slower Level 2 chargers in a building with several hundred apartments or condos is not a long-term solution as EVs ramp up due to the space limitation and insufficient electrical wiring onsite. In addition, Level 2 charging takes many hours. With ChargeBox from ADS-TEC Energy, users can charge their EVs in minutes. ADS-TEC Energy’s Marina Palms deployment is significant as it showcases a simple way to quickly deploy ultra-fast EV chargers and, in turn, speed up EV adoption. Built-in batteries allow ChargeBox to draw power from existing electrical grids, store it and then output the power at ultra-fast speeds of up to 320kW per vehicle. This means that building management does not have to invest in costly upgrades or time-consuming construction and enables installation to be completed in weeks versus months, which is typical for traditional fast chargers. The benefits of ADS-TEC Energy’s ChargeBox made it extremely appealing to the Marina Palms Yacht Club and Residences Master Association and property management company, First Service Residential. A single ChargeBox today replaces several Level 2 chargers that were available to residents on a first-come, first-served basis, requiring residents to patiently wait hours to have their vehicle charged. The ChargeBox can easily service 100 EVs per week using only two parking spaces, versus shared Level 2 chargers, which would require 20 spaces for the same number of vehicles. “At Marina Palms, the rapid increase in EVs made access to one of the six Level 2 chargers exceedingly difficult and frustrating to our residents. Charging took many hours. We realized we needed an alternative, but the challenge was finding a more advanced, speedier charging technology that could be installed in limited space, with minimal disruption and construction and without requiring costly electrical upgrades,” explained George Barriere, general manager, FirstService Residential. “We found the ideal solution in the ADS-TEC Energy ChargeBox. It has exceeded all expectations. We are very proud to be the first to adopt it in Miami.” ADS-TEC Energy is taking the next important step, expanding into the U.S. Already a major presence in the EV charging space in Europe, the ADS-TEC Energy technology was first developed in conjunction with Porsche, which uses ADS-TEC Energy chargers at dealerships worldwide. The Marina Palms project is the blueprint for what is to come from the company in the year ahead. To meet the demand for charging, ADS-TEC Energy will be deploying its ultra-fast charging solutions at additional large residential complexes, city centers, convenience stores and corporate campuses. “Rewiring a multi-level parking structure for Level 2 charging is costly, approximately $5,000-$15,000 per parking space, according to estimates our customers have received. With ChargeBox, condominium associations, building managers and investors can bypass Level 2 infrastructure that will be obsolete in a couple of years and instead deliver the future…today: a premium, ultra-fast charging solution that will power up their residents’ cars and get them back on the road in minutes,” said Thomas Speidel, CEO, ADS-TEC Energy. “Our deployment at the Marina Palms Yacht Club and Residences serves as a model for other large condominium and apartment complexes in Miami and elsewhere in the U.S. The lack of charging infrastructure is still a deterrent in driver adoption of EVs. ADS-TEC Energy is solving this problem with our solution. We look forward to rolling out additional installations across the U.S. this year. The advantages we provide will be a huge step for the U.S. in building a strong and reliable charging infrastructure.” In addition to the Marina Palms ChargeBox deployment, ADS-TEC Energy today announced another important milestone; the appointment of Renato Gross as senior vice president for the company’s U.S. operations.

The company sold 348,837,210 common shares at U.S.$0.43 per share, with participation from various institutional investors. The funds will primarily support the development of CYB003, a potential treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. Positive Successful closing of a U.S.$150,000,000 private placement by Cybin Inc. 348,837,210 common shares sold at U.S.$0.43 per share. Participation from leading institutional investors like Deep Track Capital and RA Capital Management. Funds to be used for Phase 3 drug development activities for CYB003 and general corporate purposes. CYB003 is a deuterated psilocybin analog aimed at treating Major Depressive Disorder. CYB003 could become the first adjunctive psychedelic-based therapeutic for MDD upon FDA approval. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a $150 million private placement is a significant financial milestone for Cybin Inc., indicating robust investor confidence and providing substantial capital to fund its ongoing clinical trials, particularly for CYB003. This influx of capital is expected to bolster the company's cash position, potentially extending its runway and facilitating the achievement of critical developmental milestones. The participation of established investment firms like RA Capital Management and Avidity Partners underscores the perceived potential of Cybin's pipeline.However, investors should be aware of the potential dilution caused by the issuance of new shares, which could impact the value of existing shares. It's also important to consider that the success of CYB003's clinical trials is not guaranteed and the path to FDA approval can be complex and fraught with challenges. The implications of this funding round will likely be monitored closely, as they may significantly influence Cybin's stock performance in both the short and long term. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of CYB003 into Phase 3 clinical trials represents a critical juncture in the development of new treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The proprietary nature of Cybin's deuterated psilocybin analog suggests a novel approach within the field of psychedelic-based therapies. Given the current interest in alternative mental health treatments, successful trial outcomes could position Cybin as a pioneer in this emerging sector.However, the therapeutic landscape for MDD is competitive and complex, with a myriad of existing and in-development treatments. The efficacy, safety profile and cost-effectiveness of CYB003 relative to other treatments will be key factors determining its market potential. Stakeholders should consider the long-term implications of these trials, as they will not only affect Cybin's trajectory but also contribute to the broader conversation on mental health treatment paradigms. Legal Expert The details surrounding the private placement, such as exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the commitment to file an amendment to its registration statement, highlight the regulatory complexities involved in such transactions. Compliance with both Canadian and U.S. securities laws is paramount and requires careful navigation to avoid legal pitfalls.Furthermore, the stipulation that the issued common shares may eventually be resold by non-Canadian purchasers, subject to certain conditions, introduces potential future liquidity in the market. Investors should be cognizant of the legal frameworks governing these securities, as they can have material effects on the timing and manner in which the shares can be traded, potentially influencing market dynamics. 03/19/2024 - 11:53 AM THIS NEWS RELEASE IS INTENDED FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CANADA ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES.

Negative Muddy Waters' demand to appoint their nominee to the Board without providing necessary nomination materials or credentials raises concerns about corporate governance. Muddy Waters' refusal to engage in constructive dialogue and opting for a costly proxy contest may lead to value destruction for shareholders. 03/19/2024 - 11:52 AM Mayfair Reiterates Board and Management Commitment to Good Governance and Value CreationMATHESON, Ontario, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mayfair Gold Corp. (“Mayfair” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: MFG; OTCQB: MFGCF) today responded to an announcement by Muddy Waters Capital LLC (“Muddy Waters”) of their intention to solicit proxies from securityholders of Mayfair for the purpose of reconstituting the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) at its upcoming 2024 annual general meeting (the “AGM”). Until the Company has delivered its management information circular for the upcoming AGM (the “Management Circular”), there is no need for shareholders to take any action. Mayfair has an experienced and engaged Board with considerable collective expertise in the mineral exploration industry. Our Board and management team are open to value creation opportunities, and have a proven track record of evaluating a broad range of options with that objective in mind. The nominating function is an important aspect of the Board’s duties. The Board is currently conducting a comprehensive and proactive process (the “Recruitment Process”) to identify suitable candidates for board recruitment, which has been ongoing for several months. The Company has engaged and worked closely with professional advisors to assist with the Recruitment Process. The structured nature of the Recruitment Process allows the Board to nominate the right individuals from a broad pool of candidates who will bring specific skills and experience to the Board that are needed at this stage of the Company’s development. In addition, shareholders are entitled to submit nominations for election to the Board at the Company’s annual meeting. Mayfair’s advance nomination requirements and procedure are set out in its Articles, which are available on SEDAR+. On the afternoon of Thursday, March 14, 2024, without any warning or prior discussion with the Board, Muddy Waters demanded that the Board immediately halt the Recruitment Process and instead appoint a nominee of Muddy Waters, Darren McLean, to the Board and further appoint Mr. McLean as Chair of the Board. Muddy Waters also demanded the right to have a second, as yet unidentified, nominee appointed to the Board. Muddy Waters gave the Company until 3 p.m. Pacific Time on Monday, March 18 to respond to its demand. However, Muddy Waters provided no nomination materials to the Company in respect of their proposed nominees as required under Mayfair’s Articles, and no credentials or biographical information in support of Mr. McLean’s nomination. The failure of Muddy Waters to provide nominating materials or credentials concerning Mr. McLean was of special concern to the Board as, to the knowledge of the Company, Mr. McLean has never served as a director or executive officer of a Canadian public company. Yesterday, on Monday, March 18, 2024, the Company advised Muddy Waters that the appointment of Mr. McLean to the Board and as Chair prior to other shareholders having their say on his candidacy through a shareholder vote at the AGM—and especially without the Board having had an opportunity to interview Mr. McLean or consider his credentials—would not be compatible with good corporate governance or the Board’s duty to conduct the nomination process in an informed and deliberate manner. Nevertheless, in keeping with the Company’s respect for shareholder input, the Board indicated its willingness to consider Mr. McLean’s candidacy as part of its current Recruitment Process, provided Mr. McLean submit a directors’ questionnaire and participate in an interview with the Board. The Board also offered to meet with Muddy Waters to address their vague and unclearly articulated concerns, either with or without the presence of the CEO. Muddy Waters’ statement that it has sought to resolve this matter privately and amicably is factually incorrect. Instead of taking the Board up on yesterday’s offer to participate in the Recruitment Process and engage in a constructive dialogue, Muddy Waters has chosen to launch a costly and value-destructive proxy contest. Notwithstanding Muddy Waters’ unwillingness to engage in constructive dialogue, the Company will evaluate Muddy Waters’ director candidates at such time as they comply with the advance nomination requirements and procedure set out in the Company’s Articles. The Board looks forward to presenting its recommendations with respect to the election of directors in the Company’s Management Circular, which will be mailed to shareholders and filed on SEDAR+ ahead of the AGM. The AGM date has not yet been finalized. With respect to Muddy Waters’ concerns raised regarding the Company’s grant of options, the Compensation Committee of the Board conducts detailed research on appropriate compensation for the Board, executives and staff based on publicly available data for comparable issuers. The Compensation Committee also consults with professional advisors and carefully reviews their reports and recommendations. Based on this research the Compensation Committee is confident the Company’s compensation structure is fair and commensurate to its peers. Mayfair values the perspectives of its shareholders and looks forward to an ongoing, constructive dialogue with them about the Company’s governance, performance, and strategic direction. The Company is proud that its share price performance in 2023 has been among the best of its junior gold exploration peer group. The Board and management team will continue to take actions that they believe are in the best interests of the Company and remain focused on advancing its flagship asset, the 100% controlled Fenn-Gib gold project in the Timmins region of Northern Ontario. About Mayfair Mayfair Gold is a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on advancing the 100% controlled Fenn-Gib gold project in the top-tier mining region of Timmins, Northern Ontario. The Fenn-Gib gold deposit is Mayfair’s flagship asset and currently hosts an updated National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) mineral resource estimate with an effective date of April 6, 2023 with a total indicated mineral resource of 113.69M tonnes containing 3.38M ounces at a grade of 0.93 g/t Au and an inferred mineral resource of 5.72M tonnes containing 0.16M ounces at a grade of 0.85 g/t Au at a 0.40 g/t Au cut-off grade. The Fenn-Gib deposit has a strike length of over 1.5km with widths ranging over 500m. The gold mineralized zones remain open at depth and along strike to the east and west. Recently completed metallurgical tests confirm that the Fenn-Gib deposit can deliver robust gold recoveries of up to 94%.

The update aims to boost productivity for clinicians by simplifying data capture in complex situations, automating manual tasks, and facilitating efficient lab communication. Early adopters have provided positive feedback on the system's ease of use and accuracy. Positive None. Negative None. Dental Technology Specialist The update to DEXIS™IS ScanFlow software represents a significant advancement in digital dentistry, specifically in the realm of dental implantology. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into dental workflows is a game-changer, as it can potentially reduce the time required for data acquisition and improve the accuracy of implant placement. The AI enhancements, such as the AI Matching tool and Implant Scan Body AI Assist, are designed to streamline complex procedures like capturing data for multiple scan bodies or dealing with full and partial edentulism. These improvements are likely to be well-received by dental professionals who are increasingly relying on digital technologies to enhance patient outcomes.From a business perspective, the ability to integrate with DEXIS Imaging Suite and DTX Studio™ Clinic can be seen as a strategic move to lock in customers within the DEXIS ecosystem. By offering a one-stop solution for dental implant workflows, DEXIS is positioning itself as a comprehensive provider, which may increase customer loyalty and reduce the likelihood of practitioners switching to competing products. The cost-saving aspect of receiving DTX Studio Clinic at no extra charge with an intraoral scanner purchase could be an attractive incentive for dental practices considering an investment in new technology, potentially leading to increased sales and market share for DEXIS. Healthcare Market Analyst DEXIS's release of IS ScanFlow v.1.0.10 could have substantial implications for the dental equipment market. By enhancing their product with AI capabilities and guided workflows, DEXIS is not only improving the efficiency of dental implant procedures but also addressing a growing trend in healthcare: the demand for precision and personalized care. The dental equipment market is competitive and innovations that offer tangible improvements in workflow and outcomes can serve as differentiators that drive adoption.Moreover, the emphasis on user-friendly interfaces and high-speed scanning is likely to resonate with dental professionals who value time savings and ease of use. The positive feedback from early adopters suggests that the product is well-positioned to meet market expectations. However, it is important to monitor how this technology performs in wider clinical use and whether it can sustain the initial positive impressions. Adoption rates, customer satisfaction and the impact on DEXIS's financial performance are key metrics to watch in the coming quarters. Digital Health Strategist In the context of digital health and its integration into various medical specialties, the enhancements brought by DEXIS™IS ScanFlow v.1.0.10 are indicative of a broader trend towards interconnected and intelligent systems in healthcare. The integration of this software with DEXIS Imaging Suite and DTX Studio Clinic illustrates a push towards seamless data flow and interoperability within dental practices. This not only augments the efficiency of dental implant workflows but also aligns with the broader healthcare industry's shift towards comprehensive digital solutions that encompass diagnosis, treatment planning and execution.For dental practices, the adoption of such integrated systems may lead to more streamlined operations and potentially better patient experiences due to reduced waiting times and more predictable outcomes. The strategic implications for DEXIS involve establishing a strong foothold in the digital dentistry space, which could lead to partnerships, collaborations, or even acquisitions as the market for dental technology continues to consolidate around key players who can offer end-to-end solutions. 03/19/2024 - 11:35 AM DEXIS™IS ScanFlow v.1.0.10 adds new series of guided workflows and AI enhancements to optimize the dental implant workflow. QUAKERTOWN, PA / ACCESSWIRE / March 19, 2024 / Earlier this year, DEXIS launched its dental implant ecosystem so clinicians can manage their entire implant workflow, from diagnosis to delivery, with one integrated toolset. To enhance workflow efficiencies, DEXIS announces the release of a new intraoral scanning update, DEXIS™IS ScanFlow v.1.0.10. The update includes a new series of guided workflows, enhancements to its AI capabilities, and an integration with DEXIS Imaging Suite software version 10.""We are excited to introduce our latest DEXIS intraoral scanning software update, aimed at boosting productivity for DEXIS software owners and implant workflows,"" says Brian Gooch, VP of Marketing at DEXIS. ""We've made scanning fast and easy, even for more complex situations. Digital impression data is important for implant case planning, so we enable highly accurate data to be incorporated into chairside or open workflows, and easily shared with labs or colleagues.""The IS ScanFlow software update maintains high-speed scanning, user-friendly interface, precise data capture, and an open, flexible system.

By understanding consumer behaviors and surrounding environments, P&G aims to create sustainable solutions for dishwashing. Positive None. Negative None. 03/19/2024 - 11:15 AM Written by Theresa Hare, Senior Director R&D, Procter & GambleNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 19, 2024 / P&G While companies work to reduce their environmental impacts, they also should design their products to help solve consumers' challenges in a more sustainable way.A consumer challenge can be defined as a ""job-to-be-done"", which is simply a problems people are trying to solve. From this perspective, products aren't just things people buy, but also something they ""hire"" to solve their problem.This is important because there is a great opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of a product's use phases. This is even more critical when such products require water and energy, like showering, doing laundry, or washing dishes. While it's critical that companies continue to reduce their own operational and supply chain footprints, products also have an important role to play in the creation of sustainable habits at home. Consumer insights shed light into how brand influence and product innovation can inspire new behaviors.By developing products that perform well and are better for people and the planet, this helps the consumer complete their job more easily, and helps to reduce the corresponding environmental impact. Developing a solution that can deliver performance for people and planet requires a deep understanding of how a person uses a given product and their surrounding environment.The following outlines how Procter and Gamble (P&G) applies consumer insights to reduce the environmental impact of dishwashing using a three-principal approach. First, P&G studies how people use the product through understanding their surrounding environment; second, develops a deeper understanding of why certain behaviors exist; and finally, leverages the insights in the product design.1. Zoom out to understand the full picture of the environment the consumer is in.As P&G creates both dish soap and dishwasher detergent, we study handwashing and auto-washing habits. It's important to put ourselves in the shoes of consumers to understand what's happening in the kitchen and why so that we can define the job to be done and problem to be solved. That information, powered by additional consumer insights, informs the product requirements for our innovation.Some consumer behaviors we study include: How often is the sink running? How long do the dishes sit there? How many dishes are washed by hand? What temperature is the water? How much water is used? How many dishes are put into the dishwasher?These questions and more enable a better understanding of behaviors that use water and energy in the kitchen.2. Understand how people feel about the task to get to the root of their behavior.Washing dishes is a chore and typically people want it done fast and conveniently. Many busy people state that they feel overwhelmed by the sight of a full sink of dirty dishes. People then adopt compensating behaviors that they think will help them get the job done more efficiently. Some examples:Keeping the faucet running in order to save time, resulting in significant water and energy use;Soaking dishes to shave off time scrubbing;Cleaning dishes on an ongoing basis to prevent stuck-on messes versus doing them all at the end;Increasing the water temperature to help dishes dry faster, resulting in increased energy use; and,Washing dishes before loading them because they don't believe the dishwasher will get them clean, resulting in wasted water and energy.Understanding the why behind the actions - in this case a desire for efficiency combined with a distrust of dishwashers - gives R&D teams ideas for new solutions that foster more sustainable habits.3. Leverage insights to design products for performance for people and planet.With an understanding of people's behaviors and the motivation behind them, P&G can then design products to help shift habits while delivering against the job to be done. In this case, the job is fast and effective dish cleaning that avoids resource intensive compensating behaviors.Through a study of dishwashing habits and the water and energy used, P&G R&D determined that dishwashers should be the preferred choice to reduce environmental impact during the product use phase. All it takes is eight dishes washed by hand to use the same amount of water and energy that a dishwasher uses. Using a dishwasher, people can save 100 gallons a week.By understanding consumer barriers to dishwasher usage, P&G R&D teams optimized the chemistry in Cascade Platinum Plus dishwashing pods to clean dishes better and eliminate the need for pre-washing or re-washing. The solution conserves resources and helps save time by avoiding soaking or pre-rinsing - people scrape the dish off and immediately load it in.While dishwashers offer the most sustainability benefits over hand washing, some people don't have them. Dawn Powerwash was developed to reduce water and energy use for people that hand wash their dishes. The R&D team simplified the experience by avoiding water at the onset of cleaning dishes. The result: refillable packaging and formulation designed to release suds without the need for water to activate them.Making dishwashing a faster and easier chore can also inspire further sustainable habit adoption, such as cooking and eating more at home.Innovating a Superior and Sustainable ProductConsumer brands have a responsibility to identify where impact can be made and where they can step in to innovate, leading to a superior and sustainable product that delivers added value.A science-based approach is important because it shows where the biggest improvement for the environment can be made. A consumer-inspired product is equally important because it results in a satisfied consumer when function and experience is delivered. The two must be merged for a holistic proposition that people want to buy.When done right, the result is something we can all get behind: products that delight, enable better habits and reduce environmental footprints at home.This article was originally published on GreenBiz.comView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from P&G on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: P&GWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pgEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: P&GView the original press release on accesswire.com How does Procter & Gamble (PG) aim to reduce environmental impact?

The Company expects to enter agreements to supply the NHS, targeting a significant market share. C-Scrub offers immediate and prolonged antimicrobial action, catering to a wide range of microbes, with a focus on skin health and cosmetic friendliness. The global hospital disinfectant market is projected to grow significantly, positioning Cosmos Health for potential growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Cosmos Health regarding the impending regulatory approval of C-Scrub Wash 4% CHG in the UK represents a strategic move within the healthcare sector. The global hospital disinfectant products and services market is witnessing a robust growth trajectory, with an estimated CAGR of 7.7% through 2033. The integration of C-Scrub into the UK market, coupled with a potential supply agreement with the NHS, could significantly bolster Cosmos Health's market presence.Entering the UK market is a calculated step for Cosmos Health, given the market's established healthcare infrastructure and the NHS's role as a major consumer of healthcare products. The demand for effective disinfectants has been heightened by the increased focus on hygiene and infection control, a trend which has gained momentum due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's ability to offer a product that caters to iodine-sensitive users and provides prolonged antimicrobial action positions it advantageously against competitors.However, the success of this expansion will depend on several factors, including the product's competitive pricing, effectiveness compared to existing alternatives and the company's capacity to fulfill large orders from the NHS. Furthermore, the long-term sustainability of this growth will hinge on the continued innovation and adaptation to emerging healthcare challenges. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Cosmos Health's expansion into the UK market and the initial purchase order for C-Scrub could be a significant revenue driver. The UK healthcare market is substantial and a partnership with the NHS could represent a stable and recurring revenue stream. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's ability to secure the necessary regulatory approvals and finalize agreements with the NHS, as these developments could positively influence the company's stock performance.It is important to assess the potential impact on Cosmos Health's cash flows and to consider the costs associated with market entry, such as marketing and distribution expenses. Investors should also consider the scalability of production capabilities at Cana Laboratories to meet the anticipated demand. While the company's CEO has expressed optimism regarding future cash flows, it is important to balance this with a realistic appraisal of the costs and potential barriers to market penetration.Investors will also be interested in the company's plans to enter non-EU markets, as this could further diversify revenue sources and mitigate regional market risks. The company's performance in the UK could serve as a benchmark for its potential success in other international markets. Medical Research Analyst From a medical standpoint, the effectiveness of C-Scrub Wash 4% CHG, with its active ingredient chlorhexidine gluconate, is well-documented in clinical settings. Chlorhexidine gluconate is a proven antiseptic agent and the product's formulation, which includes emollients, addresses skin health concerns that can arise from frequent handwashing in healthcare environments.The claim of immediate and prolonged antimicrobial action for up to 6 hours, even in the presence of biological fluids, is particularly relevant for hospital settings where the risk of nosocomial infections is a constant challenge. The ability to target a wide range of microbes, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, aligns with the needs of modern healthcare facilities that require broad-spectrum disinfectants.It's also noteworthy that the product does not promote resistance, an important consideration as antimicrobial resistance becomes an increasing concern globally.

The new options provide exposure to international, developed, emerging markets, and U.S. equity market performance. They aim to offer efficient ways for institutional and retail investors to hedge global equity exposure, minimize tracking error, and currency risk. The options are based on a fraction of the underlying index value, making them more accessible for retail investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of Cboe's new MSCI index options represents a significant expansion of financial instruments available to investors. These options provide exposure to international, developed, emerging and U.S. equity markets, addressing the growing demand for global investment vehicles. The European-style cash settlement feature of these options is particularly noteworthy because it mitigates the risk of early exercise, a factor that can be critical for investors utilizing options as part of a yield enhancement strategy.From a liquidity perspective, the availability of options based on a fraction of the index value could lead to increased participation from retail investors. This can potentially result in enhanced liquidity for these options, which in turn may reduce bid-ask spreads and improve market efficiency. However, it remains to be seen how these new products will be received by the market and whether they will achieve the desired volume and open interest levels.The strategic partnership between Cboe and MSCI, as evidenced by these product launches, underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in expanding market offerings. The potential for these options to serve as effective hedging tools for institutional investors could also have implications for the broader market, as it may influence the hedging strategies and risk management practices of large market participants. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Cboe's MSCI tradable product suite aligns with broader market trends of increasing globalization of investment portfolios. As investors seek to diversify their holdings beyond domestic equities, the need for instruments that can provide international exposure grows. The Cboe MSCI World Index Options, for instance, cater to this need by offering a derivative product that reflects a wide array of global stocks.Moreover, the introduction of volatility indices based on Cboe's VIX methodology for international markets is a strategic move. These indices can serve as a barometer for international market sentiment, similar to how the VIX is used for the U.S. market. By providing a transparent measure of expected volatility, Cboe is enabling investors to make more informed decisions regarding volatility hedging and trading strategies.It is essential to monitor the adoption rate of these new index options and volatility indices to evaluate their impact on market dynamics. The upcoming webinar is a important step in educating potential users about the benefits and applications of these new products. The success of these initiatives will largely depend on the effectiveness of such educational efforts and the perceived value by institutional and retail investors. Derivatives Strategist The launch of the three new MSCI index options by Cboe introduces additional tools for investors to manage their global equity exposure. The design of these options, particularly the focus on European-style cash settlement, is tailored to the needs of portfolio managers running options overlay strategies. This feature simplifies the execution of such strategies by eliminating the complexities associated with early exercise and physical settlement.The decision to offer options with standard expiration on the third Friday of each month, complemented by end-of-week expirations, provides flexibility in managing positions and can enhance the appeal of these products for tactical trading. The granularity offered by these expiration cycles allows for more precise timing in hedging and speculation.While the benefits of these new products are clear, it is important to remain cognizant of the risks associated with trading derivatives. Market participants need to understand the nuances of index options and their potential implications for portfolio risk. The educational initiatives by Cboe, such as the planned webinar, are vital in mitigating these risks by ensuring that investors are well-informed. 03/19/2024 - 10:30 AM Cboe MSCI World Index Options (MXWLD), Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options (MXACW), and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options (MXUSA) are available for trading MXWLD and MXUSA options are based on 1/100th of index value Launch is part of broader initiative to expand Cboe's MSCI tradable product suite CHICAGO, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, announced it has launched for trading Cboe MSCI World Index Options (MXWLD), Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options (MXACW), and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options (MXUSA). The launch is part of Cboe's deepening relationship with MSCI Inc. (MSCI), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community. The three new MSCI index options are designed to provide a range of investors exposure to international, developed and emerging markets and U.S. equity market performance. The new Cboe MSCI index options can provide pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors more efficient ways to hedge their global equity exposure, while minimizing potential tracking error and currency risk. Additionally, each of MXWLD and MXUSA is based on a fraction (1/100th) of the value of its underlying index, making these options more accessible for retail investors. ""As more investors seek global equity exposure, adding three new options on MSCI's world renowned benchmarks was the natural next evolution for Cboe's suite of index options products,"" said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets. ""Whether investors are looking to hedge their portfolios, generate yields, or make directional trades, we have seen heightened interest in the optionality derivatives can provide. These new index options, and the MSCI volatility benchmark indices launched recently will provide important tools in helping investors manage their global exposures. We look forward to building upon our relationship with MSCI and providing investors the global risk management tools they need."" For portfolio managers running options overlay strategies, these new index options are designed to allow investors to expand their overlay programs to their global portfolio and thus, diversify the sources of potential income in their portfolio. A potential benefit of overwriting the newly launched MSCI index options include their European-style cash settlement, which helps to eliminate risk of early exercise and physical settlement, two common pain points in running a yield enhancement strategy. Cboe initially listed MXACW, MXUSA, and MXWLD with standard expiration on the third Friday of each month. Additionally, Cboe plans to list five end-of-week expirations that are expected to begin trading on March 21, 2024. The three new Cboe MSCI Index options are available for trading on the Cboe Options Exchange. The new index options are in addition to the currently listed Cboe MSCI tradable products, which include Cboe MSCI EAFE Index Options (MXEA) and Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Index Options (MXEF). Recently, Cboe expanded its suite of volatility indices with the Cboe MSCI EAFE Volatility Index (VXMXEA) and the Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Volatility Index (VXMXEF). Developed using Cboe's proprietary VIX® Index methodology, these indices are based on existing MXEA and MXEF options and are designed to provide a transparent measure of the market's expectation of 30-day implied volatility by these respective MSCI index option classes. Similar to the VIX Index, which is designed to reflect investors' consensus view of future (30-day) expected U.S. stock market volatility, the new Cboe MSCI Volatility Indices aim to provide comparable measures for international and emerging equity market volatility. Cboe and MSCI will be hosting a webinar on the key benefits and opportunities provided by the new indices options on Wednesday, March 27.

The 2024 total solar eclipse is hitting the world on April 8, and it's gonna be legendary, drawing millions of people to the path of totality. T-Mobile's getting in on the action too, deploying additional cell sites to handle the surge of eclipse chasers. Learn how T-Mobile is prepping for the solar spectacle, pick up safety tips to enjoy the show and get the lowdown on separating eclipse myths from the real deal. This is your guide to the ultimate eclipse experience. Network PreparationRecognizing the importance of this celestial phenomenon (the next total solar eclipse visible from the United States is 20 years away!) and the tourism it will bring to areas from Maine to Texas, T-Mobile is actively preparing to ensure customers stay connected during the eclipse. T-Mobile has increased investments in network hardening by more than 30% over the past two years to reduce service interruptions during weather, disaster and major tourism events (like the solar eclipse), adding fixed backup generators at critical sites nationwide.""T-Mobile is working hand-in-hand with state and local authorities to address the anticipated surge in network traffic to guarantee seamless connectivity for all,"" said Ulf Ewaldsson, president of technology at T-Mobile. ""Whether facing large influxes in data use or high demand, our network - which is the nation's largest, fastest and most awarded - has everyone covered.""As part of our comprehensive plan, T-Mobile is proactively deploying additional cell sites that will be on stand-by in areas expecting high tourist traffic. These temporary sites will provide crucial network reinforcement, ensuring that customers can stay connected and share their favorite eclipse moments without interruption.

Eclipse glasses are specifically designed with solar filters that block harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation and allow you to view the eclipse safely. Regular sunglasses, even those with UV protection, just won't cut it against the sun's intense light during an eclipse. So, if you plan on watching, make sure you protect your peepers with the proper eyewear.Experts at NASA recommend that people steer clear of using binoculars, a telescope and cameras including the one on your device, to record the eclipse without a solar filter. Solar filters are designed to block the sun's harmful rays while allowing you to observe the eclipse safely. Pointing a smartphone camera at the sun, any day, without proper filtering may damage the lens. Check out these tips from NASA on how to capture the eclipse on your device.If you're planning on traveling to view the eclipse, especially to rural areas, it's important to pack an emergency preparedness kit for you and your family. Check out our tips on making your own go bag.Myths vs. FactsIn the tech world, there's been some talk about solar activity messing with devices and phone signals. Let's bust some of these common myths so you know what to actually expect:Myth 1: Solar eclipses can damage or destroy electronic devices.Many people seem to think that the intense light emitted during a solar eclipse can harm electronics in general. But guess what? Science says nope! The light during a solar eclipse isn't that different from the amount of light emitted during a regular day. So, no reason to worry - there's no extra risk to your devices because of the eclipse!Myth 2: Solar eclipses can be viewed safely without special glasses.Looking directly at the sun, even during a solar eclipse, is a big no-no ... it can cause severe eye damage! The sun's intense light can damage the retina, leading to partial or complete vision loss. But, because this is a total solar eclipse, there is one exception: when the moon completely blocks the visible surface of the sun, NASA says it's cool to remove your glasses, but only for a moment. Bottom-line, grab a pair of eclipse glasses or other protective eyewear that's built to block harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Safety first, people!Myth 3: Solar eclipses can interfere with telecommunications.Some people believe that solar eclipses can disrupt telecommunications, like phone signals and internet connections, but it's not true! Solar eclipses don't emit any type of radiation or energy that could screw up electromagnetic waves, so don't worry about your calls dropping or your Wi-Fi acting up during an eclipse - everything should be running smooth as usual.Myth 4: Solar eclipses will make your tech act strangely.A solar eclipse doesn't crank up the electromagnetic radiation more than a normal day, so fear not: phones, tablets, and other devices will do their thing just like any ordinary day with regular weather.

(Nasdaq: DTSS) announces a Manufacturing Cooperation Agreement with Broadway Precision Technology to produce upgraded hi-tech intelligent deodorization and disinfection products. The agreement aims to accelerate production, support ongoing negotiations with key clients, and enter the US and China markets. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Datasea Inc. and Broadway Precision Technology, Ltd. is a strategic move aimed at enhancing production capabilities for Datasea's high-tech intelligent acoustic deodorization and disinfection products. This collaboration is expected to streamline the manufacturing process, aligning it closely with market and sales demands, which could result in improved efficiency and potentially higher profit margins. The synchronization of production with sales forecasts is a common strategy to minimize inventory costs and reduce the risk of overproduction.Furthermore, the focus on quality and the pursuit of industry-leading standards could position Datasea favorably in the competitive landscape. The partnership with Broadway, a contract manufacturer for reputable international brands, might provide Datasea with access to advanced production technology and quality materials, which is critical for maintaining a strong brand reputation. The emphasis on functional testing and international safety certifications is also a positive indicator for the company's commitment to compliance and marketability, particularly in the U.S. and China markets. Supply Chain Management Expert Broadway's extensive manufacturing capabilities, with a workforce of over 4,000 and significant equipment resources, suggest a robust supply chain that can support Datasea's production needs. This is particularly relevant for Datasea's expansion plans in the U.S. and China. Efficient supply chain management is important for technology companies, especially when dealing with innovative products that require high-quality materials and precision manufacturing.Additionally, the mention of negotiations with major customers, such as hotels and schools, indicates that Datasea is targeting large-scale distribution channels. This could lead to volume orders, necessitating a strong supply chain to fulfill these orders promptly. The direct sales strategy, coupled with distribution agents and livestreaming e-commerce in China, reflects a diversified approach to market penetration, which can help mitigate risks associated with single-channel distribution. Financial Analyst Investors might view the announcement of the Manufacturing Cooperation Agreement as a positive development for Datasea's growth prospects. The ability to scale production to meet the anticipated demand for its upgraded products could be a key driver for revenue growth. However, investors should also consider the capital expenditures associated with ramping up production and the implications for cash flow. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, which leaves questions about the investment required and the potential impact on Datasea's financials.Additionally, the entry into the U.S. market through partnerships with channel partners like Meglio Interiors LLC suggests a strategic approach to distribution, which could facilitate market entry and brand recognition. However, the success of these partnerships and discussions with large customers will ultimately hinge on the company's ability to deliver a competitive product that meets market expectations. The long-term financial impact will depend on the market's reception of the products and the efficiency of the production and distribution processes. 03/19/2024 - 10:00 AM BEIJING, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Datasea Inc.

Vale SA and Samarco’s Dutch Subsidiary Named in £3 Billion Dutch Lawsuit Led by Pogust Goodhead for Mariana Dam Failure: Firms Freeze shares in Vale’s Dutch Subsidiary,2024-03-19T13:40:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"Vale SA, the world's second-largest mining company, is facing a £3bn lawsuit in the Netherlands for its role in the Mariana Dam collapse, Brazil's worst environmental disaster.

The claim includes seven Brazilian municipalities, nearly 1,000 businesses, over 77,000 individuals, and is brought by a not-for-profit foundation. The lawsuit targets Vale SA and Samarco Iron Ore Europe BV, Samarco's Dutch subsidiary, with assets ringfenced for potential compensation. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Law Expert The lawsuit against Vale SA in the Netherlands is a significant event with potential implications for the company's financial health and reputation. As an environmental law expert, I see this as a strategic move by the claimants. By initiating legal action in a jurisdiction with potentially more favorable laws for environmental claims, they are leveraging the Dutch legal system's provision for collective redress mechanisms, which can be more plaintiff-friendly.From a legal standpoint, the attachment of Vale's shares in its Dutch subsidiary is a preemptive measure to secure assets that could satisfy a potential judgment. This indicates that the claimants are serious about their pursuit and are taking steps to ensure there is a tangible means of compensation if they prevail. For Vale, this could mean a considerable financial risk, as the claim is substantial at £3 billion. Additionally, the broader impact on the mining industry could be the setting of a precedent for international legal accountability, potentially increasing the legal risks for multinational corporations operating in environmentally sensitive areas. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the lawsuit presents a material risk for Vale and its shareholders. The size of the claim, £3 billion, is not trivial and could affect Vale's balance sheet if the court rules in favor of the claimants. Investors should monitor this situation closely as it develops, considering both the immediate financial implications of any potential settlement or judgment and the longer-term effects on Vale's operational costs.Moreover, the legal action may lead to increased scrutiny of Vale's environmental and safety practices, potentially resulting in stricter regulations, higher compliance costs and changes in investor sentiment. These factors are likely to influence Vale's stock performance and could weigh on the company's market valuation. It's important for investors to assess the adequacy of Vale's legal provisions and insurance coverage in relation to such environmental risks. Corporate Governance Analyst The resignation of an independent director from Vale's board, citing concerns, is another factor that investors should consider. It raises questions about the company's corporate governance practices and its ability to manage crises. Effective corporate governance is critical for investor confidence and any perceived weaknesses could deter investment.The fact that Vale is involved in multiple lawsuits related to the same environmental disaster suggests that there may be systemic issues within the company's approach to environmental risk management. This could have long-term implications for the company's reputation and its relationships with regulators, communities and investors. Stakeholders are increasingly attentive to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and Vale's current challenges could have a lasting impact on its ESG ratings, potentially affecting access to capital and cost of funding. 03/19/2024 - 09:40 AM Lawyers from Pogust Goodhead and Lemstra Van der Korst file claim in the Netherlands against world’s second largest mining company following Brazil’s worst environmental disaster AMSTERDAM & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vale SA (VALE3:SAO), (VALE3:BZ), (VALE:NYSE), (0LBF:LSE), the world’s second-biggest mining company, is facing a new lawsuit for its role in the Mariana Dam collapse, Brazil’s worst environmental disaster. The £3bn action is on behalf of claimants including seven Brazilian municipalities (from the states of Bahia, Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais), nearly 1,000 businesses and associations, and over 77,000 individuals. The case was launched in the Netherlands against Vale SA and Samarco Iron Ore Europe BV, Samarco’s Dutch subsidiary, after lawyers attached the shares that Vale holds in Vale Holdings BV, its Dutch subsidiary. The asset attachment was made as a means of ensuring assets are ringfenced in the event of a successful outcome of the claim. The Mariana dam was operated by Samarco, which is a joint venture between mining giants Vale of Brazil and the Anglo-Australian BHP. The claim by the individuals and businesses affected by the collapse of the dam is brought by the Stichting Ações do Rio Doce, a not-for-profit foundation in the Netherlands. The foundation has instructed leading global law firm Pogust Goodhead as legal advisor, together with Lemstra Van der Korst, a leading litigation firm in the Netherlands. International law firm Pogust Goodhead already represents close to 700,000 victims of the Mariana disaster in a separate claim against mining company BHP in the English courts. The claimants bringing the new action in the Netherlands are not part of the English action. News of the new action in the Netherlands against Vale and Samarco Iron Ore Europe BV comes as Vale faces a crisis in Brazil, after an independent director resigned from the board, citing concerns about corporate governance and alleged “nefarious political influence” around the choice of Vale’s next chief executive. CEO and Global Managing Partner of Pogust Goodhead, Tom Goodhead, said: “More than eight years after the worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history, it is appalling that many victims have still not received adequate redress for the damages caused to them. “The claims being brought in the Netherlands against Vale and Samarco Iron Ore Europe BV for their role in the disaster show that delaying justice and making low value offers in Brazil will not stop the victims from demanding justice. We are glad to be instructed to hold Vale and Samarco’s subsidiary to account for their role in the disaster. ""The time has come for multinational conglomerates to be held accountable for their actions wherever they operate or make their profits. The Dutch subsidiaries played a key part in the global extraction of profits from the Samarco mine, with Samarco Iron Ore Europe BV a significant means of managing, marketing, and distributing Samarco’s iron ore produced from the Mariana dam that collapsed, destroying the lives of so many. “Not only have Vale and Samarco failed to do the right thing by the victims, but they have also exposed their investors to extraordinary levels of risk in relation to the unprecedented compensation bill the company now faces. “For too long, the victims of the Mariana dam disaster have seen Vale and BHP continue to boast about their profits and shareholder dividends while the victims have yet to receive redress for their losses as they continue to live with the devastation the companies caused eight long years ago.” These new claims come after settlement negotiations in Brazil broke down in December 2023 between Mariana dam owners, Samarco, Vale and BHP, and the Federal Government. This breakdown was followed by an order from a Brazilian federal court for Vale and BHP to pay US$9.7bn (47.69bn reais) in damages for the deadly tailings dam disaster. The Mariana dam collapsed in November 2015, unleashing a torrent of toxic mud into the river basin below, destroying whole towns and villages across two Brazilian states before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The disaster is described as the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian history and the effects are still being felt to this day. BHP will face a trial on liability in October 2024 in London’s high court. BHP has recently launched a contribution claim against Vale in those proceedings, seeking contribution from Vale in the event that BHP is held liable. The Municipality of Gonzaga said: “This claim is of the utmost importance because it aims to repair the damages suffered by the municipality, and we believe that the funds sought will be used to develop public policies that the municipality needs, in education, health and the environment."" About Pogust Goodhead Founded by Tom Goodhead and Harris Pogust in 2018, Pogust Goodhead is an international law firm headquartered in London, England. Its growing global partnership consists of over 100 lawyers and more than 500 staff members, all working to help individuals, groups, and businesses access fair and tangible justice. The firm has been described as “the first legal unicorn,” following a trajectory more like a Fintech start up than a traditional law firm. Pogust Goodhead represents 1.9 million clients in cases across the world, seeking billions of dollars in damages. Since its formation, Pogust Goodhead has become a world leader in environmental litigation. In 2022 the firm secured a landmark, unanimous judgment from the Court of Appeal that allows victims of the Mariana dam disaster to seek redress against BHP and now Vale, in the Courts of England and Wales. The firm’s cases against corporate giants TÜV SÜD, Norsk Hydro and Braskem are all centered around providing redress for claimants who have suffered through a total disregard for the environment they inhabit.

JavaOne, the flagship event for the global Java community, will return to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2025. Negative None. Software Development Analyst The release of Java 22 signifies a substantial update that can influence the software development industry. With the introduction of 12 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), there is a clear focus on improving the language's performance, stability and security. Such advancements are likely to enhance developer productivity, which can have a ripple effect on the speed and efficiency of software development across various industries that rely on Java.From a development perspective, the inclusion of features like 'Statements before super[…]' and 'Unnamed Variables & Patterns' simplifies code construction, potentially reducing the learning curve for new developers and decreasing the likelihood of errors in complex applications. The 'String Templates' feature is particularly noteworthy for its potential to increase the security of applications by providing a safer way to handle user-provided values. This is important in an era where cybersecurity is a top concern for businesses.Moreover, the 'Vector API' and 'Region Pinning for G1' are indicative of Oracle's commitment to performance enhancements. The former could be a game-changer for applications requiring high-performance computing, while the latter may reduce garbage collection latency, leading to more responsive applications. These improvements can contribute to a competitive edge for businesses that demand high-performance Java applications. Cloud Computing Analyst Java's increased performance when deployed in the cloud, particularly on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), aligns with the trend of cloud-native development. With Java 22 being supported by OCI, developers can leverage the enhancements without incurring additional costs, which can lead to optimized cost-performance ratios for cloud-deployed applications.The Java Management Service (JMS) is another critical aspect that can impact businesses. The unified console and dashboard for managing Java runtimes and applications can simplify the complexities of managing enterprise applications, particularly in hybrid cloud environments. This streamlining can translate to cost savings and improved operational efficiency for IT organizations.The Oracle Java Universal SE Subscription model, with its pay-as-you-go structure, reflects a shift towards flexible cloud service billing. This is important for businesses looking to manage costs more effectively while still accessing the latest Java features. The ability to upgrade at the pace of their business offers a strategic advantage, allowing companies to adopt new technologies without being locked into rigid contracts or outdated versions. IT Security Analyst The security enhancements in Java 22 are pertinent given the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats. The ability for developers to construct more secure applications natively within the Java language could lead to a reduction in vulnerabilities that are often exploited in cyber-attacks.Security improvements, like those made to string handling, are significant because they address common attack vectors such as injection attacks. By providing developers with tools to better manage user input, the risk of such vulnerabilities can be mitigated. For businesses, this means a potential reduction in the risk of data breaches, which can have severe financial and reputational repercussions.From a broader perspective, the continuous collaboration between Oracle and the Java developer community through OpenJDK and the Java Community Process (JCP) ensures that security is a collective priority. This collaborative approach to security can lead to more robust defenses against threats and a more secure ecosystem for Java-based applications. 03/19/2024 - 09:30 AM New release delivers 12 JDK Enhancement Proposals to improve the Java language and enhance the development platform's performance, stability, and security JavaOne returns to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2025 AUSTIN, Texas, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle today announced the availability of Java 22, the latest version of the world's number one programming language and development platform. Java 22 (Oracle JDK 22) delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security improvements to help developers increase productivity, drive innovation, and accelerate growth across their organizations. These include enhancements to the Java language, its APIs and performance, and the tools included in the Java Development Kit (JDK). ""The new enhancements in Java 22 enable more developers to quickly and easily build and deliver feature-rich, scalable, and secure applications to help organizations across the globe grow their businesses,"" said Georges Saab, senior vice president, Oracle Java Platform and chair, OpenJDK governing board. ""By delivering enhancements that streamline application development and extend Java's reach to make it accessible to developers of all proficiency levels, Java 22 will help drive the creation of a wide range of new applications and services for organizations and developers alike."" The latest JDK provides updates and improvements with 12 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). JDK 22 delivers language improvements from OpenJDK Project Amber (Statements before super[…], Unnamed Variables & Patterns, String Templates, and Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods); enhancements from Project Panama (Foreign Function & Memory API and Vector API); features related to Project Loom (Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values); core libraries and tools capabilities (Class-File API, Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs, and Stream Gatherers); and performance updates (Region Pinning for G1). ""After nearly three decades, Java's ability to support complex development tasks that span a wide range of use cases makes the platform as relevant as it has ever been,"" said Arnal Dayaratna, research vice president, software development, IDC. ""Java's versatility and comprehensive toolset enables it to support the development of production-grade, mission-critical applications at scale, which positions it as a key enabling technology for innovative use cases such as generative AI."" Significant updates delivered in Java 22 are: Project Amber Features JEP 447: Statements before super(…): Gives developers the freedom to express the behavior of constructors. By allowing statements that do not reference the instance being created to appear before an explicit constructor invocation, this feature enables a more natural placement of logic that needs to be factored into auxiliary static methods, auxiliary intermediate constructors, or constructor arguments. It also preserves the existing assurance that constructors run in top-down order during class instantiation, helping ensure that code in a subclass constructor cannot interfere with superclass instantiation. In addition, this feature does not require any changes to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and relies only on the current ability of the JVM to verify and execute code that appears before explicit constructor invocations within constructors.JEP 456: Unnamed Variables & Patterns: Helps improve developer productivity by enhancing the Java language with unnamed variables and patterns, which can be used when variable declarations or nested patterns are required but never used. This reduces opportunities for error, improves the readability of record patterns, and increases the maintainability of all code.JEP 459: String Templates (Second Preview): Simplifies the development of Java programs by making it easy to express strings that include values computed at run time, while also improving the security of programs that compose strings from user-provided values and pass them to other systems. Additionally, the readability of expressions mixed with text is enhanced, and non-string values computed from literal text and embedded expressions can be created without having to transit through an intermediate string representation.JEP 463: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview): Helps accelerate learning by offering a smooth on-ramp to Java programming to enable students to write their first programs without needing to understand language features designed for large programs. With this feature, educators can introduce concepts in a gradual manner and students can write streamlined declarations for single-class programs and seamlessly expand their programs to use more advanced features as their skills grow.Project Loom Features JEP 462: Structured Concurrency (Second Preview): Helps developers streamline error handling and cancellation and enhance observability by introducing an API for structured concurrency. This helps promote a style of concurrent programming that can eliminate common risks arising from cancellation and shutdown – such as thread leaks and cancellation delays – and improves the observability of concurrent code.JEP 464: Scoped Values (Second Preview): Helps increase ease-of-use, comprehensibility, performance, and robustness of developers' projects by enabling the sharing of immutable data within and across threads.Project Panama Features JEP 454: Foreign Function & Memory API: Increases ease-of-use, flexibility, safety, and performance for developers by introducing an API to enable Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking foreign functions such as code outside the Java Virtual Machine, and by safely accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the new API allows Java programs to call native libraries and process native data without requiring the Java Native Interface.JEP 460: Vector API (Seventh Incubator): Enables developers to achieve performance superior to equivalent scalar computations by introducing an API to express vector computations that reliably compile at runtime to vector instructions on supported CPU architectures. Core Libraries & Tools Features JEP 457: Class-File API (Preview): Helps developers improve productivity by providing a standard API for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files.JEP 458: Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs: Enables developers to choose whether and when to configure a build tool by enhancing the Java application launcher to enable it to run a program supplied as multiple files of Java source code.JEP 461: Stream Gatherers (Preview): Helps developers improve productivity by enhancing the Stream API to support custom intermediate operations, which will allow stream pipelines to transform data in ways that are not easily achievable with the existing built-in intermediate operations. By making stream pipelines more flexible and expressive and allowing custom intermediate operations to manipulate streams of infinite size, this feature enables developers to become more efficient in reading, writing, and maintaining Java code.Performance Updates JEP 423: Region Pinning for G1: Helps reduce latency by allowing some garbage collection to happen during some native library calls that would have otherwise needed to pause the collector. This is achieved by tracking which objects need to be blocked during these native library calls and ""pinning"" just the regions that contain these objects. This allows garbage collection to continue normally in unpinned regions, even during what would have otherwise been a blocking native library call.The Java 22 release is the result of continuous collaboration between Oracle and other members of the worldwide Java developer community via OpenJDK and the Java Community Process (JCP). In addition to the new enhancements and features, Java 22 is supported by Java Management Service (JMS) – an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) native service – which offers a unified console and dashboard to help organizations manage Java runtimes and applications on-premises or in any cloud. For more details on the features in Java 22, please read the Java 22 technical blog post. Supporting the Global Java Ecosystem with Innovation in the Cloud Java delivers increased performance, efficiency, innovation, and cost savings when deployed in the cloud on OCI, which is one of the first hyperscale clouds to support Java 22.

""It amazes me to see Java 22 bundle features for all – from students to senior developers, and from adventurous Java enthusiasts to organizations looking for stability with performance,"" said Mala Gupta, Java developer advocate, JetBrains. ""Java is embracing a minimalist approach by continuing to reduce ceremonies around writing initial steps of code, via instance main method and implicit classes, making it easier for folks to get started learning Java. With constructor makeover (statements before super[…]), Java has proven again that it supports responsible innovation, and relaxing language constraints that existed from Java's version 1.0 without breaking any existing code is very exciting. IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 is ready with its support for Java 22 features to enable Java developers to use them with ease."" ""The Helidon team recognized the value of virtual threads as soon as they were announced. With Helidon 4, the team rewrote the Helidon web server to natively use virtual threads, which resulted in much better performance and increased developer productivity,"" said Tom Snyder, vice president of engineering, enterprise cloud native Java, Oracle.

Negative None. 03/19/2024 - 10:30 AM LAS VEGAS, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freddie Mac (OTCQB: FMCC) and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced they’re working together to bring greater loan quality to the mortgage origination process so lenders can effectively serve more borrowers while reducing risk. The collaboration will leverage both companies’ automation technologies and solutions to help lenders quickly and efficiently underwrite mortgage loans starting at the point of sale. “We’re joining forces with ICE to combine our organizations’ unique strengths to help more lenders deliver higher quality mortgages in this challenging market,” said Kevin Kauffman, Freddie Mac Single-Family Senior Vice President of Seller Engagement. “Our collaboration with ICE builds upon Freddie Mac’s commitment to improve loan quality from origination through delivery so we can help reduce defects, lower costs and bring greater efficiency to the mortgage origination process.” The announcement was made during the ICE Experience 2024 conference, an annual event that gathers together thousands of leaders in the real estate and housing finance industries to showcase the latest technologies driving the digital mortgage market forward, from ICE as well as other industry participants. “ICE is on a mission to make the path to homeownership as fast, transparent, accessible, and simple as possible,” said Tim Bowler, President of ICE’s mortgage technology division. “Our innovations are targeting core issues associated with the cost and turn times of mortgage origination. We’re proud to collaborate with Freddie Mac on the critical matter of improving loan quality to streamline the housing finance market and help minimize related repurchases.” Over the last two years, Freddie Mac has announced automated capabilities that allow lenders to use asset and employment data to verify a borrower's assets, income and employment, as well as consider cash flow and rent payment history in the risk assessment. Kauffman added, “As more lenders consider adopting digital tools to mitigate risk and drive improvement in overall loan quality and portfolio performance, this effort signifies the next level of industry collaboration.” Recent analysis shows that loans originated by lenders leveraging certain Freddie Mac automated offerings are up to four times less likely to produce defects than loans without these technology offerings. Process automation is especially beneficial for documenting income, both in the collection and assessment process. That’s vitally important because income verification issues account for nearly one-third of all purchase transaction defects. About Freddie MacFreddie Mac’s mission is to make home possible for families across the nation. We promote liquidity, stability, affordability and equity in the housing market throughout all economic cycles. Since 1970, we have helped tens of millions of families buy, rent or keep their home.

The new Check Point AI Cloud Protect solution aims to prevent threats at network and host levels, safeguarding sensitive AI workloads against cyber attacks. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst The integration of NVIDIA BlueField Data Processing Units (DPUs) into Check Point's AI Cloud Protect solution represents a strategic advancement in the cybersecurity landscape, particularly for businesses relying on cloud-based AI workloads. The deployment of DPUs offloads and accelerates networking, storage and security tasks from the CPU, which can enhance the overall performance and security of cloud data centers.From a cybersecurity standpoint, the shift towards AI-driven security is significant. AI workloads, due to their complexity and critical nature, are attractive targets for cybercriminals. By enhancing threat detection at the network and host levels, Check Point's solution could reduce the potential attack surface for enterprises. This preemptive approach to security is essential for maintaining the integrity of sensitive AI workloads in sectors like healthcare and finance, where data breaches can have severe repercussions.For stakeholders, the implications are twofold. In the short term, businesses can expect improved security and performance, potentially leading to reduced operational costs and minimized downtime. In the long term, as AI becomes more deeply integrated into business processes, robust security measures like those provided by Check Point could become a competitive differentiator, fostering trust among customers and partners. Financial Analyst Check Point's collaboration with NVIDIA could have material implications for its financial performance. The cybersecurity market is rapidly evolving and Check Point's move to integrate cutting-edge technology like NVIDIA's BlueField DPUs may position it well against competitors. The partnership could potentially open up new revenue streams and strengthen Check Point's market position.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Check Point's AI Cloud Protect solution. A high adoption rate could signal market confidence in the product and could be a positive indicator for Check Point's future revenue growth. Conversely, any technical challenges or market resistance could negatively impact financial projections. Additionally, the company's ability to effectively market and sell this new solution will be critical for realizing its financial potential.It is important to note that strategic partnerships and product innovations can affect stock prices. Positive market reception of this collaboration might lead to an uptick in Check Point's stock, reflecting investor optimism about the company's growth trajectory. Cloud Technology Expert The collaboration between Check Point and NVIDIA signifies an important trend in the cloud computing industry: the convergence of cybersecurity and advanced hardware to bolster cloud infrastructure. NVIDIA's BlueField DPUs are designed to handle complex computing tasks efficiently, which is important for the resource-intensive nature of AI applications.By offloading certain tasks to DPUs, businesses can expect not just heightened security, but also improved cloud resource management and potentially lower cloud operational costs due to increased efficiency. This could lead to a more optimized cloud computing environment, which is increasingly important as organizations scale their AI operations.For cloud service providers and enterprises, the integration of advanced security solutions like Check Point's AI Cloud Protect can be a key factor in choosing a cloud platform. It could also set a new standard for cloud security, prompting other providers to enhance their offerings, which would benefit the broader ecosystem. 03/19/2024 - 11:00 AM Check Point’s New AI Cloud Protect Solution Integrates NVIDIA BlueField Data Processing Units to Better Secure AI Cloud Data CentersREDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), a leading AI-powered, cloud-delivered cyber security platform provider, today announced it is collaborating with NVIDIA to enhance the security of AI cloud infrastructure. Integrating NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, which feature a broad range of purpose-built, innovative security capabilities, the new Check Point AI Cloud Protect solution will help prevent threats at both the network and host levels. ""AI provides great benefits across healthcare, education, finance and more. At the same time, the rate and sophistication of cyber attacks is increasing, with threat actors increasingly looking at ways to disrupt AI workloads in the cloud,"" said Gera Dorfman, Vice President of Network Security at Check Point Software Technologies. “We’re working with NVIDIA to deliver a new secure AI cloud solution with Check Point AI Cloud Protect that guards even the most sensitive and private AI workloads against cyber threats.” The rapid proliferation of AI has brought about a revolution in workplace efficiency and innovation. However, this growth also creates additional attack vectors specifically targeting AI, such as backdooring AI models to control a model’s output or to gain unauthorized access to the environment, data exfiltration to expose intellectual property, and denial of service to degrade performance and reduce capacity. These threats compromise the integrity and security of AI systems and pose risks to business outcomes. They can also erode the foundational trust in AI operations, while potentially affecting other aspects of the data center. There is a critical need for a revamped security approach to protect not only the data in its traditional form but the AI models themselves, which are central to innovation and competitive edge. Check Point aims to address these challenges with NVIDIA by integrating network and host-level security insights, offering a comprehensive solution that protects AI infrastructures from both conventional and novel cyber threats. This integrated approach helps ensure the security system is cognizant of network activities and host-level processes, which is crucial for safeguarding AI's future. ""As AI becomes more pervasive, securing AI clouds becomes paramount,” said Yael Shenhav, Vice President of Networking Products at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA BlueField 3 enables innovators such as Check Point to offer robust cyber defense measures to secure AI cloud data centers, while also ensuring peak AI performance."" In response to these emerging challenges, AI Cloud Protect emerges as a strategic solution, addressing the dynamic security requirements of the AI era. Designed for easy deployment and adaptability, it offers out-of-the-box security without impacting AI performance. Designed for effortless integration and scalability, the AI Cloud Protect provides a robust shield against sophisticated cyber threats. Engineered with the NVIDIA BlueField 3 DPU, which powers a new class of AI cloud data centers, and the NVIDIA DOCA software framework, AI Cloud Protect is designed to seamlessly integrate into NVIDIA’s AI ecosystems, providing: Robust Defense Against AI-Specific Threats: Empowers organizations to efficiently shield against model inversion, model theft and other attack vectors with unprecedented efficiency.Scalable, Seamless Integration: Facilitates easy deployment across diverse AI environments, ensuring security measures grow in tandem with organizational needs.Optimized Performance with Zero Compromise: Ensures AI operations continue unhindered, with security processes running discretely, leveraging NVIDIA’s technological infrastructure without impacting AI performance.

ROWE PRICE: INVESTORS WITH A FORMAL FINANCIAL PLAN HAVE DOUBLE THE WEALTH ENTERING RETIREMENT Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary T. Rowe Price's new report highlights the benefits of financial planning for retirement, showing that individuals with a formal financial plan have more wealth entering retirement. The report emphasizes the importance of working with a financial advisor and contributing more towards retirement. Demand for financial planning services is strong among those nearing retirement age, with many citing lack of money as a major obstacle. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The findings from T. Rowe Price highlight a significant correlation between formal financial planning and wealth accumulation for retirement. This underscores the value of financial advisory services, which could lead to increased demand in the sector. Investors in financial advisory firms or services may see this as a positive indicator for future growth. The report’s indication that individuals with a formal financial plan contribute more toward retirement suggests a potential for higher asset inflows into retirement accounts managed by these firms, which could positively affect their revenue streams and profitability.Furthermore, with 38 percent of respondents over 50 citing insufficient funds as a barrier to retirement planning, there is an evident market opportunity for advisory services that cater to this demographic. This could lead to strategic shifts within the industry, as firms may develop targeted offerings to capture this segment, potentially driving competition and innovation in the space. Market Research Analyst The report indicates a growing trend among near-retirees seeking financial planning services, which could influence market dynamics. Companies within the financial advisory space might consider this an opportunity to expand their customer base, particularly among the 50-plus age group. The heightened confidence reported by individuals with a formal plan could also serve as a compelling marketing message to attract new clients.For investors, this trend may signal a shift in consumer behavior, with a preference for personalized financial advice over self-directed retirement planning. This could impact the allocation of investment into fintech companies that provide digital advisory platforms versus traditional financial advisory services. Analyzing the competitive landscape, firms that offer a hybrid model combining technology with human advice might emerge as frontrunners, catering to a clientele that values both convenience and expertise. Behavioral Economist The behavioral implications of the report are noteworthy. The psychological effect of increased confidence among those with a formal financial plan can lead to more disciplined saving behaviors and better financial decision-making. This behavioral shift is important for the retirement planning industry as it can result in more consistent and long-term engagement with financial services. From an economic perspective, this can lead to a more financially secure aging population, potentially reducing the strain on public resources in the long run.Additionally, the fear of not having enough money for retirement, indicated by a significant portion of the survey's respondents, may be a driving force behind the demand for financial planning services. Addressing this fear through education and tailored financial advice could not only improve individual financial outcomes but also have a positive effect on the overall economy by encouraging higher savings rates and investment in retirement funds. 03/19/2024 - 10:35 AM Working with a financial advisor leads to more confidence and better outcomes in retirement BALTIMORE, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published a new report that reveals the importance of financial planning for retirement. The report shows a correlation between individuals with a formal financial plan and having two to four times more wealth when entering retirement compared to those without one. Individuals with a financial plan are also more likely to contribute more toward their retirement and work with a financial advisor. The report also found that the demand for financial planning services is strongest among individuals who are within one to five years of their retirement date, and 38 percent of respondents over the age of 50 indicate that not having enough money was their most significant obstacle to starting retirement planning. ""The retirement industry has historically focused on helping savers climb the hill of contributing toward their future retirement,"" said Bill Meyer, head of Retiree, Inc. at T. Rowe Price.

The uncertainty surrounding future monetary policy changes may create volatility in the mortgage market, potentially deterring investors. supply of homes for sale coupled with elevated interest rates may lead to a slowdown in the housing market growth compared to previous years. 03/19/2024 - 10:30 AM Recent Inflation Data Likely to Keep Mortgage Rates 'Higher for Longer' than Previously Forecast WASHINGTON, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The increase in mortgage rates in February has driven a modest downgrade to expectations for total home sales and mortgage originations in 2024, according to the March 2024 commentary from the Fannie Mae (OTCQB: FNMA) Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group. The ESR Group now expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to end the year at 6.4 percent, up from the 5.9 percent predicted in last month's forecast. Strong headline jobs numbers and hotter-than-expected inflation data had led financial markets to price in a less aggressive rate-cutting path by the Federal Reserve, and while the ESR Group notes that labor market indicators are mixed and disinflation will likely resume, it also believes that recent data are unlikely to provide the Fed with the ""greater confidence"" it needs to begin easing monetary policy in the near term. Still, the ESR Group expects existing home sales will trend upwards in 2024 due in part to increased activity by households likely needing to move due to life events – and who are thus less sensitive to the interest rate lock-in effect. The ESR Group cited the recent trend upward in new home listings, as well as comparative strength in the latest reading of the 'good time to sell' component of the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index®, as evidence that housing market activity is likely to continue its gradual thaw in the months and quarters ahead. ""The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we'd previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy. Still, while we don't expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale, we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023 -- even if mortgage rates remain elevated.""

The ability to streamline training and development directly within an employee's workflow can potentially lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction, which are key metrics for organizational performance.From a market perspective, this partnership could position Workday more competitively within the HCM market by enhancing its value proposition. As businesses increasingly recognize the importance of investing in their frontline workers, who constitute a significant portion of the global workforce, this integration could drive customer acquisition and retention for both Workday and eduMe.Moreover, the use of AI tools for content creation and optimization suggests a trend towards leveraging technology to scale personalized training initiatives. This could signal an increased demand for AI-driven solutions within corporate training programs, influencing market dynamics and potential investment in similar technologies. Human Resources Technology Specialist Integrating eduMe's training platform with Workday's HCM system could be transformative for HR operations, particularly in industries with large frontline workforces. The reported outcomes from Pet Supermarket, such as the high training completion rate and workforce satisfaction score, suggest that the integration is effective in engaging employees, which is a critical component of successful training programs.The use of passwordless entry and automated content delivery based on specific attributes like job title and location reflect an evolving HR technology landscape where ease of use and personalization are paramount.
